But it's so hard to produce them, that despite nearly unlimited funding, only some are being built, and slowly. We don't ""need"" ethereum for a specific dApp in the abstract, we do in practice"

If you credibly promised to replicate that stack on Bitcoin, you'd have investors throwing $100m+ at you, and there'd be immediate usage of the stack."

16,201912,AriDavidPaul,2019-08-05 19:14:46+00:00,0,9,,Very cool integration across networks. A bitcoin lightning transaction triggers a change in an ethereum smart contract. Any other dApps making use of this for anything non-financial?
