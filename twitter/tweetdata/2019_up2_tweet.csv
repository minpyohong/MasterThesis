349,201912,AriDavidPaul,2019-08-01 21:44:31+00:00,0,0,,"By this logic, Bitcoin “pivoted” away from Satoshi’s vision of hobbyist miners and of full nodes being mining nodes. I wouldn’t call any of it a pivot."
350,201912,AriDavidPaul,2019-08-01 21:43:21+00:00,0,0,,"3/ in other words, I can’t speak for why a decision was made in a particular product. I will however debate the effect of that decision on the bitcoin network."
351,201912,AriDavidPaul,2019-08-01 19:54:14+00:00,0,0,,"High fees on L1 are presumably bad because they make bitcoin unusuable for some use cases, or by the poor. Today that’s true. L2 solutions have a lot of challenges."
352,201912,AriDavidPaul,2019-08-01 16:36:44+00:00,1,5,,"If you’re evaluating on innovative tech, all forms of bitcoin are comically obsolete and awful as payment rails. ...bitcoin isn’t competing in tech, but rather on security."
353,201912,AriDavidPaul,2019-07-31 20:58:27+00:00,0,14,,"12/ this is also true in Bitcoin to some degree - my ""trustless"" usage of Bitcoin relies on selected experts who tell me that the client code will work in a certain way. Even identifying and verifying a source for Core client code is a non-trivial ask of someone new to crypto."
354,201912,AriDavidPaul,2019-07-31 20:47:59+00:00,2,15,,"7/ Very similar to the bill of rights (which disempowers voters as a group to protect individuals from a 'tyranny of the majority'), I think Bitcoin's lack of on-chain governance protects individuals' financial sovereignty by taking away their power over the platform itself."
355,201912,AriDavidPaul,2019-07-31 20:46:41+00:00,1,5,,6/ Consider Bitcoin. You could argue that it disempowers individuals; people have less power to change the protocol than they have in the traditional finance system (arguably). But I'd argue it empowers individuals; have to separate power to use a platform vs power to change it.
356,201912,AriDavidPaul,2019-07-31 20:41:06+00:00,0,8,,"4/ This is vaguely similar to the question of trust in Bitcoin. Theoretically we can each validate the client code we run, line by line. But realistically, we know that won't happen. Even for fraction of people capable of doing this, it's a huge undertaking."
357,201912,AriDavidPaul,2019-07-31 17:54:39+00:00,0,0,,"2/ for example, let's say legislators make it illegal to transact on the Bitcoin network in a way that doesn't include AML/KYC reporting. If we fight that by arguing that ""tech is amoral"", it's a non-starter."
358,201912,AriDavidPaul,2019-07-31 17:50:12+00:00,0,1,,"2/ the crypto version of that might be similar to Bitcoin's ""non-governance."" User's have the ability to transact freely on the platform, but not change it. So, they lack power over the platform, but have financial power."
