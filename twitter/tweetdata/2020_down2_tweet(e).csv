1,202022,VitalikButerin,2020-05-10 11:13:54+00:00,113,734,,The ethereum ecosystem (+ crypto more broadly) is definitely at the stage where implementing the existing ideas well matters more than coming up with new and better ideas. This was not the case 3 years ago! Today the role of idea people is to assist the execution process. 
2,202022,VitalikButerin,2020-05-09 19:29:41+00:00,0,6,,"The state being 10x bigger than it is today would greatly degrade the usability of the ethereum blockchain, to the point where it's not worth the 10x gain in tx capacity."
3,202022,VitalikButerin,2020-05-09 15:54:17+00:00,0,5,,"Then what is it? Uncle rate? Ethereum's uncle rate is ~7-10%, only slightly above what it was when blocks were empty, why isn't its gas limit going up more?"

Sure, you technically can buy those big external drives on Amazon, but if you want to run a node on an existing computer or VPS you're stuck with a couple hundred GB or less. And the ethereum state is already ~60 GB. That's *state*, so already pruned"
5,202022,VitalikButerin,2020-05-09 12:55:55+00:00,0,35,,This is the correct question. Many people earnestly pushing scalability through better consensus algos miss the fact that the current bounds on ethereum's scalability do not come from the consensus algo.
6,202022,VitalikButerin,2020-05-09 12:07:58+00:00,115,521,,"The ""purist"" side of the ethereum community, trying to build fully decentralized applications (I sometimes say ""serverless"", though not having any admin backdoors once a project is out of beta is also important), is stronger than many people realize. "
7,202022,VitalikButerin,2020-05-08 17:57:49+00:00,2,18,,Nope! Ethereum was not bad.
8,202022,VitalikButerin,2020-05-08 17:34:47+00:00,2,39,,"There's lots of ethereum things that are quite purist! Uniswap is a great example. Meanwhile (some?) BTC people denigrate Uniswap as being ""just shapeshift with atomic swaps"". (If that's not you it would make me happy to hear it!) "
9,202022,VitalikButerin,2020-05-08 17:09:46+00:00,1,22,,So you're saying that the DAO fork was good for ethereum?
10,202022,VitalikButerin,2020-05-08 16:33:38+00:00,6,107,,You don't think ethereum's defi is an attempt to build a parallel system? Or ENS? Or decentralized exchanges?

12,202022,AriDavidPaul,2020-05-08 23:10:41+00:00,0,0,,2/ the fair (no double standards) comparison here is centralized BTC services to centralized ETH services. Bitcoiners donâ€™t criticize ethereum for being traded on exchange or for being paid to employees through a centralized ETH payroll service.

14,202022,cburniske,2020-05-09 20:23:12+00:00,19,88,#Ethereum,"3/ #Ethereum is orders of magnitude ahead of any of its competitors in terms of people willing to pay for its utility. Speculation may buoy ""Ethereum Killers"" for a while, but for many it will eventually become clear the emperor has no clothes: "
15,202022,cburniske,2020-05-09 20:17:59+00:00,86,279,#Ethereum,"There's been good conversation recently about the amount people *actually pay* to use blockchains, stripping out the inflation subsidy. At @placeholdervc's annual meeting a few months back, we shared this graph to show #Ethereum's lead versus other smart contract platforms: "
