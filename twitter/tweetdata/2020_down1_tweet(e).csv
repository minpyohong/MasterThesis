2,202021,VitalikButerin,2020-03-27 16:19:36+00:00,2,69,,It's an impressive number too though imo some of the centralized stablecoins reflect neither the trust/authority-minimizing decentralization values of ethereum nor traditional values of good centralized governance so I prefer not to emphasize them
3,202021,VitalikButerin,2020-03-27 15:24:47+00:00,3,35,,> I wonder what Ethereum will have in 2023 which we do not have now Bitcoin maximalists complaining that we do not yet have polynomial commitment based witness compression on mainnet.
4,202021,VitalikButerin,2020-03-27 14:28:39+00:00,428,1661,,"Things Ethereum has in 2020 that it did not in 2017: * Uniswap * http://Tornado.cash * Status * MakerDAO * ZK Rollups (eg. Loopring), &gt;2k TPS capacity * PoS testnets * Uncle rates &lt; 10% with 10m gas blocks * Gitcoin grants Move the goalposts faster, or else we'll catch up!"
5,202021,VitalikButerin,2020-03-26 21:10:55+00:00,37,197,,"Gitcoin grants quadratic funding is not just for funds allocation, it's also a great signaling tool! For the last few rounds, going to https://gitcoin.co/grants/?sort_option=-clr_prediction_curve__0__1&amp;category= (sort by top match) has led me to discover a lot of really cool Ethereum projects I previously did not know about."

Look forward to more excellent hard work and results from 1.x devs in the months to come."

8,202021,VitalikButerin,2020-03-24 20:50:30+00:00,72,602,,"We should also be building DEX bridges between ethereum and other crypto ecosystems. I've talked to @zooko about this re Zcash, though I think we can both work harder to translate the talk into action. Would love to see more."
9,202021,VitalikButerin,2020-03-21 22:15:06+00:00,0,8,,I don't think I did any moderation actions during the DAO situation..... and I didn't direct others to do any either.
10,202021,VitalikButerin,2020-03-20 19:55:47+00:00,6,72,,This technique is used in ethereum to scan for logs relevant to a particular application more quickly! Love seeing compsci bleed over into totally-not-computery fields.
11,202021,VitalikButerin,2020-03-18 17:03:40+00:00,0,0,,Ethereum has not adopted trusted setup based crypto at protocol layer.
12,202021,VitalikButerin,2020-03-16 01:36:09+00:00,2,35,,"Ethereum contract code has a lot of duplication, some total, some partial, and the protocol does a terrible job of pricing in the lower load that duplicate code has to clients in the gas schedule. DELEGATECALL improved this somewhat but it's still very far from enough."
13,202021,VitalikButerin,2020-03-15 23:56:50+00:00,3,44,,"You should make a twitter poll. After all, ethereum's official governance mechanism *is* proof of social media. If you make a poll then we are bound by holy law to follow the result."

We discuss his views of the Asian crypto markets, how he sees certain market narratives playing out, whether Ethereum (ETH) is money, and where Alex will be focused on investing in the coming 3-5 years. Enjoy! "
