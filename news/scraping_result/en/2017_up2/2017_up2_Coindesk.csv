My background comes from the world of emerging tech and startups, hence my view and analysis tend to be outside the box.This is a brief overview of some of the work I presented there, including my view of where the crypto asset markets are at in Q4 2017.If you’re new to the market, there’s a lot to learn. Understanding cryptocurrencies is akin to learning about an alien species. Even our markets do not correlate to any other traditional asset class. (I published this “3 cats and a moon” fractal pattern that reliably traded for three years, and it ceased to work after publication).This leads to the first point: the bitcoin market is changing and actively changes frequently.What we’re seeing now appears to be a trend that began in Q4 2017 with the decision by U.S. regulators not to approve a bitcoin ETF. The publicity from the ETF buildup described bitcoin as a legitimate asset instead of the “drug money” rhetoric.My theory is that Wall Street investor interest mounted during this phase and the money that was denied an opportunity to enter via a regulated ETF, came in anyway directly through the exchange markets around March.We saw an uptick in price when it should have dropped lower according to existing models. Additionally, we saw bitcoin’s long-term declining volatility trend break upwards as large volumes of money started trading the swings.Bitcoin’s price chart as of Q4 2017 started carving a new fractal pattern. Fractals reflect the market’s psychological profile. By my reckoning, a new animal had arrived.The price chart was now determined by a hybrid of traditional bitcoin traders and early Wall Street trader money.But new traders are entering a market with a not insignificant history.Attempts have already been made to attempt to value cryptocurrency networks, taking inspiration from other trading tools. NVT Ratio is another invention of mine. This works like bitcoin’s PE Ratio, indicating when BTC price has outstripped fundamental value.Like PE Ratio in equities, fast-growth companies exhibit higher ratios, similarly, bitcoin exhibited higher NVT Ratio values in its early high-growth phase.But, you may be asking, growth to what? The answer is becoming a significant part of the global money supply. In 2017, all the crypto asset markets combined equal half a percent of the world’s M2 money supply, and we are at approximately 1 percent of the world’s population as users. This is an equivalent adoption level as 1996 for the internet.Bitcoin users double every 12 months in our current phase of the adoption S-curve. This was calculated with my work tracking Google Trends data on the assumption that users search BTC/USD price.If this trend continues, we are nine years away from half the world using bitcoin.That might seem like a lot to take in, but it’s supported by data.Here’s another view of bitcoin’s growth on a long-term chart where each altitude climb is a 10x increase. Though bitcoin’s share of the 0.5% seems small, but we are actually 66% of the way on our journey to usurp M1 money.Let me reiterate something that sounds radical – bitcoin is four years out from exceeding the world reserve currency’s M1 supply.If volatility continues it’s on its 9-year downward trend, we should also see bitcoin price stability near fiat FOREX levels. This means grandma can have a USD savings account earning 1 percent per year, or she can have a BTC savings account earning 1 percent per week at similar risk profiles.So let me zoom out a bit and talk about where we are in the 10,000-year view.In 2013, they called bitcoin drug money. In 2017, they called it a bubble. It’s not in a bubble. We’re on the path of digitizing the world. We are seeing the final phase of the Post-Industrial Revolution which started in the 1960s-1990s with the invention of the microprocessor through to the expansion of the internet.Bitcoin is not just money. It’s the invention of an internet-native digital scarcity. And with that breakthrough, software will eat the financial world.Blockchain assets will be bigger than the approximately $70 trillion in money, there’s another $80 trillion in equities, and I’m told well over $200 trillion in real estate. This will all be digitized.“Stealth,” “awareness,” “mania,” and “blow-off” are the stages of the investment cycle.With Bitcoin only the geek money invested in the stealth phase. Smart money was displaced to the “awareness phase.”Normally institutional money arrives during the awareness phase, but due to regulatory bars institutions were not allowed to enter. Hence we are now seeing institutional money arrive late competing with retail money in the early mania phase.It’s my belief this could create a super bull season right now in Q4 2017 and into 2018.But bitcoin’s maturity is also likely to push newer investors toward higher yields, and as expected, we have seen bitcoin itself losing its dominance over the last five years.This is a sign of the markets starting to mature. A fully digital economy should not be 95 percent money. All industries will eventually fill this economy.That last slide was the top 125 outliers, this chart shows essentially the entire market, with the darker colors moving to lighter represent the top 200, 400, 600, etc.Newer coins are outperforming older coins in general. Also buying the entire market tends to be neutral in performance.In this environment, selection and filtering is key. I suggest selecting just as a venture capitalist would. Vet the team, call them up, are they competent? Check their tech, read their source code, is the tech stack useful? How big can the market grow to? What are the token dynamics, is the token designed for high velocity or low?Successful projects will follow what I call the “Falcon 9 launch trajectory.”The goal is to ride the early steep trajectory for two to three years, then roll the investment into new projects capable of climbing steeply. It’s a venture capital model. Returns that bitcoin offered in 2011-2013 are still available today, but today there’s more work involved to find the gems.Disagree? CoinDesk is looking for submissions to its 2017 in Review series.

the Dutch tulip mania. The chart is from a newsletter from my long time ...","Nov 28, 2017 at 08:00 UTC",Michael J. Casey is chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor of blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.,"In this opinion piece, part of a weekly series of columns, Casey suggests that bitcoin’s price might be in a bubble and that curtailing the mania around it would be good for the technology’s future.This is not “normal.”Of course, not being normal is part of bitcoin’s appeal. Bitcoin has redefined money and created the hitherto non-existent concept of a scarce digital asset. It’s hard to hold it to the standards of “normal” assets.But as someone who spent decades watching financial markets go through repeated patterns of exuberance and retrenchment, I’m quite uneasy with bitcoin’s latest runup. A 20% gain over the weekend left it up 60% over two weeks and up an eye-popping 900% year-to-date.Record-breaking gains are irrelevant in isolation. The important question is “compared to what?” And the search for an apples-to-apples comparison is especially tricky for an asset class whose binary set of outcomes might lie in an all-or-nothing range of $0 to $1 million. Cryptocurrencies don’t have any real precedent from which to establish benchmarks. That makes them hard to value.But being hard to value doesn’t get us off the hook. Investors must at least try to assign numbers to the assets they buy. And any rational assessment of something’s value must, by definition, compare it to the value of something else. Value is an inherently relative concept.Here’s a value comparison worth thinking about. Three long weeks ago, when bitcoin was only worth $7,000, Convoy Investments pointed out that, throughout history, the only other price performance for an asset class that exceeded bitcoin’s was the Netherlands’ infamous Tulip Mania of 1619-1622. As most students of finance know, that one didn’t end so well.Bitcoin compared to other bubbles. There is only one which surpasses it: the Dutch tulip mania.The chart is from a newsletter from my long time friends at Convoy investments. If you’d like to subscribe, email them at ir@convoyinvestments.com pic.twitter.com/ZdLSFXcvLn— The Long View (@HayekAndKeynes) November 8, 2017While it’s true that resorting to the Tulip Bubble analogy has been a somewhat hackneyed, knee-jerk tool for many bitcoin critics, I think the instinct among many bitcoin bulls to mock them for resorting to it is often similarly simplistic.William Mallers did it last week in an impassioned rebuttal of financial blogger John Lothian’s criticism of the CME Group’s plan to introduce bitcoin futures. The problem is that such rebuttals often resort to strawman portrayals of the critic as someone who misunderstands bitcoin’s far-reaching societal potential, as an ignoramus who thinks it’s as worthless as a tulip bulb. This misses the point. The problem with the tulip bubble wasn’t that the tulip bulbs were worth nothing, it was that a cycle of mania, speculation and FOMO (fear of missing out) pushed their price far out of line with their realizable value. It’s not unreasonable to argue that a similar phenomenon is pushing bitcoin’s price far beyond what’s justified by its unproven potential, conceivably powerful as that might be.In one of my very first articles on bitcoin four years ago, I too evoked the Tulip Bubble comparison as the BTC price was then topping $1,200. It turned out to be prescient, as the price shortly thereafter fell to around $200 and then took three years to regain the lost ground. But by then I didn’t care. Writing that column led me to explore cryptocurrencies more deeply. I became a convert, wrote a book about bitcoin, and ultimately left The Wall Street Journal to join the Digital Currency Initiative at MIT’s Media Lab.The point is that I’m not alluding to tulips out of Jamie Dimon-like ignorance. I believe, strongly, in cryptocurrency technology, and just as importantly, in its core promise of a superior, more robust and universally acceptable form of money. It’s just that I also think it’s healthy to separate that inherently hard-to-quantify aspect of its fundamental value to humanity from the particular, fleeting, quantitative expression it finds in the market.What worries me most is the cult-like mindset of the investor community, with its “to the moon” rallying cries and simplistic justifications for price performance. The notion, for example, that bitcoin’s in-built scarcity will drive its price higher ad infinitum assumes it operates in some kind of detached vacuum. The ever-present prospect of software forks, while not technically adding to the supply of bitcoin core, points to a wide set of options for investors in the future. If they find those options more appealing – and who’s to say a better idea won’t come along? – it will matter nothing that only 21 million coins will ever be produced. (For a brutal breakdown of other pro-BTC arguments, read this critique by the economist Constantin Gurgdiev, who, like me, is a believer in the underlying power of cryptocurrency technology.) The problem I have with the immaturity of bitcoin’s investing culture is not that it’s setting the market up for a correction. It’s that it constrains progress toward attaining the technology’s more fundamental social value. Speculation is unavoidable, even useful in bootstrapping innovation. But if bitcoin is to change billions of lives, it needs to become a more mainstream asset class, one that’s connected to the real world that those people occupy. As much as we might all love this quirky, abnormal “honeybadger of money,” bitcoin needs to become more normal. It needs more stability. It needs a two-way market.That two-way market is coming. And it will be brought to us by financial professionals, hordes of whom will be showing up at CoinDesk’s inaugural Consensus: Invest conference Tuesday. At the same time that venture capitalists and hedge funds are creating investment vehicles to take positive bets on bitcoin and other crypto assets, investment banks and exchanges are creating facilities that will allow other institutions to bet against it.The bitcoin bulls who’ve welcomed the CME Group’s plans to introduce bitcoin futures contracts before year-end as an easier way for institutional investors to invest in the sector might want to be more careful what they wish for. The quarterly-ROI-obsessed fund managers who will trade these contracts share none of quasi-religious mindset of bitcoin HODLers. And now they have a tool, in the futures contracts themselves, with which to short the market. If it makes sense to do so, they will gladly take actions that drive the price lower. Wall Street is pragmatic, self-interested and obsessed with its short-term bottom line. It doesn’t HODL. To be sure, it’s not clear how much of an immediate impact futures trading will have on the spot market for bitcoin – the CME’s contracts will be cash-settled, which means that neither counterparty to a trade takes physical ownership of the underlying asset. Investors will merely treat the underlying bitcoin market as a reference. But as the futures market gains liquidity, and as cross-market hedging strategies become more sophisticated, the futures price on the CME may well become a driver of spot market prices. With such an imbalance between the sizes of the institutional and retail markets, the tail could start wagging the dog.  Here’s the thing: This rite of passage is welcome. By lowering volatility, two-way institutional engagement will increase the impact that bitcoin can have on the world. It’s an important step in fulfilling bitcoin’s purpose. But it also means the moon might have to wait.Peter Pan image via Shutterstock"

Sources from the public prosecution office indicated that the Kuwaiti law cannot prohibited online trading as it falls under the laws for “e-programs.”“However, the proceeds of bitcoin that are wired from abroad to Kuwait are considered as illegal and unclean money, because the Kuwaiti law does not consider those currencies,” the sources said at the time.Elsewhere in the Middle East, the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates clarified in February this year that bitcoin is not banned in the country.That statement followed the release of a digital payments framework on Jan. 1 from the central bank, stipulating that “all virtual currencies (and any transactions thereof) are prohibited.”The bank said in its update: “These regulations do not cover ‘virtual currency’ which is defined as any type of digital unit used as a medium of exchange, unit account, or a form of stored value.”Kuwait city image via Shutterstock"

the oldest, will launch bitcoin futures trading on Dec. 18th, while ...","Dec 8, 2017 at 05:00 UTC","Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis and corporate finance, and a member of CoinDesk’s product team.","The financial press has been in a flutter over the launch of bitcoin futures trading on not one but two reputable, regulated and liquid exchanges: CME and CBOE.CME Group, the largest derivatives exchange in the world, as well as one of the oldest, will launch bitcoin futures trading on Dec. 18th, while CBOE Global Markets, which owns the Chicago Board Options Exchange (the largest U.S. options exchange) and BATS Global Markets, plans to beat CME to the punch by opening its own trading on Dec. 10th.In theory, this opens the doors to institutional and retail investors who want exposure to bitcoin but for some reason (internal rules, or an aversion to risky and complex exchanges and wallets) can’t trade actual bitcoin.And that expected flood of interest is, from what I hear, part of the reason that bitcoin’s price recently shot past $11,000 (which, considering it started the year at $1,000, is phenomenal).But if that’s true, I’m missing something: I don’t understand why the market thinks there will be a huge demand for bitcoin itself as a result.First, a brief overview on how futures work: Let’s say that I think that the price of XYZ which is currently trading at $50, will go up to $100 in two months.Someone offers me the chance to commit to paying $80 for XYZ in two months’ time. I accept, which means that I’ve just “bought” a futures contract. If I’m right, I’ll be paying $80 for something that’s worth $100. If I’m wrong, and the price is lower, then I’ll be paying more than it’s worth in the market, and I will not be happy.Alternatively, if I think that XYZ is going to go down in price, I can “sell” a futures contract: I commit to delivering an XYZ in two months’ time for a set price, say $80. When the contract is up, I buy an XYZ at the market price, and deliver it to the contract holder in return for the promised amount.If I’m right and the market price is lower than $80, I’ve made a profit.Beyond this basic premise, there are all sorts of hybrid strategies that involve holding the underlying asset and hedging: for instance, I hold XYZ and sell a futures contract (I commit to selling) at a higher price.If the price goes up, I make money on the underlying asset but lose on the futures contract, and if it goes down the situation is reversed. Another common strategy involves simultaneously buying and selling futures contracts to “lock in” a price.Futures contracts currently exist for a vast range of commodities and financial instruments, with different terms and conditions.It’s a complex field that moves a lot of money. The futures market for gold is almost 10x the size (measuring the underlying asset of the contracts) of the physical gold market.How can this be? How can you have more futures contracts for gold than actual gold? Because you don’t have to deliver a bar of gold when the contract matures. Many futures contracts settle on a “cash” basis – instead of physical delivery for the sale, the buyer receives the difference between the futures price (= the agreed-upon price) and the spot (= market) price.If the aforementioned XYZ contract were on a cash settlement basis and the market price was $100 at the end of two months (as I had predicted), instead of an XYZ, I would receive $20 (the difference between the $100 market price and the $80 that I committed to pay).Both the CME and the CBOE futures settle in cash, not in actual bitcoin. Just imagine the legal and logistical hassle if two reputable and regulated exchanges had to set up custodial wallets, with all the security that would entail.So, it’s likely that the bitcoin futures market will end up being even larger than the actual bitcoin market.That’s important. Why? Because institutional investors will like that. Size and liquidity make fund managers feel less stressed than usual.The bitcoin market seems to be excited at all the institutional money that will come pouring into bitcoin as a result of futures trading. That’s the part I don’t understand.It’s true that the possibility of getting exposure to this mysterious asset that is producing outstanding returns on a regulated and liquid exchange will no doubt entice serious money to take a bitcoin punt. Many funds that are by charter prohibited from dealing in “alternative assets” on unregulated exchanges will now be able to participate.And the opportunity to leverage positions (get even more exposure than the money you’re putting in would normally warrant) to magnify the already outrageous returns will almost certainly attract funds that need the extra edge.But here’s the thing: the money will not be pouring into the bitcoin market. It will be buying synthetic derivatives that don’t directly impact bitcoin at all.For every $100 million (or whatever) that SupermegahedgefundX puts into bitcoin futures, no extra money goes into bitcoin itself. These futures do not require ownership of actual bitcoins, not even on contract maturity.Sure, many will argue that more funds will be interested in holding actual bitcoins now that they can hedge those positions.If SupermegahedgefundX can offset any potential losses with futures trading, then maybe it will be more willing to buy bitcoin – although why it would allow its potential gains to be reduced with the same futures trade is beyond me. And, why hold the bitcoin when you can get similar profits with less initial outlay just by trading the synthetic derivatives?That’s the part that most worries me. Why buy bitcoin when you can go long a futures contract? Or a combination of futures contracts that either exaggerates your potential gains or limits your potential loss?In other words, I’m concerned that institutional investors that would have purchased bitcoin for its potential gains will now just head to the futures market. Cleaner, cheaper, safer and more regulated.What worries me even more is the possibility that the institutional funds that have already bought bitcoin (and pushed the price up to current levels) will decide that the official futures market is safer. And they will sell.Now, it’s possible that the demand for bitcoin futures and the general optimism that seems prevalent in the sector will push up futures prices (in other words, there will be more demand for contracts that commit to buying bitcoin at $20,000 in a year’s time than those that commit to buying at $12,000 – I know, but the market is strange).This will most likely influence the actual market price (“Hey, the futures market knows something we don’t, right?”).And the launch of liquid futures exchanges increases the likelihood of a bitcoin ETF being approved by the SEC in the near future. That would bring a lot of money into an already crowded space.But… it’s also possible that the institutional investors that are negative on bitcoin’s prospects (and there’s no shortage of those) may use the futures markets to put money behind their conviction. It’s much easier to sell a futures contract with a lower-than-market price than it is to actually short bitcoin. These investors may well send signals to the actual bitcoin market that sends prices tumbling.And the leverage inherent in futures contracts, especially those that settle for cash, could increase the volatility in a downturn.That’s pretty scary.Let’s not even go into the paradigm shift that this development implies. The growth of a bitcoin futures market positions it even more as a commodity than a currency (in the US, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulates futures markets). And even more as an investment asset than a technology that has the potential to change the plumbing of finance.So, while the market appears to be greeting the launch of not one but two bitcoin futures exchanges in the next two weeks (with two more potentially important ones on the near horizon) with ebullience, we really should be regarding this development as the end of the beginning.And the beginning of a new path.Tree of shadows image via Shutterstock"

Bitcoin’s market cap is today $95.5 billion, over 55 percent of the total market.Taking an overview, it would seem that the market fears caused by China’s ICO ban in early Sept., and the voluntary closures of domestic cryptocurrency exchanges that followed, have now almost completely been shrugged off by the market.Rock climber image via Shutterstock"

https://www.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/closeup- ...","Oct 29, 2017 at 22:26 UTC",The price of bitcoin has set a new all-time high.,"Just over a week after pushing past the $6,000-mark for the first time, the world’s first cryptocurrency rose to a high of $6,306.58 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index at 20:30 UTC today. The previous all-time high of $6,183 was set on October 21st and held for just eight days.In setting the new high, the price of bitcoin is now up more than 500 percent on the year, having climbed from just below $1,000 on January 1st to the new high.However, at press time, it remains unclear just how much appetite there is to extend bitcoin prices above this mark at the moment. Hours after the milestone, prices are down somewhat, trading at an average of $6,166 across a selection of global exchanges.Still, analysts have remarked that the increase comes at a time when bitcoin has never been more visible in the public eye, with business leaders and investment luminaries now discussing bitcoin on an almost daily basis.Among those who have recently weighed in on its value include billionaire investor Warren Buffett, Saudi Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel.Data from Google Trends indicates searches for “bitcoin” and “bitcoin price” are also nearing all-time highs, suggesting this exposure is perhaps translating into new awareness and investment in the protocol, now valued at more than $100 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.“We’re seeing confidence in bitcoin growing steadily,” cryptocurrency derivatives exchange trader Joseph Lee told CoinDesk. “It’s great for adoption.”Plane wing image via Shutterstock"

just ...","Dec 1, 2017 at 02:00 UTC","Preston Byrne is an independent consultant and founder of Tomram LLC and the former chief operating officer of Monax Industries, an enterprise blockchain software vendor.","Recent news stories make it pretty clear that the new people in bitcoin have no idea what they’ve gotten themselves into.Bitcoin is the Gom Jabbar of high finance. Cypherpunks who have populated the space to date hold the line because they do not care about money, and therefore do not fear. These new people are different. The only reason they are here is the money.They reek of fear.When we consider that money from fresh, naive amateurs is flowing into the sector at a rate of millions of people per month, we should also understand that these amateurs are more susceptible to the animal spirits than their stoic, abrasive, less-socially-adept, battle-hardened forebears.They will be prone to cut and run.As such, a shock to the system, such as an exchange being taken down in a necessary and overdue enforcement action, could lead to a loss in confidence in the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole and a stampede for the exits the likes of which bitcoin has not seen to date.In a recent post on my own blog, I pointed out that bitcoin, by setting itself up as a sort of decentralized bank, was also creating an unreasonable expectation to its new “depositors” that they will always be able to redeem their assets at par, given a wild mismatch between its $200 billion “market cap” and new investor money – which is clearly well shy of that number.This expectation is dangerous as it means, in the event of a liquidity crunch, people will behave not as people necessarily behave when there’s a sharp sell-off in a stock, but more along the lines of when their bank’s solvency is being called into question. Remember bank runs?As bitcoin qua decentralized bank is running a fractional reserve with a chronic shortage of dollars, a shock therefore has the potential to not just drive the price of bitcoin down a little bit, but also lead to a major liquidity crunch and abject panic.In my post, I wrote:“In the current environment, there are a number of ways such a shock could arise. To begin with, I seriously question the intermediaries’ and traders’ ability to top up their USD holdings quickly enough to catch up with their depositors’ and counterparties’ paper gains in bitcoin. There is also the possibility that, in the event of a correction or an enforcement action, a risk-averse bank to a major service provider withdraws either credit or banking services to that provider, compromising that service provider’s ability to convert BTC into dollars, provide margin lending, or even to hold fiat deposits at all.”I had a hunch people were lending into the sector. I just didn’t know the degree of alacrity with which this lending was taking place. Fortunately, I was reading CoinDesk this afternoon and the reporting from the Consensus:Invest conference delivered:“Dan Matuszewski, the head of trading at Circle Internet Financial, said during a morning panel that there is a ‘real strong need’ for the ability to borrow in this market.It would not only facilitate short positions but also provide working capital for trading desks to make markets, he said.During his talk, [Max] Boonen of B2C2 acknowledged the irony of the situation given that bitcoin was born as a reaction to the 2008 credit crisis.‘Bitcoin enthusiasts really, really do not like credit,’ he said. But, he added, ‘for better or for worse, credit is an important part of a functioning and liquid financial market…’…Even before the institutional money started flowing in, he noted, ‘by necessity, credit did creep back into bitcoin and crypto markets in general,’ with the major exchanges offering leverage to the early retail investors.”So someone’s lending directly into the market, we just don’t know who, nor how much, nor where the liquidity for these lines of credit is ultimately coming from.Leverage sneaks into the ecosystem in other ways, too; for example, Coinbase accepts credit cards, which is basically margin trading for grandmas, without collateral and with 20%+ rates of annual interest. Given that rather a lot of people seem to be interested in buying bitcoin in this way, and that platform is racking up a few hundred thousand new users a week, there’s undoubtedly systemic risk building up there. Then there’s Bitfinex and Tether, which I do not intend to discuss save to share this passage from The New York Times:“One persistent online critic, going by the screen name Bitfinex’ed, has written several very detailed essays on Medium arguing that Bitfinex appears to be creating Tether coins out of thin air and then using them to buy Bitcoin and push the price up.”Long story short, these neophyte masters of the universe, too young (or too busy working as a dev in California) to know what a financial crisis feels like, and too dilettantish to find out, are successfully (a) getting buyers to leverage to buy coins, in some cases probably up to the hilt, or (b) convincing institutions to lend into this titanic, one-way, unhedged, $300 billion insanity trade, and trying to convince more of them to do so in greater amounts.There are two not necessarily mutually exclusive ways people are responding to the Great Bubble of 2017: anticipatory schadenfreude on the one hand, abject horror on the other.So far the response from mainstream finance has been the former, with The Wall Street Journal’s treatment of the subject being more or less a long-form joke.But while there is something ineffably twee about a retiree trying to show how they’re hip and “down with the kids” thanks to their position in “big coin,” the fact that they are doing so raises very serious questions about bubble-driven risk (and attendant negative externalities to society) which merits closer attention. As of right now, the notional value of the cryptocurrency sector is roughly a third the size of Long-Term Capital Management at its peak.Cryptocurrency is, admittedly, much smaller than the subprime bubble that popped a decade ago, which was roughly two orders of magnitude larger than bitcoin today. But bitcoin has shown, on several occasions, a persistent ability to defy detractors like me to grow an order of magnitude in less than 12 months; if it does so again, it will be three times larger than LTCM. LTCM on its own very nearly ruined the world in 1998.If we aren’t careful, this is the kind of market where a financial institution can get in serious trouble extremely quickly (imagine the damage a character like Nick Leeson or Kweku Adoboli could have done trading Bitcoin contracts – which are coming soon to both the CME and, reportedly, Nasdaq).We know that cryptocurrency marketing is writing checks the technology can’t cash; most of these systems are unusable as backbones for global finance. It is a matter of time before the punter on the street becomes as disillusioned as I, an irascible blockchain software entrepreneur, have become. It’s just that none of the newcomers know what they’re doing, and most of the old-timers who have figured this out are keeping their mouths shut out of self-interest.Put another way, this is a disaster waiting to happen. Fortunately for us, 2008 is not ancient history, and the fact that Bitcoin is a classic, manic bubble is so transparently obvious that it should be impossible for thinking people to deal with it otherwise. There are no excuses for not doing right by the societies and taxpayers who had to bail out the financial services industry last time around.So, banks, shadow banks, and anyone else of systemic importance, I implore you: for the good of everyone, by which I mean for the good of the human species, keep this garbage, and anything connected to it, the hell off of your balance sheets. For once, please have the good sense to not load up on frothy bubble-driven financial assets, which you have done hitherto with such predictable regularity that the European Central Bank can model it and write a 52-page paper on the subject which is actually fun to read.That way, when regulators finally bring this party to the bitter end it so richly deserves, the rest of the ship won’t go down with it.Bank run image via Wikimedia Commons."

An almost equal number of bitcoin cash (BCH) is also to be sold (512.9274588), having a value of close to $949,000.According to the court order:“The BTC and BCH have been transferred to a government wallet. Due to the volatile market for cryptocurrencies, the BTC and BCH risk losing value during the pendency of the forfeiture proceedings … For these reasons, the United States seeks an interlocutory sale.”The order further said that cryptocurrencies will be sold and converted into US dollars using one or more commercial cryptocurrency exchanges in increments of 50 coins or less, in a move to safeguard against loss or fraud. The sale proceeds will be deposited into the Treasury Forfeiture Fund Suspense account.As per the court documents, U.S. district judge Dale Kimball approved the sale of confiscated cryptocurrencies on Dec. 12 after the prosecutors in the case filed a request for the sale on the same day.The case involves a Utah man, Aaron Shamo, who was charged with running a multimillion-dollar opioid drug ring out of a Salt Lake City suburb in Nov. 2016, and was considered among the largest busts of its kind in the country, an Associated Press report says.Shamo and his alleged partner, Drew W. Crandal, were accused of selling fake prescription drugs on a dark web marketplace. The seized bitcoin gains were worth less than $500,000 when Shamo was arrested, another AP report states.Back in 2015, the U.S. government held several auctions of bitcoin obtained through its investigation of the now-defunct dark market Silk Road. In September, the government finally acquired possession of the proceeds from those auctions after a long legal battle with convicted Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht, who had sought to regain possession of the funds.In June, the South Korean government also sought to auction 216 bitcoins confiscated during a 2016 criminal investigation.Utah courthouse image via Shutterstock"

Also, the prices chart analysis says there is merit in being cautiously bullish on the cryptocurrency.The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:Clearly, the bulls are in control and could take prices well above the $20,000 mark.

At the time, the decision to take bitcoin was positioned as a way to serve emerging markets where payment options like credit cards may not be widely available.Now, as of Dec. 6, the company will no longer accept payments in the cryptocurrency due to a mixture of high fees and volatility in the price of bitcoin. Specifically, the company pointed to elevated payment costs in recent months for its customers, who can use the Steam platform to purchase and play a variety of games.The company explained:“For example, transaction fees that are charged to the customer by the bitcoin network have skyrocketed this year, topping out at close to $20 a transaction last week (compared to roughly $0.20 when we initially enabled bitcoin). Unfortunately, Valve has no control over the amount of the fee. These fees result in unreasonably high costs for purchasing games when paying with bitcoin. The high transaction fees cause even greater problems when the value of bitcoin itself drops dramatically.”The post outlined how, in some cases, customers would send funds only to come up short due to the U.S. dollar conversion. When asked to send an additional transaction to cover the difference, that user would then be hit with another fee.As a result, the bitcoin payment option has become “untenable” for Steam, with the company promising to “continue working to resolve any pending issues for customers who are impacted by existing underpayments or transaction fees.”At the same time, Steam suggested that it could move to accept the cryptocurrency in the future.“We may re-evaluate whether bitcoin makes sense for us and for the Steam community at a later date,” the post explained.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in BitPay. "

However, the difference this time around is the context.No idle statement, Ang’s comment comes amid what can only be characterized as one of the biggest migrations of capital yet seen in the nascent asset class. Billions are on the move in the crypto markets, and it’s plainly observable where the funds are headed.After hitting a record high above $800 on Friday, the price of bitcoin cash, the alternative cryptocurrency forked from the bitcoin blockchain in August, has doubled within 24 hours, hitting a high of $1,856 according to figures from data provider CoinMarketCap. At that price, bitcoin cash is now valued at more than $30 billion, passing ethereum for second-place standing in the market.The move follows the sudden decision this week by a group of businesses and mining pools to suspend an effort to change the rules of the bitcoin software. Called Segwit2x, or simply “2x” by some, the effort would have increased bitcoin’s block size – one way by which its transaction capacity can be measured.But while bitcoin’s developers and technologists lauded the suspension, miners and entrepreneurs lamented what they described to CoinDesk as a decision that would inspire others to migrate to blockchains more accommodating to their ideas and ideals. And if it was unclear at the time which alternatives would win favor, bitcoin cash is already proving the primary beneficiary.Early and active in migrating support appears to be bitcoin’s miners.According to data from Fork.lol, at roughly 4:30 UTC on Sunday the total amount of mining power backing the bitcoin cash blockchain surpassed that of the bitcoin blockchain.When asked about the move Jiang Zhuoer, founder of bitcoin mining pool BTC.Top, said simply that “2x fans” are moving both funds and mining hardware to bitcoin cash.“BTC is going to die,” Zhuoer said. Hapio Yang, CEO of mining pool operator ViaBTC, responded similarly, indicating he believes that businesses and investors are now migrating funds to bitcoin cash.“I think more and more bitcoin holders are starting to understand what is the real bitcoin,” he said via WeChat.Indeed, spurred by a sudden change in market outlook, bitcoin cash supporters appeared emboldened in their remarks. No doubt part of the equation is the soaring valuation of the protocol, which after debuting at $4 billion in August, hasn’t exactly solve some of its more pressing open questions.Still, Jake Smith, general manager of cryptocurrency web portal Bitcoin.com, owned by investor and block size increase advocate Roger Ver, doubled down on the idea that the new investment dollars represent more than a speculative migration in the market soon to pass.Smith noted that with the price boost bitcoin cash’s value proposition can only now be strengthened by what he categorized as its ultimate performance increases over the bitcoin blockchain.“I think a positive feedback loop has been created. This is waking people up to the shaky foundations BTC is built on,” he said.Smith went so far as to describe the typical doomsday situation predicted by those supporting larger blocks – that bitcoin’s transaction backlog will continue to grow, its transactions will become more expensive, and that these two factors will decrease user experience and force users to migrate.Other supporters like bitcoin cash developer Juan Garavaglia chalked up the day’s price movements to “better planning” by those using the protocol.“Bitcoin Core is unable to execute, has a poor roadmap [and is] disconnected with market needs,” Garavaglia said. “We can execute, we have smooth coordination with key market actors and we address market needs.”If those boasts sound familiar, so too was the rhetoric from those who were more apt to read the bitcoin cash price movements with more incredulity.Jack Liao, the CEO of Hong Kong-based mining firm LightningASIC, for instance, sought to frame the idea that the bitcoin cash price increase represented any real uptick in interest in the project as “total bullshit.”One of the leaders behind the bitcoin gold cryptocurrency, set to launch tomorrow, Liao has been a noted critic of bitcoin’s mining operators, in particular, Bitmain – one of the industry’s largest sellers of specialized mining chips and the operator of several mining pools.For those following the scaling debate, Bitmain’s conduct has been one of the larger contentious narrative points, and Liao (like others) believes the explosion seen in the bitcoin cash market value is nothing more than an orchestrated bid by the firm (and its supporters) to prop up the market.“Many, many investors just see the change in hash rate,” he said. “But they cannot support such a big bitcoin cash price.”Beijing-based over-the-counter trader Zhao Dong reported a similar sentiment in some circles, crediting the price to manipulation by miners and investors who have supported Segwit2x and bitcoin cash in the past. Bitmain and Ver were both signatories of the agreement that sparked the 2x software.“They have money, they have hash power, they have everything need to pump the bitcoin cash price,” he said.Indeed, one of the more interesting theories at the moment revolves around an unconfirmed PasteBin conversation that seems to foretell yesterday’s market move (though this may say more about current paranoia in the industry at large).Still, that’s not to say the reaction was broken along partisan lines.Willy Woo, recently named one of CoinDesk’s Top 5 Token Analysts of 2017, sees the price move as perhaps one to watch. In contrast to other alternative cryptocurrencies that he said may lack value propositions, he went so far as to color bitcoin cash as a more nuanced option.“It’s backed by a lot of money from China controlling its price and supporting its network. If you buy bitcoin cash, you are betting that China wants it to dominate. That’s a strategic and geopolitical bet,” he told CoinDesk.Bobby Lee, CEO of mining pool and exchange operator BTCC, had a similar reaction. Long a business that supported the Segwit2x proposal to upgrade the blockchain, he reads the price boost in bitcoin cash as an obvious side effect of the decision to block the upgrade.While he acknowledged that it’s yet to be seen whether this weekend’s movements amount to anything more than a quick speculative fervor, he still hinted the situation remains one he’ll be watching and observing.Of particular concern for Lee, and others, is the decline in bitcoin’s total mining power.Lee went so far as to suggest that any continuing decline in this metric could cut into an attribute that has traditionally been one of the cryptocurrency’s defining characteristics.Lee concluded:“If BTC’s hash power continues to fall, then I do think BTC has long-term trouble.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in BTCC.Bitcoin close-up image via Shutterstock"

The goal of the project, according to those involved, was to use the measure to increase bitcoin’s transaction capacity, which is today constrained by the nature of the software’s rules.The suspension was announced today in an email written by Mike Belshe, CEO and co-founder of bitcoin wallet software provider BitGo. One of the leaders of the Segwit2x project, he argued that the scaling proposal is too controversial to move forward.He wrote:“Unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for a clean block size upgrade at this time. Continuing on the current path could divide the community and be a setback to Bitcoin’s growth. This was never the goal of Segwit2x.”“Until then, we are suspending our plans for the upcoming 2MB upgrade,” he added.The note is also signed by companies that originally supported the plan, forged at an in-person meeting in May, including Xapo CEO Wences Casares, Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu, Bloq CEO and co-founder Jeff Garzik, Blockchain CEO and co-founder Peter Smith and Shapeshift CEO and founder Erik Voorhees.The group said that it still hopes the block size will be increased further down the line, once there is more agreement from stakeholders.In statements to the BTC1 Slack group, developer Jeff Garzik said the alternative software would continue to be developed, and that it may support “other chains such as bitcoin cash, litecoin and other bitcoin-family chains.”For more coverage on the hard fork visit our guides here.Cancelled image via Shutterstock"

Twenty-three Bulgarian nationals were arrested during the operation, and officials said at the time that the arrests and subsequent asset seizures followed an investigation into an alleged customs fraud scam.As of press time, the amount seized is worth approximately $3.3 billion, at a price of roughly $15,524, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).Authorities commented at the time:“The offenders choose the bitcoin way of investing/saving the money, because it is rather difficult to be tracked and followed.”They further alleged that those involved developed a virus which was used to hack into Bulgarian Customs computers, allowing the perpetrators to skip paying fees when transporting goods into the country. The virus was uploaded to government machines by bribed agents, according to the release.In all, the alleged perpetrators avoided paying some 10 million leva (Bulgaria’s national currency), worth roughly $6 million.What remains unclear at this time is what the Bulgarian government is doing with the seized bitcoins.According to a report from Bivol.bg from Nov. 28, the Bulgarian government declined to release further details, citing an ongoing criminal investigation.Notable in the May 19 release is a notation that, at the time it was published, a single bitcoin was worth $2,354.

It’s too mortifying to contemplate.But you know what’s even more embarrassing than my failure then to grasp one of the fundamental advantages of bitcoin? Joseph Stiglitz’s failure to grasp it now.Bitcoin “doesn’t serve any socially useful function,” the Nobel Prize-winning economist blithely declared on Bloomberg television last week. Wrong, Joe.Off the top of my head, I can name three socially useful functions of bitcoin: its censorship-resistance; its judgment-resistance; and the topic of this post, its deflationary characteristics, which reward saving for tomorrow rather than splurging today.Stepping back, a longstanding knock on bitcoin’s suitability as a currency was that its fixed, predictable supply and zigzagging but generally increasing value against the dollar encouraged hoarding. But “hoarding” in this context seems little more than a morally loaded term for what our grandparents called “saving.”Used in this way, the word “hoarding” pathologizes thrift, something once considered virtuous. It equates the kind of person who will wait 15 minutes for two marshmallows instead of eating one now with the kind of person who keeps 40 cats in a New York City apartment.In his forthcoming book “The Bitcoin Standard: The Decentralized Alternative to Central Banking,” economist Saifedean Ammous argues that wider adoption of bitcoin would have a salutary influence on people’s behavior.“When the value of money appreciates, people are likely to be far more discerning with their consumption, and to save far more of their income for the future,” writes Ammous, who is an assistant professor of economics at Adnan Kassar School of Business at Lebanese American University in Beirut. “The culture of conspicuous consumption, of shopping as therapy … will not have a place in a society with a money which appreciates in value over time.”Sounds great in theory, you might say, but how do we know it will work in practice? Well, it already is – at least anecdotally.As developer Jimmy Song wrote in a blog post in September:“Most bitcoiners I have met regret most purchases they’ve made with bitcoin because unlike fiat, bitcoin increases in utility and value. People that were once living paycheck-to-paycheck now look at investment horizons of 10–20 years.”That long-term thinking is perhaps most evident in the volunteer army toiling away at bitcoin’s code, as suggested by this telling observation from CoinDesk editor-in-chief Pete Rizzo in his July article unpacking the scaling debate:“I once asked two high-profile developers if they cared if they even lived to see bitcoin become what they envisioned. They seemed to think that this was unlikely, and didn’t seem worse off for the realization.”Think about that. These devs are so future-oriented that they’re OK if the full payoff comes when they’re dead.In this light, it’s ironic that Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffett are among bitcoin’s most prominent doubters, since they co-signed an open letter last year bemoaning Wall Street’s obsession with quarterly metrics at the expense of long-term value creation.If Dimon and Buffett did a little digging, they might see that bitcoin can have the opposite effect on individual behavior.So, while it’s all well and good that the price is up 1,000% this year, getting rich quick is a lame reason to be interested in bitcoin. It’s not about Lambos, and it’s certainly not about YOLO – quite the opposite.To be sure, continued price increases are far from guaranteed.As even the most ardent evangelists have said since the early days, bitcoin is not for anyone’s life savings. With no buyer of last resort, it still could conceivably tank and never recover.That said, bitcoin’s track record as a store of value since its birth nearly nine years ago is looking pretty good at this juncture. Whether that dooms it as a common currency, as even some sympathetic observers say, remains to be seen.But given that the U.S. personal savings rate has plummeted from above 10% for most of the 1960s to around 3% today – with near-rock-bottom interest rates punishing those who save the old-fashioned way – I’d say anything that motivates young people to think about tomorrow (to quote a favorite song of Stiglitz’s former boss) serves a very socially useful function.Marshmallow image via Shutterstock"

Coming at the end of day one of the two-day technical conference Scaling Bitcoin last weekend, the talk amounted to a pep rally largely aimed at classical bitcoin bogeymen – the state, ICO scammers and those who don’t get it.But while he was speaking to just a few hundred of the foremost technical experts on the subject, it’s ironically those in the wider world who Lee might have been better off addressing in his full remarks.“Bitcoin’s value does not come from the endorsement, acceptance or regulation from governments. Bitcoin’s value comes from the inherent failures, limitations and inconveniences of the fiat money system,” Lee said in a tone befitting a grade school science teacher.From there, he proceeded to defend the price of bitcoin – up more than 600 percent on the year – not as a bubble, but as evidence the protocol is proving its utility as the best way to hold value in the digital age.Far from being tepid about the market, Lee argued those who have been on the fence should invest in bitcoin today, telling the crowd:“The last year, bitcoin has proven itself. What I tell my friends now, is as long as bitcoin is under $10,000, it’s your chance to get in. For those of you [who] think it’s too expensive, if you look in the rearview mirror, bitcoin has gone up 10x in the last year.”Lee went on to describe bitcoin as “very cheap,” arguing that prospective buyers shouldn’t look at the current price, but rather conceive of the potential the protocol could have when more of the world’s assets migrate to the blockchain.“Bitcoin is like buying gold at a 98 percent discount. If you think it’s too late, if I had thought that back in 2012, I would not own bitcoin,” Lee continued.Jam-packed with no shortage of attempts to entertain, the speech went on to outline common “mistakes” made by more novice bitcoin traders, including four that Lee cited as the most detrimental. These included: “indecisiveness,” “not buying enough,” “selling after a small gain” and “selling during a panic crash.”“When you first learn about bitcoin you hesitate, the answer is to not be hesitant,” he said.Still, the talk was not without its more serious moments.For example, Lee opened up at length about the difficult situation for his startup, which has pivoted internationally after finding itself on the receiving end of the negative actions that can occur when bitcoin “challenges governments.”This September, the Chinese government moved abruptly to shut down ICOs (the sale of custom cryptocurrencies for fundraising), at the time, allegedly acting behind the scenes to take exchanges offline.In response to the news, the market reacted strongly – dropping below $3,000 after hitting a new all-time high of $4,000 in the weeks before. Lee went on to note that “no one dares talk about” what happened next: the effective doubling of the price.And while no formal ban was made, Lee affirmed his belief that China still “doesn’t want to see bitcoin anymore,” and that to his knowledge, no trading or price information can be displayed to consumers.“No ICOs, no bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, no more. That’s the rule right now. I don’t know where you buy bitcoin in China. It’s like buying guns and pornography in China,” he said.That’s not to say he doesn’t see the market ever coming back, but he’s not optimistic about the timeline.While there was focus on China, the remarks are perhaps best seen as part of a broader point: state actors will and are trying to infringe on bitcoin.Lee made clear he believes the actions in China are simply the first sign of what the bitcoin community has long suspected will occur, that central banks will try to issue “digital crypto versions of their money system.”“Those will be state-controlled, state-supplied. Today bitcoin accounts are freely generated, those will be assigned to you and assigned identity. I don’t think we’ll be close to a decentralized cryptocurrency,” he said.Lee, however, was adamant in his belief that bitcoin – and by extension, its developers or businesses – shouldn’t bend the knee in response.He concluded:“I don’t think bitcoin needs to cater to any culture or nationality of its users. Bitcoin is global, it cuts across all language and cultural barriers.”Bobby Lee image via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk"

advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.","Sep 27, 2017 at 13:00 UTC",Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative. ,"In this opinion piece, one of a weekly series of columns, Casey considers China’s recent moves against bitcoin exchanges and ICOs in a wider geopolitical context.The crypto community is once again reeling from a Chinese crackdown and trying to read the tea leaves on Beijing’s next move.China’s policymaking is far from transparent, so one can only speculate how long the new restrictions on bitcoin exchanges and token sales might last.Still, if we view China’s actions in the context of its broader geopolitical intentions, we can at least gain a useful picture of what’s at stake and the longer-term challenges and opportunities they create for the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry.Consider the following:In short, it’s clear the Chinese government wants to foster international trade under its own terms and end the financial, economic and political hegemony of the U.S.With President Donald Trump embracing “America First” protectionism and a disdain for diplomacy that angers U.S. allies, Beijing sees an opportunity to seize the mantle of global leadership. (Whether it can or not is a question we’ll address later.)Given its investments in this space, it seems clear that Chinese authorities see blockchain technology as a potentially useful, disintermediating tool for advancing its regional interests, especially in trade. Much work is being done, for example, to incorporate smart contacts, tokens and other aspects of blockchain technology into supply-chain management systems that enhance information-sharing and efficiency.This month’s launch of the Hong Kong-based Belt and Road Blockchain Consortium offers an international framework for tying the technology to China’s larger ambitions.High-tech Chinese-backed upgrades to supply-chain logistics will only make those blockchain solutions more viable. One such upgrade, announced at the Xiamen summit, is the BRICS “E-Port network,” which the group described as “an integrated electronic platform to process and monitor cross-border movement of merchandise and transportation vessels at a port level.”More aggressively, China could use this technology to directly go after U.S. interests and the dominance of the dollar. We know that China and Russia are already collaborating on blockchain-based securities settlement.It’s not a stretch to imagine these two powers exploring blockchain solutions – perhaps a combination of smart contracts and multi-signature escrow accounts – that would let their respective importers and exporters settle trade debts with direct cross-currency swaps.This could end the dollar’s role as the intermediating currency when exporters or importers wish to protect themselves from adverse moves in their local currencies. It would cut out Wall Street’s middleman correspondent banks, slash transaction costs and undermine a triangulating system that has given the U.S. great influence on trade.It’s far from the only reason China and Russia are exploring a digital currency, but it’s fair to say that fiat digital currencies would make bilateral swap solutions far more viable.For the U.S., the fallout could be intense.If Chinese and Russian businesses no longer needed to make trade payments in dollars, their governments might not have to hold greenbacks as a reserve currency, either. Meanwhile, if this disintermediated trade solution worked, most other countries would surely follow it.Americans cannot afford to be complacent about the dominance of the dollar and the advantages – lower interest rates, for starters – that has afforded them over the past 70 years.So, does this mean China will ascend to dominant superpower status? Not necessarily.The main reason to bet against such an outcome is that China’s current, closed economic system limits its capacity to innovate. Chinese companies are excellent at copying others’ ideas, but in general, they aren’t great inventors (with the exception of cutting-edge advances in solar technology and payments).Closed, planned economies don’t encourage open innovation; you can’t order creativity into existence through government diktat.This is where China’s moves against ICOs and bitcoin could backfire. Both phenomena are part of an emerging global system of permissionless innovation – an anything-goes, chaotic soup of ideas. In that system, developers can monetize new decentralized applications and profit from collaboration rather than rely on restrictive, litigated intellectual property protection.It’s understandable that China’s central planners are unnerved by this seemingly anarchic world of crowdfunded ideas, one over which they have no control. It’s also why most China-based blockchain research is likely focused on permissioned ledgers over which the government can exert control.Yet, by curtailing the power of unfettered, open-source innovation, China is cutting itself off from the new ideas and dynamic solutions that it needs to stay ahead of the West.The Communist Party’s survival depends, paradoxically, on relentless, continued economic growth on the one hand and control of information, money flows and ideas on the other. But you can’t achieve the former if you’re practicing the latter. Ultimately, China will be powerless to compete against bitcoin and its successors, since they directly enable a decentralized, censorship-resistant system of exchange that levels the playing field and fosters a global, self-perpetuating pool of unbeatable innovation.Given the current policy priorities of the Trump administration, the U.S. won’t likely be the winner in this. But neither will China if it continues on its present course.The age of cryptocurrency will deliver the spoils to countries, businesses and individuals that operate within a system of open access, property rights and free trade – the principles upon which U.S. hegemony was originally built.“One Belt, One Road” image by Shutterstock"

– $41 total40% of the total transaction in fees.unbelievable— Kristian Freeman (@imkmf) December 8, 2017Ready to send your first bitcoin? That will be $26 please…Sure, that’s on the high end of what you might pay to use the bitcoin blockchain today, but if you’re new to the world of cryptocurrencies (and haven’t invested that much), we understand seeing such a sky-high sum might be a shock. (Sorry, Kristian!)Despite what you might have heard about the “money of the future,” the fact is bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) are both expensive – and experimental – today.But while this might not be what you’re used to (or even what you signed up for when purchasing), looking at the reasons behind blockchain costs can help you understand the technology, its weaknesses and where the ecosystem needs more dedicated minds to improve.To start, you’re probably thinking this money is all going somewhere. And it is, just not a single place.When you send a cryptocurrency transaction, you’re paying for it to be included on the protocol’s blockchain, which you can think of as something an official record of every token on the network ever spent (whether it’s bitcoin, ether or something more exotic). Rather than holding this at a bank or a credit card firm, this ledger is distributed.This means that should any one computer (or group of computers) go down, the network still has a copy showing that you own your asset. The bad news is you have to pay all those computers to process it.Here, we’ll introduce you to the first new person on our journey, the miner (or validator, depending on your network).You don’t necessarily know who he or she is, or which one is verifying your transaction – but they are doing work, so to speak, dedicating computing power, putting aside coins or doing some other cost-prohibitive function to help the network to determine which transactions to include in which block of the chain.For this, they’re rewarded with newly “minted” cryptocurrency.If that’s confusing, you can think of it like this.See, every cryptocurrency transaction is made up of a small amount of data, and most blockchains, have limited space for that data as a reference for all those transactions.In this way, transaction fees represent how interested you are in getting your transaction through, right at that moment, and stored on the network permanently. As you can guess, the bigger the transaction fee – which the miners (or validators) get to collect – the higher your chances are of getting your transaction into the next block that’s processed by miners.While data limits and how they change vary from blockchain to blockchain (bitcoin has a hardcoded limit of 1 MB per block), in general developers and engineers caution against raising the limit too much, as it can lead to various technical problems.Up until fairly recently, most crypto users didn’t really notice these data limits, since the networks weren’t brushing up against them. But as a new round of crypto investors and enthusiasts hit the market, pushing demand generally up, these data limits are being tested and the associated fees are going up (see chart below).While it might not seem like it, increasing fees are actually a sign that bitcoin, ether and other cryptocurrencies are growing in popularity and use. But on the other hand, as it’s a fairly recent development, your wallet might not be equipped to make it easy for you.Ultimately, many wallets (the software that provides the interface with your cryptocurrency) make you decide, giving you the power to determine how much to pay.Still, transactions without a fee or with too low of a fee during peak usage just sit in limbo.They’re not outright rejected, but it could take hours, even days, for the network to cool and miners to add the transaction to a block. Plus, as mentioned above, the higher the fee, the more likely it is for your transaction to get picked up by miners.Deciding what fee is serviceable, though, is tricky.To help users determine what fee is right, various sites offer calculators, and even some developers have stepped in to try and make that calculation less of a headache.The other option, and arguably the boldest move, is moving into cryptocurrencies that are less-used today.Yet, the infrastructure around these options may still be limited (bitcoin cash, for example, has fewer merchants than bitcoin), and as such, you should be aware that not only might you have trouble transacting, but development may be ongoing to fix vulnerabilities.Longer-term, blockchain engineers on many of the largest blockchains are working on a range of “off-chain” solutions that could help the technology scale to more users, all while slashing the cost of using the network, and your transaction fees.While it’s unclear when these solutions will be ready to deploy on the blockchain for the public’s use, with scaling taking center stage during most technical discussions, many think relief might not take long.Want to learn more?

The survey focused on a number of areas, including a basic question about whether they’ve heard of bitcoin at all. As it turns out, roughly 78% of respondents said they had.Among the notable findings in the LendEDU survey is that, according to the data, younger consumers – those between the ages of 18 and 34, showed more willingness to invest in bitcoin than older age groups.Of those between the ages of 18 and 24, 35.9% said they plan on investing in bitcoin, versus 43.5% who said no and 20.5% who weren’t sure. For the 25-34 age group, the “yes” figure grew to 40.4%, with 31.7% of respondents in that demographic saying no.By comparison, just over 10% of those between the ages of 45 and 54 indicated an interest in investing in bitcoin. Less than 5% of those over the age of 55 expressed the same sentiment, the survey data shows.In a blog post detailing the results, LendEDU predicted that this data foreshadows a greater role for bitcoin among younger consumers.“Judging from this data, as the years go by and younger Americans develop more spending power, you can expect bitcoin to become more and more prevalent in the American economy,” the company said.Image via Shutterstock"

While Buffett focused on a range of topics, he honed in on the cryptocurrency market during his remarks.“People get excited from big price movements, and Wall Street accommodates,” he was quoted as saying. Describing bitcoin as a “real bubble,” according to the publication, Buffett also criticized the idea of applying a value to bitcoin.He told attendees:“You can’t value bitcoin because it’s not a value-producing asset.”Buffett’s comments came amidst a significant month for bitcoin’s price, according to CoinDesk data. After fluctuating around $4,300 at the beginning of October, the price surged to more than $6,100 less than a week ago.That Buffett would take a harsh stance toward bitcoin is perhaps unsurprising, given that, in 2014, he advocated that investors stay away from bitcoin entirely.“It’s a mirage basically,” he was quoted as saying at the time.Nor is Buffett the only market observer to issue remarks around the market’s recent developments. Earlier this week, Saudi Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal said that he expects bitcoin to fail.Others, however, have adopted a different approach.

These companies have considerable revenue and customer growth and would love to expand as soon as possible, but the main constraint is that they can’t find enough qualified people to develop. Many who had local-only policies have relaxed those requirements and now allow full-time remote bitcoin developers. One prominent company president regards finding a local blockchain expert akin to finding a unicorn these days.Another contributing factor is the price rise. While the appreciation has been good for everyone who held on during the bear market, it’s bad for a lot of bitcoin companies as they find that many developers simply don’t need to work due to the gains on their bitcoin holdings. Many developers would rather start their own companies, contribute to open-source projects or focus on investing instead of working for someone else. In a way, bitcoin companies are victims of their own success.The talent deficit in the ecosystem is getting so severe that many companies are offering enormous bonuses to find developers and still can’t fill the positions. Most would love to hire 15 to 20 developers if possible, but they simply don’t get enough qualified people.Another contributing factor is the higher level of rigor required to program blockchain applications. Messing up a website may take a site down for a few minutes, but messing up a bitcoin transaction may lead to loss of money, which requires a lot more rigor. The thoroughness required from developers is rare.The industry is not sitting still. There are a variety of initiatives to fill this developer deficit. Chief among them is Dev++, which is led by the Bitcoin Edge Initiative, a nonprofit initiative focused on addressing this gap. This year at Scaling Bitcoin, in addition to a well-respected conference, Dev++ will train up to 100 developers to become more familiar with blockchain concepts. Bitcoin Edge hopes to heavily subsidize this in-person 2-day training with sponsorships from many of the very bitcoin companies that feel the developer deficit most acutely.Devs: Learn and become a part of this exploding industry.

Meanwhile, ether (ETC), bitcoin cash (BCH) and litecoin (LTC) have dropped 6 percent, 8 percent, and 10 percent, respectively.While tables appear to have turned in favor of bitcoin again, the charts suggest relief could be transient.The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:The above chart (prices as per Bittrex) shows:As the charts show, a recovery in ETH/BTC, LTC/BTC, BCH/BTC and XRP/BTC from intraday lows is already weighing over bitcoin.As per CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), bitcoin is now trading at $17,760, down from the record highs above $18,000 hit earlier today.The bullish outlook for ETH/BTC, LTC/BTC, BCH/BTC and XRP/BTC indicates the rotation of money out of BTC and into alternative currencies is likely to continue in the next week.It also means bitcoin could have a tough time staging a sustained rally to $20,000.

Given that bitcoin cash produced an ultimately smaller bitcoin network, not to mention a cryptocurrency that’s worth about 12 percent as much as bitcoin at press time, most seem to view the plan as another distraction in an already divided community.For one, bitcoin gold looks like it could be even smaller than bitcoin cash, at least in that not as many miners seem to support it.In remarks, BTC.Top founder Jiang Zhuoer and ViaBTC CEO Haipo Yang – two early champions of bitcoin cash – went so far as to downplay bitcoin gold as insignificant.But while those in the know might be skeptical of bitcoin gold, it does have a goal that many in the community may find attractive: creating a truly decentralized bitcoin.Most notably, the developers behind the network hope to open up mining to more participants by replacing bitcoin’s mining algorithm with one that will enable it to be mined with graphics cards. The idea is to make big miners – sometimes controversial figures on the network – less relevant.“Bitcoin gold will implement a proof-of-work change from bitcoin’s SHA256 to Equihash, a memory-hard algorithm that is ASIC-resistant and optimized for GPU mining,” explained pseudonymous bitcoin gold developer “The Sorrow.”That the plan is being hatched in China, long the hotbed of bitcoin mining, only adds another layer to the story. Liao, whose mining hardware largely focuses on the litecoin network, is seen as one of the few voices domestically that can challenge the established order.Yet, Liao was quick to name one mining firm in particular, Bitmain, as the reason that more bitcoin users should support the idea. A mining company that has been at the center of bitcoin drama over the last year, critics have long argued that the firm has too much of an influence over the network.Still, creating a network that grows so popular as to remove miners is easier said than done, and some are skeptical that this would lead to the end goal that bitcoin gold advocates desire.“GPU mining can’t prevent centralization. GPU [markets] are controlled by Nvidia and AMD,” Zhao Dong, a cryptocurrency trader and investor, argued in response to the plan.Liao, however, argued the accessibility of the companies’ products means the distribution of hashing power might evolve differently.Again, though, even project leaders admit many of the details around the hard fork are fuzzy.Bitcoin gold’s pseudonymous lead developer “h4x” said that the project is “still evolving” and details such as exact block height of the hard fork are still up for discussion.According to the original website text, bitcoin gold was even planning an initial coin offering (ICO) by which 1 percent of the bitcoin gold coins would go to the developer team, but these details have since been removed.One thing is clear though about the funding: because of the nature of the split, every bitcoin user at the time will have an equal amount of bitcoin gold associated with their private key.“It is a minimalist fork of the Bitcoin Core codebase in the spirit of litecoin – only a few conservative modifications,” said h4x.H4x went on to describe bitcoin gold in more abstract biological terms, arguing that it tests how well hard forks work and if they benefit the ecosystem.He said:“Organisms derive benefits from creating offspring. With bitcoin gold we are conducting an experiment to see if that principle holds true in the world of blockchains.”And this sentiment is largely in line with developers who have predicted that more bitcoin forks similar to bitcoin cash will come forth in the future.After bitcoin cash forked earlier this summer, for example, Lightning Network developer Tadge Dryja argued that more forks would spring up, but for another reason: money.With bitcoin gold in the works and another hard fork slated for November, it seems that prediction is slowly becoming reality.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock"

Msgr. Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, who is also the bishop of Argentina and chancellor of PASS.Following chancellor Sorondo’s blessing at Casina Pio IV in Vatican City, Mari is scheduled to present the most recent results of Project Protect, founded two years ago to teach AML officers how to identify patterns in their own transactions that might be evidence of human trafficking.Specifically, Mari plans to frame early results of Project Protect that identified an increase in the use of cryptocurrencies by slave traders in Canada and other regions in light of the broader concerns being addressed at the event.Having early on identified an increased use of cryptocurrency by slave traders , the project — which Mari calls a “zero-cost initiative” designed to bring new efficiencies to existing AML procedures — has worked with blockchain data startup Chainalysis and other financial institutions to create new methods to identify patterns in cryptocurrency transactions that might indicate a slave has been purchased, or is being advertised.By focusing on that work, projects elsewhere that use blockchain to bring new levels of transparency to the shipping of goods and to provide individuals at risk of becoming slaves a self-sovereign means to identify themselves, Mari aims to present to the church leaders a nuanced depiction of the technology’s role in human trafficking.“For everyone in the room at that time in the Vatican, I’m just really stressing from an AML standpoint that this is something that has been going on for the better part of ten years,” he said. “And its uses are diversifying across the board, in terms of both positive and negative.”Expanding on Mari’s mission to jumpstart the education process of the church leaders was event co-organizer and founder of the Global Alliance for Legal Aid (GALA), Jami Hubbard Solli, who added to the objectives her hope to win the support of the Vatican in recruiting banks in the fight against human trafficking.Originally conceived as a separate event hosted by GALA to draw attention to the slave trade between Nigeria and Italy, Solli first contacted the Vatican through the president of the Pontifical Academy, Margaret Archer, whom she invited to participate as a speaker.Instead, Solli said she was invited by Archer, to co-organize today’s joint event, formally called “Assisting Victims of Human Trafficking: Best Practices in Legal Aid, Compensation and Resettlement.”Through a diverse set of public-private partnerships scheduled to be discussed at the event, Solli believes existing anti-money laundering measures can be upgraded to more adequately account for the rapidly growing impact of cryptocurrencies on human trafficking.“We really need partnerships between banks and prosecutors,” she said. “As well as between financial institutions and civil society.”As a result of Mari’s address on blockchain and other addresses at the gathering, further Vatican recommendations are expected to be forthcoming, according to Solli.Mari described the potential impact of the event could have on jumpstarting the fight against slavery transacted in cryptocurrency:“The quicker that we can start coming to terms with the fact that this is something that is most likely going to be here for the foreseeable future, the quicker we can start getting towards mitigating the risk.”Vatican image via Shutterstock"

That said, both exchanges are halting yuan deposits starting today.According to Huobi and OKCoin, definitive information about the trading suspension will be circulated to users before September 30. More significantly, the exchanges will undertake a “gradual” process of unwinding its yuan-denominated markets, with an eye to complete that process by October 31.The news comes after fellow China-based exchanges BTCC, ViaBTC and Yunbi all announced that they would shut their doors, citing statements from domestic regulators earlier this month. In the wake of BTCC’s closure yesterday, both Huobi and OKCoin said that they had not received any notices or instructions to close.Yet this morning, leaked documents indicated that verbal directives had been given to some exchanges regarding their closure. Notably among those instructions was the stipulation that user data be preserved and provided to the government. Cryptocurrency prices, in turn, saw continued turmoil in the wake of those developments.The move to halt yuan-to-crypto trading represents a new phase in the ongoing saga around cryptocurrency regulation in China.Earlier this month, China put a freeze on its domestic initial coin offering (ICO) space, declaring it an illegal form of fundraising. Exchanges and other websites providing ICO-related services subsequently moved to accommodate the new rules amidst the fallout, with investors in previously held ICOs set to be refunded their money.That move came months after regulators in China moved to impose new anti-money laundering restrictions on the country’s exchanges. In early 2017, the People’s Bank of China made waves when it was revealed that officials had met with the leaders of the country’s major bitcoin exchanges, followed by meetings with other representatives of the ecosystem and a months-long withdrawal freeze amid the upgrades.Dragon silhouette image via Shutterstock"

He further informed the parliament that the country does not have any regulations governing virtual currencies.Back in April, the Indian government moved closer to developing cryptocurrency regulations, setting up an interdisciplinary committee including the Reserve Bank, the Ministry of Revenue, the Department of Financial Services, and others.However, just last month, the Indian Supreme Court pushed the government to respond to calls to regulate bitcoin.Concerned over bitcoin’s anonymity and its potential illicit uses, justices issued a notice to the central bank and other agencies asking them to answer a petition on the matter, reports indicated.Arun Jaitley image via Pranshu Rathi/Flickr"

Mansy conducted $2.4 million-worth of bitcoin transactions over a two-year period, according to a  release from the U.S. Attorneys office in Maine.Mansy pleaded guilty in May to purchasing bitcoin through the Coinbase and Bitstamp exchanges, and selling the cryptocurrency at a profit through LocalBitcoins, as CoinDesk previously reported.According to the release:“It is against federal law for a money-service business to exchange or transfer bitcoin without registering. Mansy was aware that he was required to register with FinCEN.”Following his jail time for the offence, Mansy will receive three years of supervised release. He must further forfeit $118,000 in cash and bitcoin gained through the illegal scheme. Investigators confiscated roughly that amount during his arrest in 2015.Undercover investigators conducted two trades with Mansy for amounts totaling 6.32 BTC – an amount valued at $1,900 at the time and now worth nearly $75,000, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.The case is just one of a number arrests in recent years for running illegal businesses using bitcoin.In October, another Michigan resident, Bradley Stetkiw, was charged with running an unlicensed money transmitting business after selling some $150,000 in bitcoin.Stetkiw also used LocalBitcoins to facilitate his transactions, and federal agents bought $56,000 worth of bitcoin from him at the time.A third LocalBitcoins user in Missouri, Jason Klein, pleaded guilty to running an unlicensed money transmission business in May, after he sold 98 bitcoins (worth more than $1 million today) to undercover agents in 2015 and 2016.Jail bars image via Shutterstock"

As of block 491,407 on the bitcoin blockchain, another alternative ...","Oct 23, 2017 at 22:20 UTC",Anyone who owns bitcoin will soon be able to receive a new cryptocurrency.,"As of block 491,407 on the bitcoin blockchain, another alternative version of the protocol will be launched, resulting in a variant that’s being branded bitcoin gold (BTG).The project, which seeks to improve bitcoin’s technology by changing how its competition for rewards is conducted, is the second to launch since August via an increasingly common process called a “hard fork.”Readers may remember the term from the launch of bitcoin cash, the alternative version of the bitcoin protocol that spurred global headlines for unexpectedly creating billions of dollars in value, seemingly out of thin air.Looking ahead, many industry observers are expecting the same results this time around, though there may be reasons for enthusiasm to be tempered.In short, bitcoin gold aims to achieve two goals:Instead of scaling bitcoin to support more users, bitcoin gold tweaks bitcoin in an effort to “make bitcoin decentralized again.” This, proponents argue, will make the network, designed to offer an egalitarian way to send payments digitally around the globe, more accessible to users.And while created via the same mechanism, bitcoin gold differs from bitcoin cash in a few ways, most notably in its distribution.Differences include:Of course, while it aims to become the de-facto version of bitcoin, others might consider bitcoin gold an “altcoin” – the term has long been used to denote any cryptocurrency launched using bitcoin’s existing code, but that has an alternative market or use case.All bitcoin owners will receive the cryptocurrency at a rate of 1 BTC to 1 BTG, setting the stage for possible market activity.But, that’s not to say it’s totally intuitive to retrieve.One quirk is that it’ll be easier to redeem the funds from wallets or exchanges that recognize the cryptocurrency. The easiest way, then, to retrieve the bitcoin gold is to move bitcoin to a wallet or exchange that supports bitcoin gold, or to hold bitcoin in a wallet where you own your private keys (rather than holding them with an exchange).To date, 20 exchanges and wallets promise to support bitcoin gold once it launches, according to the project’s website.Although one of the most popular U.S.-based exchanges, Coinbase stated on October 20 that it does not support bitcoin gold due to skepticism about how developers have made project information available to others.“At this time, Coinbase cannot support bitcoin gold because its developers have not made the code available to the public for review. This is a major security risk,” the post reads.This is perhaps something to keep an eye on as the project progresses. Although the project will officially fork on Monday night, it’s not yet open to anyone and everyone, and there’s still plenty left on the developers’ to-do list.The team behind the hard fork appears to be a relatively small group.Hong Kong-based LightningAsic CEO Jack Liao, who’s an outspoken critic of the state of bitcoin mining, first broached the idea of bitcoin gold back in July.His company LightningAsic sells mining equipment, including GPUs, the type of computing hardware bitcoin gold is supposed to rely on.Since first introduced earlier this summer, the team has expanded to include pseudonymous lead developer h4x3rotab, as well as a team of five other volunteers who are now working on developing and promoting the cryptocurrency in their spare time.The project can be tracked on Github and on the community Slack group.All that said, for those interested in exploring or using bitcoin gold, it’s worth noting that it has generated its share of controversy.Satoshi Labs CEO Marek Palatinus, who launched bitcoin’s first ever mining pool, is skeptical the project will actually work to decentralize mining as planned.And he’s not the only one to throw shade at the new project.Bitcoin developer Rhett Creighton is working on alternative bitcoin gold “protest fork” software that seeks to pursue the same idea but without setting aside some of the new cryptocurrency for development.If more than 51% of miners choose to use his software, the so-called pre-distribution to developers will be erased, he told CoinDesk. “It’s up to the miners to decide what they want,” he added.All in all, it’s unclear if business and mining groups will ultimately support the project, and if they do, how much value the alternative blockchain could create.For example, while a list of roughly 50 businesses and miners support the so-called Segwit2x fork, similar support hasn’t been seen for bitcoin gold. Likewise, though bitcoin cash began with support from vocal miners and exchanges, bitcoin gold has arguably yet to benefit from such early activity.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which helped organize the Segwit2x agreement.Bitcoin gold image via Shutterstock"

Beginning. Oct 10, 2017 at 10:00 UTC Updated Oct 11, 2017 at 09:34 UTC.","Oct 10, 2017 at 10:00 UTC","Of the many people to make the jump from Wall Street to cryptocurrency, few if any were as successful in their careers as Daniel Masters.","After working at legendary investment bank Salomon Brothers as an energy and derivatives trader, Masters took on an even bigger job, running global commodities trading at JPMorgan Chase. He then made a transition most people in the financial markets only dream of – moving from the sell side in banking to the buy side in hedge funds.Masters opened his first hedge fund in 1999, but in the mid-2010s – as commodities and other traditional asset prices became less volatile and in turn less profitable – he discovered and ultimately became engrossed in the rollercoaster world of cryptocurrency.Yet wild price swings weren’t the only aspect of the market that interested the former trader. In a new interview, Masters told CoinDesk he was also captivated by the promise of borderless, frictionless, digital money.From there, Masters began developing a strong intuition that bitcoin could, potentially, challenge fiat money and gold, and that it might play an important role in capital formation, the money-raising function that has traditionally been accomplished by stocks and bonds.Masters said:“I think, at the core of this, is the development of new tools that are challenging the role that fiat money and gold have historically played. And that challenge is being brought forth by bitcoin.”And while he still keeps an ear to the ground about his old shop – especially when JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon opines about cryptocurrency – those disruptive functions have become the foundation on which Masters bases his bullish investment thesis for Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund, GABI for short.While the legacy financial system sits on its haunches, failing to adapt to the opportunities cryptocurrencies present, as Masters sees it, the technology now exists to digitize and tokenize large swaths of traditional asset classes – such as money, precious metals, commodities, stocks and bonds.Moreover, once those assets have been tokenized on a blockchain, they will be able to perform far more intelligent functions, because the assets themselves will be programmable, just like any other instance of computer code.There are serious benefits, something that he points to for the rise of the cryptocurrency market, which is currently valued at over $150 billion.In his mind, cryptocurrency has found a way to reach that scale in almost total isolation from the legacy financial system. Now becoming self-sustaining and reaching a kind of “escape velocity,” cryptocurrency is finally gaining enough momentum to challenge the old ways of doing business in financial services, he said.Still, institutions and investors are hesitant, seeing the market’s intense volatility as a sign for concern.But that doesn’t phase Masters. He believes the price of commodities is “notoriously fractal,” meaning that prices swing wildly in both directions, adding the big picture takeaway:“Don’t get hung up on price.”To highlight his theory, Masters cited his work trading natural gas in the late ’90s.At the time, there was a five-year period during which the commodity was trading between $0.50 and $0.85, making it difficult for many people to foresee natural gas trading above $15, as it later did. He also pointed to his years trading in the oil market, when the price of a barrel of oil hovered between $5 and $20, figures that made the $145 it traded at in 2008 seem exaggerated.In a similar fashion, if you were obsessing about the price of ethereum’s ether token when it hit $1, you would never have bought it at $20 – and, as Masters said, “Look where it is now.” Notably, ether is currently trading at just below $300, according to CoinMarketCapMasters sees the relatively low valuation of cryptocurrencies when compared to other asset classes as a major opportunity.When you look at all digital assets currently trading, the combined market capitalization isn’t as high as a single one of world’s 100 largest stocks, a statistic Masters believes means there’s room for growth. Further, as bitcoin is only the 65th largest currency in the world, and some of the larger currencies are highly problematic for political and economic reasons, he believes it’s not unthinkable to believe the cryptocurrency could provide a real alternative.One of the key drivers of Masters’ thesis is that an investment in cryptocurrency is a fundamental investment in the forward movement of technology.In essence, he believes, an investment in cryptocurrency is tantamount to an investment in fintech, medtech and the Internet of Things. In this way, the view provides an elegant counterargument to the cryptocurrency skeptics who believe blockchain technology may change the world, but that cryptocurrencies are a passing fad.To Masters, cryptocurrencies will be the true market force.He said:“The vital thing to understand is that the momentum and the scale that you have in some of these public blockchains essentially means that it’s going to be near impossible to build any of this big technology on any other kind of platform.”Masters adds that the cost savings derived from using cryptocurrencies to access a global, open-source financial platform will make it impossible for even large tech companies to bootstrap their own proprietary technology to effectively compete.And when you begin to see cryptocurrencies in that context, you get a sense for just how large the potential of its digital economy may be.Bearing in mind Masters’ bullish view of the cryptocurrency space, one could expect him to disagree with Jamie Dimon’s comments on bitcoin (most recently calling bitcoin a “fraud”).Indeed, despite their common background at JPMorgan, the two former colleagues have gone opposite ways when it comes to cryptocurrency.While Masters believes Dimon has proven smart and hardworking in his role running the financial behemoth, Dimon doesn’t have adequate time to understand the complex issues at stake in the cryptocurrency space, he said, calling the comments on bitcoin “short-sighted.”“I don’t think Jamie Dimon has an open enough mind, all the time, to properly accept the contribution that digital assets can make,” he said.He points out that other senior financial executives – at such renowned institutions as Chicago Mercantile Exchange & Chicago Board of Trade, Chicago Board Options Exchange, and NASDAQ, where Masters’ shop lists its bitcoin trackers – feel very differently.Masters also points out that JPMorgan does, in fact, trade in bitcoin, and that JPMorgan Securities was buying bitcoin for its clients at the same time Jamie Dimon was criticizing cryptocurrencies.He concluded:“They either need to get with the program and support their clients who want to buy bitcoin, or they need to stop talking about it like a fool. Because those things are not consistent with an organization of that character.”Daniel Masters image via Vimeo"

Sunday, the bitcoin product code is XBT. If you want to trade the Jan.","Dec 13, 2017 at 00:00 UTC","Lanre Sarumi is the CEO of Level Trading Field, an interactive online platform for professionals in the finance industry.","When you read you begin with A, B, C.When you sing you begin with Do, Re, Mi.When you trade futures you begin with F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, X, Z.Each of those letters represents the month of the year that the contract expires. Remember, with a futures contract, two counterparties agreed on a fixed price and date to trade an asset. The month of that date is represented by those letters.I don’t know who came up with that nomenclature or how. Just memorize it and move on. Although I’m sure there is going to be some know-it-all in the comment section saying “I know!, I know!”The products traded on the exchange also have product codes. Heating oil is RB, crude oil is CL and the bitcoin futures set to trade on the CME starting Dec. 18 will be BTC. On the CBOE, which introduced its bitcoin futures contract Sunday, the bitcoin product code is XBT.If you want to trade the Jan. 2018 bitcoin contract, then, you will be trading BTCF8. BTC again represents bitcoin futures, “F” is the January code, “8” represents the year, 2018. If you want to trade the February 2018 BTC contract you trade BTCG8.What if you want to trade the Nov. 2017 BTC contract, what would it be called?If you said BTCX7, you would be correct, but it’s a trick question. We are in December 2017. The November contract, if it had existed, would have long expired by now. That brings up a very important point: If you have an open position in a physical delivery contract, you are subject to delivery.If, for instance, you are long the gasoline contract, you may want to notify your neighbors that 42,000 gallons of Reformulated Gasoline Blendstock for Oxygen Blending may be rolling up anytime soon.In the case of CME and the CBOE Bitcoin futures, however, the contract is cash settled. What this means is on the final day of the contract, the buyer is paid the difference between the value of the futures contract and the settlement price if the settlement price is higher than the value of the futures contract. If the value of the futures contract is greater than the settlement price, the seller is paid the difference. In dollars, not bitcoin.What happens if you want to hold on to your futures position after the futures contract expires? If you are long the contract you can simply sell it and buy the contract for the next month. This sounds simpler than it is in practice. Remember the market is constantly moving on all contracts. If you don’t mind paying a significant cost to do so then it really is a simple process. If you do, then you probably want the two-step process to happen simultaneously.The process of selling or buying a futures contract and then simultaneously doing the opposite (buying or selling) another contract that expires later, is called spreading. Since the only difference between the two futures contracts is the expiration date, it is specifically called calendar spreading. If, after the process, you end up with opposite positions in two contracts, then you own a calendar spread.Futures traders do a lot of spreading. Some do it for the reason described above, rolling an existing position into another month. Others do it to trade the price difference between two months.If, for instance you know that a hard fork in the bitcoin blockchain is coming in March 2018 and you believe as a result of the fork, the March contract will be more valuable than the February 2018 contract, you can simultaneously sell the February contract and buy the March contract. You make money if your thesis is true and you can effectively do the trade as simultaneously as possible.Some traders can pull this off successfully at very little cost, others successfully at very high cost. The definition of success for the latter group is an indulgence in generosity. The first group are usually high-frequency traders with fast computers.The second group are folks not to0 dissimilar from the ones reading this article.The futures exchanges, in the never-ending quest to help, and of course make a chunk of cash helping, have simplified the process.You can buy or sell calendar spreads as a single contract. The exchange takes on the task of performing the process as one operation, so the trader is guaranteed to get the two positions at the same time. These are called exchange-traded calendar spreads. If you did the two-step process yourself, you end up with the same thing, but you executed a synthetic calendar spread.Remember the exchange codes? Exchange calendar spreads wanted to join the party, so they were given their own names. The February/March calendar spread for bitcoin is at the CME is BTCG8-BTCH8. In other words, the February 2018 contract “minus” the March 2018 contract.Essentially, the exchange calendar spreads are always long the first month and short the second month. If your goal was to sell the February contract and buy the March contract (your hard fork thesis), then you simply sell the BTCG8-BTCH8 exchange calendar spread.If you are new to futures trading that is probably a lot to process. There is still a little more to learn before you print out your “Certified Futures Trader” certificate. In the next few articles, I’ll talk a little more about butterfly spreads, condors, box spreads andinter-commodity spreads.After that, can you print out your “certified futures trader” certificate? Nope. You still have to learn about implied prices and how they affect the spreads.After that, can you print your certificate? Nope, you still have to learn about price banding, price limits, contract size, and tick price.After that you still have to learn about …. wait, where are you going?Colorful letters via Shutterstock"

has started talking about bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and blockchain ...","Dec 13, 2017 at 09:00 UTC",Michael J. Casey is chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor of blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.,"Last week, my eighth-grader came home saying that all the boys at school were talking about bitcoin.Some might describe this vignette, and many others like it from the past few weeks, as a 2017 version of that ominous 1929 moment when shoeshine boys started giving stock tips. But whether or not they signal the bursting of a bubble, these stories also mean something far more important: bitcoin has gone mainstream.I’m not talking about the long-awaited mass adoption point in which a critical mass of users owns, earns and spends bitcoin. We’re still a long way from that notion of “mainstream.”Rather, it’s a moment of global awareness and dialogue. Even without user adoption, it opens up an immeasurably large array of possibilities, both positive and negative.As crypto-asset prices have gone haywire this past month, the whole world has started talking about bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology – around dinner tables, at holiday parties, in boardrooms, at trade conferences, in government meetings.At this stage, it’s not a sophisticated conversation. Knowledge and understanding are still seriously lacking. But people are gripped with curiosity, and that’s no small matter.This human conversation can’t be separated, either, from the widening engagement of institutions, big and small. Business news shows and websites are now running the BTC ticker on their home screens alongside the Dow Jones Industrials. Every day, mainstream newspapers and online publications run high-profile articles on bitcoin, ICOs and decentralized approaches to everything from ridesharing and supply chain management to social media and healthcare.Established companies are forming research consortia with their suppliers, vendors, competitors and new crypto startups to define the future open-source protocols of their industries. The World Bank, the IMF and other multilateral institutions are setting up blockchain labs for development and humanitarian objectives. Central banks are exploring programmable, digital fiat currency prototypes that, despite being government-controlled and centralized, could disintermediate banks and stoke a global competition for new monetary models.Meanwhile, tens of thousands of entrepreneurs in dozens of different countries are launching moon-shot ideas to disrupt virtually every market on earth.There is no turning back. The age of cryptocurrency has arrived.To battle-hardened cryptographers and Wall Street veterans alike, it all looks a bit disturbing.They cringe as newbies pile into digital assets while touts of varying integrity woo them with blockchain schemes based on untested, undeveloped or often non-existent technology.The cynics’ concerns are justified. People will lose money. A lot. Fingers of blame will be pointed. Mostly at the wrong parties.But there’s much more to this than the hype-stoked crypto markets. The intense attention on this unprecedented economic phenomenon is prompting people to ask some key, probing questions.Where does this fervor for bitcoin come from? What’s underlying it? Why does blockchain technology matter? Is it an opportunity for me, for my business, for society? Or is it a threat?In the end, it matters not whether it’s bitcoin, ethereum, or some other decentralizing technology that ends up framing our economic future. The most important thing is that people everywhere are starting to think about how a decentralized system of record-keeping and value exchange can flatten organizational hierarchies, reduce friction, expand access, open new markets and promote shared prosperity.It’s early days, but this unplanned global conversation could give rise to a “Big Bang” of crowdsourced ideas and entrepreneurship, one that evolves into an unstoppable wave of world-changing innovation.What’s exciting about this – and, let’s face it, also scary – is that it’s near impossible to predict where it will all go.The important thing is to let the conversation and ideas happen while also encouraging as wide public input as possible into how this technology is governed, tested and allowed to evolve.We know this from the history of the internet. The value of TCP/IP and of the various other open-source protocols of the internet was that, together, they formed an extensible platform. Anything could be built upon it. We just didn’t know what.Engineers at DARPA, MIT, Stanford and other places who worked on what was then known as Arpanet say that, when first contemplating its possibilities, they imagined sending DOS-based text messages to each other or sharing files without having to carry a floppy disk from one computer to another. But that was about it.They couldn’t foresee everything else: blogs, Wikipedia, social media, online search, streaming audio and video, the cloud, e-marketplaces or ridesharing, much less how the internet would become the backbone of the entire global economy.  That unforeseeable future required a much richer, collective imagination, one with global input.What those engineers also couldn’t foresee was that a failure to establish a truly decentralized trust-management system would allow new, centralized institutions to monopolize control of the global digital economy – the Googles, Amazons, Alibabas and Tencents of this world.Now, at the dawn of the age of cryptocurrency, we have an obligation to get it right, to build a more open economy.We must let the ideas flow, from every corner of the globe and from every community and interest group. And let those who generate them find the opportunity and the resources to turn them into something they can test, deploy and, hopefully, bring to market. We must promote a decentralized system of open-access that gives everyone a chance to succeed.If the past few weeks are any indication, we’re in for a chaotic ride. But our world’s problems are too big to entrust to anything less than chaos.Bitcoin topping image via Miss Bitcoin Mai/Twitter"

But with tax season ...","Nov 9, 2017 at 12:00 UTC",Bitcoin holders in the U.S. might be feeling giddy about the “free money” they’ve received as of late from bitcoin hard forks.,"But with tax season right around the corner, they might also be feeling a bit uneasy.While the money generated by the bitcoin cash hard fork – and the possible money generated by the bitcoin gold hard fork – has played a role in driving bitcoin’s price surge, it’s not all fun and games. Bitcoin owners have effectively acquired value for free, but there is still a cost associated with the assets.According to Perry Woodin, CEO of Node40, a TurboTax-like platform for cryptocurrency owners:“People are piling into bitcoin so they can get the free money, but I think very few people are thinking about the tax implications of it. And if they are, they’re probably thinking ‘Well, I can get around it’.”But that might not be clear thinking.For tax reporting purposes, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  currently classifies bitcoin and “other virtual currencies” as property, meaning owners are legally obliged to report the capital gains and losses incurred from cryptocurrency holdings during each calendar year.As bitcoin cash and the other cryptocurrencies created from hard forks act nearly identical to bitcoin (besides some technical code changes), some wonder if the same rules will apply. Currently, though, it’s all a gray area.“From a tax perspective, the bitcoin hard fork really is uncharted territory,” said James Markwood, a tax attorney with Cogent Law Group in Washington. D.C.For those crypto holders interested in playing by the rules, though, there’s really no clear consensus from tax experts on what should be done.“There are really two choices, and neither one of the choices are particularly appealing,” said Woodin.The first choice is to assign each new coin an arbitrary value to use as its cost basis. This could potentially be done by taking a weighted average of, for example, bitcoin cash’s trading value in futures markets just before the August fork, or by assigning it a value proportional to that of a full bitcoin.Any increase in the price after the cryptocurrency’s inception and before the end of the year would then be subject to capital gains tax.The other possibility is to assign the new coin an arbitrary value of zero and then pay the capital gains tax on the full value whenever the disposition of the coin occurs (when they are exchanged for other crypto assets or for fiat currency).The latter approach would seem to match up with the IRS’ thinking on other types of second-generation assets, explained Markwood, noting the situation could be similar to that of a farmer who owns a cow that gives birth to a calf or a landowner who discovers gold on his property.Importantly, in both cases, the creation or discovery of the new asset would not necessarily trigger a taxable event. But when the assets are sold off, the full value of the disposition would be deemed taxable income.While the latter approach may sound more appealing to bitcoin owners because it allows them to effectively kick the can until they sell an asset, it’s unclear whether or not that applies to cryptocurrencies.Of course, a third option is to simply ignore one’s reporting obligations altogether, a strategy that – as evidenced by the IRS’s assertion that only 802 individuals reported capital gains from bitcoin in 2015 – has been employed quite frequently by U.S. traders.While the approach was understandable given the complicated and labor-intensive process of reporting cryptocurrency (many traders may have been unaware of the requirements altogether), it becomes even more so since bitcoin holders sometimes don’t have much choice over whether they get access to hard fork-created tokens or not.During the bitcoin cash fork, bitcoin holders were given bitcoin cash at a rate of 1:1, and exchanges that supported the new coin merely dumped the equal amount in users’ accounts.“People are really looking to avoid this, especially if you’re not interested in bitcoin cash or any one of the new forks,” said Woodin, adding:“You don’t want to have to pay tax on something you didn’t want in the first place.”But crypto tax-evaders face much higher risk in 2017 as the skyrocketing value of bitcoin and the newly created class of crypto millionaires are drawing scrutiny from the authorities.The IRS has also wised up to how these new assets are being used and stored, as evidenced by the agency’s John Doe summons of Coinbase user records in 2016, as well as this summer’s revelation that the IRS has been using Chainalysis software to monitor the blockchain for bitcoin tax cheats since 2015.Chainalysis did not respond to requests for comment about whether the IRS continues to use its product.More than anything, new assets being created by bitcoin forks underscore the need for greater clarity from the IRS on how cryptocurrencies should be reported for tax purposes.The IRS guidelines for reporting cryptocurrencies has come under considerable backlash as too cumbersome, if not altogether impossible for higher volume traders or people using it to purchase everyday items such as a cup of coffee.“Taxing blockchain-based currency, like bitcoin, as property rather than as a competing currency has numerous adverse consequences,” said Amy Davine Kim, global policy director and general counsel at the Chamber of Digital Commerce, a Washington D.C.-based blockchain advocacy group.“Among other things,” she continued, “it imposes onerous reporting requirements that are difficult to understand and ultimately inhibit the widespread adoption in retail commerce of this promising technology.”It’s interesting to note that the mission behind the bitcoin cash hard fork is to increase the block size, so that more transactions can be verified on the network at less cost – for supporters of the move, bitcoin’s current block size limit is holding back adoption of bitcoin for retail payments.Many in the industry have asked the IRS for more formal guidance – the Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act was introduced in Congress in an attempt to push the IRS to revisit its determination – but the IRS has yet to release an update.According to Kim:“Forks represent just one example of activities on a blockchain that may have tax consequences that, with little guidance from the IRS, are difficult to determine.”Bitcoin on calculator image via Shutterstock"

weekend, clients of Trading 212, a brokerage based in the U.K., Germany ...","Nov 18, 2017 at 11:45 UTC","Editor’s note: The author, a freelance writer in the U.K., has an account at Trading 212 and was in the BCH market on Nov. 12.","As the cryptocurrency bitcoin cash surged to a high of $2,500 last weekend, clients of Trading 212, a brokerage based in the U.K., Germany and Bulgaria, were sitting on fat profits, in some cases hundreds of thousands of pounds.That is, until Sunday, when the cryptocurrency took a nosedive – and the firm suspended trading.Unable to close their positions, the affected customers could only watch as the price of bitcoin cash fell more than $800 in under an hour. Trading 212 says the suspension lasted only 10 minutes, but according to the traders, that was all it took to erase in some cases sizeable gains.Not taking it lying down, 54 customers went so far as to set up a WhatsApp group called “People v 212,” where they compared notes about how to reclaim their alleged missing gains.All told, the Trading 212 clients – many of whom described their frustrations in interviews or emails – say they lost an estimated £10 million ($13.2 million), though some have settled their complaints with the company. For example, a group of traders from Cardiff, Wales, has accepted an offer to pay out a proportion, about 10 percent, of the profits they say they were owed.Aside from temporarily preventing clients who had accumulated gains from cashing out, some said Trading 212 failed to execute their stop-loss or take-profit orders. The company, in turn, claims the customers whose orders were canceled had violated its contract terms.“Today we have settled with most of the affected clients,” Borislav Nedialkov, a co-founder of Trading 212, said Friday.Justin Galvin, one of the Trading 212 customers battling to get what they see as their rightful profits, blamed the company for the situation, however. In statements, he argued the firm simply took too risky a strategy in offering the product in a nascent market.Galvin said:“In my opinion, they exercised too much risk by offering bitcoin cash to entice new customers only to have those traders beat the market by 100 times.”But while bruising losses are nothing new in the crypto space, these traders hadn’t actually purchased bitcoin cash. Rather, they had entered into contracts for difference (CFD) with Trading 212. In a CFD, traders don’t buy assets directly but take positions on price movements. (CFDs are banned in the U.S.).The gains and losses are amplified because the brokers allow trading at 30x to 150x margins.In short, these entities don’t hold any of the assets that customers are trading on. In this sense then, CFD brokers operate in a world that is more akin to betting. (Indeed, many of the companies in the sector also offer spread-betting services, although not in Trading 212’s case.)These companies sometimes freeze positions for short periods to manage volatility, as Trading 212 did with bitcoin cash on Sunday. In such situations, there is little clients can do if the broker prevents them from adjusting their positions in the market.The goings on at Trading 212, then, perhaps represent a collision of worlds, where crypto traders meet old-school middlemen.“In crypto, I exit with my bitcoin profits immediately. Never leave your winning chips on the table for the dealer to see,” said Clem Chambers, chief executive of company stock analysis site ADVFN.com.Trading 212, however, is relatively new to the CFD broking game, launching its share-dealing and crypto service in June this year. Nevertheless, it has succeeded in attracting many young investors and traders. Its addition of eight cryptocurrency markets has helped it to expand.Still, many investors may have been prone to act emotionally, perhaps either not understanding, or being wilfully unaware, of the terms of the investments in which they had entered. It may be that the company concluded the Cardiff-based traders were “trading in concert” given that they knew each other, although the company has so far brought forward no evidence.Not used to the nature of the trading schemes that have sprouted up around the market, many were surprised, then, at the measures the company has taken.But Trading 212 isn’t the only area of the crypto market to come under stress as a result of bitcoin cash’s weekend ups and downs.Bitcoin cash’s price pullback happened at the same time as Korean exchange Bithumb began to have outages. In response, industry website CoinMarketCap stopped taking prices from the exchange, meaning 50 percent of trading volume worldwide wasn’t shown in its charts.Three thousand Korean customers of Bithumb have launched a class action lawsuit against the exchange claiming they suffered losses as a result of the two-hour outage.Price swings of the magnitude seen in the bitcoin market on Sunday would possibly have triggered a trading suspension on stock exchanges, but this is crypto, where no such mechanisms exist. Having said that, the market is showing signs of maturing.The introduction of bitcoin futures by derivatives market giant CME Group will go some way to bearing down on bitcoin volatility – although some incumbents in the futures markets worry that a crypto “virus” could jump the species barrier and initiate a pandemic in the “real economy.” The outbreak of influenza at Trading 212 may be an early warning sign.Regulators, it seems, are taking notice, though their main message is “buyer beware.”Following the incident, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a statement on the risks of cryptocurrency CFDs. But Trading 212’s customers are unlikely to find any consolation in its words.While the FCA regulates CFD brokers, it warned:“These protections will not compensate you for any losses from trading.”Since then, Trading 212 appears to be taking steps to ensure a similar situation doesn’t repeat, announcing it was raising the deposit level required to trade on margin.Money drain visualization image via Shutterstock"

It doesn’t serve any socially useful function.”However, Stiglitz, who also chaired the U.S. President’s Council of Economic Advisers during the Clinton Administration, said he does support technological innovation in payments, but thinks digital money should still be fiat created and controlled by the government.“Let’s move away from paper into the 21st century of a digital economy,” he said.Like many other members of the Davoisie, Stiglitz – who won the  Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2001 – called the run-up in bitcoin’s price unjustified and unsustainable.“It’s a bubble that’s going to give a lot of people a lot of exciting times as it rides up and then goes down,” he said. “The value of a bitcoin today is expectations of what the bitcoin is going to be tomorrow.”And even though bitcoin is a decentralized network, with participants scattered around the globe, Stiglitz seemed to think Washington could easily nip it in the bud.“If the government says ‘the reason bitcoin is being used is circumvention,’ they could close it down at any moment,” he said. “And then it collapses.”You can watch the clip here:Joseph Stiglitz photo via Wikimedia Commons."

Alive. Oct 1, 2017 at 22:00 UTC Updated Oct 2, 2017 at 12:07 UTC.","Oct 1, 2017 at 22:00 UTC",Cody Wilson is expecting a nice bump in sales from bitcoin’s rising price.,"The controversial founder of Defense Distributed, a manufacturer of machines for 3D-printed firearms, told CoinDesk that despite its niche appeal, his company is flourishing. Founded in 2012, Defense Distributed has evolved into a multimillion-dollar operation that today generates 10 percent of its revenue from bitcoin.But it’s not particularly surprising the cryptocurrency community would be supportive of the project. Wilson has been a part of the scene for some time, most notably helping Amir Taaki co-create DarkMarket, a peer-to-peer online marketplace designed to sidestep legal and regulatory restrictions through its use of bitcoin.If past trends are any indication, this support should not only continue but grow – according to Wilson, the company is gearing up for its most lucrative quarter yet.Last year, Defense Distributed generated $2.7 million in revenue, a 7 percent increase year-over-year, and to date Wilson says it’s sold about 4,000 machines. This year, however, Wilson expects that figure to escalate thanks to the increased willingness of bitcoin holders to spend as the value of their holdings increases.He told CoinDesk:“As bitcoin crested $2,000, we saw more purchases in bitcoin. Because, hell, one bitcoin gets you a gun machine now, and that’s a good trade.”A self-described cryptoanarchist, Wilson’s work with both 3D-printed guns without serial numbers, and cryptocurrency itself, is part of his work to circumnavigate government controls – an idea that some members of the cryptocurrency community have proved particularly responsive to.So, to provide his customers with a better tool to drive that process, Wilson has today revealed he’s upgrading his latest Ghost Gunner 2 gun printer.Not only has the machine’s firmware been updated to make the printer more accurate, but a number of hardware upgrades – including a spindle capable of turning metal powder into incredibly detailed pistols – have been added to make the finished products look and act more like traditional handguns.“This is basically the beginning of the automated manufacturing of untraceable handguns of a commercial grade, not of bizarre, 3D printed quality,” Wilson said.Not only is Wilson seeing an uptick in sales from bitcoin’s continued appreciation, but other gun sellers are too. In an interview with CoinDesk, Michael Cargill, the owner of Central Texas Gun Works, said his gun sales typically increase when the bitcoin price goes up.“Whenever bitcoin goes up, I get customers from all over the country who want to buy guns,” he said, adding:“When we first started doing this back in 2013, bitcoin was about $200. Now, it’s peaked at $4,700, and a lot of people are cashing in.”Cargill noted that his shop, which has Wilson’s Ghost Gunner 2 on sale, would have seen a drop in total sales this year if not for bitcoin. About 45 percent of his revenue comes from cryptocurrency, he said.Such a percentage of sales from bitcoin is doubly notable, seeing how Cargill can’t do business with bitcoin merchant services firms like BitPay because of their policies against on-boarding guns-and-ammo businesses – a policy which BitPay said still exists, thought the initial press release detailing the policy has been removed.BitPay and other merchant services providers have taken a conservative approach to high-risk merchants like Central Texas Gun Works, which means those businesses typically have to do a lot of the upfront acceptance work themselves.And that hesitance to work with high-risk verticals is unlikely to change anytime soon.Wilson has felt this himself, seeing strong opposition to his work in the gray area between building a machine that makes guns and actually making guns.Back in May 2013, the files he used to print the guns were seized by the Department of Justice. Then, last year, Wilson suffered a setback when the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals refused to give him the First Amendment protections he sought for the files.Yet, a niche community of developers has sprouted up offering their own open-source contributions to the 3D-printed gun industry, even in spite of the ongoing risk.In spite of the obstacles, Wilson continues to push forward in disrupting the $51.3 billion gun sector, expecting to keep the Ghost Gunner 2’s price steady at $1,500 in an effort to attract more sales with the price of bitcoin currently around $4,300.“We’re going to hype this like we always do,” said Wilson, concluding:“I assume we’re going to have good sales in the fourth quarter here.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in BitPay.Cody Wilson image via YouTube; printed guns images via Defense Distributed

You can only price it and trade it.”Grouping all investments into four categories, – assets, commodities, currencies and collectibles – the finance expert substantiated his statement by saying that bitcoin does not the “generate cash flows” required to be categorized as an asset, nor it is a “raw material” that would class it as a commodity.“The choice then becomes whether it is a currency or a collectible,” he said.Notably, Damodaran further disagreed with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon’s recent comment that bitcoin is a “fraud.”Back in July, Damodaran also argued that cryptocurrencies were quickly becoming a preferred alternative to gold for people who don’t trust traditional fiat currencies.Aswath Damodaran Image via YouTube"

capitalization ...","Oct 26, 2017 at 02:31 UTC","From $0 to $2,900 – and seemingly everywhere in between.","Bitcoin gold, a new fork of the bitcoin software, may not have been officially launched (or distributed to users), but that isn’t stopping the cryptocurrency markets from seeking to determine its potential value (or profiting from its eventual existence). In an interesting twist on a typical distribution, a number of exchanges are now listing a token that represents a claim on the future delivery of bitcoin gold (in advance of it becoming available to all bitcoin users). Ahead of that event, however, traders are seeking to value the asset, which proposes an alternative to the difficulty of competing for rewards on bitcoin’s mining network.Still, it’s safe to say there’s disagreement so far.In interview, analysts expressed a reservation about bitcoin gold, both when speaking about its developer team, and when characterizing the protocol’s potential market opportunity.Safiri Felix, a researcher at financial publisher Empiricus, for example, believes that while bitcoin gold is likely to encourage others to clone bitcoin’s blockchain, and thus capitalize on the potential to appeal to its expansive user base, he sees this trajectory as limited.Felix told CoinDesk:“I think that forks and airdrops as a trend to launch new tokens [will continue], aiming to get an instant user base. Best case scenario, bitcoin gold is a potential contender for litecoin.”Indeed, most industry observers surveyed don’t expect the project to compete with bitcoin or bitcoin cash, predicting its market capitalization would likely be similar to less valuable networks.This belief seems reflected on exchanges, where BTG tokens traded for a high of $2,900 on Bitfinex, before dropping 96.64 percent to $97 on Tuesday. By Wednesday, prices stabilized around $137 at press time, though order books are heavy with sell orders in available markets.At current prices, the value of all bitcoin gold (once released) would be worth a mere 43 percent of BCH and 2 percent of BTC. As such, it seems unlikely to surpass the value of those currencies in the immediate future.Likewise, exchange interest also seems subdued. Currently, only a handful of exchanges, Bitfinex, HitBTC, Yobit, Bleutrade, Bitstar and Coinnest, support BTG/BTC and BTG/USD trading pairs.Of course, the biggest question mark for those surveyed was whether the tokens will actually be delivered by those behind the project.Already controversial is that the team behind bitcoin gold intends to set aside a certain amount of the cryptocurrency to fund its future development, as part of what’s called a “pre-mine.” Indeed, Felix was quick to note that the bitcoin gold team has no existing track record in the industry.“It’s natural to dismiss their ability to deliver quality code,” he said.Long-time industry entrepreneur and director of business and community at cryptocurrency wallet provider Jaxx, Charlie Shrem, also cited the decision to set aside funds as a suspicious one, though not one that inherently denotes any wrongdoing.“[It] seems like an attempt to replicate bitcoin cash and give the developers a nice premine,” he said.Overall, his remarks pointed to the idea that the low price of bitcoin gold as compared to bitcoin and bitcoin cash may be reflective of the possibility the funds never actually arrive.As for what that means for those considering how to handle their holdings, it’s worth noting that such market shifts are common when it comes to the price determination of a new asset. For instance, bitcoin cash (BCH) – which forked off bitcoin in August – traded for highs of nearly $1,000 before dropping to trade between $300 to $400 in its first month. Likewise, at points, zcash traded for millions of dollars per token (though that was due to issues with its distribution).But, it’s still the question of the protocol’s ultimate value proposition that seems most pertinent.Shrem went so far as to forecast that it’s possible bitcoin gold could inspire cryptocurrency hobbyists to begin securing the protocol with older mining equipment, and that this could possibly jumpstart value creation, potentially leading to utility.He noted that while older GPUs could be used to mine ether – the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network – doing so would mean a reduced chance of rewards given its existing competition.Of course, others were more outright dismissive. Tim Enneking, managing director at hedge fund Crypto Asset Management, believes bitcoin gold proves fork currencies will likely have diminishing returns from here on out.Enneking concluded:“It’s like an ICO, but with a head start.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Zcash Company, the for-profit entity that develops the zcash protocol.Golden dice via Shutterstock"

Prices fell to a low of $3,836 earlier today and were last seen trading around $3,990 levels. The 50-day moving average is located at $3,982 levels.As per CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency has hardly moved in the last 24 hours. BTC is up 4.5% on the week and month. (Indeed, the lackluster action in the cryptocurrencies is eerily similar to the one seen in equities, currencies, bonds and commodity markets at the moment.)However, this may be a sign that investors across the various asset classes would prefer to sit on the sidelines ahead of the FOMC rate decision tomorrow. The Fed is widely expected to keep the interest rates unchanged and announce the beginning of the balance sheet taper.Daily chartBullish crossovers occur when the short-term moving average (5-day moving average) crosses or cuts the long-term moving average (10-day moving average) from below.A bullish 5-day moving average and 10-day moving average crossover, if confirmed during the overnight trade, would help bitcoin take out resistance at $4,209 (confluence of falling trend line and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement).A move above $4,209 would improve the odds of bitcoin rallying to record highs. As discussed yesterday, only a drop below $3,465 (the September 17 low) would revive the bearish view.Spinning quarter via Shutterstock"

It’s been an amazing run, has it not?”Doll also indicated that the cryptocurrency price ramp has gotten some quarters of the finance world talking, though what that interest will lead to remains to be seen.“‘With bitcoin, why do you need the stock market?’ has been the saying of late,” Doll quipped.Doll isn’t the first from Nuveen – which was founded in 1898 and boasts roughly $948 billion in assets under management – to comment on cryptocurrency markets.In October, Nuveen announced plans to put some of its less liquid assets onto exchange-traded funds. According to Bloomberg, the firm remarked at the time that bitcoin’s rise indicated an interest in new ways to transact currencies.The firm also suggested that it sees blockchain providing “some real usefulness and potential in the market,” though it cautioned that any potential applications of the tech in the finance space remain in development.Image via YouTube/Bloomberg"

thing that really kills bitcoin.' But the price action was saying the 
opposite,” ...","Sep 15, 2017 at 08:00 UTC",“Why won’t you die?”,"That’s what Josh Brown, money manager and CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, kept asking himself as he watched the price of bitcoin rise and rise.After years of skepticism toward cryptocurrency, Brown finally relented, buying bitcoin for the first time in July. And yet, at the very moment prices were soaring, news about the number one cryptocurrency by market capitalization turned negative.“People were saying [about the scaling debate], ‘This is going to be the thing that really kills bitcoin.’ But the price action was saying the opposite,” Brown recalls.And as he watched the cryptocurrency not only recover from, but rally after its scaling debate came to a head, he turned from bear to bull.A frequent commentator on CNBC and mandatory reading for anyone who follows “Finance Twitter,” Brown said that kind of scenario isn’t just a one-off.He told CoinDesk:“One of the things I’ve learned in the investing world is that very often the thing that’s supposed to break an asset class is the thing that truly strengthens it.”According to Brown, there’s a clear parallel in the European stock markets: while Brexit was ballyhooed as the death of the European Union, it’s actually forced the bloc to become more tightly knit.Overall, he refers to these seemingly pessimistic instances often, and it’s what he uses as an investment thesis of sorts. When an asset seems like it should die, but for years on end it finds a market – even if you’re not part of its core demographic – it’s often time to give it a closer look, he said.“I felt that way about Facebook. I wanted it to die. I thought ‘Enough! This is so stupid.’ I just wanted it to die… And now? I’m on Facebook all day,” he said.Brown had the same aversion to Netflix as well, seeing it as an unnecessary application. But what he found was that sometimes it depends not on what people need, but what they want, and users wanted Netflix.One of the primary criticisms Brown said he hears from investors who are bearish on the crypto asset market is that cryptocurrency is a “solution in search of a problem.” And while Brown believes they could be right for now, in the very near future, crypto, like Facebook and Netflix, could find a problem to solve.He offers another example in cloud computing, which started out as a solution in search of a problem.In the early days of cloud computing, the technology was fraught with privacy and availability concerns – and the dominant paradigm at the time was that it was crazy to allow your mission critical business data to be hosted off-site.And now? Brown answers rhetorically: “Who has a mainframe in a server room in their office?”That doesn’t mean every cool, bleeding-edge technology will pan out, though, said Brown.The important takeaway from his analysis is that many technologies seem like toys – or are just totally useless – until an important use case is found and broadly applied.And one area where Brown sees a great deal of promise for cryptocurrency is in the securities industry, which he already knows quite well.If you buy stock today, it takes three days for the trade to settle – meaning it takes three days to process the payment and for the broker to take custody of the security.“That makes absolutely no sense in the context of the things we’re able to do instantaneously,” he contended.Brown said he doesn’t have a crystal ball to determine exactly what the solution will be – whether it will be cryptocurrency, blockchain or a solution influenced by those technologies – but the idea the technology could have an impact is beginning to make the brokerage business collectively rethink its old paradigms.In this way, Brown acknowledges his own past skepticism.“I ignored it. I didn’t take it seriously. I ridiculed it at times,” he said.In a sense, Brown’s evolution on crypto echoes a line attributed to Mahatma Ghandi that cryptocurrency enthusiasts have been fond of for years:“First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.”All that said, Brown is still not a wild-eyed optimist.Putting most of his skepticism into initial coin offerings (ICOs), or cryptocurrency-based fundraising, Brown thinks it’s going to “blow up in everyone’s face.”He can’t imagine why legitimate companies would fund themselves by offering access to investors via an ICO – unless they had something to hide, or the companies were simply of such poor quality that an initial public offering or a venture round wasn’t an option. Although, to be fair, the venture capital space can be a tough nut to crack.But Brown still thinks he’s right to a certain extent, reiterating that many of his initial criticisms about cryptocurrency turned out to be correct.He said:“A lot of the stuff I felt about it [that] it’s going to be a Wild West, and it’s unregulated and there are hacks and it’s dangerous – all of that was right. I was completely right about it. But what I didn’t see happening was that it wasn’t going to die.”So now Brown tells his money management clients who ask his thoughts to go read, research and form their own opinion about the space.“It’s so easy to look at something that you’re not a part of and you don’t understand, and just point at it and say, ‘BUBBLE!!!'” Brown said.But what he’s not doing anymore is dismissing it out of hand.Image courtesy of Josh Brown"

This is the first one, but it at least gives you the first guess from different institutional traders as to what bitcoin’s dynamics will look like from now until 2018.”The trade option was listed by LedgerX late Friday night, and to Chou’s surprise, two institutional investors agreed to the terms of the deal just one day later.Under the terms, the buyer agreed to a price of $2,250.25 for the trade, meaning the seller collects that money if the price is less that $10,000 by the end of next year, and the buyer gets to purchase bitcoin at the strike price if it is higher.Unlike a futures swap however, the buyer is not obliged to purchase the asset.“If the price goes to zero, you don’t have to pay $10,000 for it,” Chou said. “But if a year from now it’s at $20,000, then you can exercise your options.”Based on LedgerX’s own calculations (made using the Nobel-prize winning Black-Scholes financial markets model), the startup believes there is a 25 percent chance that bitcoin will reach that level in the allotted time.While this is the first LEAPS financial instrument matched by New York-based LedgerX, they’ve been conducting increasingly high trade volumes since their soft launch a month ago.As reported by CoinDesk, LedgerX traded $1 million in bitcoin derivatives its first week of trading, ending Oct. 20.Since then, the first cryptocurrency firm to be granted a derivatives clearing organization (DCO) license by the CFTC has posted a $1 million day, a $1.6 million day and on November 15, a record $2.6 million day.Since LedgerX listed the LEAPS option at 5:30 Friday evening, Chou says they saw an additional $500,000 traded before midnight. “That’s for a holiday week too,” he said. “So we were shocked.” He estimates the company has conducted approximately $16 million in notional bitcoin transactions to date.While the startup’s numbers seem to indicated active early interest, legacy institutions such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME Group) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)  have both recently revealed their own similar plans.Though Chou hopes to maintain his first-mover advantage, he said there’s no hard date to launch into full operation. Rather, his team wants to make sure the platform scales well beyond the 1 million messages it sends per day before this milestone. He says he’d be “surprised” if that takes “more than a month,” concluding:“But it might be sooner.”Crystal ball image via Shutterstock"

They will now pivot toward a combination of the existing structure and the direct, peer-to-peer model.According to OKEx, the yuan is currently the only fiat currency that is available on its P2P platform, noting that it has seen increasing demand from Chinese investors since the exchange crackdown.Lennix Lai, financial market director at OKEx, said the platform has received around 8,000 user applications for account registration since the new service’s launch on November 1.Lin Li, CEO of Huobi, said in his latest announcement that, besides the P2P platform on Huobi Pro, the company is also eyeing an expansion to overseas markets. The firm is currently in the process of setting up an exchange platform in South Korea in order to compete with local marketplaces like Bithumb.The news follows months of growing scrutiny by Chinese regulators that led to all major bitcoin exchanges in the country, including OKCoin, Huobi, BTC China, and ViaBTC, to suspend order book trading of digital assets against the yuan.Hong Kong image via Shutterstock"

I put the question to Mike Sofaer of Brian Kelly Asset Management when I saw him at the Scaling Bitcoin conference recently. Mike replied: “Bitcoin is collective insurance against the collapse of fiat currency systems.” His answer left me with a fresh question – why can’t we have lots of insurance companies?Let’s imagine that we have a decentralized system – which means that miners (well at least, the ones among whom there’s consensus) aren’t working together, and the correlation of their decisions is negligible. The upshot would be that each miner verifies the actions of all the others, and is exclusively interested in following the rules to a T. This kind of setup is similar to an insurance company with a pool of policies sufficiently diversified that the occurrence probability of a certain percentage of identical claim situations happening simultaneously is actually zero. And in reality, that’s exactly how insurance corporations operate – they have policies against floods, and against forest fires, when it’s obvious that the two calamities couldn’t both happen at the same time.So how can the cryptocurrency economy develop similar robustness? Maybe forks are part of the answer.Stepping back, previous bitcoin forks, along with ones that didn’t go ahead, have shown that the first cryptocurrency is sufficiently robust and stable, even during such unpredictable circumstances. To be clear, the kind of forks I’m talking about in this post meet the following criteria:The primary causes of bitcoin forks are struggles for the control of bitcoin’s development. The system itself is decentralized – but obviously, opinions differ on how the project can be further improved are divided. If, 1) bitcoin were made completely anonymous, 2) miners were decentralized and not grouped together in pools, 3) the number of transactions per second would increase in proportion to demand – there would be little impetus for forks. In this scenario the system – which would be continuously getting closer and closer to perfection, along with the desired guaranteed proven security and real decentralization of control – would have the highest chances of success.But clearly, we are far from hitting that trifecta.There are several groups with vested interests in these forks:Yet in the final analysis, forks have a whole series of both negative and positive consequences. On the negative side, they erode investor confidence in an asset (which one is the true bitcoin?) – as well as creating inflation, one of the main arguments against forks. If we are afraid of inflation, then we implicitly equate bitcoin with services. As one example, if there’s only one hair salon in town, then the price of haircuts will be higher than if there were a hundred such salons. Nevertheless, you could have as many copies of the Mona Lisa as you like – and their number will never affect the value of Leonardo’s original.Alongside the negatives, there are also some positive benefits of forks. One example is that forks prompt technological improvements, because they force teams into competition with each other.The most difficult problem for any bitcoin-type system is proving that the system is truly decentralized from a control viewpoint. Consider bitcoin cash (BCH), where the main mining operations are historically concentrated in the hands of a small group of people (there are also concerns about ownership of BCH and exchanges where it is traded).It’s clear that not everyone sold their bitcoin cash coins (even Satoshi didn’t sell his, or hers, or theirs). However, the opportunities for rigging the price are substantially greater here than in the original bitcoin. So far the bitcoin cash community has not rolled out any clear criteria to prevent manipulation, so it remains hard to say if they are even capable of such development. On the other hand, you have to admit that if full anonymity were in place, a fork with 10,000 independent miners and millions of users would look exactly the same as a fork with three miners and a hundred users (since we have no idea who controls the hashrate, or accounts). Merely having indicators about the trading volume and market cap is useless while dealing with cases of manipulation, or people having the exchanges “in their pocket.”If the bitcoin experiment survives, it will teach us how to create anonymous decentralised systems with provable decentralized control. That’s when such systems can begin to compete against each other on their level of true decentralization, security, quality of service and transaction fees.Of course, there isn’t any reason whatsoever to suppose that the “traditional” financial systems couldn’t mutate into this format either. Every state, whether real or virtual, can set up its own currency that’s managed by its “central bank” – using a format, for example, such as smart contracts, which analyse economic performance stats and use them to establish monetary policy.It seems to me that new forks are bound to happen, especially for ethereum, when it switches to proof-of-stake (it’s just much easier to create a fork than with proof-of-work). Regarding bitcoin, it’s very likely that new potential improvements will appear – whose introduction will require a hard fork (such as the hotly anticipated one for MimbleWimble). We must note that a large number of bitcoin forks with a single mining algorithm will increase the likelihood of a double-spending attack. It could be that the next bitcoin fork will be exactly the place where this kind of attack is probable. But the upside in that could be that real experience of such an attack would provide the stats to guard against similar attacks on other networks in future.On balance, then, I’ve begun thinking that forks have positive value, provided that systems don’t compete to be king of the hill. If we follow along the line of thinking of decentralization, then there ought to be numerous systems. Based on this principle, users ought to have free choice as to which system to select at any given moment. A single global currency, carved into the stone of the Founding Fathers as a covenant of the true path seems these days more and more like an Orwellian future – even if served with decentralization sauce.Forks offer ideological leaders the chance to put their ideas on improving protocols into practice without getting bogged down in endless bickering with others. What’s more, it doesn’t mean starting a new cryptocurrency from scratch, and trying to win over users for it – there are already people holding bitcoins. The long-term view is that this approach will yield results – since it makes it possible to test different technical solutions independently of each other, and then choose the best ones.Forked path image via Shutterstock"

Don’t worry, you too can learn the tools to deflect relentless advocates and company interests. Just ask yourself, “Wait, what’s the evidence this is even a thing?”The results may surprise you…The first thing to know is it’s not just bitcoiners who were being creative and aspirational.Blockchain was great again in 2017, or Blockchain™ at least, where consultants did their best to convince people that a transaction ledger in a Merkle tree was a fantastic new innovation in business data processing, and not a structure we’d had since 1979 or software (Git) we’d had since 2005.(Git users: “Why yes, we’ve been using, uh, blockchain-related technologies since 2005, and …”)But, Blockchain™ did offer one key innovation. The trouble with “the cloud” or “NoSQL” is that these are specific technologies with measurable effects. Blockchain™ doesn’t suffer this limitation!A Blockchain™ doesn’t even have to be a blockchain (e.g. Estonia’s much-touted KSI Blockchain™) and you can even claim a Blockchain™ when you’re running it as a database cluster with you as the only user (e.g. the World Food Programme’s Building Blocks).You see, we learned that distributed trustless immutable ledgers are vastly more efficient and easier to implement if you don’t distribute them very far and aren’t too strict on the trustless bit. Immutability turns out not to have a huge market in practice either!In Distributed Ledger Technology™ will be a new and disruptive paradigm in which transactions are recorded on a single node at the hub of the network, with controlled access to this node to ensure security and privacy.Distributed Ledger Technology™ is powered by smart contracts, which came along for the hype ride, even if adding immutable scripts so you couldn’t fix bugs in your simplified version of Git is obviously stupid.How about the markets though? Those have to be good. The price is through the roof!Oh dear, dear. This isn’t normal securities trading! Think you can assume your crypto exchange is basically competent and its systems well maintained? Think again. “I know PHP – how hard could running an exchange be?” isn’t the best starting point.You also can’t assume a crypto exchange isn’t going to mess you around. All manner of shenanigans that are completely illegal in proper security trading – bots painting the tape, wash trades, spoof orders, just front-running your customers – are completely normal in crypto. Your threat model is not just the other traders, it’s literally the platform you are putting your money and coins into.That is if you’re even lucky enough to use real money… That’s right, some of the world’s largest exchanges don’t anymore offer that luxury.Take Tether, an increasingly famous as the Eurodollar-like USD substitute token for crypto exchanges. There are just under a billion of those, and they’re being put to good and productive economic use for margin lending to bitcoin buyers. You can rest assured that every one of those Tethers is backed by an actual dollar. Definitely™.What’s that? You got in early? I’m genuinely happy for you.Ignore bitter naysayers like me pointing out that your paper gains don’t exist until you’ve not only cashed out but finally succeeded in getting your actual money from the exchange, through the delays and withdrawal limits.Hopefully, you’ll still have a bank account by the end of it.Just be sure that you’ve actually made money, though, and remember two-thirds of holders haven’t locked in a penny of tangible profit. This means I have personally realized more actual money from bitcoin than a supermajority of bagholders, without touching one.The most difficult part of crypto trading is maintaining clear, evidence-based thinking when that would imply your paper balance is worth a fraction of what you’ve told yourself for months or years.But, nevermind, your exchange will be just fine. It’s backed by venture capitalists you can Google!Good luck, sir. I just hope it doesn’t go consistently down for maintenance whenever the price is crashing! Oh wait… How does this keep happening? Never mind, I’m sure it will be fine.But David, it’s not about what’s here today. It’s about the principles, the ideology!In crypto, you can’t just issue money like a government! Because if a government issues money carelessly, competent people tell them to slow down, because in the real world this is a widely-understood problem.Crypto has no such barriers to issuance, as we discovered with the first altcoin. More recently, there was the arrival of bitcoin cash, which boldly eschewed professional graphic designers who could make an official logo that was robustly reusable (they tend to want payment in legacy fiat). So, if you reuse it on a white background, it appears to say “B Cash.”Just like that, 21 million more bitcoin cash(es). But don’t worry, we’re sure that everyone will resist the urge to create free money, especially businesses.We have Silicon Valley, after all, to vet the latest and greatest. There’s no way they’ll get disrupted?!ME: Why am I doing this book rubbish, I could just set up an ICO and…
WIFE: No.
ME: But it could be…
WIFE: No.Oh, you’re just focusing on the negative, you might say.What about all the positive change! The money dedicated to science! The discussion of World-Changing™ concepts! (Cut to pictures of Zimbabwe…)You’re right, there were smashing successes… The National Health Service in the U.K. took its first foray into the healthcare blockchain in May, when the WannaCry ransomware shut down emergency rooms across the country and introduced the British public to bitcoin.Bitcoin also had huge success killing off the last scraps of its legitimate merchant interest. Fortunately, sidechains and the Lightning Network will definitely solve bitcoin’s scaling problems in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018.Then my personal favorite, the New Inquiry’s Bail Bloc initiative actually asked people to mine monero for a bail bond charity, eventually posting an FAQ where they directly suggested you mooch electricity from your employer or school to mine.The logic here was truly innovative: Potentially commit a crime to … pay bail for people accused of committing crimes.

With that outlook, it might seem strange that he so bullishly invests in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies – emerging technologies typically accused of being “solutions searching for a problem.”But Altucher thinks that claim is nonsense.In his eyes, cryptocurrency solves a host of problems caused by the fiat-based financial system – particularly, the fees and time it takes to send international payments.Today, every international payment must pass through a network of local banks, central banks and international wire services, taking seven or eight hops to get to their destination, and with every hop involving fees, potential errors, threats to privacy and other security risks, Altucher said.And these are the kinds of problems cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are solutions for. Even with banks and financial incumbents looking for ways to utilize private blockchain technologies, Altucher is a big believer in cryptocurrency’s potential to take over the roles of financial intermediaries like banks.Because while technology may be shrinking the economic world, the current payment systems provided by banks are still stuck in the 20th century – a sentiment that continues to guide his bullish thesis on the space.According to Altucher, multiple cryptocurrencies are needed to solve the multiple problems inherent in finance and commerce today.While bitcoin could take the role of international payments from banks, he argues ethereum, and its native token, ether, are better suited to provide a cheap and easy way to escrow funds in the form of the platform’s more sophisticated self-executing smart contracts.But, though, Altucher is extremely bullish on the future of cryptocurrency as a whole, he’s surprisingly bearish on the majority of cryptocurrencies now trading. In fact, he estimates that 880 of the 900 or so cryptocurrencies in circulation will ultimately prove worthless.Altucher’s pessimism is entirely consistent with his thesis about problem solving. To him, most cryptocurrencies are not solving a clear problem. Although, he’s also open to taking the advice of experts and others that have done their homework.As an example of both strategies at work, Altucher cites his recent investment in Filecoin, a distributed storage network that recently sold tokens to institutional investors.Filecoin uses the contract management feature of ether and, according to Altucher, solves several key problems of centralized cloud storage companies — like Dropbox, Amazon and Google. Advocates of decentralized storage like Altucher believe decentralization will make storage more robust, permanent and available while decreasing the cost.And that could be a huge payoff:“Imagine the entire storage market suddenly becomes decentralized? That’s a huge $100 billion industry, potentially.”Altucher sees cryptocurrency (or “data currencies” as he’d prefer to call them) as the next step forward in the long progression of the global financial system. Each step forward solved problems that the previous system didn’t fix.For instance, gold solved many of the barter system’s problems by allowing people to price everything using the precious metal as a common currency. But, it’s neither safe nor practical to travel with sacks of gold bars, so paper currency replaced gold.And then paper currency became “more electric,” Altucher said.Banks can track how much money we have by using accounts tied to debit and credit card numbers, and by virtualizing money this way, business is even easier to transact than it was using paper currency.This transition, according to Altucher, has profoundly philosophical roots, and won’t end until all transactions and currencies become totally data driven.Referencing the work of writer Yuval Noah Harari, Altucher believes we’re in the process of moving from theism, via humanism, to “data-ism.”That might be a lot of mystical “isms” for an investor to swallow, but Altucher makes the philosophy a lot more practical with a metaphor: If you got sick in the old days, you prayed to god to fix your health problems; then you went to a doctor to fix your illness; and now you go to data to fix your health.“You get an MRI. You get an EEG. The data figures out what your illness is,” he said, continuing:“If you look at every industry it all boils down to that same trend.”And, according to Altucher, that trend is very much alive with currency today, where we’re moving from “In God We Trust” to the more data-driven “In Cryptography We Trust.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Protocol Labs and invested in the Filecoin pre-salePortrait photo via James Altucher"

a ...","Nov 14, 2017 at 09:00 UTC",Marc Hochstein is the managing editor of CoinDesk and the former editor-in-chief of financial industry publication American Banker.,"The following opinion piece originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.Every once in a while, it’s useful to revisit the core value propositions of cryptocurrencies.One of the most underappreciated, at least outside of the technology’s inner circles, is the fact that bitcoin and the like can give individuals a greater degree of financial autonomy.The reason it’s underappreciated, I suspect, is that like privacy, autonomy is one of those qualities no one cherishes – until it’s gone.Stepping back, “be your own bank” is a favorite slogan of the early cryptocurrency adopters. This baffles bitcoin skeptics, and understandably so.Key management is a fussy business, nerve-racking and all too easy to screw up. Some digital currency doubters say it’s simply beyond the skill set of the average consumer.There’s a whiff of paternalism in that claim, though. After all, people still cook for themselves (an activity that involves knives, fire and sometimes animal bacteria!) and drive their own cars (for now); how much harder can it really be to make up a random string of words and keep it a secret?Then again, why would anyone want to bother with paper wallets or mnemonic recovery phrases when they can just store their money at a bank, a business that specializes in safekeeping? Here in the U.S., your balance is insured up $250,000 by the FDIC in the event the institution fails.You might even earn some paltry rate of interest on your money, along with peace of mind unimaginable at a bitcoin exchange. (Don’t worry, the banker probably won’t set up an unauthorized account in your name to hit a sales quota.)From this narrow perspective, being your own bank looks like way more trouble than it’s worth.But let’s zoom out the lens a bit.Consider the slow but steady erosion of due process and property rights in the Land of the Free through policies such as civil asset forfeiture (in which law enforcement can seize assets from citizens suspected of committing a crime, whether or not they have been convicted or even charged).Next, consider the lack of constitutional protections to begin with in many other countries. Finally, layer on top of these unsettling realities the worldwide gradual phasing out of physical cash, which at least you can put in your socks.All of a sudden, those trusted, regulated financial institutions start to look like potential back doors.In this light, the mere option of being your own bank, for at least a portion of your wealth, starts to sound a little bit more appealing.Inb4 the strawmen: I am not claiming that cryptocurrency users are “above the law.” An individual who refuses to give up his private keys under court order can still be thrown in jail.The point is that the government has to throw that person in jail, or perhaps beat him with the proverbial rubber hose, to get him to comply. It can’t unilaterally seize his funds.A defiant crypto holder might borrow a slogan from the late actor and gun-rights advocate Charlton Heston…In this way, cryptocurrency claws back a modicum of power for the individual.The historical significance of this innovation – self-sovereign money – was explained beautifully in a blog post by Nathan Cook, a bitcoin user in Tel Aviv.In a post, first published two years ago, he wrote:“An owner of bitcoin no longer has the problem faced by the owner of any other transferable asset: ‘will my property rights be respected?’ Holders of bitcoin own it in virtue of material facts independent of their social relations. The world may turn its back on bitcoin, yea, its value may fall to fractions of a cent, but those who own it, will own it regardless.”Just to be clear: this is hardly a reason to empty your checking account or 401(k) and put it all down on crypto (another strawman I encounter frequently on social media).But it’s a damn good reason to be thankful bitcoin exists in the world.Skeleton hand image via Shutterstock"

For this reason, BDL has banned the use of this currency in the Lebanese market.Elsewhere, he dismissed the cryptocurrency as “unregulated,” while reportedly referring to the technology as a threat to current payment systems.However, Salame was bullish on the idea that money will eventually be digitized.“We understand that electronic currency will play a prominent role in the future. But BDL must first make the necessary arrangement before taking this step and develop [a] protection system from cybercrime,” he said.No further details nor timeline were reported, and as such, it’s possible that Banque du Liban will use other forms of technology to create a centralized digital currency.Such an option has been pursued in countries like Ecuador and Sweden, though other countries, such as China, are exploring the use of blockchain.Still, more details should be forthcoming about Lebanon’s plans, that is if a proposed timeline is any indication.According to the report, Salameh said the digital currency will “be available in the next few years.”Image: Banque Du Liban"

Last month, the country’s financial regulator also took a notable move in cracking down on activities around the ICO funding model.During the legislative session, Lee also acknowledged that the central bank could do more on research around both cryptocurrencies as well as blockchain more generally.“We also refer to a lot of virtual currency research conducted in countries like Sweden.

At press time, a bitcoin is worth over $15,000, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.The meteoric gains have prompted many figures in the financial industry to speak out, calling the bitcoin market a bubble.

As a result of the release, a now larger community of developers can play around with and build on top of the code.For example, using Altcoin Exchange’s tech, developers can lock ether tokens in an ethereum smart contract that specifies the funds will only be sent if an equal amount of bitcoin is sent to a bitcoin address during a specific time window.At a high level, that’s how the developer team at Altcoin Exchange executed the trade (the ethereum code for the transfer can be viewed on the ethereum block explorer Etherscan), which shows how 0.12345 ether was traded for 0.12345 bitcoin.But while that might seem experimental or complex, developers instead see the milestone as another step toward the tangible goal of replacing centralized cryptocurrency exchanges with the ability to swap assets directly between blockchains.Long theorized, the idea of atomic swaps has been around since at least 2013, but it’s seen a burst of new activity of late, with developers testing the technique to trade bitcoin for litecoin and bitcoin for zcash.Still, it’s important to note the technology is in its early stages.This means there are practical reasons atomic swaps might not be viable today, including the fact that one-to-one bitcoin-to-ether exchanges aren’t exactly fair trades given the price disparity between the assets.To this, Altcoin Exchange CEO Andrew Gazdecki told CoinDesk that the team set up the demonstration this way for “testing purposes,” though the likely next step will be to trade bitcoin to ether for their respective U.S. dollar amounts or another fiat currency equivalent.Further, though Gazdecki believes this marks a “milestone” for atomic swaps, he admitted developers still have plenty of problems to iron out before this new type of trade sees everyday use.As such, he framed today’s release as a small step toward a better alternative, adding:“Decentralized trading is the next step forward in this industry.”Two-way sign image via Shutterstock"

In this ...","Nov 8, 2017 at 02:30 UTC","Edan Yago is CEO and founder of Epiphyte, a startup performing FX funds settlement on the bitcoin blockchain for financial institutions. ","In this opinion piece, Yago discusses one of the biggest theoretical attacks against bitcoin, and why he believes an upcoming software change fits its definition. Follow Edan Yago on Twitter.In bitcoin’s Necronomicon of possible attacks and weaknesses, one reigns supreme – the 51% attack.If there is a fear that has played on people’s minds as the end-of-days scenario for bitcoin, it is this. Attackers who hold more than 50% of hashing power could stop transactions from confirming and even reverse some transactions. They could undermine the whole project.Bitcoin’s design and its system of economic incentives has been set up specifically to combat the destructive potential of a 51% attack. And it has worked. The 51% attack has remained a hypothetical bogeyman. Until now.By all indication, a coordinated 51% attack will begin on, or around, Nov. 16. That’s when a consortium of miners representing substantially more than 50% of the network’s hashing power and an allied group of blockchain startups will seek to increase the block size.This will require a hard fork, which while controversial, is a legitimate desire. In itself, this is not an attack.However, the consortium‘s effort has evolved beyond a simple fork. It is now being developed not simply as an effort to fork the chain, but to do so in such a way as to deliberately prevent the continued existence of the status quo chain.Specifically, the developers involved have declined to introduce replay protection.The 2x fork will create a situation where transactions performed on one fork, can be “replayed” on the second fork. In effect, users will have funds on both blockchains, but any transaction they perform on one blockchain could lead to a loss of funds on the other blockchain.Replay protection is a fairly easy-to-implement method to protect users from this risk. Network attacks are those actions taken with the intention of disrupting the protocol’s normal functioning. The 2x change, bereft of replay protection, causes massive disruption. This is by design.Without replay protection in place, a minority chain becomes less likely to survive.The preferred outcome for the consortium is that the status quo chain ceases to exist, that its transactions fail to confirm.This is the literal definition of a 51% attack. If it sounds a bit bizarre to call the consortium’s effort an attack, that’s because it is. The consortium comprises many real supporters of bitcoin, acting in what they believe is good faith. They don’t mean to be attacking bitcoin.However, without replay protection their efforts are like an autoimmune disease, having become overzealous and perverted.So, bitcoin is finally coming to come face-to-face with the mother of all attacks. This is a watershed moment. The very worst outcomes are bad indeed.Transactions could grind to a halt, faith in the system could be lost, bitcoin and by extension, the entire blockchain world could prove to be far more vulnerable to attack than we hoped.However, there is also another possible, even more likely, outcome.Bitcoin could prove resilient to the consortium’s attack and emerge battered but unbroken. In so doing, bitcoin will have proven itself resilient to even its greatest foe.It is hard to overstate how important this will be to bitcoin’s perceived reliability. Bitcoin has always been haunted by the risk that its rules might come to be dictated by special interest groups or hostile, state-sponsored parties.This risk is never going completely away, but instead of the risk being a hypothetical bogeyman, it will become a much more prosaic thing: a successfully managed risk.The 51% attack is bitcoin’s boss level. I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that we are now at the end of the beginning. If we successfully overcome this coming challenge, bitcoin will no longer be just an experiment, it will be a fact.But don’t expect less drama — we are now entering bitcoin’s adolescence.HODL on tight, things will get hairy.Disagree? Have your say on the Segwit2x debate.

its new focus on using cryptocurrency to power a social network.","Oct 30, 2017 at 23:59 UTC","21 Inc, once a maker of bitcoin mining hardware, is rebranding to emphasize its new focus on using cryptocurrency to power a social network.","Effective today, the startup has changed its name to Earn.com to drive home the message users can get paid for answering emails and completing tasks, according to a company blog post. The rechristened startup also confirmed it’s on track to issue a token that would replace bitcoin as the currency it uses to incentivize people to join the network by the year’s end.Separately, the company notified customers last week that it had discontinued support for the Bitcoin Computer. The pocket-sized mining device, which initially retailed for $400, was once 21’s flagship product.Taken together, the moves underscore how far one of the best-funded startups in the blockchain space has moved from its roots.In an interview with CoinDesk, CEO Balaji Srinivasan said the new name gives people “an easier way to understand the purpose of the company.” He described Earn.com as “the first commercial social network,” combining elements of LinkedIn and Amazon’s Mechanical Turk.The advantage for users over popular social media platforms like Twitter, he said, is simple:“You’re not just wasting time, you’re making money.”Specifically, users can make money in several ways, according to the company.They can create a public profile for receiving paid messages; join lists of people with similar skills (e.g. Python programmers) to receive “microtasks” such as completing surveys; or set up an autoreply on their email encouraging senders they don’t know to pay for responses (with a whitelist, so real acquaintances can be spared the request for money).As for the senders of mass emails, who aren’t used to paying for the privilege, Earn.com claims they can get much higher response rates when recipients have a monetary incentive to write back.According to the post, offering $1 for the recipient to read and answer an email yields response rates over 30 percent within 24 hours, and $10 gets response rates over 70 percent – crushing the low-single-digit performance typical of cold emails. Senders pay only if they get a response.Stepping back, 21 raised $116 million from a group of prominent investors in multiple rounds revealed two years ago, when it was still squarely in the hardware space. The valuation reflected 21’s early success in bitcoin mining, but that business has since grown more competitive, and Srinivasan (a board partner at VC firm Andreessen Horowitz who joined 21 as CEO in 2015) has been steering the company toward a software model.According to Srinivasan, the company has plenty of capital left, and fundraising is not the purpose of the upcoming token issuance.“It’s not an ICO,” he said emphatically. Tokens will be exchanged for “labor,” not capital, he explained.Rather, the Earn.com token launch is meant to encourage users to join the network sooner. Users earn tokens just by signing up for the platform and getting verified, and the token reward for doing so will be cut in half each time Earn.com’s user base doubles. (After receiving that reward for joining, users will be able to earn additional tokens by answering emails or doing tasks, the way they earn bitcoin currently.)To give the asset scarcity, no tokens will be created after the launch, and supply is capped at 21 million, of which 54 percent will be reserved for users, according to the firm. Another 30 percent will be allocated to Earn.com employees and backers, and the remaining 16 percent will go to outside researchers and developers.Aside from their function as an internal currency to compensate users for their work, the tokens will also serve as an API key for programmatic purchases, according to Srinivasan. And since they are ERC-20 tokens, they will be eligible for listing on exchanges, giving users a way to cash out, including in bitcoin.In addition to being the company’s first day as Earn.com, Friday marked the “end of life” for server-side support of the Bitcoin Computer, 21 command line interface (CLI) and API marketplace, according to the email sent to customers last week.Despite the wind-down, the email deemed the hardware product a success – because, it said, one of the tutorials published when 21 released the device grew into the current get-paid-to-answer-emails application.“Going forward, we’re going to be putting all our energy into that product and the corresponding token launch … because we think the ability to earn digital currency by replying to emails and completing tasks will be one of the most useful applications of the blockchain,” the note said.Image via Earn.com "

With most savings accounts returning zero these days – as central banks conduct what Ravikant called their “grand money printing experiment” – the general public is looking for alternative places to store their money and watch it grow.Bitcoin and other protocols seem to offer that, as even the less-developed cryptocurrencies are showing substantial returns.“I think people are looking to solve their money problems,” he said.Yet at the same time, he warned that some of the cryptocurrency industry has been overhyped. In particular, Ravikant believes the market puts way too much faith in the concept of decentralization.“One indicator we are in a very frothy environment is we have a lot of tokens trading at very high values that are junk,” he said, without specifically naming any. “Right now, I think the market isn’t distinguishing quality.”Having said that though, Ravikant concluded that the cryptocurrency economy is here to stay.In fact, he gave the audience some insight into what cryptocurrencies he’s interested in. These include bitcoin, for storing value; zcash, for transacting easily; basecoin, to act as a stable unit of account; and tezzies, to access the Tezos smart contract platform.“I think we’ll see a lot more of the money use cases realized,” he predicted, adding:“If you can redefine what money is, that’s a trillion-dollar outcome.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Zcash Company, the for-profit entity that develops the zcash protocol. Naval Ravikant photo by Brady Dale for CoinDesk "

Shortly after users did so, however, the cryptocurrency holdings in their wallets were sent to different addresses.At least $30,000 in ethereum, $72,000 in litecoin, $107,000 in bitcoin gold and more than $3 million in bitcoin were confiscated, according to self-reported numbers verified by CoinDesk.In an interview, victims blamed the association of the website with the official bitcoin gold project as a source of the effectiveness of the operation.One of the victims, Mikel Martin, explained to CoinDesk:“I reached this site by following the link at [the] bitcoingold.org official website so I trusted it. Yesterday afternoon I noticed both my BTC and BTG stored in that wallet were gone.”Before the thefts became apparent, the team behind bitcoin gold – an effort to create a new version of bitcoin that would restrict the types of hardware that can be used for mining – promoted mybtgwallet.com on their Twitter account, assuring users that it was safe to use on multiple occasions.The person behind the service was, to an extent, ingratiated in the nascent BTG community, including its Slack channel. The website was developed by a user named John Dass, though it is unclear whether this is the developer’s actual name or a pseudonym.Further, the Bitcoin Gold website also included a balance checking tool based on code that was shared on GitHub on their website for a brief period of time, though the window only asked for a wallet address and included a disclaimer that users shouldn’t share private keys. The Bitcoin Gold team has clarified that the malicious code itself was never present on their official website.Yet once the thefts became apparent, the news quickly spread.An analysis of the site’s code by Reddit user Uejji four days ago found that the site stored the recovery keys, which were later sent to the site’s owner. The site claimed to be open-source, but all of the source code was changed on GitHub after the scam was initiated, said Torsten Sandor, a spokesperson for Exodus, a digital wallet whose users lost funds in the scam.Some of the victims of the scam used this wallet, which allowed the company to put together how the scam operated for one of their users, he said.“The user gave his recovery seed to the site and his wallet emptied,” he told CoinDesk, adding:“This only happened with bitcoin gold. It’s a very interesting fork … I think it’s extremely unfortunate that new investors, people who know little about crypto, started buying into it.”Representatives from the bitcoin gold say they’re moving to figure out a remedy to the situation.After first being made aware of the scam, the launched an internal investigation, according to spokesperson Edward Iskra. In a published statement, Bitcoin Gold developers said they were “working with security experts to get to the bottom of this issue,” but did not clarify who these experts were.Iskra told CoinDesk that, initially, John Dass claimed innocence during this investigation.“The investigation increasingly indicated that the original developer, ‘John Dass,’ was responsible for the fraud all along … He has dropped out of touch with us, as well,” he said.While Dass was in the bitcoin gold Slack channel with a “developer” tag, he was not a part of the project’s formal team, Iskra said.There was “no formal relationship at all. He did interact with our devs in the Slack regarding developing his open-source code [and] his web site,” he told CoinDesk. “The BTG Twitter account was simply supporting an individual in the community who was supporting BTG – that was their sole intent, at the time.”The Bitcoin Gold team will make a further announcement about their investigation within the next few days, Iskra said.Mybtgwallet image via Nikhilesh De / CoinDesk; Car with boot via ShutterstockCorrection: A previous version of this article inaccurately indicated that the fraudulent BTG wallet was embedded on their official website.

time, ...","Oct 12, 2017 at 13:00 UTC",Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative. ,"In this opinion piece, one of a weekly series of columns, Casey argues that bitcoin’s appeal as an investment could diminish its effectiveness as a currency and calls for testing alternative cryptocurrency models. Bitcoin traders like to say their best trading strategy is not to buy and hold, but to buy and “HODL” – hold on for dear life.For the umpteenth time, it’s paying off. Bitcoin’s price has rebounded from a sharp drop in September, overcoming a bout of wild volatility that would scare off even the most seasoned Wall Street trader from other markets. Despite a slew of unambiguously negative news, from China shutting down bitcoin exchanges to a looming fork in the cryptocurrency’s code that threatens chaos and acrimony in the community, here we are again with a new all-time high of  over $5,200 set today and quite possibly more ahead.I see two core reasons why bitcoin commands such value – no doubt to the bafflement of people like JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon.One is somewhat tautological, and that is the fact that bitcoin exists at all, that it seemingly cannot die. As if to confirm the HODLers’ worldview, circumstances like those of the past two months tend to test, and ultimately prove, the contention that bitcoin’s decentralized design can resist any effort to shut it down, whether from outside or within its community of users.That’s what’s valuable about it. The more bitcoin shrugs off attacks, the more it highlights its core value as an immutable currency of the people.The second pillar beneath bitcoin’s value is its scarcity. Although bitcoin will keep generating new coins until its total supply reaches 21 million in 2140, the protocol has front-loaded that distribution such that 80 percent of those are already in users’ hands. That petered-out distribution function will keep bitcoin scarce into the future.There is, however, a paradox here: this scarcity feature could actually undermine bitcoin’s appeal as a currency.In its aspirations to fulfill the three functions of money – a store of value, a medium of exchange and a unit of account – bitcoin could be cursed by success. The built-in scarcity, up against expectations for growing demand for an immutable financial instrument, has created an awesome store of value for the decentralized, digital economy of the 21st century.Bitcoin is in this narrow sense is a much better, highly liquid, digital version of gold. But so long as all these HODLers keep coins out of circulation, there won’t be enough of them around for people to use it to buy goods and services.Yes, payment processor BitPay is reporting a surge in transactions, but such gains come off a very low base. The vast majority of bitcoin transactions aren’t commercial in nature, and a number of merchants that experimented with bitcoin in 2014 and 2015 have since stopped accepting it.As a portion of global commerce, bitcoin is a pipsqueak.This particular failure is likely to continue even if one or both of the two sides sparring over how to scale bitcoin’s transaction throughput succeed in their goal, whether through on- or off-chain solutions. Fast, low-fee transactions won’t entice people to part with their bitcoin if they perceive that it’s more valuable to hold it. In keeping with Gresham’s Law that “bad money drives out good,” they’ll instead transact in an inferior currency. Such as the dollar.Of course, any decent, functioning currency must be somewhat scarce in order to hold its value; no one wants to accept Venezuelan bolivars right now. But as many economists often point out, neither should a currency be overly appealing as a store of value. If too many people hoard the currency, too little gets into circulation as a medium of exchange, which in turn makes it less likely to be quoted as a unit of account.This theory suggests that an ideal monetary policy includes a small amount of inflationary expectation. It’s why most central banks formally target a 2 percent inflation rate, signaling that they intend to find a balance between too much and too little monetary expansion. The problem is that many of them fail to achieve that goal and end up debasing the currency, in the form of excessive inflation like Venezuela’s, or create harmful deflation, as with Argentina’s currency peg in 1991. Perhaps there’s a better, automated way to optimize monetary policy so that people both save and spend their currency – ideally with a cryptocurrency that no one can shut down.Of course, it’s virtually impossible to imagine bitcoin’s algorithm ever being altered to increase its supply. Users, miners and businesses would never agree to such a diminishment in its value proposition.It’s fair to say we’d never have bitcoin – and the broader field of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology – if Satoshi Nakamoto hadn’t built in a scarcity feature to bootstrap demand for it. But now that the precedent has been set, developers of altcoins have an opportunity to experiment.That’s what’s happening at the MIT Media Lab’s Digital Currency Initiative, where I am a senior advisor. The DCI has launched K320, an experimental cryptocurrency that’s the first application of the cryptokernel blockchain toolkit developed by researcher James Lovejoy.K320 starts out with a bitcoin-like frontloaded release schedule for its first eight years, but then slots into a steady increase of 3.2 percent every year after that. It’s modeled on Milton Friedman’s “k-percent rule,” which posits that money supply should be increased by a fixed rate annually, regardless of the state of the economy.The 3.2 percent number is a best-guess attempt to establish a rate of increase that’s high enough above the common 2 percent central bank inflation target to create sufficient expectations of depleting value for people to use the coin ­­­– but not so high that it encourages them to dump it.But we can only know by testing it. It might be that a more dynamic model is needed, one in which, for instance, money supply is adjusted automatically, based on a digitally verifiable measure of the velocity of transactions. What’s needed is new field of crypto-economic experiments.Whatever the results of these studies, I don’t think bitcoin investors have anything to fear. In the long run, bitcoin’s immutability, in-built scarcity and political neutrality give it the potential to become a kind of global reserve currency for the masses – a digitally native backstop that everyone owns, much as countries hold dollar reserves as a form of national insurance.Still, the real promise of cryptocurrencies is that they let us overhaul our broken monetary and payment systems, making them less oppressive, more efficient and accessible to all. We need a unit of value that people will readily exchange with each other.And for that, a heavily HODLed, deflationary asset just won’t cut it.Rusty bitcoin image via Shutterstock"

Included in the study, however, is a segment on cryptocurrencies, which notably states that criminals who launder funds through trading operations are using bitcoin, particularly firms based in China.The DEA wrote:“…many China-based firms manufacturing goods used in [trade-based money laundering] schemes now prefer to accept bitcoin. Bitcoin is widely popular in China because it can be used to anonymously transfer value overseas, circumventing China’s capital controls.”The claim aside, the report doesn’t contain any specific figures on how much money is being laundered through this means. But it does detail efforts to obtain bitcoin holdings through regulated exchanges, stating that China-based groups prefer using the cryptocurrency in an effort to bypass capital controls.Elsewhere in that section, the paper’s authors argue that over-the-counter (OTC) bitcoin brokers are helping to facilitate these cross-border transactions – a trend they write will continue.“The increasing use of OTC bitcoin brokers, who are capable of transferring millions of dollars in bitcoin across international borders, as part of a capital flight scheme is expected to continue to intertwine criminal money laundering networks with capital flight,” the report states.Image via Shutterstock"

instruments and currencies that central bankers are allowed to trade.","Dec 17, 2017 at 13:30 UTC","Eugene Etsebeth is a former central banker with the South African Reserve Bank. There, he notably chaired the virtual currency and distributed ledger working group.","The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2017 in Review.Behind closed doors, G7 central banks are sluggish traders that buy and sell the same foreign currencies, marketable securities, special drawing rights (SDR) and gold day in and day out.Central bank traders follow the investment policy enforced by the executive committees with specific asset allocation targets. In order of importance, the objective for foreign reserves trading generally is liquidity, security and returns (in last place).Currently, the G7 is only concerned with the “appropriate regulation” of cryptocurrencies and not with the asset class potential of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, ether and zcash are nowhere to be found on the list of eligible instruments and currencies that central bankers are allowed to trade.In 2018, things will be different. G7 central banks will start buying cryptocurrencies to bolster their foreign reserves.The times they are a-changin’.One of the core functions of a central bank is to manage their nation-state, or union’s, official gold and foreign exchange reserves.Reserves are integral to ensuring that a nation-state can service its foreign exchange liabilities and maintain confidence in its monetary and exchange rate policies. Overall, the financial stability that comes from hording gold and foreign reserves has historically protected the economic well-being of citizens in the event of external shocks.Gold is commonly held because it is used as protection against black swan economic events. It can be used as a buffer against calamity because of its high liquidity, currency attributes and its diversification benefits.Foreign exchange is also highly liquid and has diversification benefits (compared to a central bank’s own currency). Foreign exchange is mainly accumulated through buying of foreign exchange in the spot market, conducting money market swaps in foreign exchange for investing and domestic liquidity management in term and call deposit accounts with foreign banks.The G7 countries are interconnected through a lattice of political, financial and trade agreements.This club of countries hold massive reserves of each other’s currencies – called foreign exchange reserves. Most of these countries also hold vast warehouses of gold reserves. Canada is the exception, as they recently liquidated all of their gold.The G7 central banks normally also hold special drawing rights (SDR) and marketable securities denominated in foreign currencies like government bonds, corporate bonds treasury bills, corporate equities and foreign currency loans.The SDR needs special mention. It is an international reserve asset, created by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to supplement its member countries’ official reserves.The SDR’s value is based on five major currencies – the basket includes: US dollar, euro, Chinese renminbi (RMB), Japanese yen and British pound sterling. RMB has only recently (Oct. 1, 2016) broken the monopoly of G7 currencies that make up the SDR.It is important to note that the SDR is still heavily weighted to the G7 currencies.In a nutshell, the G7 countries mostly hold each other’s currencies as foreign reserves whether it be through the SDR or directly. Gold is mostly accepted as the common standard of universal value.A turning point for G7 central banks will be when the bitcoin market capitalization exceeds the value of all SDR’s that have been created and allocated to members (approximately $291 billion).The real flippening: $17,600 when #bitcoin becomes the biggest international currency in market cap. #IMFSDR— Datavetaren (@Datavetaren) November 29, 2017Another tipping point will be the realisation that the values of G7 currencies are devaluing against cryptocurrencies. The SDR and G7 country currencies will be forced to alter their foreign reserve weightings and eventually include a basket of cryptocurrencies.The prescient Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, has already warned central banks about cryptocurrency causing massive disruptions.Foreign exchange reserves are used to back a nation’s domestic currency. Fiat currencies are pieces of paper or coinage that inherently do not have value. If anything the currency is backed by the shared belief of participants in a country’s currency scheme. When a central bank from a G7 country like Japan purchases foreign exchange reserves of the United States (US dollars) the shared belief of the U.S. dollar advertently becomes shared with the Japanese people.In 2018, G7 central banks will witness bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies becoming the biggest international currency by market capitalization. This event, together with the global nature of cryptocurrencies with 24/7 trading access, will make it intuitive to own cryptocurrencies as they become a de-facto investment as part of a central banks investment tranche.Cryptocurrencies will also fulfil a new requirement as digital gold.Furthermore, foreign reserves are used to facilitate international trade. This means holding reserves in a trading partner’s currency makes trading simpler. In 2018, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin will be utilized for international trade on a moderate basis because the high returns as an investment will encourage a ‘hold’ strategy for G7 countries.Foreign reserves are also used as monetary policy tool. Central banks may pursue the option to sell and buy foreign exchange currencies to control exchange rates. In 2018, central banks will start realising that monetary policy for a global market in cryptocurrency is not achievable.Foreign reserves are additionally used as a hedge against its own economy. Countries whose economies are dependent on export products may use foreign currency as a buffer should the exports or value of their currency drop.G7 central banks will purchase cryptocurrencies as a hedge to the performance of their economy.As the realisation of the systemic weakness of fiat currencies becomes apparent contrasted with the groundswell of cryptocurrency, the executive committee of central banks, including governors, presidents and chairpersons – will call emergency meetings to exercise their prerogative to deviate from the current investment policy for reserves management.Bitcoin and other select cryptocurrencies will be added to the list of eligible securities and currencies. Central bank money will pour into cryptocurrencies.Most G7 central banks will likely use external fund managers to invest in cryptocurrencies over this new epoch. But don’t expect this information to be freely available.This will happen in the dark. Old habits die hard.Too bullish for you? CoinDesk is accepting submissions to its 2017 in Review.

Hard to ignore,” Snowden replied, “Agree.”He continued:“Zcash’s privacy tech makes it the most interesting Bitcoin alternative. Bitcoin is great, but “if it’s not private, it’s not safe.'”Snowden is a prominent privacy advocate and is most well known for his massive leak of classified NSA documents in 2013. Asked for his thoughts on monero, a competing private currency, Snowden said it was “amateur crypto” and pointed to traceability issues within the tech.Snowden said that such design errors could put fellow whistleblowers at risk, stating: “Mistakes happen and have huge consequences for people like me.”The statements fed into the existing rivalry between the competing currencies. In the resulting flood of Twitter responses, Monero developer Richard Spagni strongly defended his project’s technology, while the creator of litecoin, Charlie Lee, stated: “I own Monero but not Zcash”.Zcash and monero are both geared towards providing privacy for their users, but use different tools to – arguably it seems – achieve the same end result.While zcash is based on a cryptographic operation called zk-snarks, monero works by obfuscating information with ring signatures and stealth addresses.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Zcash Company, the for-profit entity supporting zcash’s development.Snowden posters image via Shutterstock"

Originally set for a public launch on Nov. 1, the project is backed by LightningASIC, a seller of mining hardware based in Hong Kong, as well as a community of relatively unknown developers.As reported by CoinDesk, the idea behind bitcoin gold is to keep most properties of the protocol, but restrict the use of specialized chips for mining, or the process by which new transactions are added to a blockchain (while also creating new tokens as a reward).It’s also the latest example of a “airdropped” cryptocurrency that will distribute new coins to anyone who owned bitcoin at the time of the split, or up until the date the ledger of transactions started to differ.Yet in a move criticized by some observers, the team behind bitcoin gold has been mining blocks in insolation since the new network was formally created last month, with a certain amount of coins being set aside to support development.In comments, the team behind the effort sought to send a signal of confidence to the market, perhaps owing to concerns circulating around the effort.“We are extremely grateful for the community around the world who have been contributing hash power to our testnets; besides patiently testing their own mining process, they allow exchanges, pools, wallet developers, and all other service operators to implement and test their support of BTG so that the bitcoin gold community can have a full suite of services at launch time,” the project’s backers said in a statement.In the days ahead, exchanges will no doubt be watching the launch.

Published on business security website Cipher Brief, the report details an unintended and perhaps sobering consequence of bitcoin’s skyrocketing price.Fanusie told CoinDesk:“If you care about cryptocurrency gaining adoption, you can’t close your eyes to illicit actors trying to use it. If they’re going to use it we need to look at this as a society and a government to understand what it means.”Most interestingly, though, may be that rather than any cloak-and-dagger investigative techniques, Fanusie instead gathered his intelligence from online websites.Specifically, the information was pulled directly from propaganda sites for both the extremist group Al Queda and its rival, the Islamic State (IS), as well as a jihadist website monitoring group and an Israeli research institute that keeps tabs on this type of web activity.In the research, patterns also emerged. For example, after the bitcoin addresses associated with the fundraising campaigns were posted to public-facing websites, they were then promoted using Facebook and Telegram. According to the report, both of the social media sites eventually blocked the related users, but that didn’t keep new accounts from quickly popping up.While most of the bitcoin addresses failed to receive any funds, the most successful received a bitcoin donation worth about $685, used to build a camp in Syria and provide reinforcement.Shortly after the 0.0757 bitcoin was donated to the still-active campaign, the cryptocurrency (worth about $1,389) was moved to a separate account. Other fundraising activities included more mundane efforts such as website hosting. As of Dec, 19, Fanusie has confirmed to CoinDesk the funds had still not been spent.“In general,” Fanusie told CoinDesk, “it appears these campaigns have not been very successful, for the most part, of course every cent matters.”The United Nations last year estimated that the number of casualties in the Syrian civil war alone — not counting other engagements involving ISIS and Al Qaeda — is now upwards of 400,000 people.And while the total amount raised is minimal, a notable aspect of the report is what appears to be the increasing sophistication of the campaigns seeking bitcoin funds.In one case, first reported by the Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center based in Israel, a website identified by Fanusie as being “pro-IS” appears to have initiated its fundraising campaign using bitcoin processing site CoinGate.While CoinGate told CoinDesk the user was “blocked…prior to publication of this case,” Fanusie said the website that originally posted it, Akhbar al-Muslimeen, has since generated as many as a dozen bitcoin addresses without the need of a bitcoin processor.From the report:“This shows some technical sophistication on the part of that site’s administrators, because they apparently have eliminated their dependence on digital currency exchange services. Also, because the site’s donation page generates a variety of bitcoin addresses where funds can be sent, instead of just one, it may be harder for outsiders to monitor donations.”In spite of this technical proficiency though, Fanusie hedged the overall sophistication of the operations.The pseudonymous nature of bitcoin means the technology doesn’t provide as much protection as the Islamist extremist organizations seem to believe. Still, going forward, Fanusie is concerned that could change.His report concludes with a warning that while cryptocurrency could help provide financial services to those unable to get a bank account, more advanced identity protection could even-further embolden terrorist fundraising efforts.“If anonymization gets more prevalent within cryptocurrencies, are we going to have a problem like we had with the iPhone encryption issue we had a couple of years ago?” Fanusie asked, concluding:“That’s the issue down the road that I’m most concerned about.”Bitcoin dominoes image via Shutterstock"

Trading volumes in BCH/KRW pair offered by Bithumb, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, have gone up by 42 percent in the last 24 hours.Driving the rise may be today’s news that a South Korean financial regulator has said it has “no plans” to regulate cryptocurrency trading.Meanwhile, the total trading volume for the last 24 hours is well above $4 billion, the highest since Nov. 13. A high volume rally indicates an active market, and that a rally is likely to be sustained.The price action analysis, too, suggests the rally could be extended in the near-term.The overbought nature of the relative strength index (RSI) could be responsible for the pullback from previous highs above $1,600.However, the 5-MA and 10-MA are curving up in favor of the bulls. On the daily chart, the moving averages (MA) are sloping upwards as well.The daily RSI, though close to the overbought territory, is well short of the highs seen in earlier this month.Korean kite image via Shutterstock"

Now, emerging from his latest chaotic period, he’s promoting the idea that the cryptocurrency needs to be taken back from central banks, governments and other powers that be.In his first interview about a new unnamed project – which he simply calls “the academy” – Taaki laid out his plan to convert an entire region in northern Syria to a bitcoin-based economy.While Taaki expects the project to take nearly 20 years to implement, he’s completed the first step, recruiting a team of five “revolutionary hackers,” who he describes as committed to ensuring bitcoin doesn’t fall victim to the same fates as other once-revolutionary technology movements.He told CoinDesk:“Bitcoin is now in that crucial balance where it can either find itself, like the other technology movements that have come before it, confined to irrelevance, or people can start to gather together to try to really, truly think about, on a social level, what bitcoin is really about.”The idea for the academy came from Taaki’s months on the front lines, fighting with a group of revolutionaries — the Rojava Kurds — who believe in direct democracy with little to no government. Financially cut off by embargoes against Syria and facing an inflating Syrian lira ($1 is worth over 500 lira), Taaki began to imagine how the cryptocurrency he had previously worked with could be used to connect the Rojava people in entirely new ways.Following a period he described as being dedicated to study (after his time in the Middle East, he spent about 10 months in England on house arrest), Taaki drew up a two-year plan for an entity based in Greece that was part hacker collective, part social engineering experiment and part school.Now with a small team assembled to work toward that vision, Taaki said his next step will be to expand it to as many as 20 individuals within the next eight months.As part of the early stage work, the academy intends to organize a series of educational events to lay the foundation for a “large-scale payment network” powered not by central banks or even the internet, but with a combination of Wi-Fi-enabled ESP 12 modules and counterfeit-proof paper wallets, which he hopes the academy will be able to develop.But while this might all sound radical, Taaki argues it’s actually the normal, everyday people that are living a lie.“What’s happened in recent years is technology has lost that big vision that it had before, and it has just sunk into now a lot of people escaping into a kind of dreamworld,” he said. “Bitcoin really comes at the end point, the tail end of that bigger political movement of the hackers, [but] even bitcoin is experiencing a lot of problems with a lack of vision.”Core to the academy’s ethos is a synthesis of various existing technology movements, including the free-software movement, the crypto-anarchist movement, the Anonymous movement and the pirate movement.But while the radical nature of Taaki’s different projects, this one being no exception, could seem anti-business in its calls for individual empowerment, Taaki is actually neither full-on iconoclast nor rabid anti-capitalist.For instance, crucial to a bitcoin-powered economy is the idea of open-source software, which powers not only all public blockchains, but also most permissioned blockchains too.He describes business-led contributions made to the open source community, such as IBM’s Fabric and Intel’s Sawtooth – both part of the Hyperledger blockchain consortium now – as “necessary for the success of free software and open source.”Central banks, though, he does have a beef with.In fact, Taaki is skeptical that central bank interest in the technology is anything more than a distraction from bitcoin’s potential to empower individuals, but understands they could offer stiff competition for his vision of large-scale adoption and day-to-day use of bitcoin.“We need to re-situate the economy back to something that’s connected to life and humanity,” he said. “And to people’s personal sense of fulfillment, and bitcoin … is a big tool that we use to challenge the power of central banks.”While challenging central banks is a ballsy move, Taaki is currently undertaking a roadshow of sorts in search of financial sponsors, partner organizations, more “revolutionary hackers” and an actual location within Greece for his academy.Most recently, the roadshow took him to a stage at the Breaking Bitcoin conference in France, where he revealed for the first time, what the academy is all about.During that talk, he said he wants to make bitcoin the “national currency of Rojava,” complete with a series of exchange shops where local bitcoin traders can buy vouchers for any number of products.The next stop for Taaki is to address the attendees at the M-0 conference in Zug, Switzerland, next month. Hosted by the ethereum-based Melonport asset management platform, the conference is geared toward portfolio managers, investors and lawyers looking to save costs by conducting trades on a blockchain.For a man who both embraces the power of business to help make his ideas a reality and has in a sense turned his back on traditional finance, such a venue is perhaps both fitting and alien to the programmer.“It’s not for money that I work,” he emphasized, concluding:“And the people that I surround myself with as well, they should be driven by working on their ideas, not for material gain in this life – because they want to leave something behind, put their image into the world, their ideas, their spirit.”Photo courtesy of Amir Taaki "

As of 3:00 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday, the exchange rate between Indian rupees and bitcoin was more than 470,000.As a result of its adoption, bitcoin usage may affect “the market value of other commodities,” according to the petition, which pleaded with the court for an “urgent direction” for the government to intervene.The petition noted that some countries are beginning to either regulate or ban bitcoin, citing China’s crackdown on exchanges and Russia’s attempts to block bitcoin websites.India has typically adopted a “wait-and-see” stance on cryptocurrencies, discussing their role in the world’s largest democracy but not taking concrete steps to regulate or prohibit them.In April, the government formed a committee to study cryptocurrencies and propose new regulations.Correction: An earlier headline on this article misdescribed the Indian Supreme Court’s action.

a messy process), Lightning essentially adds an extra layer to the tech ...","Dec 9, 2017 at 10:45 UTC","“What is bitcoin? Can I buy, like, pizza with it?”","Asked by sports blogger Dave Portnoy in his inaugural video as a bitcoin investor, the comment cuts to the core of a truism about the network: while it’s been billed as a “digital currency,” it’s actually not all that useful for payments today. In short, you’re very unlikely to stumble on a bodega that accepts it (should you even want to spend it).But that’s not to say that engineers aren’t working on addressing the issue.That’s why one of the most talked about technologies currently in development for bitcoin is the Lightning Network.Rather than updating bitcoin’s underlying software (which has proven to be a messy process), Lightning essentially adds an extra layer to the tech, one where transactions can be made more cheaply and quickly, but with, hypothetically, the same security backing of the blockchain.Proposed as far back as 2015, Lightning has progressed gradually over the years, migrating from white paper, to prototype, to more advanced prototype.It’s the most recent test, however, that has some looking forward to a not-so-distant future when users can at last transact via Lightning, putting to the test long-held assumptions and criticisms.As Jack Mallers, developer of Lightning desktop app Zapp, put it:“It’s fairly close to working to the point where the public can test with real money, but not necessarily at the point where people can operate a business on it quite yet.”What steps are left before Lightning is usable? Lightning engineers have some ideas.Though Lightning took a big step early this week, the engineers still need to release software with which real users can make real Lightning transactions. So, the first and most obvious step is to let Lightning out of the cage and to watch and see if users have any issues during this initial stage.“In the near future most problems will be about getting Lightning to work in practice,” Swiss university ETH Zürich researcher Conrad Burchert told CoinDesk.And, once Lightning’s up and running, engineers foresee other subtle technical challenges, such as getting the “network structure” right, Burchert said. Bad actors might be able to halt transactions, for example, or users might want more control over where their transactions are going.“Whenever you’re building a new financial protocol, you want to ensure it’s secure as possible, so we’re working on various security-related efforts,” said Elizabeth Stark, co-founder and CEO of Lightning Labs, one of a handful of startups dedicated solely to the technology.Mallers agreed that these technical hurdles need to be solved before Lightning can reach the mainstream.“All of that will need to get ironed out before I would advise a company to start to rely on the Lightning Network for business or money that they can’t afford to lose,” Mallers said, adding:“The only thing that could speed it up is more engineers.”Stark concurred, adding that despite the promise of the technology, there are astoundingly few developers working on it right now.“We need more hours in the day. … There are 10 or fewer full-time developers working across all implementations of Lightning. Getting more contributors and people building out the protocol would certainly help move things along,” she told CoinDesk.Another piece of the puzzle is making the Lightning apps easy to use.It’s promising that apps supporting Lightning as a payment method are already cropping up, but so far they’re pretty confusing to use. A lot of the wires are still popping out into view.Zap, a Lightning desktop app, requires users to configure their node and plug in its IP address, for example, a far cry from today’s money apps that hide these technical details from users.“That stuff will definitely be hidden one day,” said Mallers, envisioning that Zap will one day look closer to Venmo, an app for sending small amounts of money to friends. “Eventually peers on the network will just look like contacts on your phone.”Maller argues this is happening already.LND, the Lightning implementation most popular among app developers, for example, recently added a feature that automates creating a channel between the sender and receiver when users deposit money, “so that users don’t have to understand what all that means,” he said.That’s not to say he thinks it will happen right away, though.“Baby steps,” he continued. “Right now the Lightning Network still probably favors technical users. Slowly but surely we’ll abstract a lot of this stuff away, so it’s just about paying and receiving money.”“As far as Lightning Network changing the world – where I can wave my phone and pay for things and stuff will show up – I’d say it’ll take a year or two,” Mallers said.Then there’s the question: Will users actually want to use bitcoin? Even with faster, cheaper Lightning-like transactions in place?Bitcoin developer Alphonse Pace believes it could be a challenge for Lightning to achieve a “network effect,” where users have an incentive to use the technology because other people are using it.And, who will adopt it first?“It’s a chicken-and-egg problem,” said Pace. “Wallets will want people wanting to use it to support it, and people will want wallets to support using it.”Alex Bosworth, developer of Lightning apps HTLC.me and Yalls alluded to a similar problem.“There is somewhat of a bootstrapping issue. We need to have apps to encourage wallets and wallets to encourage apps,” said Bosworth.And, even if bitcoin transactions become faster and cheaper (because of Lightning) than familiar payment apps, such as Apple Pay, he thinks users will be cautious at first.“If you ask a normal person what they want to pay with, they would probably go with Apple Pay because that’s what they are used to,” he said.In conversation, Lightning developers expect to overcome these hurdles. But, again, they think it will take time.Although it might take time to iron out these issues, developers were mostly optimistic that Lightning would help achieve the dream of making bitcoin a usable payment system. Rome wasn’t built in a day, after all. And neither were computers or the internet, which each took decades to reach normal people.Mallers argued Lightning “will really change the way that we send money to each other on a day to day basis.” But he thinks the community might have unreal expectations for how long it will take engineers to achieve that.“[To these engineers,] I would hope you’d go ‘oh take your time, would you like any water?’ But the community seems to be like ‘Why’s it not here tomorrow?’ I think users over-estimated Lightning’s deadlines,” he said.Bosworth offered a similarly optimistic take: “[The Lightning Network] could be like the WWW was to email. It might take a while to grow, but the more it grows the better it will get.”He added that his dad, Adam Bosworth, led the tech team behind one of the first web browsers in 1995, just as the internet was finally making its way out of research laboratories to normal people.Bosworth said:“I remember that time as being pretty exciting because of all of the opportunities that were going to fall out of web browsers. This reminds me a lot of that.”Inert gas image via Shutterstock"

As the news service explained, this would constitute a first step toward pushing for a change in Japanese national law that would clear the runway for a bitcoin future.The disclosure came on Dec. 1 during a press conference held by CEO Shozo Ohta, during which he said that the exchange would seek to move quickly pending regulatory approval.Ohta said at the time:“Once the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act recognizes cryptocurrencies as financial products, we will list the futures as quickly as possible. To achieve that, we will launch this working group to study various aspects, including bitcoin’s present status, its outlook, and what form it will take root in Japan’s society.”That the exchange would move to even explore the launch of bitcoin futures is perhaps unsurprising, given the efforts of firms like CME Group and CBOE to create such products in the U.S. As previously reported, trading of CBOE’s future is expected to begin late Sunday, with CME commencing with their own roughly a week later.Disclosure: CME Group has an ownership stake in Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent company. Trading data image via Shutterstock"

growth initiatives for bitcoin and ether wallet startup Blockchain.","Dec 13, 2017 at 23:00 UTC",Elly Zhang is a London-based global marketing professional who leads Asia growth initiatives for bitcoin and ether wallet startup Blockchain.,"The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2017 in Review.This year has been pivotal for digital assets like bitcoin and ether, resulting in unprecedented price increases, capital investment and general awareness.But despite these successes, one of the fundamental properties of all cryptocurrencies – their decentralized nature – has been under attack in 2017.With this in mind, it’s worth remembering that a core value proposition of blockchains is that there is no one central intermediary or organization that controls them. Instead, these protocols are used to enable the network to come to a consensus on the validity of transactions and data.Bitcoin was the first digital payment system to function without a central repository, and the concept (fairly novel in 2009) is now widely accepted and becoming more ubiquitous. But the world’s first blockchain has evolved since its humble beginnings, and today there are variations on the original – most notably, bitcoin cash and bitcoin gold.Forks have become so prevalent one might call the model an initial fork offering (IFO).Not just bitcoin gold and bitcoin cash, but more bitcoin variations initiated by Chinese companies such as “super bitcoin,” “bitcoin diamond” and “bitcoin god” are on the way.And while all may be finding a market, it’s worth asking the question, are these networks delivering on the promise of the technology? And should consumers care?An argument can be made that the three cryptocurrency networks are all different in how well they encapsulate the vision of bitcoin as a decentralized network.But it’s worth noting, too, that decentralization is frequently achieved by market economics.When thinking about this, I’m reminded of the classic question asked by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1988:“I haven’t seen a single bread queue. Please take me to meet the person in charge of supplying bread to London. I must learn his secret.”In fact, there was no one in charge for supplying bread to the city of London, that’s why there were no queues.Though bitcoin was the first so-called “decentralized” product built on blockchain technology, there are arguments within the community as to whether it constitutes real “decentralization.”There are those who argue that the power and influence of the mining industry results in the network being more centralized than most people expected. To support this point of view, it’s valuable to revisit Satoshi Nakamoto’s email regarding the original design of bitcoin.He writes:“Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12 KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices. If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.”This email makes clear that Satoshi Nakamoto predicted that running network nodes would become the responsibility of a few mining pools or “specialists” rather than individual users.What’s less clear is what he would have made of the results of his plan.So far, it seems Satoshi’s original scaling proposal actually increases the power mining pools have in deciding the future of the network.We saw an example of that firsthand when China’s developers and miners tried to come up with a new solution to perceived network congestion – forking off to create bitcoin cash.Bitcoin cash is essentially a blockchain asset created using a software implementation called Bitcoin ABC. The software excluded a somewhat controversial code change called SegWit and has a block size of 8 MB, up from 1 MB on bitcoin. The new rules created a new network.Now, there is still some ongoing disagreement among the community as to whether bitcoin cash constitutes a hard fork of bitcoin or should be considered a separate “altcoin,” but we’ll save that for another time.Relevant for this conversation is the fact that 70% of bitcoin’s mining power belongs to China’s miners, and the fact is that these entities can easily join forces. Bitcoin Cash, I believe, is a prime example of that.Thanks to the support of BTC.com, BTC.Top, ViaBTC, AntPool (all of which have direct or dubious connections to Bitmain), it can be argued that bitcoin cash became a centralized commercial product controlled by China’s miners.With the increasing price of bitcoin cash as a backdrop, others followed the model.Another fork of bitcoin took place this fall, bitcoin gold, which sought to incorporate technology used by other cryptocurrenices designed to block factors that led to more centralized mining.Less is known about bitcoin gold, but according to its website:“Bitcoin gold decentralizes mining by adopting a PoW algorithm, Equihash, which cannot be run faster on the specialty equipment used for bitcoin mining (ASIC miners). This gives ordinary users a fair opportunity to mine with ubiquitous GPUs.”Efforts are underway already to create FPGA chip miner for zcash, though, and with progress here, it might only be a matter of time before they develop an ASIC chip. If that’s the case, then mining might again shift away from users back to traditional mining pools.To this possibility, we might ask, what was the point of the fork to begin with?One possible reason: since initial coin offerings (ICOs) are banned by the Chinese government, there is an appetite by Chinese-based crypto companies to develop new business models.Entering 2018, I believe it’s important that we answer key questions about this trend.These include whether forks of bitcoin might actually be weaker in providing consumers with decentralization, whether buyers want access to those properties or if “decentralization” is simply a buzzword and marketing ploy for all cryptocurrencies.Ultimately, time will tell whether bitcoin, bitcoin cash, or bitcoin gold becomes the most prevalent, but the great thing about an open market is that users get to decide what has the best value or utility.If the groups behind the scenes can’t offer more value than competitors, then their asset will struggle to survive.That said, I don’t expect to ever see full consensus across any of these crypto assets. As prices continue to rise, I suspect more external powers, whether they’re government, institutional or within the bitcoin community, to try and exert their influence and power.When the time comes, we may be thankful that we took the time to understand how to fulfill Satoshi’s vision in the way he wanted it to be, if not exactly how he expected it to be done.Disagree? CoinDesk is looking for submissions to its 2017 in Review series.

During the chat, he noted that he first got into bitcoin back when it was valued at around $13, thanks to a gift of a physical bitcoin he received.Casey notably argued that bitcoin meets the characteristics defined by the Greek philosopher Aristotle. Namely, that it is divisible, durable, convenient to use (in some circumstances) and consistent, according to Casey. At the same time, Casey returned to a belief that he previously held but now argues is wrong: that bitcoin has no “use value.”He explained in the interview.“If you have a million US dollars and nobody accepts them, they have no use in and of themselves. They’re just unsecured liabilities of a bankrupt government. Like a million Zimbabwe dollars. And a fiat currency is easily destroyed by its issuer. The things are burning matches. They have half-lives, like radioactive elements. And I said that was the problem with bitcoin. But I was wrong about that.”Going on to call bitcoin “an excellent transfer device” that sits outside of the traditional banking system, Casey said that his original argument against bitcoin’s use value was invalid.“So, this is the use value of bitcoin. It allows you to transfer something that is accepted as money outside of the banking system, and outside of fiat money currencies,” he said.However, Casey was less bullish on the long-term prospects of the cryptocurrency. He argued that while he believes that bitcoin meets the conditions to serve as a form of money, this state of affairs won’t last forever.“The bottom line, bitcoin passes the medium of exchange test for the moment and store of value test for the moment.

It does this by breaking that transaction into two parts, nicknamed the “stem” and the “fluff.” The “stem” is the single transaction itself, while the “fluff” is an obfuscation method that occurs after the fact.The proposal was originally opened up for scrutiny as a Bitcoin Improvement Protocol (BIP) back in June, but issues were discovered that ultimately delayed the project. As pointed out by Bitcoin Core contributor Greg Maxwell, various faults in Dandelion could lead to its deanonymization over time. Now, the Dandelion team has come forward to present a strategy for addressing those problems. An improved Dandelion BIP may still be a while away, though, according to those involved.“We have not yet completed a reference implementation, so this update does not include a new BIP. Instead, we’re just outlining the steps we plan to take before an updated BIP,” one of the developers, Giulia Fanti, said in an email.Dandelion seed image via Shutterstock"

Bitcoin is decentralized – in that many people help make the network function, and in choosing to run its software, users all agree to abide by the same rules to keep it operational.It’s these qualities that make the proposed change particularly divisive.Called Segwit2x, the plan calls for a very specific fork (or a change to bitcoin’s rules), one that would make certain rules valid that weren’t valid before. Specifically, Segwit2x would change the size of the blocks passed regularly around the network and stored in the blockchain from 1 MB to 2 MB.Some users think this is a good idea, others don’t.But to begin, it’s important to note how this fork differs from others. Coming on the heels of the bitcoin cash and bitcoin gold forks, bitcoin users might be accustomed to certain outcomes – ones that might not be guaranteed in the case of Segwit2x.With bitcoin cash and bitcoin gold, for example, bitcoin users could have paid little to no attention and it wouldn’t have impacted their transactions. If you held bitcoin on certain exchanges (or your own wallet), you received new cryptocurrency.This smooth outcome, however, isn’t guaranteed with Segwit2x. Complicating matters is that in many ways, Segwit2x sounds (and is) similar to other bitcoin forks.Like other recent forks, Segwit2x is:It’s the differences, however, that stand out this time around.First and foremost, whereas bitcoin cash developers appeared content to create a new blockchain (with new rules), Segwit2x’s goal is to keep all bitcoin’s existing users on one blockchain.In this way, Segwit2x could have different outcomes.These include:However, it’s the second outcome that might be of most concern to users, given it appears possible.The reason is that those who support the change, and those who do not, both appear to have support from different parts of the community. In short, while Segwit2x claims to have a super-majority of miners and exchanges, it can’t be said that 100% of network users support just one side.Segwit2x draws the most support from:They argue:Other groups oppose this thinking.They include:They argue:For now, it’s perhaps too early to say for sure. But with that in mind, we do have some indications given the mechanics of how Segwit2x has been coded.This is because:On paper, the plan boasts roughly 80% of the network’s miners as signatories, a group some believe is big enough to switch the majority the network over to the Segwit2x chain, and quickly (for fear of being left on an unprofitable software).The reasoning here goes like this – the Segwit2x chain will quickly accumulate the most mining power, making the original bitcoin unprofitable (or unmanagable) to mine, and ensuring a total migration.Yet, that’s not to say all these miners will eventually run the code.While more complex, the reasons why include:Also of importance here will be the perceived value of a Segwit2x cryptocurrency.Already, exchanges are experimenting by listing a version of the coin – one that lives only on their order books – as a way to test the value.At press time, the value of the new version of bitcoin was estimated at just over $1,000, double the price of bitcoin cash ($450) and much higher than bitcoin gold ($130).But while there remain many ifs, one thing we do know is the fork will occur on or around Nov. 16.However, an exact date can’t be pinned down. This is because the change will be enacted at a specific block (number 494,784), at which time miners will be able to run the new software.Still, those involved with the project are adamant that it is moving forward, with the project’s lead developer stating just last week that the updated code will be released based on the mid-November plan.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which helped organize the Segwit2x agreement.Broken chalk image via Shutterstock"

Celente predicted that such attacks can be expected to continue as long as bitcoin is around.He said in the interview:“[The] banks are going to continue to talk it down because it makes banking obsolete and the banksters obsolete.

We don’t know the [long-term], but the price shot up too quickly as we see it.”Looking beyond the speculative dynamics of the market, Celente said that cryptocurrencies are attracting attention because they offer an alternative to existing structures both financial and political.“What bitcoin also represents is the populist movements around the world.

But it is an entirely different matter for governments to allow large-scale anonymous payments, which would make it extremely difficult to collect taxes.”Rogoff famously advocated for phasing out large-denomination bills as a way to combat tax evasion and aid central banks in implementing monetary policies in his book “The Curse of Cash,” published this year, and struck similar notes in his op-ed.For example, he went on to suggest cryptocurrency is even more suited to illicit purposes than the proverbial briefcases full of banknotes.“Cash at least has bulk, unlike virtual currency,” he wrote.Rogoff also offered his disapproval for Japan’s recognition of bitcoin as a legal method of payment.While the government in the East Asian country has told cryptocurrency exchanges to identify customers and monitor transactions for suspicious activity, he argued that “global tax evaders” would likely attempt to acquire bitcoin anonymously and then launder it in Japan.Perhaps unsurprisingly given this take, he concluded by expressing his hope that other countries won’t follow Japan’s lead.“Carrying paper currency in and out of a country is a major cost for tax evaders and criminals; by embracing virtual currencies, Japan risks becoming a Switzerland-like tax haven – with the bank secrecy laws baked into the technology,” he wrote.Kenneth Rogoff image via CNBC/YouTube"

At its core, the idea proposes securing sidechains, designed to boost the functionality of bitcoin, by entering miners into a kind of lottery system.In this way, the proof-of-mainstake proposal aims to solve the issue of miner incentives by allowing traders to bet on a sidechain with real bitcoin, an incentive scheme similar to what’s being used in ethereum’s still-in-development proof-of-stake protocol, Casper. With proof-of-mainstake, miners would put coins aside on the bitcoin blockchain for the specific purpose of using outputs from those coins as a kind of lottery ticket. The winner of that lottery would then create a block and bribe miners to accept that block in the main bitcoin blockchain.The innovation claimed is that the proposal encourages miners to better maintain the sidechains, without discouraging or hindering their ability to compete for bitcoin’s lucrative rewards.The proposal follows years of discussion on a concept that, over time, has been proposed as a solution to nearly every perceived bitcoin problem, including privacy, scalability and governance. But while promising, the idea has struggled to come to life, mostly over the issue of how to incentivize miners to secure transactions on the alternative chains.Whether this new idea will be able to win favor from developers remains to be seen, however, given that it takes aim at drivechain, a well-regarded idea with an emerging developer community, the paper will likely add to the discussion.Watch interior via Shutterstock"

Equally, as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies gain more momentum, the launch signifies the growing recognition of cryptocurrency as a payments technology.Announced on Thursday, the API is currently being implemented in browsers including Google’s Chrome, Microsoft’s Edge, Apple’s Webkit, Mozilla’s Firefox, the Samsung Internet Browser and Facebook’s in-app browser. When activated, the Payment Request API will allow new payment information for bitcoin, ether and other more traditional online payment methods to be stored directly in the browser.Consumers will then be able to choose from a drop-down menu of available payment methods supported, a kind of expansion on the auto-fill feature already widely enabled at checkout.With that potential new functionality, Ian Jacobs, head of the W3C’s payments activity, said now is a good time for developers to start writing code for payment methods they’d like to see available.In an exclusive interview, Jacobs told CoinDesk:“This is a great opportunity for people to start writing blockchain-based payment method descriptions and to try to test the API. That’s sort of the period that we’re in, the test and interoperability development phase.”The API, and the W3C’s call for the “broad implementation” of it, is based on what the group sees as a way to offer consumers more payment options and merchants a more secure online checkout.As part of that growth, the WebKit browser engine that powers Safari and Apple’s app store earlier this month moved the status of its work from “under consideration” to “in development,” though other more advanced stages still lie ahead.“The specification has matured enough within the W3C process that we’ve moved from draft state to stable state,” said Jacobs, who added:“And that means, now we know what the API is going to do, and we are building test suites and working on browser interoperability so the implementations are secure and they behave the same way.”The W3C’s standardization efforts are notoriously slow moving, with work advancing from community groups to working groups, all of which can take years. This is one of the reasons cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have been hesitant to join the group’s ranks, even though the Tim Berners-Lee created consortium has a largely positive reputation.But, the process ahead isn’t as easy as it sounds.Jacobs compared the next steps to matchmaking, where merchants will need to integrate the API and pick which payment methods they want to accept. At this stage, customers will need to download the browser extension and signal what payment methods they use.In other words, merchants need to build websites that acknowledge the new payment methods, while users need to have wallets that “speak the protocol that we’re writing,” Jacobs said. “That’s how the ecosystem pieces together the merchant-side and the user-side.”The W3C is already working with third-party apps to integrate both distributed ledger solutions and non-credit card forms of payment into the API in a way that can be interpreted by merchants and consumers.“So, for example, you might identify a particular bitcoin payment method with a URL, and then people can distribute payment apps that declare their support for that payment method,” Jacobs said.The W3C has gotten more and more interested in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology over the years, hosting it’s first ever blockchain workshop in June last year.

Yet at the same time, they come amid a range of finance-related applications for the tech, particularly around capital markets.As reported by CoinDesk, Russia’s National Securities Depository (NSD) has just issued the first-ever live bond at $10 million using smart contracts and the open-source Hyperledger Fabric blockchain.

He also reportedly said that, to date, the central bank has not moved to offer licenses to any cryptocurrency businesses operating in the UAE.“Some nations have announced that they are not using bitcoin, and consequently its value sharply plummeted. In addition, it can be easily used in money laundering and in funding terror activities,” he was quoted as saying.Critical words aside, it’s not clear whether Al Mansouri’s words will turn into action.Back in February, the central bank chief said that there were no immediate plans to impose new restrictions on cryptocurrencies. However, Al Mansouri indicated that this was a subject that’s under study – echoing moves by a number of central banks worldwide – and that new regulations could be forthcoming.“This area is currently under review by the Central Bank and new regulations will be issued as appropriate,” Al Mansouri said in February.Last month, regional news sources reported that the institution’s work was nearing completion and that new rules remain a possibility.Dubai skyline image via Shutterstock"

The development dates back to August, growing out of an initial partnership that saw New York-based exchange startup Gemini (owned by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss) providing data to the Chicago-based CBOE.It’s a development that adds further fuel to efforts to create trading products tied to the cryptocurrency market. With a futures contract, two parties agree to trade an asset – in this case, bitcoin – at a predetermined time and price. Those involved in the agreement seek to make a profit on the difference between the quoted price and its actual value when the contract expires.Derivatives exchange operator CME Group is moving to launch its own product within weeks, and startups like LedgerX have been pursuing new markets for the exchange of such contracts.And although the exact listing date isn’t available, CBOE’s website had other points of interest related to the XBT listing, including the indication that both weekly and quarterly contracts will be available. The listed contract multiplier is 1 BTC, according to CBOE, and the settlements will be paid out in cash.In detailing the efforts to develop the product, CBOE’s Russel Rhoads wrote that readers may want to avoid trying to predict how futures prices will relate to today’s price, noting:“The question I am constantly hearing is, ‘How will the futures prices relate to spot bitcoin pricing,’ and the best (and most honest) answer I can give is, ‘I don’t know.’ … Personally I think the best strategy is to see what the market tells us when bitcoin futures are available for trading.”Rhoads also ran a comparison between the CBOE Volatility Index, its stock market volatility index and bitcoin’s degree of price fluctuation, finding that “they are pretty darn similar.”Disclosure: CME Group is an investor in Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent company. Image Credit: Ariel Bravy / Shutterstock.com"

But while the company isn’t exactly new, what it’s doing with share trading and cryptocurrencies is – and it seems to be generating success so far.Its app is the most-downloaded trading app in the UK, with the company now providing a full-blown trading operation, with markets in some 2,500 instruments, ranging from shares to commodities.In June this year, however, Trading 212 took a bold step in adding cryptocurrencies to the mix, helping it to attract a younger crowd – the millennials – broking industry incumbents are finding hard to reach. These are the consumers who grew up against the background of the 2008 financial crisis, and as a consequence, are inclined to see financial service companies as the bad guys.And while U.S. fintech startups Invstr and Kapitall are targeting the same demographic of 20-something financial cynics, they don’t yet have the “magic sauce” of crypto to sell on their shelves. For the likes of Trading 212, crypto is a way of further enhancing its appeal to new users.But the question is: just how effective has this push been?Nick Saunders, chief executive of Trading 212’s UK operation, won’t say for sure.In interview, Saunders was cagey about disclosing exact figures on how much crypto constitutes in terms of its overall business, although he described the contribution as “significant.”“We’d rather not share the exact numbers but it is [a few percent] of the combined volume generated by all exchanges, which is quite a lot for a single retail broker,” he said.Still, Saunders did suggest that Trading 212 is benefiting from the wave of new attention cryptocurrencies have received in 2017. After rising from under $10 billion at the start of the year, the total value of the combined market has risen to more than $170 billion.In short, it’s showing all the attributes of a hot market that’s generating returns.Saunders continued:“Clients numbers are always driven by volatility and the news. When the two combine and bitcoin price rises make headline news, this drives new clients to open accounts.”It doesn’t hurt that Trading 212’s app, honed for more mainstream tastes, is slick.The app includes a real-time chat facility in a link-up with TradeBird – a trading-focused social network set-up by Trading 212’s founders; accessible educational tools and regular cryptocurrencies analysis, which has all helped it to attract a growing audience.Even before it offered crypto, Trading 212 caught imaginations when it came up with a freemium model for share trading, in which customers get commission-free dealing for up to 10 trades a month, up to a maximum value of £10,000 per trade.The company estimates that 90% of its equity customers will pay nothing at all, with the 10% of high-rolling “whales” delivering its revenue stream.Perhaps propelling its growth among more seasoned cryptocurrency traders, though, is that it has also added a swath of available options from the asset class. Customers can deal not just in bitcoin and ether, the two largest cryptos by market cap, but in ripple, bitcoin cash, dash, monero and neo.Saunders revealed to CoinDesk that Trading 212 plans to add a further 14 currencies in November – ethereum classic, zcash, qtum, omisego, iota, eos, lisk, augur, cardano, waves, stratis, ark, steem and stratis.Apart from that, Saunders is pledging the app can “remove all the complexity and risk” of owning cryptocurrencies, which today often involves storing or managing a set of cryptographic keys (or trusting someone else to do so), by using contract for differences (CFDs).A type of financial instrument made to mirror an underlying asset, the use of the tool means that trading crypto on the platform does not involve buying the claims to those keys, as you would on a crypto exchange such as Bitfinex, the marker leader by volume.But, CFDs have a downside, too, in that trading isn’t yet available in the U.S.CDFs involve trading on margin, which has the effect of magnifying gains but also losses and is why the SEC has taken it upon itself to protect traders by banning CFDs.Still, Trading 212 has made other tweaks to its service to accommodate cryptocurrencies.For one, it has a Bitcoin Mini market that quotes a price one-tenth the value of bitcoin, which they believe makes opening a position much more manageable and possibly less scary. (Saunders says the average deal size for bitcoin is around £10,000.)As with fiat currency or share trading, stop losses can also be set so you get to sleep at night without worrying if the South Koreans are about to start selling bitcoin big time.Trading 212’s killer feature, though, is perhaps the fact that on its crypto markets you can “sell” coins as well as buy. This provides novice and experienced users alike with a way to “short” the market if they think prices are going to fall. As ever with trading, it’s all about the timing.Elsewhere, other CFD, spread betting and forex brokers have been getting in on the action.Avatrade.com and Trade.com are two forex brokers trying their hand at crypto. Another is InterTrader, which provides dealing in bitcoin and ether, and is currently giving away 1 ether to anyone opening a new account and trading a stake worth a minimum of €500.And then there’s UK spread-betting behemoth IG Group, which was the first to offer CFD and spread-betting bitcoin products. Shai Heffetz, managing director at InterTrader is a long-time bitcoin believer, stating: “There is no doubt virtual currencies are going to play a significant role in the future of the economy.”A new kid on the block is a trading app from startup Bux, positioning itself as a “millennial financial brand,” is trying to make headway by turning stock investing into a game with virtual trading, hoping to convert its young customer base to funding their accounts with real money.Of its 200,000 UK users, Bux claims 85,000 are now using real money. Its app, with a design look-and-feel that evokes the Grand Theft Auto video game, and judging from the stream showing what app users are trading, bitcoin is one of the more popular trades among its client base.Still, the likes of Coinbase notwithstanding, buying and securing your crypto is not seen as a straightforward matter by most ordinary folk.Yet, as interest in crypto grows, the new breed of trading apps from Trading 212 (and others) show there’s a big market for more familiar ways to gain exposure.Image via Trading212"

The firm has allegedly been trying to sell investment contracts in “dozens of Texas cities” by way of social media videos, dedicated websites, and advertisements on sites like Craigslist. It names two U.S.-based agents, Clifford Thomas of Maryland and Michael Rivera of California.According to a presentation dated April of this year and posted to LinkedIn, USI is centered around the sale of software for bitcoin mining and trading. The presentation includes claimed breakdowns of how much money in commissions would-be participants can make based on the number of referrals they generate.The Securities Board said that the company claimed to offer steady, daily returns – a structure reminiscent of high-yield investment plans that boast steady gains. Further, the solicitations reportedly encourage prospective investors to find others to buy in so that they can make money from “referrals.”The Securities Board wrote:“The agents’ websites claim the mining investment ‘derives its value from [USI-Tech’s] non-exclusive interest in a series of bitcoin mining contracts.’ They promise a daily return of 1%. The USI-Tech website says its bitcoin platform “consistently provides returns of up to 150% per year.” The returns do not depend on the value of bitcoin, according to the company.”According to the statement, those named in the cease-and-desist order were accused of violating Texas securities registration standards and failing to disclose the risks involved in bitcoin mining.“In addition to violating registration requirements, USI-Tech and the sales agents are violating State Securities Board rules by failing to disclose information investors would need to make an informed decision about whether to invest,” the agency added.The full cease-and-desist letter can be found below:Usi Tech Enf 17 Cdo 1753 by CoinDesk on ScribdTexas flag image via ShutterstockThis article has been updated with additional information about USI-Tech."

He received the Nobel Prize in Economics in October 2013.Yet speaking to the network, Shiller argued that it’s difficult to peg the fundamental price of bitcoin, remarking:“You just put an upper bound on [bitcoin] with the value of the world’s money supply. But that upper bound is awfully big. So it can be anywhere between zero and there.”That same sentiment was reflected in Shiller’s recent op-ed article for The New York Times, in which he wrote: “How can we even start estimating the fundamental value of bitcoin, with its astonishing market value of more than $275 billion? Any attempt will soon sound silly.”Bitcoin’s price has surged in value since the beginning the year, climbing from $800 last January to a new record of almost $20,000 this weekend, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.Shiller cited a phenomenon that may explain the reasons behind such a phenomenal market rally. According to neuroscientists, he said, our brains work differently when making choices in a stressful, ambiguous environment.“You might think people who are educated will transform the decision problem into something precise … But it doesn’t seem like the brain is doing that,” Shiller told CNBC.Robert Shiller image via WEF/Wikipedia"

But despite its new URL, the WEX website notably mirrors the old BTC-e website in design, functionality and trading pair options.Further, in a welcome message on its new website, WEX sought to differentiate itself from the BTC-e website, claiming that it is unrelated to that company. Despite having migrated over all the exchange’s former users, the platform claims the technical teams behind the exchanges are different.Adding to the claims is that the new website stated that it did not receive any funds from BTC-e, while at the same time alleging that it would abide by anti-money laundering and know-your-customer laws.In the welcome message:“We thank all ex-users of BTC-E for their patience at such a difficult moment for all of you guys. We on our part have spent a lot of efforts and energy to create a new platform for trade in the shortest time limits.”For the next three to seven business days, WEX will operate in a test-mode.

industry's ...","Nov 11, 2017 at 14:00 UTC","Charles Alovisetti is a senior associate and co-chair of the corporate department at Vicente Sederberg LLC, and works with legal cannabis businesses in the U.S.","In this opinion piece, Alovisetti warns such enterprises to be wary of using bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as a solution to the pot industry’s continued difficulty obtaining or keeping bank accounts (a familiar problem for blockchain startups.)One of the major challenges facing legal marijuana businesses is lack of consistent access to banking services. Many marijuana businesses do have banking accounts, but the sword of Damocles dangles above them, always threatening an unappealable termination of an account. Enter digital currencies, which promise an end run around a wary financial system. There is a great deal of excitement in the marijuana industry about the possibilities regarding bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But before the cannabis industry gets carried away with images of marijuana businesses sidestepping hostile federal banking regulators, we need to take a hard look at the future of digital currencies. One strategy that’s been pushed is for cannabis businesses to take an existing digital currency and simply use it as a method of transacting business to avoid the need to rely on banks. This way, marijuana companies without bank accounts could eliminate the need to operate in cash, instead accepting payment directly from customers or other businesses in digital currency – although converting digital currency into dollars will still require a bank account. Another possible use of digital currencies would be to develop a new token, often referred to as an app coin, protocol token, or altcoin, specifically for the marijuana industry. Again, the goal would be to reduce or eliminate the use of cash and integrate blockchain technology into the compliance and other needs of marijuana businesses. Finally, some business offer bitcoin-based payment processing services. These services allow customers to purchase bitcoin via a credit or debit card and then purchase a marijuana product with the recently acquired bitcoin. The store then converts the bitcoin back into dollars. The idea is to provide an alternative to traditional payment processing services and credit card companies that will not work with marijuana businesses.However, regulators present a real and present threat to cryptocurrencies as they currently exist; for example, recent Chinese regulatory restrictions have seen the closure of platforms allowing people to buy or sell tokens. And these threats become even more important for digital currencies servicing marijuana-related businesses (“MRBs” in the parlance of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or FinCEN).As longtime CoinDesk readers will recall, in March 2013, FinCEN published its initial guidance on virtual currencies. The agency defined three categories of participants: users, exchangers and administrators. A user is “a person that obtains virtual currency to purchase goods or services,” whereas an exchanger is “a person engaged as a business in the exchange of virtual currency for real currency, funds, or other virtual currency” and an administrator is “a person engaged as a business in issuing (putting into circulation) a virtual currency, and who has the authority to redeem (to withdraw from circulation) such virtual currency.”FinCEN concluded that, barring any specific exemption, exchangers and administrators are money service businesses (MSBs) and as such are subject to FinCEN registration and the framework of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), which was designed to aid FinCEN’s investigations of potential criminal activity. Subsequent administrative rulings have clarified that FinCEN considers digital currency exchanges, ATM operators, and payment processors to be exchangers within the agency’s tripartite framework.On the marijuana side of the equation, it is important to note that, while marijuana remains illegal federally, the industry in the U.S. exists in its current form because it is tolerated pursuant to federal policy, as set forth in the Cole Memo (put out by the Department of Justice on Aug. 29, 2013). The Cole Memo states that while marijuana remains illegal federally, federal law enforcement should not consider prosecution of state-legal marijuana businesses if those business do not implicate any of eight enumerated enforcement priorities (e.g. preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises and preventing state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or illegal activity). While it is unfair to associate all digital currency use with illicit activity, there is a perception, reinforced by certain bad actors, that digital currencies are being used to launder money, divert revenue to criminal enterprises and traffic illicit drugs. Any risk that a business could be seen as violating the Cole Memo priorities needs to be treated extremely seriously as it could provoke a federal law enforcement action.While the Cole Memo addressed violations of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), it was silent as to financial crimes that would inevitably result from the use or banking of proceeds of a federally illegal activity. In response to financial institutions’ concerns regarding accepting MRBs as clients, on Feb. 14, 2014, in two memos often referred to as the “Valentine’s Day Letters,” the Department of Justice and FinCEN each outlined their respective attitudes to money laundering concerns related to the violations of the CSA. The FinCEN memo contained detailed guidelines on how to provide banking services to an MRB while remaining compliant with the BSA. These guidelines included the obligation to file different types of suspicious activity reports (SARs) in response to activity on the part of an MRB. The new DOJ memo updated the earlier Cole Memo to extend the realm of non-priority violations to include provisions of the money laundering statutes, the unlicensed money remitter statute and the BSA triggered by underlying violations of the CSA. But the DOJ reiterated that any exercise of discretion regarding its resources was subject to the provision of services to an MRB whose activities do not trigger any of the eight priority factors. The DOJ also noted that following the FinCEN guidance was critical to remaining within the low enforcement priority category of the Cole Memo.Again, FinCEN has also made it clear BSA compliance obligations also apply to many businesses dealing in digital currencies – exchanges, ATM operators and payment processors are all required to register as MSBs. That means that to comply with the Cole Memo and FinCEN’s marijuana policy guidance, any digital currency business that is required to register as an MSB must make the required SAR reports outlined in the Feb. 14, 2014, FinCEN guidance.When it comes to marijuana firms using cryptocurrencies, discretion should remain the better part of valor. The marijuana industry in the U.S. exists solely due to permissive federal policies that require businesses to follow certain guidelines, including filings SARs with FinCEN. If these guidelines are not being followed to the letter, which is a challenging and sometimes onerous task, a business is no longer within the guidance of the Cole Memo and is at higher risk of facing federal law enforcement action. And even if these guidelines are religiously adhered to, while FinCEN-compliant use of digital currencies is not explicitly prohibited by federal policy, their use is sometimes linked by law enforcement with money laundering, illicit drug sales and other illegal activities. As these crimes are listed as prevention priorities in the Cole Memo, digital currency use could potentially provide an excuse for Attorney General Jeff Sessions (no fan of legal marijuana) to crack down on state-legal pot enterprises.Cannabis growing image by Shutterstock"

Those funds were gained as the US Marshals Service auctioned off more than 144,000 bitcoins confiscated during the crackdown on the Silk Road, an unregulated marketplace that used bitcoin as a primary medium of exchange prior to its closure in late 2013. Ulbricht had previously sought to regain possession of the funds after they had been seized.The US government held its first bitcoin auction in 2014, during which nearly 30,000 BTC was sold to Silicon Valley investor Tim Draper (who would later buy 2,000 BTC in a subsequent auction). The final auction was held in November 2015.Notably, the forfeited $48 million will count toward the more than $180 million in monetary judgments he was ordered to pay at sentencing. Ulbricht, found guilty in February 2015 on narcotics distribution and computer hacking charges, was sentenced to life in jail without parole in May of that year.“The sum of $48,238,116.04 shall be credited in partial satisfaction of the Money Judgment,” Forrest wrote in the court order.The forfeiture also comes months after Ulbricht’s failed appeal of the judgment. In May, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued a 139-page decision that rejected the claim by Ulbricht that he had been given an unfair trial as well as an overly harsh sentence.Image via Media"

anything they find a little dubious, or that they simply don't like, a 
“scam.”.","Nov 27, 2017 at 22:22 UTC",Marc Hochstein is the managing editor of CoinDesk and the former editor-in-chief of financial industry publication American Banker.,"The following opinion piece originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.As children, we all heard the story of the boy who cried wolf and learned that the moral was not to raise false alarms, or else no one will believe it when you report a real emergency.But there’s another, less obvious and more unsettling lesson of the fable. It’s the takeaway for the recipients of a distress call (the villagers in the story): Even if someone pulled your leg in the past about a supposed clear and present danger, there is still the possibility he might be dead serious this time. So if you write him off because of his track record, there’s a chance your sheep will be devoured.This is a big problem for anyone trying to simply make sense of the crypto space, much less make money in it.Bitcoiners, especially bitcoin maximalists, have a habit of calling anything they find a little dubious, or that they simply don’t like, a “scam.”It’s a serious charge – fraud is a crime, after all, punishable with jail time – but on Twitter and in crypto forums it gets thrown around like high school kids in the locker room calling each other dorks and losers. Though, to be fair, the “S” word is sometimes used in a way that’s unmistakably playful.In a footnote to his hilarious and thought-provoking 2014 essay “Everyone’s a Scammer,” Michael Goldstein of the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute writes, “‘scammer’ is a heuristic, not an accusation.”If you believe bitcoin is going to the moon, as Goldstein does, then a merchant who accepts it is a scammer, even if her alpaca socks are as warm and cozy as advertised, and a HODLer seeking to buy it off you is a scammer too, even if the fiat he’s offering in exchange is real.A scam, in this broad definition, is any attempt to part you from your bitcoin.Another way to think about this issue is that perhaps telling mom-and-pop investors “all altcoins and ICOs are scams” is the equivalent of telling kids that porcupines shoot their quills. It’s not literally true, but if they believe it, they’ll steer clear of a hazard and you’ll have done a mitzvah.In crypto, those hazards may include bad ideas pursued in earnest, good ideas poorly executed and outright scams. Some argue that the first two categories might as well be subsets of the third, for all practical purposes.That’s all well and good for the Wild West of crypto, but in civil society, the word “scam” implies an intent to deceive. Calling someone a scammer can damage that person’s reputation (unless, of course, the charge is leveled so often, at so many people, that no one gives it much weight anymore). Without solid evidence, the label is potentially defamatory.It’s possible to raise doubts about an idea or business model, or a team’s ability to execute on it, without jumping straight to fraud accusations. (Sometimes those lines of inquiry might eventually lead to the uncovering of fraud; one of the first articles poking holes in Enron’s facade merely suggested that the company’s business was overly complex and its stock overpriced, understatements in retrospect.)But a four-letter insult is the easiest way to make oneself heard in the shouting match of online conversation, which I suspect is another reason why it gets used so casually.Plus, if the CEO of the largest bank in the U.S. can call bitcoin a fraud, while his institution is building a private blockchain based on ethereum (a protocol that probably would never have existed without bitcoin), then why should anyone bother choosing their words carefully?Getting back to the villagers who ignored the shepherd boy, though, there are a lot of dodgy schemes in this space.Just this month, a startup raised $374,000 through an initial coin offering on ethereum, then disappeared, according to Vice. There’s a long list of stories like that.Often the first people to question the operators are the same ones using histrionic language on other topics. Which means that you can’t just shrug your shoulders and roll your eyes when the trolls cry “scam.” Sometimes they’re right.Sorting the signal from the noise may be harder in this industry than almost anywhere else.Lone wolf image via Shutterstock"

live onto the bitcoin blockchain, but proponents of the idea see it as a ...","Nov 16, 2017 at 09:02 UTC",Researchers are putting new effort into developing bitcoin’s Lightning Network.,"With the Segwit2x hard fork – which looked to increase the bitcoin block size parameter to 2MB – suspended, ETH Zurich researchers Conrad Burchert and Roger Wattenhofer and Blockstream engineer Christian Decker have proposed a more scalable version of the payments channel scheme, believed by developers to be the best way to expand bitcoin to accommodate more users.Sometimes called bitcoin’s “layer two,” Lightning hasn’t yet been pushed live onto the bitcoin blockchain, but proponents of the idea see it as a way to boost bitcoin’s transaction capacity without increasing the block size (as bitcoin cash, which forked off bitcoin in August did).In a new paper called “Scalable Funding of Bitcoin Micropayment Channel Networks,” however, the three developers now envision even another layer, one that would be sandwiched between the bitcoin blockchain and Lightning, which they think would overcome Lightning’s existing limits.Perhaps most notably, the researchers argue that limit is somewhat defined by the bitcoin blockchain itself, which, capped at 1MB, can’t support infinite Lightning channels. After all, users must complete bitcoin transactions and record them on the blockchain each time channels are opened and closed.In this way, Decker, pointing to existing research, suggests there’s an upward bound on just how many Lightning Network transactions are feasible today.He writes:“It turns out, it’s not that many. It’s a few million every week, which is still a long ways from serving the full Earth’s population.”And while this isn’t a problem right now, it could lead to issues in the future – scaling issues that continue to be a hot, and contentious topic in the crypto community.To understand what the new layer would provide, it’s helpful to compare the proposed layer to the way Lightning functions currently.Today, a user must open a new Lightning “channel” with another user through a regular blockchain transaction. Once that’s established, the two users can make as many off-blockchain transactions as they want or are able to with the initial amount of value they put into the channel.The new proposal, which Decker called “Lightning extended,” utilizes so-called “hook transactions” to move funds into a multi-party channel capable of supporting more than just two users. The paper calls this a “channel factory.”The method allows two people in a multi-party channel of say four or six, or as many as 15, to start a separate isolated channel within the main channel.While it sounds a bit complex, the mechanism allows the two users in the isolated channel to close that channel and be dropped back into the multi-party channel, where they could then open another isolated channel with someone else. And all this is done without going back to the blockchain and incurring the transaction fees associated.In this way, users could hypothetically open and close channels several times without ever making an on-chain transaction.“The only thing the blockchain needs to know in the end is where the money ends up. So, if we have many intermediate states, we don’t have to publish them ever. Instead, we just make a transaction that everyone signs. This is the only thing that goes to the blockchain,” Buchert, the lead author of the paper, explained.He continued, “It offers more flexibility, basically.”According to the authors, the channel factories will lead to reductions in cost, comparable to the number of people in the multi-party channel. For instance, a 100-person group would lead to a 90 percent reduction in costs, compared to 100 traditional payment channels, the paper explains.While the benefits seem attractive, the authors say there’s still a way to go before the project could see real-world use.For one, the developers said, the technology would perform better with if another long-proposed technology, Schnorr signatures, was added to bitcoin.Whereas channel factories are currently limited to groups of 15 people, with Schnorr signatures, users could open up groups of an unlimited size – scaling Lightning even further.Although there could be downsides to larger groups, in that one user could spoil the channel for everyone else by sending a transaction from the inside to the bitcoin blockchain. According to Burchert, developers and users will have to experiment to see how many members per group works in a real-world setting most effectively.Plus, with Lightning still in the testing phase, Burchert said that channel factories can’t jump to the front of the line.He told CoinDesk:“There are far more important things to work on right now, like getting the Lightning Network online. We’ll need [channel factory] technology when we have millions of channels, but we’re far from that right now.”And when that time comes, Decker said it can be integrated more easily because Lightning sits on top of the bitcoin protocol, and so shouldn’t give rise to much conflict when upgrading.“While we don’t plan to implement this right away, this could be a potential upgrade later on, without any disruption to the network,” Decker concluded.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blockstream.Lightning strike image via Shutterstock"

However, on a year-to-date basis, bitcoin is up almost 900 percent. It remains to be seen if bitcoin cash can surpass that benchmark before its first anniversary on Aug. 1, 2018.Bitcoin cash clocked a record high above $2,400 earlier this month. As of writing, it is changing hands at $1,600; down 3 percent in the last 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap.Meanwhile, bitcoin gold is less than a month old, but that didn’t stop it from recently leaping confidently into the rankings as the fifth largest cryptocurrency. However, as we discussed yesterday, bitcoin gold is finding little love in the investor community which has cited a lack of use cases, and looks currently to be overvalued.While prices have risen over the last week, BTG is now losing altitude as expected – nursing a 7 percent drop in the last 24 hours, and trading at $335 levels at press time.The chart analysis points to better days ahead for bitcoin cash, but paints a less glowing picture for bitcoin gold.The chart above shows:The cryptocurrency looks set to explore sub-$300 levels as discussed yesterday.

Lawmakers have previously stated that this was driven by the now-notorious collapse of local bitcoin exchange Mt Gox in 2014, which led to the loss of millions of dollars in customer funds.The news comes at a time of regulatory shifts in the broader cryptocurrency landscape.

Traders, it seems, are in no mood to take up big positions, as evidenced by the drop in the volumes.But, coinciding with this decline has been lack of substance in the bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate.After a rally from the September 15 low of $2,908, bears made their presence felt but were reluctant to push the digital currency back to $3,000 levels. The weak selling pressure helped BTC regain some poise, although gains are now being capped at the key downward sloping trend line hurdle.Since Friday, the BTC/USD exchange rate has been hovering in the narrow range of $3,600–$3,800. According to the CoinDesk BPI, the cryptocurrency has traded below $4,000 since September 14.While China could be blamed for the lack of price action, one must not forget that the cryptocurrency rally was overstretched. Thus, a healthy correction and the current pause may be a blessing in disguise.As per CoinMarketCap, bitcoin has added 2.2 percent in the last 24 hours, trading at $3,775 at press time. Week-on-week, bitcoin is down 7.92 percent and, for the month, the digital currency has lost 13.4 percent.The price action analysis suggests the cryptocurrency is chipping away at the key trend line resistance, where a violation would open doors for a revisit to $4,200–$4,300 levels.The trend line sloping downwards from the September 2 high and September 8 high is offering resistance around $3,830.– Price breaks above the trend line and prices riseSuch a move would add credence to last week’s bullish doji reversal and higher lows pattern, and may open the doors for $4,300.A doji candlestick forms when a security’s open and close are virtually equal and signals reversal, which depends on the follow through. In bitcoin’s case, Friday’s doji candle was followed by a positive price action on Saturday. Thus, a bullish doji reversal was confirmed.– Trendline hurdle holds and prices drop below Friday’s lowFailure at the trend line hurdle followed by a drop below $3,509 would signal a continuation of lower highs and lower lows pattern. This, coupled with the bearish daily relative strength index (RSI) would indicate a potential for a sell-off to $2,980 (September 15 low).Watch glasses image via Shutterstock"

It’s not unthinkable, according to the defunct bitcoin exchange’s controversial CEO.","In a blog post published yesterday, Mark Karpeles detailed possible avenues for reviving Mt Gox, the once-dominant Japanese bitcoin exchange that collapsed amid allegations of fraud and mismanagement in early 2014. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin – at then-current prices – were feared lost, though ultimately 202,000 BTC were retained as assets, under the custody of a trustee.In the aftermath, Mt Gox entered bankruptcy, and has since been at the center of an acrimonious, years-long claims process, including a $75 million claim from CoinLab. Prosecutors in Japan later charged Karpeles with embezzlement, with that trial beginning earlier this summer.The blog post also addressed a recent bone of contention: while the value of the remaining Gox BTC has swelled as bitcoin’s price has climbed to close to $8,000 per coin, those seeking to recoup their losses may ultimately collect much less, if anything.And while some are clamoring for that increase in value to be factored into the payouts, Karpeles pushed back on the idea in the blog post, stating that those gains haven’t actually been realized yet, among other complications (the bitcoins remain in the custody of the Mt Gox trustee).One possible avenue around the issue: reviving Mt Gox, with a price tag of $245 million. This could be accomplished either through a recapitalization by way of an equity sale or an ICO, according to Karpeles.He wrote:“Launch an ICO to raise money to hypothetically revive MtGox. This sounds more challenging, both legally and because there is no guarantee of raising enough to revive MtGox. In case there is not enough raised it could still be locked to be distributed to creditors, which would be better than nothing.”And in a seeming acknowledgement that the idea is rather far-fetched at present, Karpeles suggested that anyone interested in recapitalizing the exchange should get in touch.“Should anyone have 245 million USD sitting around and want to purchase MtGox, just drop me an email,” he wrote.Image via CoinDesk"

– ...","Sep 20, 2017 at 08:00 UTC",When the price of bitcoin plunges — as it did last week — seasoned investors are caught in a market that doesn’t exactly have the mechanisms they’re used to.,"Case in point, hedging long positions, is today a difficult prospect. Unlike most traditional stocks, where investors can open a margin account with their broker that allows them to short most shares, the tools in bitcoin are few and far between.Yet, while some see betting big on bitcoin as a gamble in and of itself, a new casino-like exchange type is filling the gap for those seeking to bet – or otherwise prepare for – the cryptocurrency’s drops.Enter parimutuel betting pools.Far from a familiar term, it’s nonetheless an important one should traders want to know what they’re buying into. In simple terms, parimutuel pools are a way of speculating on the future price of cryptocurrencies without actually owning the coins themselves.Or as Lanre Sarumi, CEO of Level Trading Field, which last month launched parimutuel pool Bitcoin Market Predictor, told CoinDesk:“Parimutuel [betting] is a group of people essentially predicting something, and the person with the most accurate prediction wins.”Yet, their structures can differ dramatically. One might look more like a cryptocurrency Powerball, while the other is an intense derivatives exchange touting triple-digit leverage.While their use for short exposure is a bit underdeveloped, more investors are participating in these pools – knowingly or not – to fill the gap.And if they’re not aware of the limitations and risks involved, they could end up surprised – after all, parimutuel betting isn’t the most sophisticated structure for providing short exposure.Lanre’s Bitcoin Market Predictor, what he calls a “game of skill,” is the latest evidence that parimutuel pools could add some cushion to the cryptocurrency market’s lack of shorting options.But while theoretically it gives users the ability to bet on bitcoin’s price dipping, the rules of the game are strict, allowing only groups of 10 to bet on the price of bitcoin only 60 minutes in the future. The three players with the most accurate predictions, whether the price is up or down, split the money from the group’s betting pool, so at $50 per player per round, the most an investor can make off their prediction is $225.Obviously, this presents problems for serious retail investors, since the price of bitcoin (which they might hold) could drop substantially, and all they’ve done is make $225 at most betting that it would.And if three other players predict closer to the actual price, an investor loses even the money they put in the pot.In this way, Level Trading Field’s parimutuel pool is less a sophisticated way to short bitcoin, and more an enticing platform for those interested in gambling, and only gambling on bitcoin.Still, the latter limitation could be especially important in today’s cryptocurrency market, since in early August all bitcoin investors got equal parts of another cryptocurrency, when a group of enthusiasts split from bitcoin’s blockchain creating bitcoin cash.After all, if free money is being given out to bitcoin holders, it isn’t exactly to the investors benefit to be caught in a limited short position.The bitcoin-only limitation carries over to the other end of the parimutuel betting pool spectrum with BitMEX’s full-blown derivatives exchange.The high-octane exchange is run by former Citigroup trader and ferocious bitcoin bull Arthur Hayes, who told CoinDesk its 100 times leverage was not only its differentiator, but its sex appeal. Traders come to BitMEX wanting to place high-powered bets with very little money down. But, clear that kind of colossal leverage isn’t without risk.Parimutuel betting means that one trader’s gains are offset by another trader’s losses — so every dollar you win is offset by a dollar someone else in the parimutuel pool has lost – which creates what Hayes calls “moral hazard.”And that hazard means if your trades are crushing it on BitMEX, there might not be enough equity in the system to pay out your winning bets.In a way, it’s like breaking the bank at a casino. If the market makes huge moves too fast, traders with losing positions have those bets closed and sold. And without enough equity in the system to payout on the other side, traders with winning positions will also be closed out early, in essence capping the returns they can get.To Hayes’s credit, he’s incredibly upfront and transparent about it:“If you want 100x leverage – which obviously you do, because that’s why you’re here – you accept that we at BitMEX can’t put our balance sheet on the line to settle these contracts.”Yet, still, candid or not, this risk doesn’t allow traders to get a foolproof short opportunity.In this way, the market – however mature it’s becoming – is still struggling to offer investors refined mechanisms as they prepare for another possible plunge.Deck of cards image via Shutterstock"

Rather, bitcoin “feeds on itself,” he said.His comments followed similar remarks in recent months by JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who called bitcoin a fraud, and Warren Buffet, the billionaire investor, who said bitcoin is experiencing “a real bubble.”“What’s more – it is also used by criminals, for their shady business. I think that more and more countries will start to make cryptocurrency exchanges illegal like China did. New regulations will be adopted. So, this will find its end,” Roubini added.Roubini’s comments come as bitcoin’s price has been setting new records, surging as high as $7,879.06 today on the news that the Segwit2X hard fork had been called off.Yet Roubini is not new to bashing the world’s first cryptocurrency.

These entities must be met with “iron fist governance,” according to the news agency, which also praised authorities’ “zero tolerance” to the financial risks and illicit activities.The article follows a statement by authorities in early September, which prohibited the sale of blockchain tokens as a method of fundraising. In the following month, a number of exchanges, citing the statement, announced they would voluntarily close their doors.Xinhua argued that, even following the crackdown, there are still many “regulatory vacuums” that authorities need to address, in part because of the global use of cryptocurrencies.Solutions suggested by the agency – which is often considered the voice of the government – include strengthening existing regulations and establishing a full regulatory framework for exchanges with specific requirements, such as a cap on large volume trading, ID verification, and know-your-customer and anti-money laundry procedures.Xinhua News Agency has previously written articles collecting instances of bitcoin fraud.Wolfie Zhao also contributed reportingNewspapers image via Shutterstock"

it, ...","Nov 30, 2017 at 02:00 UTC",Willy Woo sounds like a high stakes altcoin gambler.,"He’s often looking for insane 100x to even 1,000x gains, and he’s willing to stomach the kind of volatility that could wipe out three-quarters of his portfolio’s value over a couple of weeks.And while everyday investors might be bewildered by those concepts, it’s not too surprising for Woo, given his background.While now best known for his innovative philosophies on cryptocurrency, Woo got his start in the trading world buying derivatives during the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis — he started shorting bank stocks right before the banks collapsed. And that experience gave Woo a pretty solid understanding of how to trade markets when they’re at their most volatile.Plus, with a background coding as a teenager, it’s no wonder Woo was drawn to cryptocurrency.It was right around the time bitcoin hit the $1 billion mark that Woo got interested in crypto, shortly after moving to Bali, where, as he describes it, he “went down the rabbit hole.”While his first foray – much like other investors just getting in – was bitcoin, he’s since changed his tune, deciding the real action is in altcoins (alternative cryptocurrencies).“My particular portfolio is very, very high gain, high risk. It’s highly volatile,” said Woo.But, even still, he’s got a pile of data to back up those risks as the right decision.“Under the data that I have is that most coins when they launch that are successful, they create a particular graph,” he said, pointing to the Falcon 9 rocket launches as a visual. “The photos show the rocket launching up with this steep trajectory and then it levels off and continues moving steadily up.” Although, looking for those breakouts comes with some gnarly lows, too.But to Woo, “We’re not trading here. We’re investing. We’re going to put it in a drawer like a venture capitalist does.”For him, investing in cryptocurrency isn’t about short-term trading gains, but about longer-term investments. Because of this, Woo primarily focuses his attention on the “early launch” of cryptocurrencies, where the trajectories are steepest, hoping to get the 10x to 100x trajectory that some of the best coins have had during their initial run.Woo believes that chasing those kinds of returns will be far more lucrative in the long run than the “boring” 300 percent to 400 percent annualized returns that bitcoin is now generating.And then, once the coins mature – typically rising to the range of around half a billion dollars – that’s when he starts looking to exit.But even without that investment thesis, Woo has data that shows considerable returns even if you’re just investing blindly in all altcoins.Woo told CoinDesk:“Even if you weren’t filtering the shit out of and buying everything under the sun when they launched – all 700 or so coins – even the scam coins, actually it’s near a 50/50 split where 50 percent was underperforming bitcoin, but around 50 percent was outperforming bitcoin.”But it’s the data behind Woo’s investments that would make most crypto investors salivate, as his strategy takes inspiration from an even deeper set of calculations than just market cap.For instance, Woo is a serious consumer of blockchain explorers like Blockchain.info, using stats like mempool, connection rate, trade volume and miner income to judge the health of a network.With that in front of him, he then visualizes the data and looks for patterns to emerge.Woo typically works in metaphors and analogies, looking for ways to compare the cryptocurrency to other things. For instance, he might ask himself: if bitcoin fulfills a similar role to PayPal – facilitating digital payments – what are the metrics one can use to measure bitcoin’s potential?Woo has been searching for a key benchmark ratio for cryptocurrency for some time, one that will provide the same kind of insight that the price to earnings ratio (P/E) provides for equities. While an investor can analyze the market capitalization of a coin as the price, the key second component, the earnings, isn’t available in the cryptocurrency space.The next closest proxy, according to Woo, is sales – or, in the case of PayPal or bitcoin, the total value of the transactions that ride on their networks.“I treated that as the closest thing we’ve got to a price to earnings [ratio],” Woo said.By using that kind of P/E, he continued:“You can just start to look at it to see if it’s valid. Does the valuation track the transaction going through it? Once you understand that data, you can look to see where it’s pumped and where it’s dumped in the past.”While that’s a good starting point, Woo doesn’t stop there – not when there are other data points that can be mixed and matched, creating new ratios and new data metrics, looking for the golden ticket that will allow him to predict with more certainty how to invest.“I’m just trying weird stuff, here’s some data here, what if I messed with it in this way?” he said.All that data crunching has left Woo focused primarily on cryptocurrencies as protocols.According to Woo, nearly all of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are protocols or the decentralized infrastructure that decentralized applications can be built on top of.“For the first time, we can invest in these protocol stacks and any app that’s built on them, you get a [kind of] cut,” said Woo, adding:“You can buy the real estate in which people plant down their businesses.”And with that thinking, Woo doesn’t worry much about investing in applications. In his mind, the applications that ride on blockchain protocols are starting to look more and more like Silicon Valley startups – where nearly 10,000 launch per year and only a handful succeed, with only one becoming a unicorn like Facebook.That, he thinks, is a much more speculative play, than investing in the base-layer protocol cryptocurrencies.This risk also keeps Woo away from most initial coin offerings (ICOs) as well, a not often heard strategy in today’s crypto space. But instead of long-term investments, Woo sees most application specific tokens as merely “FOMO-nomic” (playing off the acronym “fear of missing out”) hype.Plus, as more and more token sales offer privileged buy deals, those investments become even higher risk and even more work.So for Woo, it’s all about the long-term “HODLing” pattern with tokens that provide the rails for application train cars.And sure it takes some initial due diligence – Woo advocates researching the founders and advisers to see whether any big names are willing to put their reputation on the line for the project, as well as spending time in related social channels and forums.But in the end, Woo’s philosophy after buying is simpler.He concluded:“Once you’ve done your due diligence, you pretty much sit on it for six months to two years and ride out the bumps.”Image via Willy Woo"

Casey is chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor of blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.,"In this opinion piece, part of a weekly series of columns, Casey grapples with the inconsistencies of language in the world of blockchains and cryptocurrencies and tries to find a way to live with it all. You can measure how long someone has been into cryptocurrencies by how they use the word “blockchain.”My initiation came in the fall of 2013, when there was only one cryptocurrency worth talking about, which meant there was really only one blockchain. So, for me, the word had to come with the definite article: the blockchain.This was about a year and a half before “blockchain” became a generic reference carrying an indefinite article – a blockchain – and two years before it morphed into an uncountable noun: “blockchain” as a concept.  (Imagine someone saying “I’m interested in ledger” and you’ll understand why this drives some of us nuts. A blockchain is a tangible thing, not a practice, a process or a field of interest.)But thinking about the etymology of these words is more than just an academic exercise. It helps us understand the motives and interests that fuel subtle but important changes in meaning. For example, recognizing that detaching the word “bitcoin” from “blockchain” works to neuter the former helps us see how those most threatened by cryptocurrency are trying to shape the debate.By the same token (no pun intended), if you don’t understand why “blockchain,” expressed as an uncountable noun, means something different from “a blockchain” or “the [bitcoin] blockchain,” you could fall into a trap. It means you probably don’t understand the technology you’re dealing with and that someone could take advantage of you.So, when Christian Smith, a colleague from the MIT Media Lab, gave an impassioned speech last week condemning the widespread use of “the blockchain,” it irked me. Not only did he dis the definite-article form on which I’d cut my cryptocurrency teeth, he happily used the uncountable noun form. To be fair, he was speaking at the MIT Legal Forum on AI & Blockchain. Perhaps I have to accept this increasingly ubiquitous usage as an unavoidable fact of life? Like taxes.Still, Smith raised some good points. He rightly observed that there is now a plethora of distributed ledgers carrying the label “blockchain,” and thus that there is no monolithic single chain to which we all must adhere. And I fully share the disdain he expressed for that aggravating phrase, “just hash it and put it on the blockchain.”But to banish the definite article seemed to me to deny the word’s roots. I tend to view “the blockchain” as a nod to bitcoin’s catalytic role in fostering wider interest in “blockchain technology.” (Pro tip: if you want to talk about “blockchain” as a field of interest, use it as a modifier to a word like “technology”; it can also modify other words, like “pedant.”) We still say “the wheel” to talk about other the starting point of that world-changing invention, don’t we?Hardcore bitcoin enthusiasts, those who have been in the space from the beginning, sometimes scoff at the newfound ubiquity of the word “blockchain.”Back in the day, no one really thought of the blockchain as being especially significant, other than that it described the particular transaction recording system that bitcoin used, one that happened to be arranged into a cryptographically linked chain of blocks. “Blockchain” didn’t appear in Satoshi Nakamoto’s initial white paper. It has been suggested the first usage came from Satoshi’s early collaborator, Hal Finney, and even then in a less iconic, two-word construction – “block chain” – which Satoshi and others later picked up and used.Once blockchain explorers were created, allowing people to more easily search the ledger, the single word started to gain significance. No doubt, its growing popularity was helped by the fact that the most popular of those software tools belonged to the startup named Blockchain – typically expressed with its URL extension “.info” to distinguish it from the bitcoin ledger.  (One mark of the confusion around all this is now found in how Blockchain.info’s original logo is frequently used in slide decks by speakers seeking to illustrate a generic technology they call “blockchain.”)Dedicated bitcoin developers still don’t really talk about the blockchain as an isolated thing of any great importance. They view bitcoin as an all-encompassing technology, within which the chain-of-blocks ledger is just one part.  I personally think the blockchain deserves to be recognized on its own. It’s what gives bitcoin its immutable time-stamping capacity, allowing tricks like Julian Assange’s “proof of life” and it lets us forecast when each halving will occur. It also encapsulates the principle of the “longest chain” – contested as it may be – and, when the community is divided over a contentious hard fork proposal, as it was until recently, it’s the blockchain that literally manifests that division. Still, core devs have a point: it’s not entirely accurate to describe the blockchain, as many do, as the “technology underpinning bitcoin.”Things got confusing when Wall Street banks got interested in distributed ledgers. They used the phrase “blockchain without bitcoin,” which misleadingly suggested that blockchains were not only important but more important than cryptocurrencies – even though, without the latter, it was impossible to have the groundbreaking permissionless, fully censorship-resistant, record of transactions that bitcoin introduced.This new usage had a purpose, of course. It allowed the newcomers in suits to strip the technology of its most disruptive characteristic – the fact that no one could control it – and impose their own control over it. It was a subtle but powerful act of appropriation.Should we care about this? Well, yes, and no.As anyone with teenagers knows, language, especially English, is always evolving. And it needs to. Language imposes rules on social interaction. It constrains what we can and can’t do with expression. This helps us make sense of each other, but if the rules are overly inflexible, they limit our imagination and our capacity for innovation. There is a cultural zeitgeist underway in the “blockchain space,” a Cambrian explosion of ideas. We can do our part to try to steer the evolution of the language associated with that, but preventing change and new forms of expression is as difficult as stopping biological evolution.What we must demand is awareness of why we use the words we use and why others choose theirs. (I’ll begrudgingly accept “blockchain” as an uncountable noun if others will understand why my co-author Paul Vigna and I put “The Blockchain” into the title of our new book to acknowledge the technology’s bitcoin-rooted history.)With awareness hopefully comes consistency of usage. That’s vital if we are to develop this technology and its applications.  We need precision in communication if we are to come together and collaborate on the same ideas.If we are at least thinking, reading and educating ourselves about such matters, we can be more accepting of the fluidity of word usages. That way, we avoid the harmful, confining effects of political correctness for blockchain. (See what I just did there.)I only have one demand: don’t, whatever you do, start using “blockchain” as a verb.Pom pom image via Shutterstock"

Later going on to start several bitcoin ventures, he was also at the forefront of efforts to boost its regulatory compliance.","In this opinion piece, Waters reviews “How Money Got Free: Bitcoin and the Fight for the Future of Finance” (Oneworld Publications), arguing it captures the zeitgeist of the original cryptocurrency and the sprawling – all too human – movement that helped it reach the masses.I have long suspected, owing to its sheer brilliance and idiosyncratic beauty, that bitcoin was in fact brought here by aliens from another planet.Brian Patrick Eha’s vivid history of bitcoin, “How Money Got Free: Bitcoin and the Fight for the Future of Finance,” which captures in thrilling journalistic fashion what I experienced in my years working on this remarkable technology, only confirms my suspicions.I regret not recording what I saw and felt while working on bitcoin — the fleeting moments of intense joy and dismay that once seemed too meaningful ever to forget. But at the time, it was all I could do to keep up with the pace, and my life became a blur of 80-hour working weeks devoted to the engineering project of a lifetime.As the years passed, and the blockchain industry exploded, it seemed that these beautiful moments of intellectual adventure would remain only as fading memories, slowly dimming as I aged.The idea that an author could capture the essence of that stirring time seemed impossible even in my most optimistic moments. Yet, just as I had initially done with bitcoin, I came to find in reading Eha’s book that I had underestimated once again.Eha starts at the beginning, sparing no detail.The era he eloquently describes was an alternate reality which brought together the brightest, hardest-working and most ideologically extreme individuals I have ever known. We shared common goals and an outsider camaraderie that only grew stronger as we made progress in the early years of bitcoin’s ascendance. Looking back, it’s sobering to realize that some of us were imprisoned or otherwise suffered as a result of the desire to improve and promote this new kind of money.For some of my fellow pioneers, the intensity of their ideological commitments became a prison in itself.Early bitcoiners collectively witnessed the radical dismantling of tribal and national affiliations, and the formation, in their place, of a new global citizenry. The birth of bitcoin and its blockchain was an important moment in human history – one whose legacy deserves to be documented.“How Money Got Free” is precisely what I was yearning to read.The fascinating detail and precise vocabulary of Eha’s writing provide a sense of closure for me personally. It feels cathartic to now possess a tome which records the visceral thrill of bitcoin’s rise, the earthshaking import of its innovations. As I read, I felt as though I were in the room witnessing the breakthroughs made by the first bitcoin pioneers.The truth is, I have crossed paths with many of the characters depicted in the book.Some of them were in close proximity to me for nearly a decade. Until now, I didn’t know why these people had joined the bitcoin community or how fate had guided us to share in this wonderful experiment. While I was busy working on cash remittance at BitInstant, I had very little insight into what others were working on in parallel. The challenges faced by Coinbase, Blockchain, BitPay, SecondMarket and others were just brief news headlines to me at the time, like billboards flashing past on the highway.I had little appreciation for the depth of their intensity or the richness of the stories behind those headlines – all of which is conveyed in full through Eha’s narrative.Consequently, “How Money Got Free” has changed my perspective on many of those people, some of whom I once thought of as competitors. What I’ve since learned is that we were all in the same boat, whatever our individual aims. Bitcoin itself is, in some sense, our parent organization, and its furtherance benefits us all.Eha interviewed me for his book, as he did many of my former colleagues and acquaintances. When I asked what had motivated him to write it, he said that he wanted to shine a light on the pioneers and preserve the history of bitcoin’s formative years. (His book, which is both a work of investigative journalism and a tremendous feat of storytelling, focuses mainly on the period from 2009–2015, though Eha also examines bitcoin’s precursors, and an epilogue brings his narrative almost to the present day.)The martyrs, explorers, creators, and pariahs who champion new technologies and advance society, Eha told me, are often overlooked or soon fall into obscurity. While every frontier has to be settled eventually, the lessons learned during the rough-and-tumble days are important – so that future projects are inoculated against failure by the hardships of the past.“How Money Got Free” transports readers to the meeting rooms, startup couches, conference halls, online discussion boards and proverbial watercoolers where the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry took shape. It guides readers through the history of bitcoin’s implementation and explains its potential for the future.Whether you are a bitcoin believer or a skeptic, Eha’s work will arm you with a deeper knowledge not only of the technology but of the human motives behind it. It is inspiring, evocative, and imbued with empathy for the dreamers – the “crazy ones,” as Eha puts it in the book’s dedication, echoing Steve Jobs – who move society forward.As the book makes clear, bitcoin would not be where is it today had it not been for all of the people who clicked on a link, who read an article, who discussed, built, argued and invested. Small in themselves, each of these actions shaped our future; they contributed to the momentum of where we are going.Naturally, our past informs our choice of what to write, what to click, with whom to argue and what to say.Just so, early bitcoiners tended to have philosophical or political reasons for being drawn to cryptocurrency, and Eha is splendid at delving into primary sources and tracing the wellsprings of these convictions.As we express ourselves through the use of these new technologies – the Internet, email, text messaging, social networks, blockchains – we stand to benefit from weighing the long-term implications of even our smallest interactions.It is crucial for us to recognize and reflect on the journeys made and efforts undertaken to bring us our current way of life. But while some figures loom larger than others, every person who participates in bitcoin, even conceptually, is taking an implied risk. It carries social, legal, and financial consequences regardless of success. That risk and the willingness to take it, in the interest of furthering humanity, is what binds us together.Eha’s book reminds me of something Faulkner once wrote: “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.”Even now, it informs our actions, and we need to understand it if we want to understand where we are going. “How Money Got Free” conveys the essence of bitcoin’s past – not preserved in amber but alive with color and controversy.For non-geeks, reading this book may be the first step toward acceptance of our inevitable future. It can serve as a permanent record for those who weren’t around to witness the events first-hand, and as an inspiration for all the dreamers still captivated by a transcendence which rivals the internet itself.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has ownership stake in BitPay, Blockchain and Coinbase. Old books image via Shutterstock"

CME will use a custom reference rate created with partner Crypto Facilities, while CBOE intends to use data from the New York-based cryptocurrency exchange Gemini.Cantor Exchange, a subsidiary of Cantor Fitzgerald, will offer bitcoin binary options beginning on the above date.However, in remarks, CFTC Commissioner J. Christopher Giancarlo was quick to caution against the idea that the products would be regulated under its full oversight, noting its “limited statutory ability” to oversee the underlying cash markets for bitcoin trading.He said:“Market participants should take note that the relatively nascent underlying cash markets and exchanges for bitcoin remain largely unregulated markets over which the CFTC has limited statutory authority. There are concerns about the price volatility and trading practices of participants in these markets.”Elsewhere, the CFTC sought to frame itself as a participant in the launch, indicating it had held discussions with CME, Cantor and CBOE for months prior to today’s news.The regulator also indicated that it would maintain a close watch on the nascent market for bitcoin-tied financial products. The CFTC said that it intends to “assess whether further changes are required to the contract design and settlement processes and work with the [designated contract markets] to effect any changes” over time.Warnings aside, those listing the products expressed optimism about their release.In remarks, Terry Duffy, CME Group chairman and CEO, said he believes the Chicago-based exchange, as well as its peers, have put in place the necessary safeguards for the listing.“We are pleased to bring bitcoin futures to market after working closely with the CFTC and market participants to design a regulated offering that will provide investors with transparency, price discovery and risk transfer capabilities.”At launch, Duffy explained the bitcoin futures product will be subject to risk management tools, including a margin of 35 percent, position and intraday price limits.

Other participants in the round include new investors Silver8 Capital and Ignia, as well as previous Abra backers Arbor Ventures, American Express, Jungle Ventures, Lehrer Hippeau and RRE.However, just as notable is that the round marks Foxconn’s first investment in a bitcoin-focused firm.While, previously, Foxconn has tested blockchain technology for supply chain management, its investment in Abra shows a new willingness for the company – best known as the manufacturer of Apple’s iPhone – to embrace other potential use cases. Since Abra is a purveyor of a bitcoin remittance app, the investment could be read as a business-to-consumer and financial inclusion play.Still, Abra founder and CEO Bill Barhydt was quick to note that he envisions his company’s technology as having broader implications, including those that might be of interest to large manufacturing firms.Armed with a platform that enables bitcoin micropayments and smart contracts, Barhydt went so far as to project that Abra’s technology can underpin a new type of consumer credit product. In this vision, makers of refrigerators, televisions and more could lease appliances to people who may not want to pay the full value upfront – with blockchain technology giving consumers an incentive to make installment payments.Barhydt told CoinDesk:“We foresee a whole new market growing in this area of consumer asset finance.”To be sure, the idea of smart contract-connected IoT appliances has been talked about for years, with little to show for it so far. Further, Foxconn’s investment is just that, and no manufacturer has yet committed to testing out Barhydt’s idea.But Foxconn finds it compelling. Jack Lee, a founder and managing partner at HCM International, the manufacturer’s venture capital arm, said he believes that Abra could usher in what he called a “new era” of financial inclusion via solutions like credit services.In an interview with CoinDesk, Lee added that, from a business perspective, “companies can make more money from delivering the [financial] service than just from making margins on the hardware.”Also boding well for the leasing concept is the fact that, in addition to its contract work for companies like Apple, Foxconn also owns Sharp, the consumer home appliance brand.“I’d hope they’d be one of the first [to try it],” Barhydt said.But while ambitious, the plans are not without precedent.Barhydt’s new vision was inspired by his travels in Africa, where he saw how solar companies were integrating products into mobile money systems like Kenya’s M-Pesa by embedding cellular modems in hardware. If the consumers made weekly payments, solar lanterns worked; if not, they would be remotely shut off.This pay-as-you-go “jukebox model,” as Barhydt calls it, has made solar more widely affordable.Bitcoin, Barhydt contends, enables replication of that consumer financing model on a global scale, for a broader range of consumer asset purchases – particularly when used in the background the way Abra does. While consumers who use Abra’s flagship payment app can hold balances in local fiat currencies (it’s actually bitcoin, hedged with smart contracts), transfers between wallets ride on bitcoin’s rails, which know no borders.That global reach would enable manufacturers to offer this kind of digitized credit to consumers in more places, Barhydt said.“If I want to ship a device anywhere in the world without having to modify the device or create limitations on where the device can be shipped, I need a guaranteed payment vehicle that would work in any country,” he said, adding:“I believe Abra and the way we use bitcoin solves that problem. The alternative is to figure out a country-by-country payment model.”Of course, this new consumer credit use case depends on bitcoin being able to resolve its longstanding scaling challenges and hold down network transaction fees so that regular, small payments become viable.Barhydt readily acknowledged this big “if.”“Everything I’m saying assumes that bitcoin scales correctly,” he said.In the short term, this means Barhydt believes bitcoin needs the capacity benefits from a block size increase, and that he favors the contentious Segwit2x hard fork expected in mid-November.Still, despite the uncertainties surrounding bitcoin, Barhydt said he considers the protocol “uniquely qualified” to execute the kind of smart contracts Abra already uses for payments and investment products and that it now hopes to pioneer for consumer asset finance.Even though ethereum, unlike bitcoin, was designed specifically for smart contracts, “there’s still a lot of security issues” with that protocol, he said.Moreover, Abra’s smart contracts basically boil down to moving value from A to B under certain conditions, which is simple enough for bitcoin to handle, Barhydt said.“If I needed some Turing-complete smart contract to fill my vision, then bitcoin would probably be hard to do,” he said. “The reason we trust bitcoin in the scenario I described is that it doesn’t require bitcoin to do a lot, it just requires it to do it really well.”Barhydt concluded:“Bitcoin is not hacked because it doesn’t do much. And that’s a good thing”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Abra, and also helped organize the Segwit2x scaling agreement.

challenges that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies face with more ease.”.","Dec 13, 2017 at 13:15 UTC",The U.S. tax code is on the brink of its largest overhaul in three decades.,"And while neither the House of Representatives or Senate version of the tax bill (both have passed in their respective chambers and are in the process of being reconciled into a final bill) specifically addresses cryptocurrency, several rule changes could potentially catch bitcoin holders who realized eye-popping gains in 2017 by surprise.So far, both versions scrap the “like-kind” exchange mechanism that many cryptocurrency holders have used in the past and the Senate version proposes a “first-in, first-out” (FIFO) accounting framework, which could complicate cryptocurrency token reporting.Yet, the proponents of the reform, including President Donald Trump and the majority of Republicans on Capitol Hill, argue the goal is to make paying Uncle Sam far less torturous of a process for everyone.Representative David Schweikert, the Arizona Republican who serves as the co-chair of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus and the Ways and Means Committee, which oversees taxation, told CoinDesk:“With a more simplified tax code, individuals will be able to navigate the challenges that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies face with more ease.”Unfortunately for crypto-holders, the Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act – of which Rep. Schweikert is a co-sponsor – was left out of both versions. Neither version modifies existing capital gains tax rates, which cryptocurrency is subject to pursuant to the IRS’ 2014 guidance.Yet, the final bill will almost certainly do away with a crypto-friendly maneuver – deferring capital gains taxes on property by swapping one asset for a similar asset via a so-called 1031 like-kind exchange.Employing such exchanges has been a common tactic in crypto trading circles in years past, but both the House and Senate bills limit this provision solely to real estate transactions.“A lot of people have been taking the position that when they swap tokens from one type of token to another type of token or one cryptocurrency to another cryptocurrency, that’s a like-kind exchange,” said Lisa Zarlenga, partner at Steptoe & Johnson in Washington, D.C. and co-chair of the firm’s tax group.By swapping between cryptos, asset owners forego the short-term capital gains tax – the same as ordinary income tax rates – and then pay a lower long-term capital gains tax rate of 20 percent when the asset is sold.According to Kelsey Lemaster, partner at Goodwin Procter in San Francisco, while current law is unclear whether this like-kind mechanism can be applied to cryptocurrencies, a good argument could be made for it in the case of swaps of assets that originate from the same blockchain, such as bitcoin to bitcoin cash.“But then if the proposals go through, they would eliminate the ability to take this position on any exchange of crypto,” Lemaster said.What is more of a wild card, though, the FIFO accounting mechanism for “specified securities” could have the biggest potential impact on cryptocurrency holders.The requirement, only a provision within the Senate version, means that, as it relates to determining the cost basis of an asset sold, the oldest goods in one’s inventory would be the first to be sold.“Normally, what you would do is tell your broker to sell the highest-cost ones first. What [the Senate] is proposing is that you can’t use that anymore, that you have to use first-in, first-out,” said Jim Calvin, tax partner at Deloitte, explaining:“So, the first stuff that you bought would have to be the first stuff that you were treated as selling.”As an example, if a person bought one bitcoin at $1,000 in 2013 and another at $10,000 last month, and then decides to sell one at $15,000, that individual must sell the one bought first – the $1,000 one – and realize $14,000 worth of taxable gains (what they’d likely rather do is sell the $10,000 one first, and realize only $5,000 of taxable gains).While the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has categorized bitcoin a commodity, many wonder whether this provision, since it only applies to securities, would affect bitcoin. According to Calvin, bitcoin will likely get caught up in this, because bitcoin futures started trading this week.And even if bitcoin gets a pass, Zarlenga contends several initial coin offering (ICO) issuers, who have designed their tokens as securities, plus the issuers the SEC continues to go after, will fall under the FIFO umbrella.“You can have tokens that have enough qualities of a security to be treated as a security for tax purposes,” she said.As daunting as FIFO may be, though, it’s not certain that the provision will be in the final bill signed into law.Since the House and Senate are currently reconciling their respective drafts, and FIFO was only in the Senate’s version, it could very well be axed. Especially since many powerful interests, such as the Investment Company Institute – which represents firms in the regulated funds business – are calling for its removal.Yet, even if it does stay on the bill, there’s some good news on the FIFO front, according to Deloitte’s Calvin.For one, the provision only applies account-by-account, meaning that if the oldest bitcoins an individual owns are stored in a separate account from the bitcoins they want to sell or better yet, outside of an exchange account altogether, the rule does not apply.“If you sell bitcoin (in 2018), you’re going to be treated as selling the first one that you bought,” Calvin said. “So, take it off the exchange, hold it directly and when you want to sell one, you can deliver the one you want to sell.”Practicing what he preaches, Calvin added, that he personally is taking all his crypto off of exchanges before the end of the year.Going a step further, Lemaster said traders may want to consider selling off a significant chunk of their crypto holdings before the end of the year to minimize the capital gains realized.He concluded:“If people are planning to sell bitcoins in the near future, it might be worthwhile for them to sell before the beginning of the year.”Uncle Sam pig image via Shutterstock"

But even with tests underway, in which multiple unlisted companies have been given access to services normally reserved for public firms, LSEG continues to encounter obstacles related to paying for securities with cash.“Eventually, and hopefully, central banks will issue their currency in a digital form on a blockchain, because then that will facilitate collateral movement,” Harris said.The statements underscore that while some central banks have deemed cryptocurrencies a threat and moved to ban them, others are in fact exploring the potential benefits of issuing fiat currency on a blockchain.But, Harris is conscious that there are factors that could impede a swift embrace.As blockchain technology was in large part developed to make banks and other middlemen unnecessary, once a central bank decides to issue a cryptocurrency, that could call into question the entire concept of commercial banking, Harris said.As Harris puts it, “nothing is easy.”He concluded:“You’re not going to wake up one day and suddenly have a crypto-dollar facilitating collateral movements.

Of the first 30 crypto apps with up to 100,000 total installations, 93 percent contain at least three “medium-risk” vulnerabilities and 90 percent contain at least two “high-risk” issues.Among the most-downloaded apps, the numbers are a little better, but not by much. Ninety-four percent of apps with over 500,000 installations contain at least three “medium-risk” vulnerabilities and 77 percent contain at least two high-risk vulnerabilities.The most common vulnerabilities, according to the analysis, include “insecure data storage,” which means information that should be private can leak unintentionally, and “insufficient cryptography,” which indicates some form of cryptography was implemented to shield data, but was used incorrectly.In short, this means users might be at risk.“Depending on the application functionality, design and vulnerabilities, a wide spectrum of nuisances is possible, up to sensitive data and even the wallet (private key) theft,” said Ilia Kolochenko, CEO and founder of High-Tech Bridge.He added:“Unfortunately, I am not surprised with the outcomes of the research.”Kolochenko attributes the poor scores to a lack of emphasis on security across mobile development.“For many years, cybersecurity companies and independent experts were notifying mobile app developers about the risks of ‘agile’ development that usually imply no framework to assure secure design, secure coding and hardening techniques or application security testing,” he added.Users and developers can use the company’s free security analysis tool, Mobile X-Ray, to plug in mobile apps and see the vulnerabilities for themselves.However, when it comes to securing funds, there’s plenty that can go wrong.

You hungry? I’ve got an extra steak cooking on the engine block. It should be ready any minute now! I should tell you, I don’t usually pick up hitchhikers, but, well you look like you could use some help.A lot of people come through this car. You can see bits and pieces of what they’ve left behind in the back there. That’s an Opendime you just sat on. Oh, and that? That’s the 21 Computer. Just push that aside for now…I picked you up because of that sign you were holding. “Heading south, will work for crypto.”That’s a common message these days – you’re not the first to think of it. Hell, maybe you saw someone else holding that sign and thought you’d do the same. I see a lot of that too. The trick to a good sign is to make it relatable. Lots of people are heading south. Hell, lots of people even want crypto these days. Your message stuck. Simple messages are often the ones that stick best.Look kid, I’ll be straight with you. I’m a busy guy. I have a wife at home. I have kids to feed. But these people on the road these days? They’re bonkers. I only picked you up because you looked… relatable. I made note of that. Yeah. You looked like you have the same problems I’ve had. Your sign stuck out. Signs like yours are what help like-minded people stick together.So, what else makes a sign stick?Well, you have to make your message snappy. That’s the first thing.You see all these cars? Each one of them contains a busy person on the go. These people don’t have much time to think. They want to learn something, and they want to learn fast. So, make your message simple. And you know what? Make it funny too. People love to laugh.Most people are just trying to get to where they’re going. We don’t have time to go down every road and examine them for ourselves. See, take those people on that side of the road. They’re going backwards. You know it, and I know it. They’ll learn that eventually. The reason they’re going backwards is that they started off reading the wrong signs. Once you get started on the wrong trail, it’s hard to turn around.As for these people on our side of the road? Well, they’re people like us. And they’re heading our way. The biggest problem on these highways, best that I can tell is that no one’s looking out for each other. Everyone is so concerned with their destination, they don’t even pay attention to the people heading there with them.That’s why I picked you up. I figured, I need to talk to more people like us. People who stare into the same far-off distance I’m driving to, and who say, “Damnit, I want to get there as well.”So, where are we going?Well, that’s the hard part. I’m just heading forward right now. I don’t know where you’re going to. And sure, I could ask. But what if I don’t like your answer? To me, all I need to know is that we’re together for the time being. I’ll take you as far as I’m going, and when I need to exit this highway, well, I’ll just let the next guy take you from there.That’s what I like about a good sign. It takes you forward.A great commute is made of simple steps. That’s what all the great signs have in common. They cut through the big thinking and get straight to the heart of things. They help us focus on the immediate goals.That’s another thing about signs. When they’re done right, they’re lessons learned from others. Hints from our future selves, to our past. Some signs are great at finding our flaws. Others for finding our ideals. And some, well, they’re just for blowing off pressure.The trick is to remember the scenery is what makes road trips fun. If you don’t like a sign, ignore it. That’s why they put a steering wheel on this ride. It’s up to you to pick what signs to follow.You have to watch out for new people bearing fancy signs. Things get awfully heated when they show up. They can be distracting. People start rubbernecking down the highway. Accidents happen. People just can’t seem to leave well-enough alone sometimes.I think that’s what decentralization is for. Making signs together. A way to direct traffic to your fruit stand on the side of the road. A way to tell others about the scenery at the top of the mountain. And sometimes, signs are even just a way to strip travelers of their money, in exchange for a peek at the world’s largest pistachio.And with that, I’m going to let you off. This is my exit coming up, and I don’t want to be late for my next gig. Watch out for that 21 computer there on your way out. Don’t squish it. A man walked in here with that a couple years ago, and well, he got restless, too. Left that behind on his way out. All he had to do was sit still and not bother anyone. But he was so in a hurry to change the world that he ended up changing nothing.Thanks for the attention bub. Good luck on the rest of your trip, and watch out for tourist traps. The world’s largest pistachio ain’t no good if you can’t fit it down your throat.Not in for the ride? CoinDesk is looking for submissions to its 2017 in Review series.

2016, ...","Sep 26, 2017 at 08:00 UTC","It’ll take more than the flick of a wand to carry out, but MimbleWimble developers now seem set on creating a new cryptocurrency.","The blockchain project, named after a spell from the Harry Potter book series, has been looking for ways to attach itself to bitcoin since 2016, but with its platform getting closer to being ready (and options like sidechains still in development), developers now argue launching a new cryptocurrency is simply the easiest way to test MimbleWimble with real users.But while the project touts itself as a more scalable, more private blockchain, launching new cryptocurrencies has historically been seen as controversial.With hundreds (if not, thousands) of so called altcoins launching and fading into obscurity over the years, some have gone so far as to label the practice an elaborate fraud. But, according to one MimbleWimble developer, the project doesn’t intend to follow models that have proven problematic or harmful to investors.Igno Peverell, the project’s pseudonymous lead developer, said:“No ICO, pre-mine or funny business.”Instead, Peverell said money for project development will likely depend on voluntary donations, though the team has not ironed out the details just yet.Stepping back, MimbleWimble’s open-source team has continued to grow larger and become more active with time, and because of that, the project has made significant steps forward. Still, the original goal of launching it as a sidechain of the bitcoin network has remained a challenge.Since MimbleWimble requires bitcoin’s existing scripting system to be stripped out, the project has long been considered all but impossible to incorporate into bitcoin itself.Indeed, Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra, one of the earliest advocates for MimbleWimble, and arguably its most visible proponent, agreed that launching a new cryptocurrency is the “simplest” option.“It’s a very reasonable attitude and I’m glad that they’re pushing the research and design of MimbleWimble forward,” he added.Yet, Poelstra mentioned it might be possible to peg the network’s cryptocurrency, called grin, to bitcoin later on, using a mechanism he’s currently developing.He told CoinDesk:“Although grin is starting from a different place than I would have preferred, it’s still moving in the right direction: toward improved privacy and scalability for bitcoin.”But as for how those features are developing, things are still taking shape.Because it isn’t able to use bitcoin’s scripts, it seemed at first as though MimbleWimble wouldn’t be able to support more complex transaction types like Schnorr signatures and Lightning Network, both of which could boost capacity even further.So, if grin has better privacy and scalability, and might be able to support many of the same features bitcoin has, does bitcoin still have any advantages?To this question, Peverell responded with sarcasm, acknowledging that bitcoin still has the “largest market,” “most known brand” and “most active ecosystem,” making the prospect of competing difficult.Further, Peverell noted that since bitcoin was upgraded to support Segregated Witness in August, it now allows more advanced transaction types, something that’s likely to keep developers busy with new innovations.All in all, the developer doesn’t see it so much as a competition. Instead, Peverell argues that there are tradeoffs between the different approaches.“We’re not here to ‘kill bitcoin.’ We’re here to provide a radically different, private and scalable alternative that plays well with it,” he said.Developers have been working on a code version of MimbleWimble, also called grin, since October of last year. And that implementation has seen plenty of progress, especially with a new cast of Harry Potter-themed developers (including Antioch Peverell, Luna Lovegood, Seamus Finnigan, and Percy Weasley) joining ranks.But there’s still a lot of work to be done before the team can launch the grin cryptocurrency, Peverell continued, including multiple rounds of testing. First, the current code still needs to be fleshed out, reviewed and tested.“We now have a blockchain implementation that, while still naturally immature at this point, doesn’t have gaping holes anymore,” Peverell said.Second, by testing and bulletproofing the code, they will crystallize an “alpha” release, with which they will launch a testnet, a big step toward showing the cryptocurrency community the underlying ideas really work.Setting up the testnet means producing a first block, known as a “genesis block” (in bitcoin, this block was hardcoded by the technology’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto). After that, volunteer testers will be able mine the network and make test transactions.“I’m hoping we’ll be ready before winter,” Peverell said.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blockstream.Zonko’s Joke Shop image via Shutterstock"

changing the bitcoin software will fail to achieve its desired results.","Nov 6, 2017 at 05:00 UTC","Ariel Deschapell is a full-stack javascript developer teaching at the Ironhack coding bootcamp in Miami, and a Henry Hazlitt fellow in Digital Development at the Foundation for Economic Education.","In this opinion piece, Deschapell argues that an upcoming proposal for changing the bitcoin software will fail to achieve its desired results.With two weeks remaining until it’s slated to launch, all eyes are on the imminent hard fork of the bitcoin software: Segwit2x.Its significance? The fear that it could initiate the largest and most contentious chain split that bitcoin, and perhaps any cryptocurrency, has yet seen. Such an event could have devastating consequences for the ecosystem and its wider perception.However, a close analysis of the dynamics at play shows that these fears are largely overblown. More likely is the avoidance (or quick resolution) of such a split, one that will also serve as an important test that bolsters the perception of bitcoin as a secure store of value.A number of factors have contributed to escalating this situation and making it a completely unprecedented, and therefore one understandably shrouded in uncertainty.Other controversial forks seeking to increase the block size have come and gone with little incident under the names of Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited. However, 2x differs from these previous attempts in two distinct and important ways.The first is in its substantial backing. The scheduled 2x fork is the result of the “New York Agreement” between an impressive collection of major industry players including miners, wallets, exchanges and payment processors.At its inception, the agreement claimed the participation of 58 companies located in 22 countries including many of the largest in the ecosystem, and 83.28% of miner hashing power. This represented the most significant push for any hard fork to increase the block size by far.And while the agreement has lost a non-negligible amount of that support since it was first announced, the majority of its original signatories have not officially indicated a change in position.The second and most important difference (one made even more significant by its aforementioned backing) is the NYA’s break from the traditional conventions regarding changes to the bitcoin protocol. This has been the source of much of the contention and protest in the community.Unlike previous attempts to change the bitcoin core protocol, Segwit2x was not introduced as a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, but rather through the New York Agreement.This is significant because bitcoin and all blockchains are strictly opt-in, consensus-based systems. For a backwards incompatible change to be implemented like a block size increase, the whole peer-to-peer network of bitcoin nodes must synchronously update its software to avoid splitting the blockchain and ecosystem.For this reason, it is a standard and reasonable expectation for advocates of hard forks to attempt to do either one of two things. First, they can build widespread consensus in the ecosystem around the need for a backwards-incompatible change so as to avoid a confusing chain split. Or, if they cannot create such consensus, then they can enact replay protection – as bitcoin cash did – in order to cleanly split into a co-existing minority chain with minimal disruption to the ecosystem.Segwit2x breaks this trend by declining to enact replay protection and also failing to publicly seek and build wider community support for the adoption of the software.This is explained by the language of the original NYA announcement itself, which reveals a deeply flawed premise: that a consensus for such a change was already obtained since, “The group of signed companies represents a critical mass of the bitcoin ecosystem.”While the many large companies that originally signed on to Segwit2x may seem to represent a clear consensus amongst the majority of the ecosystem, new developments have proven this is anything but the case.Firstly, the doubling of the block size that Segwit 2x solely exists to implement has been rejected by the vast majority of the open-source development community on technical grounds, and as such, is not being merged into Bitcoin Core, the most widely used and supported bitcoin client by far.Several original signers of the agreement have since formally dropped their support. Most notably amongst these are the mining pools Slush and F2Pool, which together account for nearly 13% of hash power at time of publication.Exchanges have also largely recognized “legacy” bitcoin, and after the fork, that Segwit2x coins will be treated as separate units of value. This is opposed to Segwit2x’s original intention and goal, which was to seamlessly replace the current bitcoin protocol and the corresponding unit of value.These developments alone are enough to, in my view, ensure 2x has little chance of ever overtaking and replacing the legacy chain for any considerable length of time. Let’s explore why.Regardless of original intentions, if the Segwit2x fork took place tomorrow, with all its remaining signatories, the result would be a needless and ruinous debacle for bitcoin. With the strong contention of the fork between nodes, users and developers, two chains are guaranteed to co-exist and maintain monetary value.This alone isn’t normally a cause for alarm. However, this isn’t a normal case. Without replay protection and with two chains maintaining independent monetary values, the loss of funds for many users on the network will literally be unavoidable due to accidental replay spending, replay attacks and sudden and widespread incompatibility between various software and services.The only thing that is uncertain is how severe and continuous such a state of affairs proves to be and how much reputational damage bitcoin incurs as a result.Needless to say, such a debacle would be immensely detrimental to the ecosystem and all its stakeholders, and is likely a far cry from what the Segwit2x signers originally envisioned and signed on to. Fortunately, the NYA is not only not binding, but its associated “support” and “signaling” equate to little more than flag waving.Whether such supporters are ultimately willing to accept the economic consequences of following through with the split given the clear division regarding the fork is a separate question entirely.These companies are ultimately profit-oriented and will live or die with the ecosystem, and it is doubtful that the repercussions of a deeply contentious fork without replay protection is lost on the majority of them. That this is being risked for a simple block size increase makes it an even more unsavory deal. To put it simply, circumstances have changed dramatically since the participating companies agreed to what then likely seemed like a safe and straightforward commitment.That is why it is likely that the Segwit2x agreement will only continue to lose more support prior to the activation date. Indeed, perhaps the only reason that we haven’t seen more of this already is that there is little incentive for these companies to be among the first to back out of their agreement while there remains time before they are required to actually act on it.By virtue of this, should Segwit2x launch at all, it will likely debut with much less than currently advertised support. Thus, signers are faced with the actual risk and cost of following through given the clear division in the ecosystem.Should Segwit2x emerge in any way besides being accepted by users and the market as the “new” and superior bitcoin as it originally set out to do, it will be reflected in its market price. The best indication of how that price might look like are coin split futures markets on several exchanges like Bitfinex, which roughly value a future Segwit2x coin at about 15% of the value of a bitcoin.Regardless of initial miner signaling, a battle for hash power would quickly play out between the two chains that can ultimately only be determined by profitability. Because miners ultimately have large sunk and ongoing costs, hash power must ultimately follow the chain that is the most profitable to mine.But how can we be sure that this continues to be the case and that the market will continue to value the legacy chain over Segwit2x, especially if an initial exodus of hash power renders transaction times painfully slow? What if, to add to this worst-case scenario, all the originally included companies actually went through with the agreement regardless of the risk to the ecosystem’s and their own reputations, and are even willing to incur some amount of financial loss to do so?A deeper analysis of the dynamics at play reveal that the NYA was flawed from the start by not only misunderstanding the nature of the network, but by also directly ignoring what makes a bitcoin valuable in the first place.As such, Segwit2x could never have a chance at successfully overtaking bitcoin in market value regardless of the amount of corporate backing.The New York Agreement was just that: an agreement among the involved parties. The error was in believing that they collectively had the ability to change the bitcoin protocol without any additional support as they represented a critical mass of the bitcoin ecosystem.There are two important components to this erroneous conclusion.Firstly is an overemphasis on the importance of hash power in measuring consensus and in achieving a successful fork. Miners provide an essential service and are large stakeholders in the ecosystem, but they are far from the only ones. Ultimately, the preferences of the rest of the ecosystem are aggregated and reflected in market prices, which miners can ignore but at a high cost that can’t likely be incurred for long.Secondly, and even more problematically, is the implicit assumption of Segwit2x that third-party services like Coinbase and BitPay can speak for their users, and can actually decide for them what token they would like to hold and use. Such thinking assumes the implicit consent of the users of all of these services to change the very definition of what a bitcoin is.This goes against the very ethos of bitcoin, which was from its inception meant to do away with the need for participants to delegate this kind of trust and power to third parties.Segwit2x was organized and advertised as a compromise in bitcoin’s scaling debate. But it is only a compromise in an antiquated political sense, which understandably remains our only source of reference for when it comes to decentralized governance. But those same ideas and practices have no applicability in voluntary and consensus-based systems.Blockchain protocol changes demand explicit, not implicit consent. So long as the cost of validating the network is low enough for most users to at least have the option to do so this will remain true.Third parties may believe they can leverage their role as service providers and custodians to side-step this through attempts like Segwit2x, but they ultimately cannot force the network’s fully validating nodes to follow their new rules. Nor can they force their users or the wider market to demand their new token.What necessarily follows from these facts is a new model of governance where politicking is supplanted by voluntary association, and the concept of representation is rendered obsolete by self-sovereignty. Segwit2x is a compromise the participants simply never had the power or authority to make.If Segwit2x were to succeed in being collectively labeled as bitcoin, it must be despite the disagreement of the ecosystems vast majority of validating economic nodes.This would mean that the coordinated actions of a few of the ecosystem’s large and visible players can unilaterally change the rules of the bitcoin protocol, a fact which would render bitcoin’s reputation as a censorship-resistant store of value all but worthless.Simply put, if these companies are successful in unilaterally changing the network rules without widespread consensus, then bitcoin would have failed.For if such a contentious change can effectively be forced on the rest of the ecosystem then other changes can also be introduced despite protest, and States who are or become hostile to bitcoin will take notice. Pressuring those visible and key businesses in order to influence and control the network would be a straightforward and trivial attack surface.Segwit2x seeks to provide temporary transaction fee relief by doubling the base block size. But without the underlying confidence in its security, resistance to change and continuity, the cost of a bitcoin transaction becomes irrelevant.It would have lost the very thing that makes it worthwhile to transact in the first place.While at first glance the difficulty in changing bitcoin seems to many to be a flaw, this couldn’t be farther from the truth.Bitcoin’s resistance to change is what makes it so valuable in the first place.Every time this property is demonstrated, it builds confidence in bitcoin’s reliability and security and reinforces its soundness as a store of value. That the economics of the network actively incentivizes this is what gives it the potential to become the most secure and trusted store of value in history. But it will only fulfill such potential if it can continue to demonstrate these properties in the face of ever larger threats to them.2x isn’t the first such test, and it won’t be the last.The choice between the legacy bitcoin and 2x is a choice between a continuously proven and non-censorable store of value, and a provenly compromised store of value with temporarily lower transaction fees.If futures markets are any indication, then choice for the market is an easy one – and the result is clear: the Segwit2x hard fork is doomed to fail.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which helped organize the Segwit2x agreement.Wastebasket image via Shutterstock"

Or maybe just a mean person. Even if so, fire is still useful for cooking and warmth.To use more concrete examples, Richard Wagner and Henry Ford were nasty anti-Semites. But we can still appreciate the beauty of the Ring Cycle and the efficiency of the assembly line.In other words, the identity or character of the creator has little, if any, bearing on the value of the creation.That’s why the mainstream media’s obsession a few years ago with unmasking Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of bitcoin, was so silly. We’ve seen what bitcoin does, we know how it works, the code is public. The focus on its author would be laughable if it weren’t also destructive.Quite apart from doxxing poor old Dorian Nakamoto and rewarding Craig Wright with the limelight, these circuses distracted public attention from the much more interesting questions about money and society raised by Satoshi’s work and by the projects it inspired.Questions like: Why did it still take days to transfer money between bank accounts when an unknown geek had demonstrated that value could be zapped across the globe in minutes? Could capital controls still work in the age of the internet (if they ever did) – and if not, is that really a bad thing? And what do you mean, I don’t actually own the stocks in my portfolio?But far too many people in my profession are less interested in engaging with big ideas than in talking about other people. As President Trump would say: Sad!Yet, this is one more way bitcoin opens up new vistas. When you spend time exploring the rabbit hole of cryptocurrency, it inevitably gets you thinking about identity – when it’s important, when it isn’t and why.To be sure, there are times when knowing someone’s identity is helpful, even critical. Businesses often need to know something about their customers to guard against fraud or assess credit risk, for example. Some scam artist has recently been impersonating CoinDesk and sending phishing texts with our name on it to people in the Netherlands – now there’s someone who deserves to be unmasked (along with other consequences).But there are other times when identity can serve to cloud people’s judgment. And not even the bitcoin community has been immune to this problem.In a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) submitted in March, as the scaling debate was heating up, Chris Stewart, co-founder of SuredBits, described the danger:“We are seeing the politicization of protocol level changes. The critiques of these changes are slowly moving towards critiques based on who is submitting the BIP – not what it actually contains. This is the worst thing that can happen in a meritocracy.”To address this, Stewart proposed requiring BIPs to be submitted pseudonymously. “This means a BIP can be proposed and examined based on its technical merits,” he wrote.And if a developer wanted to claim credit after a BIP was accepted, Stewart included a way for them to cryptographically prove authorship – preempting another Craig Wright-style drama.In a conversation a few weeks ago, when the Segwit2x fork was still expected to happen and bitcoin tribalism had reached a fever pitch, Stewart gave another reason why technologists might want their ideas to be discussed without attribution.“I think more people need to be conscious of their online persona – it can have dire consequences,” Stewart told me, citing as an example the recent “swatting” of a prominent bitcoin engineer. “I’m guessing anyone that is a strong persona in this space is getting a lot of harassment.”So the next time someone asks you who you think Satoshi is, don’t indulge in gossipy parlor games.Instead, make them think by answering with a question: “Who invented pants?”Jeans image via Shutterstock"

a two-part experiment designed to show how public blockchains could ...","Nov 22, 2017 at 10:00 UTC",Blockchain startup Nivaura has today initiated its first bond denominated exclusively in ether.,"Built under the regulatory oversight of Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the first-of-its-kind instrument was issued by London-based luxury retail startup LuxDeco and created with the help of industry leaders to give the company a new way to raise capital for short-term seasonal demand.But what’s truly disruptive about the issuance isn’t the use of cryptocurrency, rather it’s that the bond will be cleared, settled and registered on the public ethereum blockchain. With a relatively short lifecycle of only one week, the bond is also part of a larger experiment to see if removing financial middlemen can make such investment vehicles more accessible to small businesses on a massive scale.“As an entrepreneurial business we are always looking at ways to gain advantage and scale,” said the founder and CEO of LuxDeco, Jonathan Holmes, in an interview with CoinDesk. “So, if cryptocurrency becomes a valid funding and trading option we would definitely look at issuing further bonds in the future.”And while private blockchains have largely been the purvey of CSDs and other legacy infrastructure providers, the founder and CEO of venture-backed Nivaura, Avtar Sehra, argued that the new bond shows the potential of public blockchains when applied to enterprise business models.Sehra said:“What we’re showing is you can use open public infrastructure for regulated financial instruments, and this is a very critical step, because from the earliest stages we’ve always believed that public blockchains are the way forward.”To ensure the ethereum bond aligned with existing workflows, a number of counterparties were involved in its creation.As part of JPMorgan’s in-residence program Nivaura received input for the development of an automated bookbuilding process that could be deployed for a number of different financial instruments. With the help of law firm Allen & Overy Nivaura then used that structure to construct legally compliant documentation that automated the work using ethereum smart contracts.In turn, credit rating firm Moody’s priced the instrument by providing data to generate yield curves, factoring the volatility of ethereum into the structure of the bond itself.Specifically, while a control experiment (discussed in greater detail below) paid 2.5 percent annual interest, the ethereum bond is expected to offer annual interest of about 10 percent to help offset the perceived risk of using a cryptocurrency prone to rapid price fluctuations.Ether used to purchase the bond was be deposited to a public address called the Nivaura Client ETH Account. To help conclude the process, investors, in turn, must confirm the account in which they’d like to receive principal and interest when the bond reaches maturity on Nov. 29.While the entire process was designed to be as self-service as possible, a trustee service is also being provided by Australia-based Link Asset Services (previously known as Capita) in case the issuer defaults on the loan.“A blockchain can’t do that,” said Sehra, elaborating:“A blockchain can’t go and enforce a contract and reclaim the assets for the investors. This is essentially where an accountable third party is always required.”Yet, the ethereum bond issued today is just the latest of a two-part experiment designed to show how public blockchains could turn bond issuance into an increasingly self-service industry.Considered a control group for comparison with the ethereum bond, the earlier work was conducted using the bitcoin blockchain, resulting in a more manual process in part due to expected difficulty writing smart contracts.This bond was created last month as part of another regulatory sandbox similarly set up by the FCA to give the partners assurance they won’t accidentally violate industry controls.In spite of the difficulty automating some of this earlier work, end users were still afforded a degree of self-service, by using private keys assigned to them via a KYC/AML onboarding process built into the Nivaura platform.The biggest difference between the tests was that instead of depositing the cryptocurrency directly to an account on the blockchain, as with the ethereum bond, British pounds were deposited into Nivaura’s Client Money Account.A document given by Nivaura to the counterparties explained the limitations of this arrangement:“This meant that the ownership of money on the blockchain could not be considered as the independent source of truth due to the dependency on, and management of, the funds held in a Client Money Account.”With the lessons learned from both of these live experiments, Nivaura and LuxDeco have plans for a number of further implementations.LuxDeco’s Holmes said he first discovered Nivaura in response to global customers who wanted to pay for their goods in ethereum and bitcoin – and if the bond matures without any problems, that’s exactly what the firm would like to do next.“If we eventually start accepting payments in cryptocurrency, which we think will come, there is potentially a natural case for funding our working capital cycles through this means too,” he said.As for Nivaura, Sehra is mindful of other bond issuers such as Daimler, Fisco and Overstock who have used cryptocurrency for part of their process. As those companies, and others working in derivatives, make their own progress, he expects to see a convergence.Sehra concluded:“We’re already seeing derivatives in cryptocurrency. Bonds and derivatives are going to be the next step. They’re going to be the next pioneers.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Nivaura.Thumb tacks image via Shutterstock"

libertarianism ...","Sep 23, 2017 at 11:00 UTC","Dr Paul Ennis is a research assistant at the Centre for Innovation, Technology & Organisation at University College Dublin, specializing in bitcoin and blockchain studies.","In this opinion piece, Ennis takes a dive into the kinds of sub-cultures bitcoin and cryptocurrencies enable, tracing their origins in libertarianism – and beyond.Not everything is tameable – that’s a truism that might apply to bitcoin above all.Recently, researchers from City University and Stockholm University introduced the concept of the “bandit organization,” calling it “a form of association or ‘band’ (frequently led by a charismatic individual) that occupies a space outside national and/or international credibility but inside the everyday practical and moral organization of specific audiences.”Bitcoin, as we all intuitively seem to sense, is not quite a community in any usual sense.For this reason, I’ve started to describe it as a land of bandits, “Bitcoin Country,” a term that denotes a semi-autonomous lawless region full of bandits, some noble, some not, and most certainly not cohesive.Too formless to be a country, too amorphous to be a company, you can think of Bitcoin Country as a kind of digitally decentralized frontier.Historian Eric Hobsbawm provided an early model of outlaws as social bandits that, although often violent, were celebrated by the local community as heroic or defiant.In this way, the origin story of bitcoin is deliciously outlaw, essentially one of the individual who, through an amazing feat, harangues the evil king. It’s all the better if the king has devolved into vice and avarice to the point of financial ruin.The other, slightly more contentious hero, operated on the edge of the edge, is the black market within the black market, the bayous of Bitcoin Country.“The fascists always use the narrative of ‘We are the white knights in shining armor protecting against the threats. We come here and we move out the dark with pure whiteness.’ That’s a false narrative because there is corruption in those castles. The real base of power lies with us. We are the darkness.”In the above quote, anarchist bitcoin developer Amir Taaki sets out, in the context of a documentary about the original darknet marketplace, Silk Road, a common theme within digital libertarian culture: the establishment, broadly construed, is corrupt.Not just corrupt, its corruptness is clouded in “whiteness,” traditional forms of organizational legitimacy, and it uses narratives of fear to ensure we place our trust in them.We need police to stop crime, we need armies to stop invaders and intelligence services to stop terrorists. Taaki’s rhetoric is hyperbolic, but it contains, implicitly, two important insights. The first is that the organizational legitimacy of central authorities is connected to our placing our trust in them in exchange for protection from threats (Taaki calls this “babysitting” a little later in the speech).The second, a cypherpunk view, is that a powerful response to this situation, in the context of the digital world, is the creation of technological systems that subvert this power relation, “the real base of power lies with us.”These systems Taaki discusses would strive to be trustless, having no central authority and, strikingly, they would not require legitimacy. It is crucial to remember that digital libertarians do not propose a counter-legitimacy belonging to them.They do not claim to be the truly legitimate position. Rather they revel in being “the darkness.”Their ideal systems necessitate no “babysitters,” no trusted third party, no “legitimacy” in any traditional sense. Given such an anarchic spirit, it is no surprise that digital libertarians are drawn toward those areas deemed off-limits by authority, such as the shadow economy.Silk Road was never just an exercise in deviant entrepreneurship, but was “presented as a means to dismantle the state.” University professor David Golumbia notes that in the wider bitcoin discourse “the idea that government itself is inherently evil” appears with “particular force.”It was a form of activism involving a political “prefiguration” that sustained the community.Prefiguration is a concept found in the left anarchist and autonomist Marxist traditions and developed in relation to cryptomarkets. Like most forms of political radicalism, libertarianism relies on envisioning a world that does not yet exist. Aware that this is the case, radical activists often must discover methods that justify their faith in the project.For the anarchist and autonomist traditions, this tension has emerged quite visibly in movements such as Occupy Wall Street.As Mathijs van de Sande explains, prefigurative politics need to be seen in terms of the ever-evolving act of bringing into being the world its adherents wish to see, but without any mainstream engagement. Crucial to prefiguration is a subtle inversion within leftist thinking.In traditional Marxism, the relation to the state is directly antagonistic; one is against the state.In the anarchist and autonomist view, this becomes inverted. There, to borrow from the Spanish Indignados, “We are not against the system. The system is against us.”This redefines the nature of defiance as a focus on how best one can build new worlds despite state “interference.” It manifests as a process of instantiation of abstract ideals to come through practices occurring in the here and now.The overriding aim is to act “as if one is already free.”The state is to be escaped rather than replaced. In other words, “exit over voice.”According to economist Albert Hirschman, the two options open to all dissatisfied members of an organization are exit or voice. One can either exit the organization or voice dissatisfaction.Libertarians are infamous for their preference for exit or, at least, the option of exit and, as journalist Brian Doherty charts, there have been many attempts to escape what they perceive as the ultimate closure of options, the state.The concept of exit has even led to attempts to establish entirely new countries, known as micro-nations, their failures documented in an obscure libertarian classic “How to Start Your Country.” Arguably the most successful forms of exit have occurred by simply moving out to sea, as encapsulated in our romantic vision of anarchistic pirates, but also in the most successful micro-nation of all time, the Principality of Sealand, an offshore oil platform located not far from the coast of Suffolk, England.The Dread Pirate Roberts name evokes this pirate outlaw status quite explicitly (Ross Ulbrich, who ran Silk Road under that name, even notes this in discussion with Variety Jones). He had not just prefigured the world his community wanted to see, but had generated a space, a micro-nation located off the coast of the clearnet, where the law (seemingly) no longer applied.In effect, what Ulbricht achieved was a quite unique marriage of high-minded digital libertarian ideals with the routine process of buying and selling narcotics.For most participants, their engagement with Silk Road operationalized a sense of freedom to consume their drug of choice in the context of doing no harm to others, aligning participants with the cyber-libertarian philosophy of DPR.In more formal terms, organizational legitimacy on the Silk Road was ensured by reimagining the “mundane” act of buying and selling narcotics as an act of liberty.For Ulbricht, the success of Silk Road was precisely in line with the teachings of his most important intellectual influence, Samuel Edward Konkin III. A relatively obscure figure, Konkin developed a strand of libertarianism known as agorism in the early 1970s. In his exceptionally detailed and thorough-going history of American libertarianism, Doherty references Konkin a mere five times and not once in any especially important manner.Indeed, Konkin seems to have “fallen” out of the tradition, but this is consistent with his rejection of the Libertarian Party as inherently paradoxical, preferring instead to promote black market activism where one might “commit civil disobedience profitably.” It is not clear how Ulbricht first came across Konkin, but perhaps there was something of the kindred spirit to them, both had studied chemistry to an advanced degree.Konkin proposed a dual course to bringing agorism into being: (1) a theoretical position known as “counter-establishment economics,” or “counter-economics” for short, and (2) the practical dimension of “counter-economic activity.” For Konkin only a small handful understand agorism, in the theoretical sense, but this does not mean that counter-economic activity does not occur.Konkin was keen to celebrate the unconscious agorists that populate our world: tax-dodgers, black market operators, prostitutes and so on. This is where Konkin can be considered explicitly radical.The creation of black markets was for Konkin an agorist act where small “pockets” of outlaw culture create markets more efficient than the state can provide. The more efficient these pockets the more people in the white economy will turn to agorism.Konkin died in 2004, but he had foreseen, as early as the middle of the 1980s, that the internet opened up agorist possibilities. His remarks are worth quoting in full, given his influence upon Ulbricht:“The internet explosion has led the American State – for now, at any rate – to throw up its tentacles at regulation of the information industry. Every legislative session, however, brings up new attempts to tax and control the World Wide Web. But consider this well: should the counter-economy lick the information problem, it would virtually eliminate the risk it incurs under the State’s threat. That is, if you can advertise your products, reach your consumers and accept payment (a form of information), all outside the detection capabilities of the State, what enforcement of control would be left?'”This is, to be direct, quite simply what Silk Road was.Even more prescient is that Konkin recognized the importance of encryption around the same time.Noting that encryption meant the state “cannot reach the invoices, inventory lists, accounts and so on of the Counter-Economist,” Konkin’s proto-conception of the cryptomarket means he arrived at the idea before even the cypherpunks.Rusted train image via Shutterstock"

That report took a similar stance, and suggested that, if the use of digital currencies become more widespread in the country, the “risk could rise.”The latest report also expects the money laundering risks associated with digital currencies to grow in correlation with the increase in the technology’s adoption as a payment method.The report reads:“As the number of businesses accepting digital currency payments grows, there is an increasing risk of criminals using the currencies to launder funds without needing to cash out into non-digital, or ‘fiat’ currencies.”In terms of terrorist financing, the use of digital currencies is assessed to be “unlikely” to increase in the next five years, the paper states.The paper further cited the peer-to-peer lending industry, which it said has the potential to be used as a “terrorist financing tool,” though no incidences have been observed in the U.K. to date.The full “National Risk Assessment 2017” report can be found here.HM Treasury image via Shutterstock"

saw several groups split from the main bitcoin blockchain to create ...","Dec 4, 2017 at 19:00 UTC",Can a crypto app be too easy and fun?,"That might be the case on ethereum, where one project is proving so popular it’s putting pressure on the network’s technology. Best thought of as a decentralized Tamagotchi, CryptoKitties appears to be striking a nerve with new users, making ethereum fun and accessible to those who aren’t in the tech nerd domain.Already, the app, which uses ethereum’s blockchain to create a public, shared history of cryptographically unique (not to mention cute and cuddly) fluffballs, is ethereum’s most popular, with users having spent at least $3 million total on breeding, buying and selling the in-game items, up from $1 million just yesterday. And currently, the average cat is trading for $100 in ether.But the application is clogging the ethereum network, putting transactions in a long-time limbo.“Due to network congestion, we are increasing the birthing fee from 0.001 ETH to 0.002 ETH. This will ensure your kittens are born on time!” the CryptoKitties team stated in a tweet surrounded by siren emojis to express the direness of the situation.In its short lifespan, CryptoKitties has grown to make up 20 percent of all ethereum computations, a number that seems to still be growing.While it’s certainly not the sole culprit behind ethereum’s lagging transactions, as ethereum developer Nick Johnson pointed out, it is one, and at the very least, it’s where people are placing the blame for exposing ethereum’s limits.Johnson continued, telling CoinDesk:“CryptoKitties is definitely a significant contributor to network congestion, and it may have been what pushed us over the edge from mostly-full blocks to full blocks in the last day or so.”The issue is a bit ironic, seeing how ethereum is touted as a world “world computer” that hosts unstoppable decentralized applications, replacing the internet.With aspirations like that, it might seem strange that one app for trading otherworldly kittens could clog the network, but because of the way blockchains work – with every transaction needing all network nodes to process it – there are limits on the number of computations that can be done all at one time.Not only does that mean that an insane amount of kitty trading can slow down the network, but it can also add to the expense of using ethereum as well.And whether people are right to point fingers at the CryptoKitties app or not, it is laughable that kittens are bringing new awareness to the messy underbelly of public blockchains, including ethereum, bitcoin and many others – scalability.As a tweet from coder Boris Kozak displays, the issue is well-established and there are many proposed fixes, including state channels, Raiden, sharding and Casper – ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin’s and other developer’s interest in moving ethereum to proof-of-stake – but all these solutions require major engineering work and are still unfinished.“It may also hasten the ethereum scaling crisis,” tweeted BlockTower chief information officer Ari Paul.Others made parallels to bitcoin’s fierce scaling debates – which this year saw several groups split from the main bitcoin blockchain to create new versions of the protocol, in bitcoin cash’s case raising the block size limit to allow for more transactions.Johnson Lau, Bitcoin Core contributor, quipped on Twitter:“We need Ethereum Cash or many kittens would be killed.”In short, ethereum has its work cut out for it.And as usual, whether or not you think CryptoKitties is a positive movement for the ethereum community is colored by whether you support the protocol in the first place.Ethereum supporters have a reason to be excited that an app is finally showing what the platform is capable of, as outlined in a reddit thread, which lauds the game as a successful proof-of-concept.“I’m glad smart contracts are productizing a variety of use cases beyond speculation,” said The Initiative for Cryptocurrencies & Contracts (IC3) researcher Phil Daian, pointing to the bout of speculation generated by the thousands of initial coin offerings (ICOs) that have launched on the blockchain.And Buterin even chimed in, tweeting: “I actually like the digital cat games. They illustrate very well that the value of a blockchain extends far beyond applications that would literally get shut down by banks or governments if they did not use one.”And, as far as scaling ethereum goes, many are glad it’s bringing awareness to the issue – one ethereum user even called it a “blessing in disguise.”Martin Köppelmann, founder of ethereum app Gnosis, echoed that sentiment, telling CoinDesk:“If it is that successful – and even if it increases fees, even better – it will reveal weaknesses of the current tech but ultimately make it better. I’m all for experiments.”Kitty image via CryptoKitties website"

Not only do the orders from Putin mandate new legal structures around cryptocurrency within Russia, they ambitiously establish a plan to use the technology to create a “single payment space” within the Eurasian Economic Union, which features Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia as members.Notably, Russia intends to apply rules for initial public offerings to the ICO use case, through which cryptographic tokens are sold to bootstrap a new blockchain network. Putin also ordered that the government, under Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, develop a system for cryptocurrency miners to register and pay taxes on their income.One of the decrees seems to throw its weight by existing efforts within the State Duma, Russia’s national legislature, as well as the central bank to develop legislation that regulates cryptocurrency activities.It stated:“The Government of the Russian Federation, in conjunction with the Bank of Russia, shall ensure that changes are made to the legislation of the Russian Federation providing for…[the] determination of the status of digital technologies used in the financial sphere and their concepts (including such as “technology of distributed registries”, “digital letters of credit”, “digital mortgage”, “crypto-currency”, “token”, “smart contract” “) [b]ased on the obligation of the ruble as the only legal tender in the Russian Federation.”The Russian government also wants to throw its weight behind efforts by startups to develop new financial services around the tech.One of the decrees mandates the creation of a so-called regulatory “sandbox,” or a framework within which companies can test products in limited settings.

And for good reason. Business-leaders awoke to the reality that the ...","Dec 20, 2017 at 09:00 UTC","Don Tapscott is the co-founder of The Blockchain Research Institute. He has authored over 15 books, including “Blockchain Revolution,” published in May 2016 by Portfolio.","The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2017 in Review.Notwithstanding our admonition in “Blockchain Revolution” that “the future is not something to be predicted but something to be achieved,” a year ago my son Alex Tapscott and I made some predictions for 2017.A key theme was the issue of governance. As we wrote in our submission for CoinDesk’s 2016 in Review, “In 2017, we need to get our act together. Decentralization is critical to this technology and to the future of civilization. But decentralization does not mean disorganization. So, we resolve to focus on governance in the new year.”We also said that, “Investment (in proprietary blockchains) will continue in 2017, but the pendulum will swing back somewhat to the public blockchain space. If the bitcoin community can get its act together and solve some basic governance issues (like scaling), investors will again see it as an attractive play – and with good reason. Bitcoin is still the biggest, most secure, most liquid blockchain to date.”“Bitcoin bad, blockchain good” was heard a lot less in 2017 than in 2016. And for good reason. Business-leaders awoke to the reality that the most ground-breaking innovation in this industry is happening in the permissionless open-source blockchain world, including in bitcoin, but also ethereum, Cosmos, Tezos, Eos and other new platforms. As for bitcoin, there were improvements in governance, and a temporary resolution of the scaling debate acted as one of a few big catalysts enabling bitcoin to resume its upward trajectory.Prediction: “Bitcoin will hit $2,000 (that’s right: one bitcoin will be worth $2,000). Ethereum will not collapse, post-DAO, but will become a dominant platform for new apps and new business models.”What happened: We were ridiculed for forecasting that bitcoin would triple in value. “You guys are nuts,” was a popular tweet.However, only in the wild world of cryptocurrencies can you set a one-year price target implying a 200 percent return, and miss the mark by a factor of nearly 10! As for ethereum, the fork happened and ethereum kept on chugging away, became the de-facto platform for the ICO boom that launched a thousand dapps, from distributed file storage and prediction markets to collectible kittens.Prediction: “A major central bank will live test a digital fiat currency and it will work, very well, leading to broader adoption.”What happened: While some central banks did explore and test the concept of a digital fiat currency, none was able to take the next step and implement it in production and at scale. Indeed, most central bank chatter in 2017 was about bitcoin-mania, with many (India, France, Russia, China, New Zealand, etc.) calling it a speculative asset and some even a bubble.We think this analysis misses the mark. To be sure, bitcoin is hot, but its bigger importance is what it represents: An emerging alternative to central-bank-issued currencies, governed not by a centralized authority but by a combination of math, consensus and clever code. Central bank governors would be wise to better understand what bitcoin represents and what seismic economic and social shifts are driving it, rather than just its price (the same too could be said for all the HODLers out there).Perhaps the most remarkable response was from Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, who said in a speech in February that that cryptocurrencies could, among other things, improve financial stability, inclusion and provide better value than traditional fiat currencies, particularly in less developed countries and warned central bankers to ignore them at their perilPrediction: “Large banks will begin shifting large amounts of over-the-counter (OTC) transactions to real-time settlement on private distributed ledgers. Look for JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Santander to lead the charge.”What happened: Even though the chief executive officer of JPMorgan, Jamie Dimon, asserted that bitcoin is a “fraud,” JPMorgan is one of the most active and innovative banks in this area. It partnered with zcash, a distributed and anonymous cryptocurrency network, to pioneer anonymous transactions in other financial assets like stocks and bonds. It uses the awkwardly named but potentially transformational technology called zk-snarks. JPMorgan was also a co-founder of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, with more than 100 other big firms.As the sun set on 2017, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) announced that securities trading would migrate to a blockchain infrastructure being developed by Digital Asset (run by Blythe Masters). Expect more to follow. As for Jamie Dimon, he doth protest too much.Prediction: “Incumbent companies in every industry will begin developing a blockchain strategy, hiring key IT talent and launching pilots – for sure, insurers, healthcare providers, music labels, defense contractors and others.”What happened: Yes! This happened. Our Blockchain Research Institute is documenting this development in 70 projects in 10 industry sectors.Prediction: “A new round of startups will enter this space in virtually every industry, particularly a new class of platform and middleware companies. From what we’ve seen, the innovation may well be stunning.”What happened: Check!Prediction: “The crisis of legitimacy of democracy (as evidence by the recent U.S. election) will accelerate the development and sandboxing of new e-voting systems and new platforms for accountable democracy emphasizing the use of smart contracts.”What happened: As with the internet’s first era, governments are slow to embrace change. There is experimentation with blockchain for improving operations and some governments (such as Dubai, Estonia, Georgia) are doing large deployments. But when it comes to building new models of democracy based on transparency, accountability, public deliberation and active citizenship through blockchain e-voting, smart votes, and new collaborative tools, most politicians are oblivious.It is no surprise that trust in governments continues to plummet. In the U.S., we see tax changes favoring wealthy individuals and large corporations. The rollback of healthcare, increasing mass gun violence, attacks on consumer and environmental laws, and looming cuts to social services, will undermine prosperity for the vast majority of citizens. Opposition candidates in the 2018 mid-terms must demonstrate that technology can counter fake news, thwart the voter suppression of 2016 and rebuild trust for the digital age.Prediction: “‘Blockchain Revolution’ will continue to be a global best-seller, in multiple languages, and make the New York Times non-fiction list.”What happened: Well, we didn’t make the NYT non-fiction list (yet), but the book is still the best-selling book on blockchain ever, and already translated into over a dozen languages. The book has led to the launch of the Blockchain Research Institute. It is conducting the definitive investigation into the strategic issues in blockchain.  The multi-million program includes 70 projects across 10 industry verticals, including government as well as projects on how blockchain changes the way we manage our companies.Think you can do better than Don? CoinDesk is looking for submissions to its 2017 in Review series.

The remaining funds will be raised by wealthy individuals and other hedge fund managers.Rather than focus on a narrow range of cryptocurrencies, the billionaire intends to invest indiscriminately across the industry, or “play the whole ecosystem,” he explained.In an interview with CNBC’s Fast Money, Novogratz called the emerging landscape a “revolution,” stating:“I never thought I’d come out of retirement but the space is so exciting right now I decided to build a business, hire a whole bunch of smart guys, and we’re gonna to raise a fund … and hopefully take advantage of what I see as a revolution, actually. A decentralised revolution.”As a store of value, Novogratz likened bitcoin to digital gold, and said the technology is beginning to make “more and more sense” as we move increasingly into the digital.Novogratz continued to say that, while bitcoin is a bubble, the mania is justified, because it is a technological advancement that promises to fundamentally alter our lives.

His sentencing – handed down by U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan – came more than two years after he was initially arrested and charged with violating U.S. money laundering statutes.Along with Lebedev, Pastor Trevon Gross was convicted in March, though in the case of Gross, he was charged with bribery in connection with a now-shuttered New Jersey credit union that was allegedly used to channel funds from Coin.mx overseas.According to the prosecutors in the case, Lebedev helped arrange bribes to Gross, including $150,000 in donations to his church. Gross is expected to be sentenced later this month.Bloomberg reports that Judge Nathan said Lebedev used his “impressive technology skills” in order to avoid detection. Lebedev’s attorney, Eric Creizman, described him in court as an “unlikely criminal defendant.”The Florida-based bitcoin exchange Coin.mx was operated as a so-called “Collectibles Club” in order to obscure its exchange activities. Prosecutors had previously tied the exchange to a broader cybercrime enterprise, arguing that Coin.mx served as as a clearing house for funds derived from various criminal activities including a hack on JPMorgan Chase.Another Coin.mx operator, Anthony Murgio, was arrested and charged, along with Lebedev, in 2015. Murgio pled guilty earlier this year on three charges, including one count of wilfull failure to file a suspicious activity report, and was sentenced to five-and-a-half years in prison in June.Man in Jail image via Shutterstock"

fraud in the bitcoin spot markets can both fall under its jurisdiction.","Dec 21, 2017 at 09:00 UTC","Josh Garcia is a fintech and blockchain Lawyer at Cooley LLP, where he helps clients with compliance advice, government enforcement actions and inquiry letters.","The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2017 in Review.The regulators are coming.They have formed committees, subpoenaed documents, studied white papers, and will march into 2018 armed with enforcement actions. These actions will be more in the vein of re-actions, as regulators will attempt to stem the darker tides of cryptocurrency: promises of ludicrous returns, Ponzi schemes, and other obvious violations of securities laws.When the gavel lands, even the best-meaning and most honest developers may have to cope with a rulebook built for criminals.That’s one scenario.Here’s another: Industry leaders take action tailored for a specific business purpose, time and market sentiment. The rest of the industry follows without fully considering the fit for their businesses. This occurred spectacularly as the “ICO” or “token sale” frenzy took off over the summer.Businesses traditionally averse to crypto created and sold blockchain tokens without asking why their business needed access to a distributed network of computers.Regulation through penalties and accidental leadership have both set the industry’s standards to date. This coming year presents an opportunity for a third way forward, where key contributors develop principled standards and encourage their use through a self-regulatory organization (SRO), a certification entity, via new law drafted with regulators and lawmakers or through new frameworks that creatively navigate old law.Regulators turn to regulation by enforcement because the law moves achingly slow.The Administrative Procedure Act requires a notice and comment period between the proposal of a rule and its final publication in the Federal Register (where it carries the force of law). A notice and comment period tends to stretch rulemaking out at least a year.This timeline means every government agency that could potentially issue comprehensive regulation over token sales and the secondary markets, including the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), must, by law, move at the speed of glue.The only way for a guard dog to stay relevant is to bark or to bite. Put more elegantly, a regulator can make its presence known by either pronouncing a new interpretation of old law or putting someone in prison and assessing a hefty penalty.FinCEN barked in 2013 guidance and drew the acceptance and transmission of convertible virtual currencies close enough to take bites at the industry. The SEC barked in its DAO report and warned cryptocurrency exchanges not to list security tokens without the proper registration, and recently warned issuers to avoid promises of exchange listing.The CFTC bit, in a few different places, and now takes the position that margin trading of cryptocurrencies and fraud in the bitcoin spot markets can both fall under its jurisdiction.Regulation by enforcement is not the same as true rulemaking. It is standard setting by fiat. True rulemaking usually involves careful study of a range of issues, serious inquiry into the most pressing and harmful ones, and a principled approach that responsibly resolves the issues or minimizes their occurrence without chilling innovation.Regulators can take a careful, studied approach prior to issuing new proposed rules. Proposals of one regulator often contain upwards of 800 pages of research, summaries of comments and exacting policy positions for each subsection of a new rule.But that process can’t happen through the federal government any time soon.The necessarily slow pace of rulemaking is inadequate to govern rapid advancements in applied cryptography. The industry should view 2018 as a golden moment to set its own standards. The time may pass for the industry to pen a comprehensive set of guidelines with fresh ink. Let that moment slip and regulators will draft rules within the charred outlines of criminal enterprises.To be clear, standard setting through leadership has occurred already. But it has been either reactive or accidental.The reactive standard arrives piecemeal, in response to crisis after crisis. The white hat response to the Parity hack was a prime example of specialists spearheading efforts in a reactive fashion to stop the theft of funds where the government could not.Cryptocurrency exchanges have reacted swiftly and intelligently to customer complaints and flash crashes in the market, offering examples of how to set new standards on the fly.Other standards arise simply because companies desperately want to replicate success. This has resulted in standard-following without introspection. Token sales, mentioned above, have become a fundraising option set to outpace traditional financing in fintech.But many companies selling tokens do not have a good reason for developing on a blockchain. Other companies opt for a Swiss foundation without fully thinking through the operational implications of running a business out of several countries.These practices became the market standard by accident.A mature industry will need a principled set of rules in order to thrive.The best way to develop those rules is to reach out to smart, engaged community members and to seek their input. The Uniform Law Commission did exactly this as it worked with Coin Center to develop a new uniform virtual currency licensing law that could be adopted by all 50 states. We believe Cooley did this as well with the SAFT Project, an open-source effort inviting community input to develop a token sale framework that navigates existing law. The Brooklyn Project is another example inviting public comment.New technology on the horizon will need new standards. Otherwise, newbies will be harmed.For instance, decentralized exchanges have no standards for protecting against spoofing, wash trading or other market manipulation. Open-source software will one day allow anyone to create and trade regulated financial instruments from their smartphone with a few simple taps. New entrants will thus risk exposure to derivatives touted by anonymous sellers as lucrative investments on unregulated markets.The industry can wait for regulators. But even when regulators take the time to think about their rules, they can come up short.Take New York’s BitLicense and compare it against the Uniform Regulation of Virtual Currency Businesses Act. One took industry input that regulators decided in their discretion was either valid or not, while the other had regulators and industry experts working in concert to draft law.Place these two work products side-by-side and see how stark the differences are. Many companies that did found the poorly-tailored BitLicense’s requirements too onerous and decided not to operate in New York. This drove innovation and opportunity out of a key state and into other markets.The industry has a few paths toward principled standard-setting:The market follows leaders. Which means the market can follow itself off a cliff if it isn’t careful.The time is ripe to set principled standards, or the industry risks having regulators and accidents of history set unhelpful standards for all.Have a different idea for the path forward? CoinDesk is looking for submissions to its 2017 in Review series.

Just as online platforms are pushing aside evocative, casino-based settings, they themselves are starting to face big change.The threat – or the opportunity – comes from two trends, one cultural and one technological.On the cultural side, we have the explosive growth of eSports, which now spans a range of online venues, genres and demographics. Analysts insist that the recent surge is a small foretaste of what is to come. There is even talk of them becoming a medal event at the Olympic Games.From technology, we have blockchain. While gambling with cryptocurrencies has been around since the early days of bitcoin (and is expected to grow strongly as customers get more comfortable with the concept), an interesting twist appears to be emerging from platform tokens.Combine these trends with national legislation and economic strategy, and you begin to see a fundamental shift that has the potential to transform a massive segment of the leisure economy.And in the process, it could also give a big boost to the development of distributed ledgers and digital tokens.As an example, this past week U.S.-based eSports betting platform Unikrn got an online gambling license from Malta. This enables it to offer real-money betting to most of Europe, and token-based betting to the rest.What makes this noteworthy is the platform’s new crypto token. A couple of years ago, the company created a platform-only digital token to enable users to place bets on the outcomes of games such as League of Legends. The new version, however, will run on the ethereum blockchain.This means that it can be traded between players, sold on an exchange and converted to fiat money in many jurisdictions. It also points to the emergence of a community of developers that in theory could extend its utility by creating additional apps and add-ons.A more intriguing aspect, though, is the strategy of the Maltese government, and where this could lead.To help offset the decline in manufacturing, the Maltese government over the past few years has focused on attracting technology businesses to the island, offering relatively lenient legislation, low tax rates and lots of sunshine. The efforts have largely centered on the gaming industry, given its potential to foster related sectors such as finance and film.Malta was the first state in the EU to regulate online gaming platforms, back in 2001. Since then, the industry has grown to be one of the world’s largest, accounting for over 10 percent of its domestic GDP.By incorporating the potential for eSports gambling and cryptocurrency tokens into the mix, the island is not only signaling a future-first approach to gaming legislation. It also appears to be setting the stage for a broader development of blockchain technology.To see an example of this strategy in practice, we only need to hop over to the Isle of Man.Like Malta, it was an early legislator of online betting (which grew to account for almost 20 percent of GDP). This, combined with fast internet and a zero percent corporate tax rate, encouraged an influx of technology businesses, which in turn helped to foster a strong cryptocurrency ecosystem. Official support for blockchain technology was not far behind.In 2015, the Isle of Man was the first government in the world to trial a blockchain platform – fittingly, for registering digital currency companies. It was also one of the first to regulate bitcoin businesses. Last year, it became the first jurisdiction to officially recognize bitcoin gambling, and just last month it announced its intention to foster a friendly framework for token sales.Malta appears to be following in the Isle of Man’s footsteps.It recently announced its intention to legalize bitcoin gambling, and last month unveiled a blockchain advisory board to steward its national strategy around the adoption of the technology. It also is contemplating testing the impact of cryptocurrencies on the national economy, and last week revealed a trial for putting academic credentials on the blockchain.However, the potential impact of Malta’s moves is much greater than that of its larger counterpart.Malta is part of the EU, while the Isle of Man (a self-governing dependency under the British crown) is not. Any licensed business domiciled in Malta can offer its services in other EU countries, without needing a domicile in each one.While this is interesting for eSports betting sites such as Unikrn, it could be especially compelling for other cryptocurrency startups. Malta has not yet made an official announcement on digital token sales, but it is likely to be only a matter of time.And its support for blockchain experimentation – both in the private and public sector – points to the development of a forward-thinking ecosystem that in turn will breed further innovation and growth.Who said that big change needs to come from big players?Online gambling image via Shutterstock"

block size increase, ethereum users are requesting a gas limit increase ...","Dec 7, 2017 at 13:30 UTC",Ethereum users are calling for a solution to the protocol’s CryptoKitties invasion.,"As  profiled by CoinDesk, the cat-trading game had grown so popular earlier this week that it was clogging the ethereum network, slowing down transaction times. Now, however, congestion is reaching unprecedented levels, with a record-breaking 30,000 transactions stuck and waiting to be processed at press time.“Can we please increase the gas limit?” pleaded one user on a Reddit thread, itself a chorus of agreement on the issue.“Is the blockchain completely frozen?” asked another user.Indeed, despite facilitating nearly $7 million-worth of ether trades and winning new users to the platform, the game is attracting a level of vitriol: “Fuck cats. When will they solve this problem? I have been waiting for 20 hours now,” said another user on ethereum’s Gitter channel.That’s not to say there aren’t ways to relieve the issue, and, so far, arguably the most likely solution is increasing the network’s “gas limit” – a metric that puts a cap on the number of transactions and smart contracts that can happen across the network.Christian Reitwiessner, an Ethereum Foundation engineer and the co-founder of scaling protocol, Truebit, is one developer who agrees this approach might be an easy solution.He told CoinDesk:“The miners raising the block gas limit is the only short-term solution against our new feline overlords for now.”Yet, while that’s good news for beleaguered users who haven’t been shy about their frustrations, it turns out that the change could have unpleasant side effects, making some developers more hesitant to embrace the concept as the best path to a quick fix.Helping the cause is that there’s already precedent for the approach.For example, this wouldn’t be the first time ethereum has become overcrowded and the network has fallen back on making adjustments to the gas limit. In the past, miners (the stakeholders that have control over setting this cap) have followed developer recommendations to do so.Earlier this year, popular initial coin offerings (ICOs) led to a glut of transactions on the network and developers encouraged miners to raise the gas limit by about 33 percent.But according to Ethereum Foundation developer Nick Johnson, increasing the gas limit again “isn’t likely to be practical” today.Johnson told CoinDesk that raising the gas limit could also boost the so-called “uncle” rate, where blocks are added to the blockchain temporarily but later rejected. Currently, the uncle rate on ethereum is around 30 percent of blocks, and he believes a further increase could be to the detriment of security, since users could interact based on transactions that will later be rejected.The operator of ethereum’s largest mining pool, Ethpool, drew the same conclusion.“Increasing the gas limit will likely make the current situation even worse,” a spokesperson for the pool said on social media, adding:“Without substantial improvements … I don’t think increasing the gas limit further is feasible right now.”The arguments are uncannily reminiscent of the debates raging over bitcoin scaling. Similar to the way many bitcoin users and businesses have argued for a block size increase, ethereum users are requesting a gas limit increase so as not to ruin the user experience of quick, inexpensive transactions.Meanwhile, developers of bitcoin, and now ethereum, argue other long-term scaling solutions are best, but could take some time.Indicating the complexity of the situation, CryptoKitties’ head of community, Benny Giang, hasn’t yet taken a stance on the gas issue, saying the firm trusts miners to “do what’s best for the network.”“We obviously don’t want them to do anything that will compromise the value of the network,” Giang added.That said, developers haven’t told miners to increase the gas limit yet, and instead, they’re brainstorming other short-term solutions.Johnson suggested that “performance improvements” might help reduce the uncle rate, even if the gas limit were raised. However, he added that those measures would require clients develop and release new software, which could take time.Others argued that users could always increase the fees added to their transactions, which would push them through faster. But already, it costs $1 to initiate a transaction to make simple things happen within the CryptoKitties game, and users are likely to be turned off by higher costs.Still, while this is all up for discussion, it’s possible a temporary solution could come by on its own.Believing CryptoKitties can’t sustain its current level of interest forever, Reitwiessner said he believes the best route might be to accept it as a short-term issue.He told CoinDesk:“There has to be a point where the cat supply can satisfy the cat demand (I can’t believe I’m writing these words), and this will probably crash the cat prices and thus, also the interest in the game.”BugKitty image via Nick Johnson’s blog"

There, Jimoh indicated that the Central Bank of Nigeria is preparing a white paper on the subject.Perhaps most notable, however, was how Jimoh framed the reason for the study, noting the central bank “cannot stop the tide of waves generated by the blockchain technology and its derivatives.” Such comments carry extra weight coming from the institution that oversees domestic monetary policy as well as banking sector regulation.In his remarks, Jimoh also noted that the nature of the technology, which gives users autonomy over the private keys that access blockchain-linked data, enables the creation of forms of money that are “beyond restriction and confiscation.”Elsewhere, attendees surveyed at the conference painted a generally positive picture of how the technology is progressing domestically. Other topics addressed included how blockchains can help move payments across borders, and the investment risks associated with the nascent technology.Dr. David Isiawe, president of the Information Security Society of Nigeria, also spoke to the general consensus, when he was quoted as saying the technology is a reality that must be faced by the country’s leaders “whether we like it or not.”Such comments also coincide with a growing acknowledgment of the technology in Nigeria, and the issues with a relatively immature market. So far this year, domestic regulators, the Central Bank of Nigeria included, have issued two warnings about the technology.Nigerian money via Shutterstock"

Originally launched as Realcoin and later rebranded, Tether aims to serve as a proxy for the US dollar that can be sent between exchanges, notably including Bitfinex, Poloniex and other markets without fiat trading.In response, Tether said it would move swiftly to ensure these exchanges do not trade or otherwise introduce the stolen funds back into the cryptocurrency economy.The company wrote:“$30,950,010 USDT was removed from the Tether Treasury wallet on Nov. 19, 2017 and sent to an unauthorized bitcoin address. As Tether is the issuer of the USDT managed asset, we will not redeem any of the stolen tokens, and we are in the process of attempting token recovery to prevent them from entering the broader ecosystem.”Notably, the company said that it is releasing a new version of the Omni Core software client (which Tether runs on top of) in a bid to effectively lock up the tokens it alleges were stolen. Should nodes in the network adopt the software, it would effectively blacklist the stolen address, enacting an emergency fork to contain the funds.Representatives from the Omni Core software project said they would seek to release new software in the coming days that will allow Tether to retrieve the stolen tokens.Observers online spotted the move earlier today, stoking speculation about the nature of the freeze.“The tether.to back-end wallet service has been temporarily suspended. A thorough investigation on the cause of the attack is being undertaken to prevent similar actions in the future,” Tether wrote.The announcement comes amid a period of growing discussion – and controversy – around Tether.Under scrutiny has been the unclear relationship between Tether and the troubled British Virgin Islands-based bitcoin exchange Bitfinex – and long-standing allegations the exchange has been using the asset to engage in fraud and market manipulation. Complicating matters is that the two companies are said to share a common ownership, though details remain murky as to the exact nature of the connection.As such, today’s hack claims are likely to further drive the controversy, which began following Bifinex’s hack last August, in which it lost more than $70 million in customer funds.Following the news, other exchanges that offer order-book trading on Tether have taken steps to freeze trading, with China-based Huobi and OKCoin announcing the move shortly after the post.CoinDesk will continue to monitor this developing story.Keyboard with dollar overlaid via Shutterstock"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Nov 1, 2017 at 20:35 UTC",New Zealand’s finance regulator has released new guidance on initial coin offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrencies.,"In a statement published last week, the New Zealand Financial Markets Authority (FMA) outlined the ways in which token sales would be covered under national law. Notably, the regulator said that, in its view, any cryptocurrency or ICO-derived token would be considered a security.The FMA said:“All tokens or cryptocurrencies are securities under the [Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013] – even those that are not financial products. A security is any arrangement or facility that has, or is intended to have, the effect of a person making an investment or managing a financial risk.”Citing that law, the agency went on to say that tokens could fall into one of four financial product categories – debt securities, equity securities, managed investment products or derivatives – depending on their characteristics.That said, the FMA left the door open to additional classification for such offerings, through which the technology can be used to bootstrap a blockchain network through the sale and release of tokens.“If appropriate, we can designate any security to be a particular financial product based on its economic substance. For example, a project token giving investors voting rights and a share in the company and its profits could be designated an equity security,” the agency wrote.The published materials also include guidance for businesses working with the technology.For major cryptocurrency services — such as wallets, brokers and exchanges — the FMA argues it does have a category for all of these services, and such companies should be appropriately registered.Additionally, the agency suggested that it could provide exemptions from current laws to companies in an effort to “promote innovation and flexibility.”The FMA said:“We can grant exemptions to promote the FMC Act’s objectives. One objective is to promote innovation and flexibility in our financial markets. We can also, if appropriate, grant exemptions to ensure FMC Act requirements are fit for purpose for ICOs.”When reached for comment, a representative for the FMC said that the agency was seeking to strike the right balance between market oversight and allowing for new kinds of products and services to take shape.“Our aim is to encourage responsible innovation, balancing innovation against consumer protection and ensuring the regulatory regime remains relevant and agile,” the representative said.New Zealand flag image via Shutterstock"

Based on the most aggressive estimates for the advancement of quantum computation, private keys might be cracked as early as 2027, their paper says.Bitcoin encryption today is ensured by the difficulty of cracking its code using existing computers, but quantum computers will theoretically be able to work much faster because they are not constrained to working with bits (values that are either 0 or 1). Quantum computers use qubits, which take advantage of the very strange ways subatomic particles behave to contain more values (or even two values at once).As first reported by the MIT Technology Review, the researchers investigated quantum computers’ application against both mining pools and using the machines to attacks private keys. Miners will be safe for longer than wallets, the researchers contend.The greatest danger for bitcoin users will come when transactions have been broadcast to the network but not yet processed, according to the paper.An attacker with a quantum computer is likely to be able to change the transaction before the legitimate one goes through, the researchers found.Settled transactions will remain safe, at least for a while. Even a paradigm-shifting computer is unlikely to be able to change the ledger after several blocks have been processed.If private keys are compromised, that’s not just bad news for cryptocurrency. It would expose anything else that uses public-private key encryption, such as messaging apps, SSL certificates and data storage.As the researchers acknowledge, this finding holds true provided nothing changes in the way private keys are created. They write:“Many presumably quantum-safe public-key signature schemes have been proposed in the literature.”However, their discussion neither completely endorses nor dismisses any of the proposals.This summer, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania also proposed ways in which more robust private keys could stymie these new machines. And, as has been argued, quantum computers might also develop much more slowly than the researchers have modeled.Tesla coil image via Shutterstock."

Put differently, is a ‘cashless society’ a sound outcome?”The paper goes on to explore six different supposed benefits to a central bank for issuing a digital currency, but largely dismisses all but three: payments for consumers, financial inclusion and stability.For consumer payments, the authors write that a “CBDC would facilitate transactions that are currently foregone because of frictions that inhibit some types of transactions.” In particular, it would reduce friction for online payments and entice smaller merchants to offer services over the internet. In some economies, they also see benefits in reducing costs for retail payments to consumers.The authors argue that financial inclusion would only really benefit in developing economies, though it cites several other existing solutions around the world (such as Africa’s M-PESA system) that seem to be closing the gaps just as well as digital currency could.“Financial inclusion does not provide a compelling motivation for CBDC in most advanced economies, including Canada,” they write.Lastly, the paper gives mixed results for improved financial stability.On the one hand, “the financial systems in Canada and other countries feature highly levered banks conducting liquidity and maturity transformation and operating at the core of the payment system,” the authors write. “It is well known that under some conditions this set-up can be unstable, and in severe cases the stock of inside money can contract, with adverse negative externalities for the economy.”Digital money would give consumers a largely risk-free way to store value without exposure to that risk. On the other hand, the ease of leaving bank deposits for a fiat crypto could accelerate financial turmoil.The paper represents the views of its writers and does not necessarily reflect that of the Central Bank of Canada.Canadian money via Shutterstock."

His recent writing has ...","Oct 31, 2017 at 13:30 UTC","When Scott Adams announced his company would embark on an initial coin offering (ICO) on his blog Friday, he wrote without sarcasm that the day might be one of the “biggest” of his life.","Quite the statement from the creator of the beloved Dilbert comic strip, readers may be surprised given Adams’ recent, pointed take on blockchain mania. But far from just lampooning the technology, Adams is gearing up to get firsthand experience of how it can be used for fundraising.WhenHub – a time visualization firm co-founded by Adams – is now preparing to launch a token of its own, preceded by an offering of Simple Agreements for Future Tokens, or SAFTs.The project, according to Adams, allows subject matter experts to sell small amounts of time to clients, who will consult in a Skype-like video call session over the platform, the WhenHub Interface Network (WIN). The new product will facilitate auctions and payments, a system that would be built on top of ethereum using smart contracts, taking the tedium out of payments and invoicing.In interview, Adams explained that he went through much the same process as everyone else: going from asking “What the hell is this?” to having days where he kind of started to get it and others where he could see the bigger picture.Adams told CoinDesk:“Once you see different applications for the blockchain, you start to see: This is way more than I ever imagined.”Adams went on to explain his recent strips about blockchain aren’t intended to inspire others to write off blockchain tech.Rather, he said, they have been inspired by how difficult it can be to explain the technology. In this way, he reasons the comics reflect the way it feels when someone understands something very new and they have to talk to someone else who doesn’t.“This is based on a real technology that I think you can say is tried and true,” Adams said. “It’s not like a management fad … It’s more like the internet in the early days.”Bitcoin, in particular, has impressed Adams because “the secret inventor merged technology and persuasion,” he said. His recent writing has focused heavily on the latter topic, including a new book, “Win Bigly,” on how Donald Trump convinced voters to elect him president.Later on, Adams would use similar wording when discussing how bitcoin took advantage of the psychology of scarcity, hipness and greed to convince people to adopt it and treat it like it like gold.“It’s one of the greatest pieces of persuasion the world’s ever seen,” Adams said.WhenHub’s CTO arrived at blockchain after creating previous products that helped people conceptualize and manage time, such as calendar management, timeline visualization and meeting coordination.Adams said:“As the world often goes, you start with one good idea and then you discover others that might be more fun and more profitable to chase.”The company held a hackathon early in the year in which one of the entrants included a blockchain element in his not-quite-completed project. It came to mind for another WhenHub co-founder, CTO Nik Kalyani, when he was speaking to a consultant friend about the struggle to find that next client after completing a project.WIN will now allow skilled people to squeeze revenue from gaps in their schedule, while enabling consumers to get knowledgeable answers to very specific questions. Adams said he could have used WIN recently when he spent six months trying to set up a live-streaming studio in his home that could work on all the platforms, such as Facebook and Periscope.“There are just some things you can’t Google,” he said.An hour with someone who has set up a lot of such systems, he continued, would have saved him a lot of time and headache.Adams, too, says he gets lots of requests for his time, but finds it difficult to manage all the requests. When he does sit down with people, “most times they have 15 minutes-worth of questions,” he said.So experts on WIN can post increments of time as small as 15 minutes on their calendar, setting a minimum price for a consultation. Clients interested in talking to them can then bid for the time slot, and the winning bid is permitted to connect with the expert.After WhenHub verifies the session took place, client funds are released to the expert via a smart contract.Equally important to the network will be its custom cryptocurrency.An ERC-20 token built on top of ethereum, WHEN will manage payments between experts and clients on the WIN platform. By creating its own token, the company is able to seed early adopters with rewards for participation for useful activity without the need to spend fiat money to buy ether to provide those incentives.“This is a case where the token is marketing as well as technology,” Adams said. “The two worlds collide.”Early experts on the platform will be rewarded with tokens for doing things like completing their profile, linking it with social media (such as LinkedIn) and getting their identity verified with WhenHub partners. Provided they do a good job and manage to attract clients, those seed rewards will start to take on real value.The company has devoted 26 percent of the total pool to drawing influencers onto the network.Adams expects the earliest adopters to be people with technological skills, though he also expected that counselors of various kinds might use the service as well.“I would be amazed if sex workers don’t find this, because they find everything,” he added.Going forward, WhenHub aims to sell enough tokens to fund the company’s operations for two-and-a-half years, which Kalyani estimated will require about $35 million.Of the total 875 million tokens, 350 million will be offered via a SAFT, according to its white paper. The pre-sale is open now, with a minimum investment of $50,000, and a token bonus of 30 percent.A public sale will open on Nov. 10 and run through the end of the year, with a minimum purchase of $250. Early buyers in the public sale will get a token bonus as well.Still, for those sitting on the sidelines, Kalyani was keen to note that the team believes WHEN tokens could also end up finding a place in other products, hinting at a larger strategy in mind that he believes might continue to make it compelling.Kalyani concluded:“We’ve always had this vision to solve problems with time.”Scott Adams image via VLAD TV/YouTube"

The CFTC is working very hard to provide a suitable response to that question.”That lack of clear-cut rules in this area – a result of existing regulations clashing with new technologies and the products they facilitate – is what led to a $75,000 settlement in June 2016 for cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex amid allegations by the CFTC that it did not properly deliver funds to customers.And it was that enforcement action that subsequently sparked a petition by U.S. law firm Steptoe & Johnson LLP to address the matter. In July of last year, the law firm asked the CFTC to provide regulatory clarity regarding the definition of “delivery” in the context of transactions conducted using blockchain-based assets.While Quintenz didn’t offer a clear timeline for release of its proposed rules, he did say that they would be subject to open debate by both the agency itself and its private-sector advisory committee.“Once a proposal comes forward, I expect to request the [Technology Advisory Committee’s] input and feedback as we work to provide regulatory consistency with other commodities … as well as regulatory certainty within which a more constructive trading environment may develop,” he said.Elsewhere, Quintenz called recent media coverage around bitcoin “terribly misguided.”In recent days, a number of notable Wall Street figures and financial analysts have taken aim at the cryptocurrency market, with Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman joining Dimon by offering negative perspectives on the technology.According to Quintenz, those views – particularly about market speculation – miss the point.“Certainly, we can all debate the value of bitcoin – whether it is overvalued, undervalued, or a ‘fraud’ – but that price-based conversation misses bitcoin’s broader technological and innovation achievements entirely,” he said at the event, adding:“One of the most fascinating aspects of bitcoin is not that it’s a virtual currency. It’s that it’s an ecosystem.”Those characteristics – and the benefits and risks they bring – present both challenges and opportunities for regulators like the CFTC, he argued.“But it is important for us as regulators to be aware of the diversity of these potential ledger ecosystems, from the narrow and mostly private to the very broad and incentivized, so we can appropriately estimate risk and regulation,” he said.CFTC image via Shutterstock"

The price per dollar of ether oscillated wildly in the run up, before rising over 2 percent following activation to $348, according to CoinMarketCap data.First introduced in the ethereum roadmap in 2015 under the name of Metropolis, that large-scale upgrade encountered some substantial delays, leading it to be broken into two phases – Byzantium and Constantinople (the latter still having no formal release date).As Byzantium was a planned fork with minimally contentious changes, there’s been very little disagreement among the community about the merits of the code changes included in the upgrade. However, the fork is still notable in that it’s ethereum’s first major upgrade since interest in the technology skyrocketed this year, which has been largely correlated to the popularity of ICO tokens launched using ethereum’s ERC-20 token standard.The process was at times a little sticky, though, with ethereum developers encountering some pretty nasty surprises in the run-up to the deadline.Over the last few days, Byzantium-enabled ethereum software was continuously retracted due to critical bugs found in the code. Developers pushed out corrections just in time – but not without seriously considering postponing the fork.According to blockchain analytics website Ether Nodes, nodes running faulty software are currently 65.3 percent Geth and 30.4 percent Parity, the two main ethereum clients. As previously detailed by CoinDesk, the faulty software could cause a consensus issue, leading the network to partition, or expose the platform to denial-of-service attacks.However, so far, there is no sign of a minority fork according to current fork logs, and developers are celebrating the transition on social media.CoinDesk will continue to monitor this developing story.Yellow mosaic image via Shutterstock"

And second, and perhaps more interesting in how it aligns with the organization’s possible ICO, is the company’s emphasis on learning how to utilize blockchains itself.To that end, UNICEF’s work has largely focused on open-source public blockchains like bitcoin and ethereum, the latter of which, through its ERC-20 standard is responsible for the recent influx of ICO tokens. The organization began accepting ethereum donations to its own ethereum address in August as part of a study on smart contracts and has raised about $600-worth of ether at current prices.UNICEF is now running what Fabian believes is the first public ethereum node managed within the U.N., and this is primarily a mechanism to learn more about the tech.“We’re using that because we think it’s important for our team to understand [ethereum smart contract language] Solidity and kind of have a sense of what an ERC token looks like, how that would work,” Fabian said.Under the guidance of their first blockchain lead, Qusai Jouda – who previously designed software for wellness startup Lighter – UNICEF has developed a series of curricula on blockchain generally and ICOs specifically.Previous classes have focused on what Fabian calls “the less speculative token work that’s being done,” such as the one-off reconnaissance being carried out by the World Bank and U.S. State Department.But UNICEF’s classes aren’t just for beginners. Rather, they’re primarily designed to explore whether the venture firm could “invest in companies that would provide a crypto return,” thereby providing better liquidity on investments.ICO or not, UNICEF is already starting to build out a network of blockchain startups to invest in. Last November, the agency invested $99,000 in South Africa-based TrustLab, which is building identity and social development tools with blockchain.Then, earlier this year, UNICEF became a founding partner in the IXO Foundation, a spin-off of the protocol design part of TrustLab aimed at making the vast amounts of data that could flow through a blockchain more easily measurable.“If it works as expected,” Fabian said, “we hope that [UNICEF] would have a protocol that we might be able to apply to other parts of our work at UNICEF for monetizing some of the collection of data that we do.”Currently, UNICEF’s investments are limited to $100,000, though it has raised $12.6 million to invest from limited partners including the governments of Denmark and Finland, and public conglomerates like Disney.According to Fabian, UNICEF is in the final stages of putting out a call for blockchain startups, and expects to fund as many as 10 of them, bringing the maximum amount invested to over $1 million.Fabian said:“We believe that a lot of the places where this particular technology can be applied to global scale come out exclusively when you have the public, permissionless blockchains.”UNICEF tent image via Shutterstock"

the ...","Dec 8, 2017 at 09:00 UTC","Kyle Samani is the co-founder and managing partner of Multicoin Capital, a new thesis-driven crypto fund that invests with a multi-year time horizon in blockchain tokens.","Basically, all token pitches include a line that goes something like this: “There is a fixed supply of tokens. As demand for the token increases, so must the price.”This logic fails to take into account the velocity problem.In this post, I’ll explain the velocity problem by providing an in-depth example. Then I’ll examine mechanisms that reduce velocity.Ticket fraud (literally reprinting and selling a ticket multiple times) for events is a huge problem. There’s a reasonable case to be made that tickets for live events should be issued on blockchains. If venues come to accept blockchain-issued tickets, this solution should stomp out all fraud. You can’t double spend blockchain-based assets.Issuing tickets on blockchains can bring other benefits, including disallowing resale, profit sharing on resale back to the venue, capping resale amounts, etc. Ticketing on-chain should create a lot of value for venues, artists and consumers: it eliminates fraud, reduces scalping, and reduces fees to middlemen like Ticketmaster and StubHub.Although I love this use case for blockchains, there is no reason that I, as a full-time crypto investor (speculator), want to actually hold Aventus, Ticketchain or Blocktix tokens (all three are blockchain-based ticket issuance platforms). Even if these platforms become widely used and process tens of billions of dollars of transactions, their underlying token mechanics are not structured so that the price of the underlying token will materially appreciate.Consider a hypothetical platform that we’ll call Karn, in honor of the show that never ends.Consumers want to pay for tickets denominated in dollars. They may purchase Karn tokens as part of the ticket acquisition process, but they won’t hold the tokens for more than a few minutes at a time. There’s simply no incentive to hold them and incur price risk relative to the dollar.Venues also don’t have an incentive to hold Karn tokens because they, too, want to avoid price risk. After consumers trade their tokens for concert tickets, venue hosts will trade Karn tokens for their preferred currency. Note that this cycle can be completed in seconds by leveraging decentralized exchanges such as 0x.No one actually wants to hold Karn tokens. The presence of a proprietary token actually creates a worse UX for consumers by introducing an unnecessary layer of friction into the ticket purchasing process. The moment anyone receives Karn tokens, they exchange them for something else – either a ticket (consumer) or dollars (venue).Even if Karn becomes the global standard for ticket issuance, no one will want to hold it. BTC/ETH/USD-denominated trading volume for Karn tokens may skyrocket as the platform becomes the global ticketing standard, but the price will grow sub-linearly relative to transaction throughput.The primary stakeholder group who will profit from the rise in trading volume of Karn tokens will be market makers who provide liquidity for those entering and exiting the market. This is not a bad thing. As asset pairs increase in volume and become highly liquid, bid-ask spreads collapse to near 0 percent, which is good for consumers and venue hosts.To be clear, in this scenario the venue hosts still win by cutting out scalpers, and consumers win because of increased fraud protection. But despite delivering real, tangible benefits to marketplace participants, our fictional Karn token won’t actually capture the value the protocol is creating.Here’s where velocity comes in. I define it as follows:Velocity = Total Transaction Volume / Average Network ValueTherefore:Average Network Value = Total Transaction Volume / VelocityVelocity can be measured over any time span, but is normally measured annually. Trading volume can be difficult to measure. This not only includes trading volume that occurs on exchanges, but over-the-counter trades and actual usage of the platform.We can say that an asset has a velocity of 0 if, over the course of a year, no one buys or sells it. The lack of liquidity would cause the asset to trade at a discount to its “intrinsic” value. Assets need some velocity to achieve their full intrinsic value. The difference is known as the liquidity premium.In the case of a proprietary payment token that nobody wants to hold, velocity will grow linearly with transaction volume. Per the second equation above, transaction volume could grow a million-fold and network value could remain constant. Almost all utility tokens suffer from this problem.There are a few ways a protocol can reduce the velocity of its associated asset.1) Introduce a profit-share (or buy-and-burn) mechanism: For example, the Augur ($REP) network pays REP holders for performing work for the network. REP tokens are like taxi medallions: you must pay for the right to work for the network. Specifically, REP holders must report event outcomes to resolve prediction markets. A profit-share mechanism reduces token velocity because as the market price of an asset decreases, its yield increases. If the yield becomes too high, market participants seeking yield will buy and hold the asset, increasing price and reducing velocity.Also, a cash-flow stream makes a token easier to value using a traditional discounted cash-flow (DCF) model. 2) Build staking functions into the protocol that lock up the asset: This includes proof-of-stake mechanisms for achieving network-layer consensus. However there are far more compelling reasons to stake than simply to achieve node consensus. For example, FunFair is a platform that powers online casinos. FunFair only supports one-against-one games such that the player is playing the house directly (therefore no poker). The house must maintain reserves to pay out highly unlikely events, such as a user winning big in slots or winning 10 times in a row in blackjack. The casino operators will need to lock up far more than 50 percent of all tokens.3) Balanced burn-and-mint mechanics: Factom is the best, and perhaps only, example.A number of protocols have implemented the burn concept (without minting), notably FunFair. I am highly skeptical of currencies that are explicitly deflationary to create upwards price pressure on the value of the token. In the long run, deflationary currencies will create weird incentives for holders, causing unnecessary volatility due to excessive speculation. Burn-and-mint addresses this problem.In Factom, the cost of using the protocol is denominated in U.S. dollars at $.001. Each use is $.001, regardless of the price of FCT. Users burn tokens to use the protocol as designed. Independently, the protocol mints 73,000 new tokens each month and distributes them to validators (Factom is its own chain, not an ERC20 token). If users don’t burn 73,000 tokens in a month, supply increases, which should exert downwards price pressure. Conversely, if users burn more than 73,000 tokens per month, supply decreases, exerting upward price pressure. In the long run, there should be linear relationship between the usage of protocol and price.The burn-and-mint dynamic is possible because Factom is its own chain. ERC20 tokens do not have network validators who can be compensated via inflation. Burn-and-mint is possible for ERC20 tokens, albeit trickier. There’s not a generic, obvious set of network participants who should receive the tokens that are generated by inflation. Also, more technically: inflation is tricky to implement because smart contracts cannot run as daemons that auto-inflate; they must be triggered.4) Gamification to encourage holding: Let’s revisit ticketing. Since many concerts sell out quickly, venues could prioritize customers based on having held X tokens for Y days. If enough venues adopt this mechanic, velocity will fall.Another example: YouNow is rolling out a proprietary in-app cryptocurrency called PROPS that allows users to tip content creators during live video broadcasts. YouNow also has a “discover” tab. The YouNow service is more likely to rank a creator’s content highly if they hold tokens. This creates an interesting dynamic in which content creators are paid in PROPS, but need to convert to fiat to pay the bills. On the other hand, they want to hoard tokens to become more discoverable, fueling more attention and generating more tip-based income.5) Become a store of value: This is by far the most difficult to achieve as it’s not a function of a specific design mechanic, but rather a question of broader technical viability and market acceptance. If people genuinely come to believe in a token as a store of value, there will be a significant probability that they’re willing to hold onto excess tokens rather than sell them for something else.One reason to hold an asset is an expectation that it will increase in price. In theory, this should dampen velocity and drive up the price of the asset. This basically defines bitcoin today. Bitcoin’s value is a function of a speculative value game, not from intrinsic utility as a payment system.Another reason to hold an asset is the expectation that its value will be stable. A number of stablecoin projects such as Maker and Basecoin are trying to create trustless assets that are price-stable on the open market.Becoming a general-purpose store of value is extremely difficult. There are only a handful of projects even attempting to fulfill this vision today. It’s not clear how dominant the long-run winner will be. You can make perfectly rational arguments for a handful of currencies with 20–30 percent of global value each, a 75-5-5-5-5-5 percent split, or an 80-20 percent split. Although money has a strong network effects, it’s not clear how strong those effects are, or how much the market will demand viable competition to mitigate macro-level risk associated with a single mega currency. Velocity is one of the key levers that will influence long-term, non-speculative value. Most utility tokens don’t provide a compelling reason for token holders to hold the token for more than a few seconds. Absent speculation, assets with high velocity will struggle to maintain long-term price appreciation. Hence, protocol designers will be well served to incorporate mechanisms into their protocols that encourage holding, not just usage.Gas pedal image via Shutterstock"

Further, this system would be automated, establishing the exchange rate between the two currencies based on external data feeds.The patent describes a potential three-part system, where the first part would be a customer’s account and the other two would be accounts owned by the business running the system. The user would store their chosen cryptocurrency through the customer account.The second account, referred to as a “float account,” would act as a holding area for the cryptocurrency the customer is selling, while the third account, also a float account, would contain the equivalent amount of the cryptocurrency the customer is converting their funds to.That third account would then deposit the converted funds back into the original customer account for withdrawal.The proposed system would collect data from external information sources on cryptocurrency exchange rates, and use this data to establish its own optimal rate.The patent notes this service would be for enterprise-level customers, meaning that if the bank pursues this project, it would be offered to businesses.According to the patent:“Enterprises may handle a large number of financial transactions on a daily basis. As technology advances, financial transactions involving cryptocurrency have become more common. For some enterprises, it may be desirable to exchange currencies and cryptocurrencies.”The proposed system could also evaluate transactions for potential illicit trades, calculating a risk score based on the amount of cryptocurrency being transferred and any other information available, according to the patent.Transactions which look illegal would not be allowed to process, the patent says.Bank of America has been looking into cryptocurrencies for years, filing another patent in 2014 to create a cryptocurrency-powered wire transfer system.That system would allow users to transfer funds by converting the sender’s local currency into a cryptocurrency, sending it to a foreign exchange, and then converting it to the destination country’s currency.Bank of America image via Rob Wilson / Shutterstock"

But while a whole slew of startups is developing ethereum solutions for everything from social media to file sharing, none have yet to see a large, mainstream audience.Apart from CryptoKitties.An internet-based game for buying, selling and breeding adorable digital kittens, CryptoKitties has found itself in the center of a pop culture storm. Many have lauded the app for giving new users an easy, fun way to learn about cryptocurrency protocols, but others are strongly opposed to the app, which has been the cause of serious backlogs and rising transaction fees on the network.But there’s another issue with CryptoKitties that’s being increasing called to attention: namely, your kitty isn’t as decentralized as you think.As least, that’s the contention of some critics, who claim CryptoKitties, like World of Warcraft before it, is under the control of a central authority. Widely heralded as an unprecedented success for ethereum, questions have now begun to emerge about whether it’s at the sacrifice of the  fundamental concept of the project.What’s to stop the owner of the CryptoKitties smart contract, Kitty Core, from editing the algorithm and mutating a kitty against the will of its owner? According to its skeptics, not much.As bitcoin developer Udi Wertheimer, asked Vitalik Buterin on Twitter:“Did you read the cryptokitty contract? Ownership can change, owners can shut down the system at any time, and replace the contract arbitrarily.”Because CryptoKitties is built on top of ethereum, many in the community assumed it was a dapp.But that’s not the case. Rather, the game is run within a centralized database, and mostly operates from one internet portal – the CryptoKitties website itself.In this way, CryptoKitties has a central point of failure – one of the key reasons there is such enthusiasm for blockchain technology. With a decentralized model, if one company shuts down, others are there to pick up the slack; if a handful of servers go offline, others are there to keep the software running.CryptoKitties critic and Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd told CoinDesk too much power is in the hands of the app’s creators.“It’d be like if I sold you a cat, but then took away your ability to interact with it, see it, etc. For all practical purposes, you’d no longer have a cat,” he told CoinDesk.Adding to this, while the majority of the CryptoKitties code is open source – long touted as a key to decentralization – there are a few commands that have been kept hidden. For one, the genetic algorithm which creates the kittens is concealed, which according to the CryptoKitties team “is what makes games like this fun.”Those in the crypto space might not agree, especially since the execs at the firm have the power to halt this contract at any time, possibly inducing a wave of narcolepsy throughout the market.Another quirk in the code allows the COO to create up to 5,000 copies of any kitten at any time, and although it’s unlikely that Kitty Corp would deliberately sabotage its players, if a malicious actor hacked into their systems, there could be either a purge or an overpopulation of the furballs.As Philip Daian, developer of security-focused smart contract programming language Viper, emphasized on Twitter:“I hope you guys realize you are placing a huge bounty on a contract used to breed virtual cats. The cryptokitty hackpocalypse will be very real, and deadly.”Even Buterin took to Twitter to comment on the current version of CryptoKitties, arguing that he believes it’s a step in the right direction.“It’s not close to fully decentralized in its current form,” he said. “But I think people see that it can be.” And, if necessary, Buterin later tweeted: “I suspect the community will just hard fork the kitties.”Still, someone could build a third-party software protocol to interact with CryptoKitties, since enough of the open-source code is public. This also means the the game’s contract could evolve into new species – frogs for example.Irrespective of the aspects of the code that aren’t public, Parity representative and CryptoKitties enthusiast Afri Schoedon said, “Nobody can prevent you or me or anyone else building your own ‘CryptoFrogs’ game on top of the CryptoKitties logic.”And in his mind, that’s as decentralized as CryptoKitties needs to be.“All important logic is hosted on the ethereum blockchain in smart contracts,” he told CoinDesk.Schoedon defended the centralized aspects of the game, explaining, “they just reserved the right to keep some proprietary stuff centralized and host it on some web server for the convenience of a huge user base that never interacted with decentralized applications or ethereum before.”Kitty Corp representatives echoed those comments, saying the company’s primary intention was to make the game accessible for people new to crypto.And decentralization will come with its trade-offs.Speaking to CoinDesk, Griff Green, founder of decentralized charity Giveth, said that, currently, “the options for creating a truly decentralized application are very limited and in the end impractical.”When it comes to user experience, Green said, “trying to run an app on the ethereum blockchain without using some help from central servers is UX suicide.”In a  blog post, the Kitty Corp team reflected on the issue, stating:“Completely decentralizing CryptoKitties would have resulted in a game that wasn’t as fun, and we would have crippled our efforts to bringing blockchain to the masses.”CryptoKitties image via Shutterstock"

analog gold, and ether disrupts the function of the stock markets and ...","Oct 11, 2017 at 10:45 UTC",A first-of-its-kind investment product focused on ethereum is now open to investors on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange.,"Announced today, CoinShares, headed by former JPMorgan Chase trader Daniel Masters, is launching an exchange-traded note (ETN) for ether, the cryptocurrency that powers the ethereum blockchain. With the news, the ETN joins CoinShares’s original bitcoin ETN offering, launched in 2015, in bringing a well-used mechanism from traditional markets to the world of cryptocurrency.ETNs function similarly to exchange-traded funds, except rather than give investors access to a basket of assets, they generally give investors exposure to just a single asset.In this way, more conservative investors wary about putting their money into funds that invest in multiple cryptocurrencies (some very new and yet to prove their use case), can invest now in only ether or bitcoin, the two cryptocurrency projects with the most market traction.A principal at CoinShares, Masters framed the company’s interest in ETNs as stemming from its belief that people should have “hassle-free exposure” to the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.Masters told CoinDesk:“Bitcoin disrupts the functions of analog money and analog gold, and ether disrupts the function of the stock markets and the process of forming capital.”The announcement is notable given that XBT Provider, which is wholly owned by CoinShares, currently holds a substantial cryptocurrency portfolio.The firm recently announced a bitcoin position of 58,451 BTC — which, at current market prices, is worth over $250 million. (CoinDesk has seen a signed letter from CoinShare’s Hong Kong-based custodian attesting to the size of their position.)As for what makes the product unique, Masters said the fund will differ from actively traded options in that it will be “100 percent passive.”Prices between the ETNs and the underlying coins will be about 99 percent correlated, Masters said, meaning that since the ETNs are based on a derivative product, the price of the notes and ether may not be the same at all times. Investors in the product can realize their profits (or losses) by selling their ether ETN in the open market. Masters further added that his firm’s ether-based ETN does not use any leverage. However, depending on which platform an investor uses to purchase the ETN, it may be possible to apply leverage through the investor’s broker. This option generally hasn’t been available to investors purchasing ether and bitcoin on cryptocurrency exchanges, and shows the growing interest in the more sophisticated investment mechanisms that are prevalent with more traditional assets. While the new ether-based ETN is being marketed exclusively to European investors for regulatory reasons, anyone with access through their brokers to NASDAQ Stockholm will be able to purchase the product from a technical, market access perspective.Moreover, Masters told CoinDesk, that using a broker’s platform to purchase the ETN may allow investors to hold exposure to ether in a retirement account, which may, under certain circumstances, result in a tax-advantaged tax treatment for the ETN in certain jurisdictions.Ethereum image via Shutterstock"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Dec 3, 2017 at 15:30 UTC",Aruba is looking to blockchain to take power from travel monopolies and keep tourism revenue on its sandy shores.,"No small matter for the Caribbean island, Aruba relies heavily on tourism – with a population of a little more than 100,000, it sees 1.2 million visitors every year. But with the travel industry dominated by the likes of Expedia and Priceline, a few online travel agencies (OTAs) and airlines all controlling pricing, a significant amount of Aruba’s tourism revenue gets shipped offshore.Now, the organization responsible for fostering the island’s technical development, the ATECH Foundation, is looking to change that by working with Swiss startup Winding Tree on a blockchain marketplace for travel booking.Rather than the status quo, the ATECH Foundation would like to use Winding Tree’s platform, built on ethereum’s public blockchain, to connect tourists directly with travel suppliers, in an effort to eliminate all the middlemen.And eliminating the third parties in tourism could be especially beneficial for smaller nations, Varelie Croes, ATECH Foundation co-founder, told CoinDesk.“A platform like this can help countries like Aruba … bring back some of the profits and tax it and actually keep the income at home,” she said, adding:“The impact is significant to the economy.”If the blockchain system works, it would have a significant effect on Aruba’s bottom line, she continued.The island has been investing heavily in new technologies for some time in an effort to make it better prepared for the future. Its Smart Island Strategy for the tourism industry, for example, has piloted biometric checks at airports and embraced renewable energy.Blockchain has been of particular interest in its search. Most notably, the island is exploring its own digital fiat with cryptocurrency startup Bitt, and Aruba’s Central Bank believes this could boost the island’s GDP.But while blockchain’s potential for travel and tourism businesses has been much-vaunted (Winding Tree has previously inked a deal with major airline Lufthansa), its Aruba project is on track to be the first fully implemented blockchain-based marketplace for travel.Winding Tree will start beta-testing the platform with early adopters early next year, with the hopes of launching commercially by the end of 2018, first with hotels and later with airlines.But the benefits aren’t only Aruba’s; the island’s small size makes it an ideal area for exploration.Winding Tree can “use Aruba as a playground for rolling out this new technology on a nationwide basis,” said Croes.The startup has already secured Australian hotel management software firm RoomRanger as a partner, and also plans to announce a major European hotel group in the coming weeks.Croes concluded:“This is beyond Aruba, it can have a significant impact on small economies.”Aruba image via Shutterstock"

As a result, Bitfinex has decided to assert all of its legal rights and remedies against this agitator and his associates.”The move aligns the world’s largest bitcoin exchange – a company mired in controversy and shrouded in secrecy – with one of the most prominent law firms in the digital currency space.Based in Washington, D.C., Steptoe is the counsel for the Blockchain Alliance, a public-private forum created two years ago to exchange information between the industry and law enforcement in the service of fighting crime.Reached by email Monday, the blogger, who uses the handle Bitfinex’ed, said the exchange has “knowingly filed frivolous lawsuits in the past which they had no intent on completing,” and cited as an example Bitfinex’s lawsuit against Wells Fargo, which was withdrawn in April.Stepping back, Bitfinex, incorporated in the British Virgin Isles, has close ties to Tether, the Hong Kong-based issuer of a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency. While Tether says it fully backs its eponymous tokens, Bitfinex’ed has accused the company of issuing more tethers than it can redeem and using them to fund margin trading on Bitfinex, thereby artificially pumping up the price of bitcoin.He or she has also claimed that Bitfinex allowed and benefited from wash trading (an illegal activity in which an investor simultaneously buys and sells an asset to create a misleading impression of market demand) on the exchange, and that it misled customers and investors on other matters.Bitfinex’ed has made these and other claims in a series of often lengthy and highly detailed posts on Medium, Twitter and YouTube, which have been widely shared on cryptocurrency social-media circles.In its statement, Bitfinex did not specify who exactly it might sue, on what grounds, or in which jurisdiction.“I think you can infer who,” said Ronn Torossian, the public relations specialist recently hired to represent Bitfinex and Tether.Further, the Bitfinex statement goes on to suggest that those making the assertions might be engaging in “market manipulation” – broadly, the same thing Bitfinex’ed accused the company of.“In recent months, certain parties and their associates have made false and unsubstantiated claims against Bitfinex, engaging in potential market manipulation activity that is dishonest and unlawful,” Bitfinex said.Correction: This report has been updated to reflect that Bitfinex withdrew its lawsuit against Wells Fargo in April, not August. Statue of Justice image via Shutterstock"

But as has been clear ...","Dec 6, 2017 at 17:00 UTC",A co-founder of Wikipedia doesn’t like what Wikipedia has become.,"Dr. Larry Sanger has been an outspoken critic of the online encyclopedia he helped found for some time, but his latest move, joining venture-backed startup Everipedia as its chief information officer shows just how serious he is about disrupting the model.Revealed today alongside news of Sanger’s hire, Everipedia is moving the entire process of approving articles, making edits and storing information to the EOS blockchain.According to the Everipedia team, using smart contracts to record the editing workflow and store articles stands to create a truly censorship-proof system. And by incentivizing contributors with a cryptocurrency token, the company hopes it can create a platform for more accurate information.In interview, Sanger explained his decision to join the startup as part of what he considers the next evolution of online encyclopedias.He told CoinDesk:“The biggest problem with online information today is that it is centralized and controlled by a very few players, that it benefits to have the most salacious and hype-ridden information. We can do much better.”In an unpublished draft of Everipedia’s white paper provided to CoinDesk, the company details how this move to blockchain might create an improved Wikipedia.Instead of a centralized server, content would be hosted by nodes – similar to how bitcoin’s ledger of transactions is held. But as has been clear throughout this year’s scaling debates, many of the largest blockchains in the space would face significant challenges storing the amount of data needed for an online encyclopedia.In an effort to steer clear of those hurdles, Everipedia explored a number of platforms to host the smart contracts that execute the logic around contributing and editing articles, including the Plasma framework designed for ethereum.In the end, however, the startup settled on a combination of the EOS blockchain unveiled in June and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) — a sort of decentralized server — that will be used to store the more data-heavy files including video and images.Also using the EOS blockchain, the company plans to develop a cryptocurrency token called IQ to incentivize the creation of content. Editors and curators will then “mine” that cryptocurrency by making accurate, valuable contributions to the encyclopedia.“Just like miners who find blocks get newly minted bitcoin, these editors who are voted to have a very good state-change proposal get newly minted tokens,” said Everipedia co-founder and white paper co-author Sam Kazemian.According to the white paper, which hasn’t been formalized, 50 percent of the total 100 million “IQ” tokens will be distributed in an initial coin offering (ICO) and 30 percent will be “minted” over 100 years to pay out editors and validators for their work.To supplement $1 million the company previously raised from Mucker Capital, an additional 20 percent of the tokens will be set aside to pay development costs.Similar to the mission of many blockchain startups, Everipedia set out to eliminate the bureaucracy the startups’ founders thought allowed a relatively small number of people to be gatekeepers on Wikipedia.The founder and CEO of Everipedia, Theodor Forselius, argues that contrary to Wikipedia’s original mission to tap the wisdom of the crowd, the online encyclopedia’s editorial hierarchy has resulted in a slanted view of history and a decreasing number of editors.“Essentially, a doctor from the 1800s that gets five searches a month on Google could have a Wikipedia article,” said Forselius. “But bloggers, social media stars and up-and-coming rappers that are getting hundreds of thousands of searches a month were not seen as notable enough.”Yet, Everipedia’s ostensibly more democratic process hasn’t always resulted in numbers or accuracy to compete with Wikipedia. For instance, whereas Wikipedia offers 43 million pages and has about 136 million active users, Everipedia only has about six million pages and 2.3 million unique users.While there’s a long way to go, Sanger believes the company can implement a blockchain solution to rival Wikipedia in as little as nine months.“The vision that I have for the next stage of the evolution of encyclopedias is what this team is implementing,” he said, adding:“It opens up so many doors when information is truly decentralized and offered in a protocol such as blockchain.”Dr. Larry Sanger image via Everipedia"

The following example is loosely based on a product now actively available in the market, but greatly simplified to make its terms and conditions easier to parse.CoinDesk assumed a $100,000 investment in a fund with a vanilla “two and 20” fee structure that earns a 10 percent gross return.While the example below is just that – one example – it can still be a helpful metric to aid you in your evaluations. After all, while a cryptocurrency hedge fund may be appealing – it should also be compared to the pros and cons of your own active management.The first point to understand when looking at a fund is the management fee, which is what you pay upfront as soon as you invest in the fund.The typical management fee is 2 percent on every dollar you invest. As an example, let’s say you’ve found a fund with a solid strategy, and it has a minimum investment of $100,000. This means that on your $100,000 investment, you would get charged $2,000, meaning you’re only “putting to work” $98,000 in the investment.Right off the bat, that’s money that won’t be going directly into the market, and in cryptocurrency, where there have been historical benefits to holding, that might be something to consider.Still, that might not necessarily be a deterrent. Let’s say at the end of the year, the fund generates a 10 percent return, as in this example, you could end up with a potentially attractive profit.Depending on what you were expecting, you may be thrilled or you may be disappointed – but, either way, you’re probably not done paying fees yet.In the most basic analyses, there are two kinds of fees that hedge funds charge their investors: management fees, like the 2 percent discussed earlier, and “incentive fees” that are applied to profits.In a typical, vanilla fund scenario, investors pay around 20 percent fees on their returns. These fees are usually called incentive fees because they seek to align investor returns with the compensation of the fund managers.The percentages charged on incentive fees are typically far higher than management fees, which makes sense, because the fund’s managers or general partners are being rewarded for their product’s performance. So, the greater the return that fund managers make for their investors the greater the fees they earn for themselves.Let’s continue to assume that the fund you invested in generated a 10 percent gross return. Since you earned 10 percent profit on your investment after management fees, the gross return, before the incentive fees were charged, would be $9,800.A 20 percent fee charged against your gross return means another $1,960 in fees get assessed.So, adding it all up, you would pay a total of $3,960 in fees on your investment in the fund.Let’s take a look at the investment from a different angle — the rate of return you received on your investment.After the management fee and incentive fees get charged, investors would receive a $7,840 net return on their investment, or a 7.84 percent rate of return for the year.Whether or not that fits the bill with your expectations, is up to you as the investor. As mentioned above, given the extreme volatility of the cryptocurrency markets, there can be upside or downside in putting your money to work directly on available exchanges.Still, if you’re looking for exposure to a very volatile market, and you’re not interested in doing the legwork required to actively manage your own portfolio, the above example should give you a better sense of the potential costs – and possible returns.$100 bills image via Shutterstock"

Shavers case, I had the opportunity to speak at several locations, and to consult with a lot of businesses. Each time, I would calmly explain that initial coin offerings, so-called ICOs, were securities offerings.The response would range from outrage to unmeasured vitriol.I recall speaking in Las Vegas at a conference put on by Oracle. There, I answered questions from the audience, and later in the hallway a man who helped found ethereum, came up to me and said something along the lines of, “Dude, what’s your deal, are you a fed or something?” My answer was simply, “No. I just don’t want everyone to be surprised when regulation comes down hard.”His response, “Well, they haven’t done anything yet, so that means they aren’t going to, right?” “No,” I replied simply.The discussion that followed was the same one I’ve had with many over the past couple years. They have to believe that they’ve found the magic secret to get around law and regulation. That the ultimate “AH HA!!!” happened is a dream has haunted many companies I’ve spoken with.I simply reply that:“The government is patient. The government has rules and regulations and unions. The government is not comprised of caffeinated coders that work 100 hours in two days whilst flaming newbs in chatrooms. The government has a process, and that process must be followed.”As The DAO was contemplated, I recall, specifically, having a phone call with a prominent New York bitcoiner who was gloating that The DAO had solved the Howey Test and that regulators were finally out of crypto.I disagreed, explained horizontal and vertical commonality, and noted that under several cases, including my personal favorite, SEC v. Glenn Turner, these were securities. There was nothing but laughter on the other end of the phone.*Sigh.* Then The DAO imploded.In January 2017, I attended The North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC) and sat on a legal panel with Drew Vander Hink and Adella Toulon-Foerster in the bathroom hosted by Chris DeRose and Junseth (then Bitcoin Uncensored) and moderated by Tone Vays.I must have sat on three or four panels that weekend on the air, and figured out that through a show I could reach more people and give them the advice they NEEDED – not the advice they wanted. I started with Charlie Shrem and that ridiculous Jason Granger Mainstreet Investment and didn’t look back.I dedicated about an hour each week to breaking down ICOs and explaining how they violated securities laws or how the terms and agreements were scams.I did it all for free as pro-bono work for the industry. … doing “God’s work” as Marco Santori once commented to me about my efforts with Shavers.Then, it happened, July 25, 2017. SEC Release 81207 – Report of Investigation Pursuant to 21(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934: The DAO. (*note – the SEC spent nearly two pages discussing how SEC v. Glen Turner applied)I went on the air that night and started taking calls and having discussions with various luminaries in the bitcoin world. Rhiana came home from the store while I was on the air and walked into my tiny home office carrying a cake.On the top of the cake it read, “I’m Sorry I was Right.”I laughed so hard I had to take a break. I then ate cake for the next two hours live on the air. I ended the show with my usual closing, “I’m not your lawyer, but I could be…”Since that date, I’ve advised dozens of ICOs on proper formation of utility and software tokens and am defending an SEC inquiry into an ICO from last year.I’ve worked with clients all over the world. I’ve advised legislators, drafted proposed regulations, spoken with prime ministers and visited countries I honestly didn’t know existed. It’s been a hell of a ride.I-told-you-sos aside, you may be wondering where ICOs go from here.Hard to say. I’d like to see legitimate offerings taking advantage of the quick and easy systems set up by regulators, but it seems more often than not, ICOs want to skirt regulation and dare the SEC to come after them. That’s not the best way to go.I think part of the limitation of legitimacy is that there are very few markets in existence or on the horizon where security tokens can be traded, and using those exchanges means having to identify yourself as an investor.The anonymous nature of crypto also works against compliance.I think, as I suggested many times over the past year, if the industry regulated itself, if the exchanges actually had requirements for listing (other than whether or not the coin can pay the listing fee) – like some form of diligence and verification of legitimacy – we might move in the right direction.But, in my opinion, so long as there are venues for trading ICO coins, there will be less incentive for the related projects to use a registered and compliant exchange.I hope to be wrong.Counterpoint? CoinDesk is open for opinions as part of our ongoing 2017 in Review.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Oct 16, 2017 at 04:01 UTC",Big Blue is making what could be considered its first public foray into cryptocurrency.,"In the kind of unveiling that can only come before one of the biggest events in global finance, IBM is revealing today at Sibos 2017 the results of a partnership with blockchain startup Stellar in which it successfully settled real transactions using the company’s custom cryptocurrency, lumens.While currently limited to cross-border payments involving British pounds and Fijian dollars, the early-stage platform is nonetheless designed to scale to handle seven fiat currencies in the South Pacific – including the Australian dollar, the New Zealand dollar and the Tonga pa’anga.Perhaps the platform’s most distinguishing characteristic, however, is that the project showcases how private and public blockchain technologies are increasingly being used in tandem. While IBM’s blockchain solutions are designed to complete much of the workflow around transaction clearing, the actual settlement will be conducted using Stellar’s blockchain.In this case, Stellar’s lumen serves to digitally connect fiat currencies, allowing for nearly instant exchange without the consumer or buyer ever touching the cryptocurrency itself.Stellar founder Jed McCaleb told CoinDesk:“When trading between multiple currencies, it helps to have a bridge currency to reduce the ledgers needed to maintain. Lumen provides that single ledger that can bridge currencies.”Taken together, however, this partnership goes beyond just technical implications.Not only is the partnership an outside-the-box move for IBM, which has largely focused on its own blockchain platforms, it’s a big win for Stellar, which having emerged from the Ripple founding team hasn’t had quite the same growth, perhaps attributing in part to its focus on developing markets.The partnership is also evidence of the extent of collaboration between blockchain firms and the wider financial world. To make the project work, IBM had help from partners including National Australia Bank, TD Bank and Wizdraw (HK) of WorldCom Finance.The payments themselves are conducted for the Advancement of Pacific Financial Infrastructure for Inclusion (APFII), an organization of member financial institutions founded by the United Nations and Swift, and operated by KlickEx, a privately-held direct clearing provider that specializes in cross-border digital remittances.According to IBM’s vice president of global blockchain development, Jesse Lund, getting all these players to work together is just an extension of IBM’s mission to collaborate with financial institutions to develop a blockchain ecosystem.To that end, the platform is already integrated with IBM’s Financial Transaction Manager, which itself is integrated with ACH, SEPA and other electronic transaction networks. Going forward, APFII’s confirmation receipts are expected to be published as MT103 Swift messages directly to the blockchain.“This in many ways is just an extension of that, wherein we’re providing, in collaboration with banks, and in the process developing this blockchain ecosystem,” said Lund.For now, the new project is also a balancing act – at once both a small advancement of early-stage technology and an aspirational advance toward more lofty goals.While the trial with APFII has been ongoing since last week, the CEO of ClickEx, Robert Bell, said it’s too early to provide any numbers about transaction volume. But still, he expects as much as 60 percent of the cross-border retail market in the region to be transacting on the platform once all seven currencies are added (the Australian dollar will be the next currency integrated).“For the first time, blockchain is being used in production to facilitate cross-border payments in multiple integrated currency corridors,” Bell said.IBM also sees the demo as one with implications for the digitization of central bank money – a concept that’s gotten a significant amount of attention recently as central banks around the world grow more interested in figuring out how the technology could create efficiencies.“Our long game is to support multiple different types of digital assets,” said Lund, adding:“And I’m very confident that you will be seeing central banks coming forward with their own digital asset issuances that will be a much more formidable construct of this model.”Today, that future will be discussed in greater detail on stage at Sibos in Toronto, where a panel with representatives from IBM, TD Bank and CLS will discuss the project with the CEOs of both Stellar and KlickEx.“It’s going to be a wild ride,” Lund said, concluding:“We’ve got the bankers and the renegades altogether.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.Fiji dollar image via Shutterstock"

speculation, and that speculation is undermining cryptocurrency use as ...","Oct 13, 2017 at 17:45 UTC",An all-star cast of investors has backed a little-known startup behind a token called basecoin.,"Scheduled to debut with a white paper release on Tuesday, the project, the first from Intangible Labs, boasts investors including 1confirmation, Andreessen Horowitz, Bain Capital Ventures, Digital Currency Group, MetaStable Capital, Pantera Capital and PolyChain Capital.Hailed as an evolution of the “stablecoin” concept, basecoin is lauded by investors for its unique approach to what’s been called the “holy grail” of cryptocurrency – a digital asset able to keep its value free from volatility. A draft white paper obtained by CoinDesk details the concept, which outlines a blockchain with the built-in “brains” to manage monetary policy.At a high level, the idea is that the basecoin protocol can be pegged to the value of any asset or basket of assets, dynamically adjusting its market price through the creative use of a combination of tokens.As explained in the white paper, the idea is that the protocol would be set up to mirror an asset or an index, say the U.S. dollar or the Consumer Price Index, at which point it would use oracles (links to trusted, external data sources) to monitor exchange rates. The protocol would then automatically expand or contract its supply of tokens to maintain its value.Polychain’s Ryan Zurrer hailed it as an “elegant system,” with other investors heralding that the idea could have both short and long-term implications – in the near-term, providing an alternative to fiat currencies for crypto traders, and in the long run, serving as a tool for maintaining the stability offered by today’s centralized monetary systems.The former problem was one addressed by Joey Krug, the founder of Augur and a Pantera partner, who spoke to how basecoin could ease issues he’s faced as a developer.“One of the problems this space faces is volatility; no one is going to want to use Augur if you’re right about a prediction, and the price of the reward goes down overnight,” he told CoinDesk.Indeed, Intangible Labs founder Nader Al-Naji, who quit his job at Google in July to pursue the project, described stability as the main benefit the protocol would bring to the market.He told CoinDesk:“Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies are a bit of a playground for speculation, and that speculation is undermining cryptocurrency use as money. The fact that it’s volatile and that there’s speculative value is a blocker to mainstream adoption. We tell people we’re trying to be used as medium of exchange.”In this way, the cryptocurrency project is notable given the extent to which the basecoin team – comprised of Al-Naji, as well as fellow Princeton graduates Lawrence Diao and Josh Chen – draw inspiration from traditional finance.“Basecoin would present the world with both the technology and the opportunity to develop an independent, transparent and potentially more stable monetary policy than anything that’s ever been possible via central bank,” the white paper reads.According to Al-Naji, the company has still to determine how it would launch the protocol – namely, if individual protocols would be needed for each stablecoin, or if a single version of the blockchain could manage many different types of fixed-cost assets.Either way, investors are keen on a share of the coins, in whichever version they appear. Intangible Labs is said to have completed a small and highly competitive capital raise, and will soon be opening a pre-sale of its coin.An original version of its draft white paper indicated the startup is also considering an initial coin offering (ICO) as part of its release, though those involved declined further details.But, that’s not to say any sale would even be limited to a single cryptocurrency.As outlined in the white paper, basecoin aims to differentiate from past iterations of the stablecoin concept by using a combination of tokens to replace the centralized management that has been needed to maintain their stability.The basecoin team, for example, took aim at Tether in its paper, itself recently the subject of criticism for fluctuations in its U.S. dollar peg. “Tether’s $400 million market cap proves the need, but it is also completely incapable of serving it long term,” the paper asserts.Most interesting about the critiques, though, is that the basecoin team offers what appears to be a novel take on how a better system could be achieved.Namely, to regulate the supply of its tokens, the basecoin protocol itself is made aware of the market capitalization of its cryptocurrency, the demand for the coin and the number of coins in circulation. Further – as the different tokens are used to offer different incentives – they seek to naturally create an equilibrium that keeps the price stable.The first – basecoin – is the cryptocurrency that powers the system. Pegged 1-to-1 with the value of the U.S. dollar, it serves as the most user-facing of the three tokens, in that it’s the one exchange traders and other users would interact most directly with.The second and third cryptocurrencies, “base bonds” and “base shares,” are those that underpin basecoin. Base bonds are tokens to be auctioned off programmatically by the blockchain when supply needs to be reduced, and these will expire within a time frame to encourage redemption.“When you buy a bond you pay for it with coins, which get taken out of circulation, decreasing supply. And the reason why you like that bond is that it converts back into coin at some point in the future. You’re hoping in the future you’ll get back a return on what you put in, you want your coin principal plus some coin interest,” Al-Naji explained.Base shares, on the other hand, provide a fixed-supply cryptocurrency that does not have a peg.Rather, they gain value through a dividend policy, whereby holders receive new basecoins that are created if and when the token supply needs to be increased.As for how these coins will be managed, however, that remains less clear.Al-Naji said that the team is now working on a “yellow paper” that he estimates is about “80 percent” complete and that will detail the technical specifications of the basecoin blockchain, including aspects such as how mining will function and how consensus will be reached.In contrast, Al-Naji framed the three different tokens that will underpin the protocol are more mature in ideation. Going forward, he said that the team is also working on a “robustness analysis” that will showcase the conditions under which the tokens can be expected to maintain their desired stability.“You can think of this as economic research. It aims to prove this actually works and that the pegs stays put no matter what under the assumptions,” he said. “That’s really mature.”Still, taken together, Al-Naji was keen to portray the project as not simply another token built amidst the recent ICO craze. Al-Naji said that he has been studying bitcoin since 2012, when he began considering how to apply monetary theory to the technology.The end result, he said, is a sophisticated take on how public distributed ledgers and tokens could come to replace some of the more advanced aspects of the current monetary system, which he framed as corrupt due to human error.“The key thing that we’re doing is that there’s no central authority. This is totally decentralized, even the exchange rate is decentralized via oracles, which makes it extremely difficult to corrupt the supply of money. It’s a much more robust way to do the policy,” he said.Given these weaknesses, the authors go so far as to predict basecoin could “displace U.S. dollars in transaction volume” due to the fact that it would (in a sense) leverage the Federal Reserve’s work on maintaining a stable asset to bootstrap its value.It also projects that, should its peg prove reliable, the protocol could be used for “salaries, loans, futures contracts, options contracts and more.”Far from far-fetched, the authors believe they are likely to find a large market of cryptocurrency traders eager to act as early adopters, which will provide an onramp into other markets.In line with criticisms about the sector from thought leaders, the authors think basecoin could one day even be adaptable to serve a similar function as central banks.The paper concludes:“In this future world, governments would do well to support cryptocurrencies that are stable in the face of macroeconomic upheaval. In fact, citizens may even demand it.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Intangible Labs.Image via Basecoin website"

The first sale is for the Fan-Controlled Football League which, according to its website, is seeking to create a user-driven model for American football teams.Specifically, in the case of FCFL, investors (both accredited and non-accredited) purchase Simple Agreements for Future Tokens (SAFTs), with the tokens set to be delivered at a later date. The mode has been used by a number of ICOs in recent months, and according to the page on MicroVentures, $915,000 has been raised from nine investors thus far in the new ICO.[Update: The company has said that it aims to host both non-SAFT presales as well as actual token sales on the platform.]The launch is a notable one given Indiegogo’s size and influence in the crowdfunding platform ecosystem. Indiegogo first went live in early 2008, and the development comes more than a year after it moved to offer access to equity crowdfunding.Through this lens, Indiegogo is positioning itself as a new hub for ICOs – specifically, those that are compliant with U.S. regulations around securities.In statements, the startup said that the move to embrace ICOs was a natural fit given its crowdfunding work to date, noting:“For us, this is simply another way of doing what we’ve been working on for the past decade. … We’re ready to become the go-to platform for selling and investing in digital tokens and blockchain-based assets, and we can’t wait for you to join us.”According to The New York Times, Indiegogo is working with law firm Cooley LLP on the initiative.

tokens where genuine value is created, will remain viable over the long ...","Oct 18, 2017 at 08:00 UTC",Joe Pindar is the director of strategy in the office of the chief technology officer at security firm Gemalto. ,"In this opinion piece, Pindar argues that the recent token craze is a blip, and that blockchain technology remains more important in the long term than any currency.If you attend investment conferences or talk to long-time industry analysts, it’s clear that that the general cryptocurrency market bubble is unsustainable.There were 30 initial coin offerings (ICOs) in July, each launching new cryptocurrencies. Then, in August, there were more than 50, with marketing and investors ranging from Floyd Mayweather to Paris Hilton.Now, part of this mania is based on speculation. But it’s also clear that we’re departing from the fundamental assumption of what a cryptocurrency originally is – a scarce digital commodity where the value derives from that scarcity.Simply put, if more than 100 new sources of this digital commodity have been launched since the summer, then the entire concept of scarcity, and therefore value, begins to erode. In fact, many of these new cryptocurrencies will need to fail in order to maintain the viability of the best-known currencies, bitcoin and ether.Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has been around for two years, so it’s a relatively known quantity. Most of the recent ICOs are based on the ERC-20 ethereum token, and the primary purchasing mechanism for new cryptocurrencies has been ether, the currency of the ethereum network.Therefore, an investor often needs to buy ether in order to buy into any of the new ICOs.But the crypto bubble of lesser-known currencies will pop at some point, leaving some people in a bad spot. Even so, the core technology behind it, blockchain, will provide value as a hidden infrastructure underlying future applications.A small number of currencies – likely bitcoin and ethereum – and utility tokens where genuine value is created, will remain viable over the long term – although not necessarily at the current prices.The fundamental premise of cryptocurrency, if it’s not a scarce digital commodity, is that it is a token that allows access to a utility service. One of the few valid tokens that have been launched recently is IOTA, which is targeted at the Internet of Things market.However, it’s hard to justify building an IoT application using IOTA when surging token prices mean the cost of doing blockchain transactions doubles in seven days or increases by 500 percent over the course of a month, as it has recently done.While IOTA has a strong long-term future, the ability to use it for IoT applications depends upon removal of the speculation-driven volatility. This shows the disconnect between the value proposition of utility tokens and the trading prices.This is also a reminder that it’s essential to separate blockchain technology from cryptocurrencies.It is entirely possible to run a blockchain without a cryptocurrency, as demonstrated by Metrognomo, which predates and takes a similar approach to IOTA, but uses a subscription payment for nodes publishing to the network.Another example is Quorum, JPMorgan Chase’s permissioned, minimally-forked ethereum network, designed to promote private transactions for the enterprise.So, even though a blockchain can be very useful for securing distributed systems and businesses, it does not justify the fundamentals of any cryptocurrency.Blockchain’s future is bright, just maybe a little less glamorous without the get-rich-quick investment aspect.Frozen bubble image via Shutterstock"

Strategic investor Don Wilson, the founder of asset trader DRW and a co-founder of blockchain startup Digital Asset, will also join BitGo as an advisor.Announced today, the fundraising caps a transitional year for the veteran bitcoin startup, which was founded to serve businesses back in 2013 – long before this year’s influx of institutional money helped drive the currency to record highs.As a result of that market maturation, BitGo turned a profit for the first time this year. Based in Palo Alto, CA., the firm was building institutional products when most other startups in the space were focused on bringing bitcoin to the masses.With clients such as CME Group, which is expected to launch a much-anticipated bitcoin futures product next week, BitGo now facilitates a total $8 billion-worth of bitcoin transactions per month, charging a fee on each one.In an interview, BitGo co-founder and CEO Mike Belshe discussed the firm’s long path to achieving profitability and scoring one of the largest venture capital raises in the blockchain industry.All this time, Belshe said:“We’ve been behind the scenes plotting away, building a bigger, better system.”When BitGo was founded, it focused on enabling businesses to securely use bitcoin with wallets that require multiple cryptographic signatures to access.But over the years, the company has evolved to meet an institutional demand for both “hot” (online) and “cold” (offline) storage of six currencies, including bitcoin, ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash.With the new investment, Belshe said the company will be able to expand that pool of currencies by “at least” three in 2018 – and perhaps more importantly, to more quickly on-board new currencies that result from forks of existing ones. Currently, adding these spinoff currencies can sometimes take days or weeks to accommodate.In addition to supporting new currencies, Belshe indicated that BitGo intends to invest in helping develop and implement scaling solutions, such as the Lightning Network, “that are able to drive off-chain payments” – something he says is crucial to helping his corporate clients build at scale.Lastly, Belshe spoke in broad terms about “a number” of other opportunities that will be explored as a result of the additional funding.One area he mentioned specifically included services that could be offered as a result of BitGo having a bird’s-eye view of where transactions are coming from and going to.“What we see now is a big opportunity ahead,” he said. “We know that it’s going to take some strong growth, and we are aligning the resources that we need to be able to capitalize on that.”BitGo was born the same year bitcoin’s price surged from less than $100 to more than $1,000, before beginning a long slow decline in the wake of the Mt. Gox exchange collapse.As the industry emerged from that trough, largely due to retail purchases at exchanges like BTCC, Coinbase and Kraken, the institutional investors BitGo courted largely stayed on the sidelines.“We had a quiet 2014, a quiet 2015, 2016 started to grow a little bit, but still pretty quiet,” said Belshe. “Then 2017, finally traditional finance and institutional investors are here. They are looking around desperately for, what do they do?”Surviving a hack of one of BitGo’s largest clients in 2016, the company went on to become profitable for the first time earlier this year, largely thanks to a single revenue stream: the transaction fees charged to those using the hot wallets. A less significant amount of revenue comes from cold storage.While the privately held firm isn’t sharing actual revenue or user numbers, Belshe said both are “strong,” enabling BitGo to double the size of its team from 20 employees in January to 40 today.In spite of the patience Belshe and his team seem to have exhibited over the past few years, he maintains a humble stance when explaining this year’s rapid expansion, saying:“The industry has grown, and it’s made us strong with it.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in BitGo, BTCC, Coinbase and Kraken.Mike Belshe image via CoinDesk archive"

Citing recent controversies surrounding Facebook, he went so far as to discuss how some of the same technologies he created have been leveraged in unintended ways, such as by political organizations in efforts to sway elections.“The message here is that in these things we build [on the web], there is a time for creativity; there is a time for consortia working together; and there is a time of consequences,” he said.Berners-Lee told the audience:“And we have to think about the consequences.”Elsewhere, Berners-Lee hinted at what he sees as the vision for a world powered by blockchains, noting how he foresees banks in different countries using the technology to enable safer transactions.But still, he returned to the idea entrepreneurs interested in creating these applications must think about the future and how that technology could affect humanity and the economy.“Great things could come of it,” he said. “But maybe you’ll end up producing huge waves of crime.”It’s an interesting forewarning given the associations between cryptocurrencies and illicit activity, such as the drug trade and money laundering. But he suggested the admonition should be heeded by those building private blockchain projects, as well.Overall, the message was clear – we can never quite tell how technology will be used.Of course, Berners-Lee also noted the work he is helping spearhead toward this goal.Berners-Lee, who is now director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), develops standards in an effort to keep the internet open and neutral, and already, there is work going on inside the W3C on blockchain.Ripple, through its hand in the Interledger Protocol, for instance, is part of the W3C’s Web Payments Working Group, and there are other API initiatives being developed with the technology in mind.But according to Berners-Lee, neither blockchain or standards that support them are magic bullets that will solve all the world’s problems, especially the hackers, prying eyes and government spying that have hindered experiences on the web.“Moving everything to blockchain and Tor will give us a false sense of security,” he said.Instead, Berners-Lee advised advocates to engage in constructive discussions with governments, regulators and companies, and to even encourages protests, if warranted.He concluded:“Make banners and signs and protest in the streets; we had to then, we’ll have to again.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.Tim Berners-Lee image via Bailey Reutzel"

While it is set to be prepared by the Department of Defense – which has explored a number of applications in the past – the final product is likely to include input from other federal agencies and departments.And though it constitutes a minor element in major funding law, the measure, proposed by Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, could help spur investigation into possible blockchain uses within the U.S. government, some observers say.“Blockchain was clearly one of the technological capabilities that Congress meant for agencies to look at, and what they were trying to do was create dollars with some flexibility to them so that agencies would have their own discretion on what they invest in,” Trey Hodgkins, senior vice president of public sector at the Information Technology Industry Council in Washington, D.C., told CoinDesk last month.Image Credit: lev radin / Shutterstock.com"

You see huge opportunities, but what we’re talking about today, it’s much more of a speculative platform, people are speculating on it.”Fink added that, thus far, his firm hasn’t seen much interest from clients beyond “some speculative stuff” – a notable comment given that firms like Goldman Sachs are reportedly eyeing new trading services around cryptocurrencies.“We’re being asked that question but it’s more of a venture capital type of interchange, but we’re not hearing clients say ‘we want to use this as an asset class’,” he said.And while cryptocurrencies’ speculative nature is an issue for him, Fink argued their most important problem is that they are being utilized to launder money.“As I said, it’s much more of a speculative platform for Asia, and it’s heavily used for money laundering,” Fink told Bloomberg.Image via Bloomberg/YouTube"

For instance, the People’s Bank of China has deemed the creation of a fiat-based cryptocurrency a “crucial” financial development.But still, the National Bank of Ukraine gave a more detailed vision of its undertaking to create a “national digital currency,” that makes its work less theoretical than others.According to Smolii:“National bank of Ukraine is looking forward to implementation of e-hryvnia based on blockchain technology. We consider blockchain as the next step in evolution of transactions technologies, which will become more popular and widespread during the next decades.”The central bank formally began working on a blockchain-based system in November 2016 to develop a “cashless economy.”While the results of the earlier research were not disclosed, Smolli told CoinDesk, the project is now “focused on studying the ability of the central bank to establish [an] operational e-hryvnia solution which would be available 24/7 and easy-to-use for all stakeholders.”In this way, the central bank is now working to build a more “convenient instrument” for Ukrainian citizens and businesses to conduct any number of transactions.Displaying how determined the central bank is to move forward with the project, the National Bank of Ukraine has begun surveying commercial banks in the country, in an effort to understand their “readiness” to “support the circulation” of a national fiat currency riding on a blockchain.The central bank is also looking at best practices employed by other blockchain users around the world.“We have spent some time in additional study of international best practices and existing technologies,” Smolli wrote, adding:“We remain confident of the need to introduce national digital money.”Ukrainian money image via Shutterstock"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Nov 20, 2017 at 09:00 UTC","Initial coin offering (ICO) may be the hottest term in cryptocurrency, but some startups are less than enthusiastic about embracing it.","Far from being able to cash in on its marketing value, many are instead seeking to buck the categorization altogether. Their chief concern? Worries that the language brings undue attention from regulators.So, in an effort to stay under the radar, the entrepreneurs running these offerings have begun changing the language, sometimes only slightly. “Initial token offering,” “token sale,” “token generation event” or “initial capital building mechanism” or “ICBM” (an acronym more commonly thought of as a delivery mechanism for nuclear bombs) have all cropped up of late.Amidst this inconsistency, CoinDesk took the topic to the floor of the ICO Forward Summit in New York City last week. The event brought together token projects, interested investors and existing blockchain companies to talk about the use case, its promise and possible pitfalls.And while there might not be consensus on the issue, those CoinDesk spoke to believe the language is a natural symptom of regulatory tip-toeing.According to Matt McKibbin, of the blockchain industry consultancy DecentraNet, the rhetorical positioning is just growing pains.He told CoinDesk:“I think the industry is still very, very young. Obviously, the lawyers still have a great amount of say in what their thing is called.”In this way, McKibbin argued the decision of whether to use the word “token” or “coin” seems like one coming directly from attorneys. In fact, speaking with many entrepreneurs with ICOs on their roadmap, it almost sounded as though they were reading off a memo from counsel as we spoke.“I think the language holds a lot of power in informing the audience of what you’re doing,” said Nick McEvily of Current, a project looking to roll various kinds of streaming media into one application.Perhaps unsurprisingly given his attendance, he also plans to do a token sale in a couple months, but he’s thinking about his positioning of the idea carefully.McEvily continued:“If you say ‘ICO,’ people perceive that as an investment opportunity.”And that’s what many of these companies want to avoid, because as an investment opportunity, those tokens and in turn the companies or projects, would fall under a complex regulatory structure.Currently, the in thing to do is sticking to the term “token sale” to “avoid scrutiny from regulators,” McEvily said.Max Niebylski, CEO of Gladius, which will run a month-long token sale starting later this month, agreed, saying, “It’s important to distance yourself from selling securities.”But will regulators really be led off a startup’s scent because of word choice?During an on-stage discussion Nick Morgan, an attorney at Paul Hastings LLP and a former SEC staffer said it isn’t worth fighting the securities classification.“Don’t spend all your time trying to figure out how you can be characterized as not being a security,” he said. “Assume you’re a security.”Morgan points to the SEC’s outlining of its thoughts on The DAO, saying that while he does not necessarily agree with the interpretation, he thinks many token issuers should start thinking of themselves as securities providers.In fact, again and again, panelists and speakers referred to recent remarks by the SEC chair suggesting that nearly all ICOs could qualify as securities.“There are a lot of regulatory issues,” Marshal Shichtman, a securities attorney, told CoinDesk. And he didn’t think the phrase a project used to describe their coin would sway regulators.He said:“I don’t think they care if they call it a tomato.”And all this raises the question of whether these different terms are doing any good or whether they’re simply confusing potential supporters and a public that barely understands the industry.According to Robert MacInnis of ActiveAether, a company which will offer a “FogCoin” token later this month to power a system for paying devices to do cloud computing, flipping between words is a problem.Although, he also thinks what businesses decide to call their fundraising project is a trade-off between accuracy and effective marketing.Gladius’ Niebylski, on the other hand, thinks it’s too soon to really worry about the public.For now, the crypto community is small, he argued, and everyone in it understands what the startups are doing, no matter what phrase they use.But others, like McKibbin, think the term that was given to the industry during its inception will stick, no matter how hard the industry tries to cleanse itself of it.He concluded:“I think ‘ICO’ will forever be a term.”Event image via Brady Dale for CoinDesk"

It notably declares that, in the view of UBS analysts, “the sharp rise in crypto-currency valuations in recent months is a speculative bubble.”Yet on the broader question of “investing in the blockchain wave,” as articulated by the report’s authors, UBS highlights the kinds of companies that would enable adoption as well as those that might be on the forefront of actually using blockchain in a meaningful way.As the report states:“… investors seeking long-term opportunities from blockchain technology can start to position in two broad groups: technology enablers – in software, semiconductors, and platforms; and early [and] successful adopters – in finance, manufacturing, healthcare, utilities, and the sharing economy.”In particular, the paper posits that hardware companies – including those manufacturing application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, that are used by bitcoin miners – would potentially see an increase in business if they’re building and shipping products to be used as part of future blockchain networks.“Encryption of blockchain networks requires additional processing speed, benefiting companies exposed to semiconductors like application specific integrated circuits (ASIC) central processing units (CPUs), application processors, and graphics processing units (GPUs),” the report notes.The paper also notably suggests that investors trying to gain early exposure should steer clear of companies that “fail to invest” in the tech, as well as those “most exposed to significant disruption risks.”The full UBS paper can be found below:Cryptocurrencies – Beneath the bubble by CoinDesk on ScribdImage via Lewis Tse Pui Lung / Shutterstock.com."

It’s an area that has attracted interest from a number of public-sector organizations, including the United Nations, which used ethereum as a means to deliver aid to thousands of refugees in a pilot program earlier this year.Among the proposals: using blockchain as a means to send aid from Denmark citizens to those in need directly. The report suggests that the country should “consider being the first donor country to transfer aid by using cryptocurrency.”The possible benefits of such an arrangement center mainly around the removal of financial intermediaries from the process. Rather than funding going through the traditional financial system, donors could potentially send cryptocurrencies straight to the foreign government or group that is collecting aid.“There [are] huge opportunities in bringing the technological development into play in development cooperation. The use of blockchain and cryptocurrency is merely some of the technologies, which can give us new tools in the development cooperation toolbox,” Ulla Tørnæs, Danish Minister for Development Cooperation, said in a statement.Diplomats in other countries, including in the U.S., have also started looking at blockchain as a potential vehicle for delivering aid.Denmark flag image via Shutterstock"

This pilot makes it possible for them to have ownership of their records and be able to share them in a secure way, with whomever they choose.”According to Chris Jagers, co-founder and CEO of Learning Machine, MIT is among the first universities to have “issued official records in a format that can exist even if the institution goes away.“People can own and use their official records, which is a fundamental shift,” he said.The Blockcerts system uses the bitcoin blockchain, according to Jagers, because it “prioritizes security over other qualities like speed, cost or ease of use.”While the diploma information itself isn’t stored on the blockchain, the system utilizes a timestamped transaction indicating that MIT created the digital record for the certificate. This allows the student to prove ownership of the diploma at a later date.With interest in the use case for the technology picking up, Malta’s Ministry for Education and Employment and Australia’s University of Melbourne have also started testing Blockcerts for tracking academic certifications in recent weeks.MIT building image via Shutterstock"

By comparison, fewer than 15,000 were created in 2015. The data for 2017 includes only the first six months of the year, yet nearly 25,000 GitHub projects were created over that period.The report also included data on the top blockchain code repositories on GitHub. Of those, bitcoin has (perhaps unsurprisingly) seen the most activity, with 627 total contributors and nearly 12,000 followers. Go-ethereum (or Geth), the software client maintained by the non-profit Ethereum Foundation, has drawn 149 contributors to date with 5,603 followers.Another major data point in the report is that the majority of blockchain projects seen to date are largely inactive on GitHub.Deloitte explains:“The stark reality of open-source projects is that most are abandoned or do not achieve meaningful scale. Unfortunately, blockchain is not immune to this reality. Our analysis found that only 8 percent of projects are active, which we define as being updated at least once in the last six months.”The authors add that organizations are a “positive differentiator” in the data, saying “while 7 percent of projects developed by users are active, 15 percent of projects developed by organizations are active.”The report further offers geographical insights into the pace of blockchain development thus far, noting that San Francisco plays home to the most blockchain-related GitHub repository owners, with 1,279 users and 101 organizations. London scored the second-highest with 919 projects in total, followed by New York with 774.“It is also worth noting the high level of activity in China, specifically, Shanghai and Beijing. In both of these cities, most of the projects pertain to cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency exchanges, with an emphasis on scalability,” the report goes on to say.Code on screen image via Shutterstock"

And although the wallets are not yet ready for use, the demo, from Gervais’ new project, called Liquidity Network, signals that more people in the ethereum community are interested in adopting the technology.To users, the wallet functions similarly to other ethereum wallets, in that it allows users to send and receive ether. But under the hood, the wallet is more complex, allowing users to connect to so-called “hubs” if they can’t connect directly.In the demo, Gervais shows one user depositing 100 wei (a tiny division of ether) into a hub.Since the connection can then be used to send payments to any other user connected to the same hub, Gervais instantly sends 50 wei payments to one user and 30 wei to another.Liquidity Network is working on a relatively new off-chain network for ethereum, that could possibly provide an alternative to the well-known in-development network, Raiden.However, Liquidity uses slightly different technology modeled after the Revive payment channel – a model first put forth by the Liquidity Network founders in a white paper in September.Paint merging via Shutterstock"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Oct 10, 2017 at 13:00 UTC",The Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) is no stranger to the risks of over-centralized energy sources.,"Perhaps best known for the nuclear meltdown of its Fukushima Daiichi power plant in 2011, the largest energy utility in Japan is now looking to blockchain in an effort to prevent another catastrophe.However, from distributed wind generation using tiny windmills to smart batteries that store power purchased when it’s cheap to buy, alternative energy initiatives have historically been individual philanthropic pursuits.Jeffrey Char, director of TEPCO’s venture capital arm, though, believes blockchain can help provide a business model for these innovative ideas and, in the process, lessen Japan’s reliance on centralized nuclear power.Char told CoinDesk:“I was out looking for different technologies that would allow us to scale up operations in a distributed environment, and blockchain technology seemed to be a good fit.”Since creating the venture capital arm in 2015, Char has publicly backed four companies: United Wind in Brooklyn, Via Science in Boston, Moixa in London and, most recently, German-based Conjoule – a joint venture with Innogy and TEPCO aimed at building decentralized energy solutions using blockchains.And while he’s also brought TEPCO into the Energy Web Foundation (designed to explore blockchain for the energy industry), he said the “holy grail” of all these projects is to have individuals create, consume and trade their own energy.As such, his latest work – a signed memorandum of understanding between TEPCO and Grid+ – is aimed at exploring how blockchains could power peer-to-peer transactions for alternative energy sources.“What we hope working with Grid+ would enable is that it will give us some early insight into how to deal within those limitations,” Char said.Char’s interest in Grid+ began more than six months ago when he offered the startup an investment opportunity. While Grid+ declined the money, it invited Char to join as an adviser, and that’s where he learned how beneficial collaboration with the startup could be.Founded in 2015 as a “spoke” of the ConsenSys production company for ethereum startups, Grid+ is currently working on a piece of hardware it calls an “agent,” designed to let individuals pre-pay for energy using either ether, ethereum’s native token, or fiat currencies.By plugging ethereum-enabled devices into other smart machinery – such as the Tesla charging wall or the Nest thermostat – the company believes it can write algorithms based on customer energy usage that will allow them to buy energy when it is cheap.Now a standalone C Corporation out of Delaware, Grid+ is preparing to raise more than $50 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) of “grid” tokens. According to Char, the goal of TEPCO’s agreement with the startup is to learn about the potential benefits of ethereum for decentralizing the exchange of energy.But it’s not a one-sided agreement. Grid+ co-founder Mark D’Agostino said his startup expects to learn how to refine its algorithms for cheaper, more decentralized energy from TEPCO.D’Agostino told CoinDesk:“We’d like to work closely with TEPCO to partake in the optimization algorithms, wherein, if our agent device is going to make purchasing decisions better than current utilities, it’s because we have granular insight into what the consumer consumption profiles are in a given home.”While it might seem strange for an executive at TEPCO to be looking for ways to cut Japan’s reliance on nuclear energy, Char made clear his investment strategy.“I’m not a politician, so I don’t lobby. I’m an entrepreneur, so I build businesses where I see problems, in order to solve those problems,” he said.The particular problem of converting nuclear to a more decentralized alternative has a window of opportunity only a few years long, according to Char, which explains his increasing interest in finding the right partners and solutions. Since the Fukushima Daiichi power plant meltdown, Japan’s nuclear consumption has dropped from about 30 percent to 2 percent, with remaining demands largely offset by the burning of fossil fuels.“We’re burning a ton of gas and oil and coal,” said Char.However, to maintain its obligation to climate control under the Paris climate accord, the Japanese government says it needs to return its consumption of nuclear energy to 22 percent by 2030, according to a Forbes report.Between now and then, Char hopes his company’s investments can help prevent a full return to nuclear without a continued reliance on fossil fuels.That the Japanese government is largely deregulating the energy sector has already helped, opening up the field to competition that TEPCO itself  has been blamed for helping stifle.Now, Char said, all that remains between the old nuclear paradigm and the future of decentralized energy are a few technical hurdles and regulations that prevent the spread of community-generated energy.From there, he says it’s up to consumers to adopt the technology:“If we are able to scale up the deployment of distributed energy resources like solar, like wind, and deploy a bunch of batteries, the economics around that type of power generation and power delivery keeps decreasing.”Fukushima image via Wikimedia CommonsCorrection: This article has been updated to correct information regarding Grid+’s ICO token name. "

An increasing number of startups on the continent focus exclusively on blockchain development, accounting for a much higher share of companies founded in 2016 than in 2012.Notably, the report found that roughly 25% of ICOs had some sort of decentralized team, where the company launching a campaign was headquartered in a different location than the founder or chief executive.Ricky Tan of Token Data said he expects this figure to increase in the coming years.In the report, he said:“We see a pattern of geographical diversity between ICO founding teams and also within the teams themselves. If the future of business ideas lies in decentralisation, then decentralised founding teams will be a key aspect of it.”Europe also has the greatest number of bitcoin nodes, with more than 5,000, according to the Atomico report. The U.S. comes in second with just over 3,300 nodes.While the number of ICOs and blockchain startups is increasing, interest in “blockchain” in general is increasing even more rapidly.Data from Stack Overflow cited by Atomico shows an exponential growth in the number of searches for the term, jumping from 110 in January 2015 to 14,500 in September 2017.European Union flag image via Shutterstock"

The blockchain’s underlying code would then be able to automatically reject transactions which do not match the pre-described accounts.One example use case outlined by the patent includes “majority control attacks” (also called “51 percent attacks”), where a hostile force with more than 50 percent of the total computing power tries to control a blockchain network.According to the patent:“Despite the architecture of blockchain systems, malicious attacks present a threat to the security and reliability of blockchains.”When an attack is detected, the system will automatically stop conducting transactions, preventing even a majority attack from being effective, according to the patent.The patent further cites include distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which are designed to completely overwhelm a miner with an excessive number of transaction requests.BT does not address how it would deal with such attacks, however it does state that “it would be advantageous to provide a mechanism for detecting and mitigating threats to blockchain environments.”While the patent discusses the method of verifying transactions through the energy-intensive mining process employed by digital currencies like bitcoin, BT notes that the process is unrelated to the patented system.BT Tower image via Shutterstock"

selling bitcoin, ether and any other crypto asset deemed a commodity.","Nov 28, 2017 at 05:01 UTC","A platform run by former State Street executives that will allow institutional investors to buy a wide range of crypto assets, has raised a $5 million seed round.","Led by Wicklow Capital with the help of Digital Currency Group, Sierra Ventures, Clocktower Ventures and ThirdStream Partners, the round will be used to build out Omniex’s suite of tools for buying and selling bitcoin, ether and any other crypto asset deemed a commodity.According to the former director of State Street’s emerging technology lab, now Omniex chief executive, Hu Liang, the startup is looking to help investors buy and sell large amounts of crypto assets by providing a massive pool of liquidity.And while the startup is now one of an increasing number of companies launching in an effort to intake money entering the crypto space, it looks in good shape to compete.Liang revealed new details about its founding team including that two other State Street executives have joined Omniex as co-founders: Kamal Mokeddem, who is now head of technology, and John Burnett, who has signed up as the startup’s head of business development.The new investment will be used to continue to round out the startup’s team. According to Liang, Omniex will add four more people, mostly developers, soon.Burnett told CoinDesk:“Ultimately, we want to be geared up so that we have the full product set in market by the end of the year, that is designed for the first time as an institutional investment and trading platform.”But while the end-of-year deadline could seem tight, the co-founders’ backgrounds at State Street should help them lure investors with “good connections in the capital markets space,” as Liang said was Omniex’s focus.The platform, called Omniex Portfolio Edge, will initially cater largely to quant hedge funds and specialty crypto funds that focus on cryptocurrencies with large market caps that have been deemed commodities by U.S. regulators.At launch, the founders hope to have completed their first set of products serving both front and back office operations for trading crypto assets, including a portfolio management platform, risk analytics tools and connectivity to exchanges, voice brokers and electronic streaming engines.Some of the seed money will also be used for building products for the rest of the trading lifecycle, including fund managers, market makers, exchanges, custodians, fund accountants and online cryptocurrency vaults.“We’re not a market maker ourselves, we’re not an exchange ourselves. So we’re looking for anybody who is adding value to the existing ecosystem by bringing in either liquidity or storage mechanisms or regulated activities,” Liang said, adding:“We’re the infrastructure for the crypto ecosystem.”That infrastructure is something some in the cryptocurrency space think is the key to enabling what Digital Currency Group founder Barry Silbert called the “next wave of institutional capital,” in interview with CoinDesk.“In order to participate in these markets in a meaningful way, these folks will need “institutional grade” cryptocurrency trading tools,” Silbert said.And though the platform will start off limited to cryptocurrencies with large market caps, the co-founders would also like to expand the infrastructure to support smaller assets, such as tokens sold during initial coin offerings (ICOs).It’s not all that surprising, since ICOs are the hot topic in the crypto world, with many thinking the new fundraising mechanism could soon become commonplace. But currently, Omniex doesn’t have the regulatory approval to accept ICO tokens that might already be or someday be categorized and regulated as securities.While startups, such as Templum, and Overstock’s tZERO subsidiary are already salivating at the opportunity, so far opportunities are limited.Liang concluded:“For this to be an institutional class, we need this to be a $1 trillion, $2 trillion, $10 trillion industry. We’re here to grow that ecosystem.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Omniex and commented on this story.

Central banks around the world (including in Singapore, the U.K. and Europe) have taken more of an interest in blockchain technology recently, trying to figure out how it might create efficiencies within their systems.Case in point: earlier this month, senior vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Jim Cunha said blockchain and other fintech startups would be pushing incumbent financial institutions and middlemen to be more innovative in their approach.When asked if bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies and blockchain might affect monetary policy, Bernanke said he doesn’t see that happening.Bernanke said:“It could be a lack of imagination, but I don’t think monetary policy has changed that much. [Central banks] are supportive of these new technologies because they’ll improve the payment system … but it won’t affect the ability of the Fed to require a certain amount of reserves of affect interest rates.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.Ben Bernanke (right, with economist Gene Sperling) image via Bailey Reutzel"

bitcoin ...","Nov 19, 2017 at 10:30 UTC","Dr. Paul Ennis is an assistant professor at The Centre for Innovation, Technology & Organization at University College Dublin, specializing in bitcoin and blockchain studies.","In this opinion piece, Dr. Ennis takes readers on a tour of the cryptocurrency metropolis, comparing ICOs to a neighborhood, once hardened, that is in store for a cultural shift.For years, I have described blockchain as the gentrification of bitcoin, meant positively.Bitcoin is, without doubt, what it is because it has an edge, a Wild West dimension. Yet, residents of “Bitcoin Country” know this quasi-lawlessness comes with a price, specifically its appeal for scams and heists. When reversibility of transactions is outlawed, outlaws will appear, no doubt about it.That’s enabled because bitcoin is about channeling the old cypherpunk spirit and becoming as deregulated as possible through technical means. This is a form of total freedom where the risks and the rewards really begin to accelerate.Our time, as well, is a time of acceleration, and in terms of technology, that means a time of deregulation through exit. This concept of exit, develop in the 1970s by Albert O. Hirschman, is the libertarian ideal condensed into one possibility, the option to opt out and live according to one’s own conditions (“to live as if one were already free,” as Graeber puts it).Bitcoin has attempted to create pockets where one does precisely this, little islands of freedom, but always aware of where the true power lies. This leaves the potential of bitcoin as a “regulative ideal,” as described by Immanuel Kant, a target to aspire to.This has played out in numerous forms, most notoriously the attempt by Ross Ulbricht to engage in “profitable civil disobedience,” leading him to create his shadow Amazon – narcotics direct to your door, bought using a slick interface with all the trappings of a clear-net e-commerce site.Within these worlds, whether with cryptocurrency or cryptomarkets, there has always existed side-by-side the idealists and the exploiters.Crypto is a rough neighborhood, but like our brick-and-mortar versions, we find true innovation there (“the hustle”). We also find a tendency to appropriate ideas and culture from there, drawn to the hard-nosed and scrappy desire to make something of nothing.And yet there is the more clear-cut process of gentrification where, over time, an undesirable neighborhood is altered bit by bit, coffee shop by coffee shop, until the local population begins to look around and wonder, “When do the suits arrive?”People begin to speak differently, to speak of blockchain, rather than the blockchain. Rents go up, the locals feel marginalized. What happens, however, when digital rather than physical space is occupied? The costs of exit become much lower, the ability to ignore one another much easier.Bitcoiners and blockchainers can co-exist, engaging and disengaging with what intrigues them.Gentrification is now apparent with the rapid expansion of initial coin offerings (ICOs).In my own small country, one finds an ICO located in one of its most salubrious suburbs (Confideal) and run by the country’s most successful hedge fund manager (Mingocoin). Alongside gentrification, one finds mainstream-ification, represented most abruptly by surreal, but surely exciting, celebrity endorsements, running the gamut of Floyd Mayweather to Paris Hilton.What has changed? Well, for one, traditional businesses are no less drawn to the deregulationist tendency than cryptocurrency ones. They are, however, often more cautious, unused to the “better-to-ask-permission” philosophy underpinning numerous crypto innovations.However, with the success of Uber, it seems that a cultural shift may be taking place that asks, what if, perhaps, one is able to self-fund? Or rather, to fund on one’s own terms and in the democratized manner ICOs allow. Or put another way, why precisely would we not self-fund, especially in a community rooted in a libertarian politics of self-sufficient and a cypherpunk DIY ethos?The retort, of course, is that regulations exist in order to constrain rampant exploitation of naive investors and no doubt the ICO space will have many of these. But does this mean ICOs should engage in the process of adopting regulatory frameworks that will appeal to this audience?The answer is that, broadly speaking, they already are. The new breed of ICO is operating in a “post-ban” phase, meaning that the various warnings and crackdowns have occurred, are not simply theoretical, as they were for the original wave of ICOs (e.g. Gnosis).This is why it is not uncommon to hear these days about “passing the Howey test.”In the case of ICOs, this test would determine whether a token is a security and therefore subject to SEC regulation. And what recent comments from the SEC suggest is a “thoughtful” approach is being taken, one that will take care to assess ICOs according to circumstances.For now, the question is open, the ontological nature of tokens bracketed for the time being.So, here is where we find ourselves, at the point where the cypherpunk insight – we can raise our own capital within this cryptocurrency community, using our own creative technologies – begins to attract outside interest, bringing in new neighbors, all sharp suits and business acumen.Here is where I think the promise of cryptocurrencies begins to seep back in.With contentious issues over transactions fees rendering older cryptocurrency ambitions, such as serving the unbanked, almost quaint in its idealism, we find the opening up of a new space of possibility, one hinging on creativity. For what ICOs allow for is the option of exit from endless rounds of venture capital funding, oriented to a select few of angel investors.Instead, ICOs democratize the process to a massively-distributed network of people, allowing them to assess the situation, and giving them a chance to access investment opportunities in a way that is normally complicated by intermediaries and middlemen (remember, this is what all this is about).Disintermediation of old business practices is always a little bit messy, a little bit of a culture shock.But crypto is no ordinary shake-up, it goes right to the heart of what is assumed about the nature of what things are. Bitcoin disintermediates money; ethereum contracts and ICOs combine both to disintermediate the raising of capital.The best part of all this?Companies will finally be able to focus on their projects; in that spirit let a thousand ICOs bloom.Graffiti image via Shutterstock"

Such testing would follow the creation of a national strategy, launched in April, which has been publicly supported by the nation’s prime minister.A spokesperson from the government reportedly declined to discuss the specifics of the trial with the news source. However, if true, it could play an important role in informing Malta’s evolving domestic policy on blockchain technologies.While novel for Maltese regulators, the test would be one of many conducted by governments internationally that have often sought to go to extremes to model the economic impact of blockchain technologies.In 2016, for example, the central bank of the Netherlands went so far as to attempt to extrapolate from bitcoin’s early stages what the network would look like in 2140.

The process was, perhaps, triggered in part by a $75,000 fine that was issued to digital currency exchange Bitfinex and the subsequent petition from U.S. law firm Steptoe & Johnson LLP calling for a more concrete definition.Now, the CFTC is taking the first steps toward publicly clarifying how it would define a “delivery,” which the agency said back in October was a complex issue given the wholly digital nature of cryptocurrencies.According to the CFTC, the two factors which determine that a delivery has taken place are:“(1) a customer having the ability to: (i) take possession and control of the entire quantity of the commodity, whether it was purchased on margin, or using leverage, or any other financing arrangement, and (ii) use it freely in commerce (both within and away from any particular platform) no later than 28 days from the date of the transaction; and(2) the offeror and counterparty seller (including any of their respective affiliates or other persons acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty seller on a similar basis) not retaining any interest in or control over any of the commodity purchased on margin, leverage, or other financing arrangement at the expiration of 28 days from the date of the transaction.”Per the CFTC, the proposed interpretation isn’t final and is subject to a 90-day public comment period, which begins when the interpretation is formally published in the Federal Register. Bitcoin and dollar image via Shutterstock"

In order to avoid costly regulatory surprises, we encourage businesses with proposed cryptocurrency offerings to contact their local securities regulatory authority to discuss possible approaches to complying with securities laws. We welcome digital innovation and we recognize that new fintech businesses may not fit neatly into the existing securities law framework.”Consistent with the recent U.S. and Singapore guidance regarding token sales, the notice does not state that all cryptocurrency offerings automatically will constitute trades in securities and, instead, explains that a facts-and-circumstances-type inquiry will apply.The CSA notes that, in certain cases, a coin or token may be considered a security for the purposes of Canadian securities law, and that cryptocurrency offerings must be assessed individually to determine if they fall within the ambit of the legislation.Crucially, the CSA notes that “in assessing whether or not securities laws apply, [the CSA] will consider substance over form.”The Canadian tests for what may be considered a security are, in many ways, similar to the U.S. securities analysis. Section 1 of Ontario’s Securities Act (OSA) provides a lengthy but non-exhaustive definition of “security,” which includes “any investment contract.” This definition may capture a purchase of coins or tokens where the value of such coins or tokens are dependent upon the future profits or success of a particular business.In Canada, the leading case for determining whether an investment contract exists is the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in Pacific Coast Coin Exchange v. Ontario (Securities Commission) (“Pacific Coin”).The four-pronged test announced by Pacific Coin is arguably based on the Howey test that exists under U.S. law.Under Pacific Coin, an investment contract exists when there is:Prior to the CSA’s release of the notice, there had been some speculation in Canada that Canadian authorities might rely on the “family resemblance test” set out in “Ontario Securities Commission v. Tiffin” or adopt an entirely new approach for classifying and regulating tokens, coins and cryptocurrency offerings.The notice, however, seems to indicate that Pacific Coin remains the key case for determining what may constitute a security.If an instrument satisfies the Pacific Coin test, it is an investment contract under Canadian securities law, and therefore a security for the purposes of section 1 of the OSA.If a given token or coin is deemed to be a security under the Pacific Coin test, the applicable cryptocurrency offering for such token or coin may be classified as a trade in securities, in which case, Canadian securities laws would apply to the transaction.As discussed in the notice, Canadian securities law, among other things:Below are some of the considerations highlighted in the notice:Prospectus and trading requirements: To be in compliance with Ontario securities legislation, sellers of securities must either file a prospectus with the regulatory authorities or rely on a prospectus exemption.In the notice, while the CSA mentions that, as of the date of the notice, no business had used a prospectus exemption to complete a cryptocurrency offering in Canada, it also states that it anticipates that cryptocurrency businesses may rely on the accredited- investor exemption (which requires investors to pass an asset test), or the offering memorandum exemption (which implements various specific disclosure obligations on the part of the issuer), depending on the provincial securities legislation in consideration.The notice also mentions that consideration should also be given to the trading of coin/token securities, post-cryptocurrency offering, on exchanges and to the applicable restrictions on secondary trading.Registration requirements: If a token or coin seller meets the business trigger-test by trading in securities for a business purpose, the seller will be required to either register as a dealer or rely on an exemption from the dealer registration requirement.In the notice, the CSA lists, among others, the following important considerations for determining whether a natural person or entity is trading in securities: solicitation of a broad investor base (including retail investors); use of the Internet, including public websites and discussion boards, to reach a large number of potential investors; and raising a significant amount of capital from a large number of investors.Marketplace requirements: If a cryptocurrency exchange offers instruments that are securities, the exchange may be required to comply with the Canadian securities laws governing “exchanges,” either by applying for recognition as a marketplace, or by applying for an exemption from recognition.In the notice, the CSA notes that, as of the date of the notice, no cryptocurrency exchange had been recognized in any Canadian jurisdiction, nor had any cryptocurrency exchange been exempted from recognition.The notice also advises that fintech businesses establishing investment funds that will or may have cryptocurrency exposure should be prepared to consider or discuss with Canadian regulators a range of issues, including but not limited to:Overall, the notice clarifies that cryptocurrencies, as well as cryptocurrency offerings, exchanges and investment funds, remain subject to the existing Canadian securities law framework.The CSA appears to be signaling that it wishes to collaborate and interact with businesses in the coin and token space, to avoid regulatory surprises while encouraging financial innovation and development.We will see whether the Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority of Saskatchewan will take a similar approach after the provincial by-election in the province on September 7.Canadian coin image via Shutterstock"

It first crossed the billion-dollar mark in 2014. Total ICO funding so far is at $3.8 billion, according to CoinDesk’s ICO tracker.Kickstarter offered few details as to the reasoning for the decision, ultimately directing CoinDesk to its charter, which has five planks.The first reads, “Kickstarter’s mission is to help bring creative projects to life” and the fourth says, “Kickstarter is committed to the arts.” In 2015, the company insulated itself from pressure to make profits its sole priority by reincorporating as a public benefit corporation (PBC).PBCs are a relatively new legal entity that protects companies that want to pursue a social mission as well as fulfilling their fiduciary responsibility to shareholders. We previously reported on Blockstack, which also reincorporated as a PBC.In this way, shareholders in Kickstarter earn an income stream rather than hoping for a giant return on a big exit down the road. (The company has long committed to remaining private, and one of its three co-founders has compared a share in the company to owning the rights to a popular song.)But despite any similarities, the company said this unique structure protects it from the temptation to leverage its brand for returns in the frothy ICO market.“Not something we looked into or will look into,” the spokesperson said.Kickstarter website photo via Shutterstock."

Quite simply, since blockchains are built on common rules, it can seem like the easiest way to improve them is to introduce new rules (or change existing ones) – and that’s exactly what hard forks, one type of a wider variety of forks, seek to do.But as developers have learned the hard way, executing them is a challenge.So, while best practices have come a long way since a hard fork unexpectedly split ethereum’s blockchain in two last summer, developers are still seeking a better understanding of the process, studying its nuances and testing how to execute safely.That said, not all blockchains struggle with the transition. The anonymous cryptocurrency monero carries out hard forks on a regular schedule and even cryptocurrency developers who some view as more conservative agree the mechanism might have a place in the future.Bitcoin cash, for example, successfully split off from bitcoin in August, with relatively few problems for the network’s many users. Now, at least two bitcoin hard forks are on the way – both of which will take place in the next two months.But while hard forks are growing more common, developers haven’t stopped debating under what conditions they are safest to use – and how to mitigate their less-than-desirable side effects.In ethereum’s case last year, users and companies lost money because of the resulting “replay attacks” that exploited the sudden creation of two chains.So, with demand for the mechanism increasing, developers from across the ecosystem are working to make hard forks smoother and safer, in an effort to ensure that users don’t lose any funds or faith in the networks that protect them.One issue is that the “right” way to execute a hard fork isn’t so cut and dry.The problem is that when a blockchain splits in two, users – and the software they use – can get confused about which cryptocurrency to follow. One example of this confusion is referred to as a “replay attack,” where users can accidentally send cryptocurrencies on two blockchains when they only meant to send funds on one.Bitcoin cash, bitcoin’s first hard fork in August, made a change that protects against this problem and bitcoin gold, another upcoming hard fork with goals opposite to bitcoin cash, claims it will add replay protection also.Still, different developers have different ideas of the best way to deal with these attacks. The developers behind Segwit2x, perhaps the best-known proposed hard fork (since it’s garnered support from many bitcoin industry leaders), have flipped back and forth on the topic.Developers behind the controversial proposal maintain that the hard fork will become the new bitcoin and that implementing protection would deter the project since users will have to take the extra step to upgrade their software.Meanwhile, others argue that adding protection against replay attacks will ensure users don’t get confused and accidentally lose money.BitGo engineer Mark Erhardt (aka Murch) explained that since bitcoin cash is a copy of bitcoin in many ways, it uses the same address format. Since the addresses are of the same type, it’s possible to send bitcoin between the two networks, where they then get stuck.Murch, who leads moderation of Bitcoin Stack Exchange, an active forum to ask technical questions about the protocol, mentioned that he’s seen “numerous questions” about this issue from users who accidentally sent funds to the wrong network.If users send bitcoin cash to a bitcoin address, it’s possible to recover funds by importing the corresponding bitcoin private key into a bitcoin cash wallet. On the other hand, if a bitcoin cash user sends bitcoin cash to a bitcoin SegWit address, it might be “lost altogether,” he said.Murch said that he thinks this confusion with bitcoin cash is a sign of what could come in future hard forks, like the one in November.“There will be numerous incidents of users sending funds accidentally on both chains or from addresses of one chain to the other,” he told CoinDesk, adding that one way to get rid of this problem would be for future forks to use a different address format.“I am expecting a significant increase in support requests,” he added.Still, what’s been less discussed is that there might be a way of wiping this attack vector away entirely.Bitcoin Core contributor Luke Dashjr recently reintroduced a proposal that would make bitcoin naturally resistant to replay attacks, “hopefully ending the whole argument,” he wrote.This sort of development takes time, though, and will require a couple of different changes to bitcoin.Dashjr told CoinDesk that he thinks the change is “not likely” to be implemented in time for the Segwit2x fork in November, although it might be implemented some day in the future. At least, if the bitcoin hard forks continue.Then there are also broader governance questions and concerns.You could say that this makes up the bulk of the argument around Segwit2x, as each side frames the debate as a power struggle for control of the technical direction of bitcoin. And there is a broader worry that hard forks could make certain groups more influential in systems where no one is supposed to have power.These questions came to light in recent discussions among developers of MimbleWimble, as its developers plan to finally put its novel cryptographic tricks into practice by launching a new blockchain next year.In the early stages, the developers are still working out the code and cryptography, so they are mulling over the idea of allowing hard forks for a short grace period, as a safeguard against unexpected technical problems that might pop up soon after the launch.“We’re a young project and we may make mistakes both with technical and governance rules,” MimbleWimble lead developer Igno Peverell told CoinDesk.The developer suggested a novel approach, though: putting an end to the upgrading mechanism after two years.Some were skeptical of the idea. Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra, one of the earliest MimbleWimble advocates, argued that hard forks pose a “centralization” risk and there’s “rarely a need” to use one.After expressing those concerns, though, he hinted that the best approach might not be so black-and-white, seeming open to the idea of limiting developers’ ability to execute the type of upgrade to a shorter time frame.He wrote:“I like the idea of being clear upfront that the ‘early days’ won’t last forever.”Seatbelt image via Shutterstock"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Oct 25, 2017 at 19:10 UTC",Graphics card maker AMD reported a major sales jump in the third quarter of 2017 amid significant demand from the world’s cryptocurrency miners.,"On its Tuesday afternoon earnings call, the company reported $819 million in revenues from its computing and graphics division for the third quarter of 2017, a whopping 74 percent increase over the prior year’s quarter.While the company’s graphics processing units (GPUs) have been traditionally used by video gamers, cryptocurrency enthusiasts are quickly snatching up the tools for mining ethereum and other coins. In a possible nod to that circumstance, AMD said the revenue was “primarily driven” by strong sales of its Radeon GPUs and Ryzen desktop processors – both of which are employed for crypto-mining.In particular, AMD noted that sales of the Vega 56 and Vega 64 GPUs ramped up significantly during the quarter. These are among the most highly sought-after devices in the cryptocurrency market because of their significant processing power compared to other products.With stagnant growth in its other core business segments, the surging GPU sales fueled a 26 percent year-over-year increase to a total revenue of $1.64 billion, making it the company’s highest-grossing quarter since 2011.But while the numbers are eye-popping, the company’s shareholders weren’t impressed with the Q3 results.AMD shares ultimately dropped 12 percent, from $14.25 at closing on Tuesday to as low as $12.43 in after hours trading. This coincides with the investment communities highly cautionary stance towards AMD’s exposure to the volatile and potentially fleeting cryptocurrency market.Plus, AMD forecasted a decrease in cryptocurrency-related revenues for the fourth quarter, expecting its fourth quarter revenues to decrease by 15 percent from the third quarter, give or take three percent.As CEO Lisa Su said on the earning call:“In terms of the headwinds … we’re also predicting that there will be some leveling-off of some of the cryptocurrency demand.”Overall the message was mixed. While she issued bearish statements about the future of cryptocurrency mining as it relates to AMD’s earnings, she also seemingly left the door open for other opportunities, although those seemed less clear.“There’s also [a] commercial blockchain component that we believe is interesting and likely to continue into the medium term,” she said.Image Credit: Gene Wang/Flickr"

to help me see the uniqueness of the cryptocurrency custody ...","Dec 23, 2017 at 13:45 UTC","Taylor Monahan is the founder of MyEtherWallet, an open-source, client-side interface for generating ethereum wallets and interacting with the ethereum blockchain.","The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2017 in Review series.It’s easy to ignore how simple things are today, and even easier to miss how much larger things will be tomorrow.We underestimate, misestimate, write off exponential as linear and react to the five-minute candlesticks as if they are the whole picture. Everything is relative. Unless we zoom out, we won’t see that peaks are growing taller each day, nor that the valleys are barely blips given full context.When we put together the first version of MyEtherWallet, we weren’t trying the change the world. We were just building a wallet generator that didn’t require the command-line. Two-and-a-half years later we’ve become the de-facto interface for interacting with the ethereum blockchain, especially when it comes to ethereum-based tokens.This is not your typical journey.But the fact that we were able to build a product in this fashion reveals more about the market than our own skills. Only in such a new and emerging space could we thrive building a product for ourselves. We knew what people wanted because we knew what we wanted. Early blockchain adopters, ourselves included, tend to hold more libertarian or anarchist views, have an intolerance for inefficiency, have a tolerance for risk, are tech-savvy, privacy-minded, innately curious, self-motivated and thoroughly enjoy the possibility of a better future.However, the crypto-sphere is not a microcosm of the larger world; it’s limited to those who see the potential future regardless of the experience today. Most do not enjoy reading research papers, let alone debating them on forums created before the iPhone existed.Most value ease, automation and features over control of their data. This, combined with the online experiences we’ve grown accustomed to (insurance, mobile banking, “undo” buttons, password resets, live customer support) means throwing my mother onto the blockchain today would be a recipe for disaster.This isn’t because my mother is incapable or uninterested. It’s because she lives in a world that operates differently than the blockchain world. Unlike those of us already in this space, she hasn’t found the resources that shift her mind and trigger her “rabbit-hole” moment.One can hope that the state of things today are not seen as the “simple times” tomorrow.Ideally, looking back we’ll have a nostalgic viewing of “the early days.” The unpolished days. The days reserved for geeks and misfits and maniacs who believed in the “why,” but hadn’t quite nailed the “how.”Mike Belshe, the CEO of bitcoin storage service BitGo, was the first person to help me see the uniqueness of the cryptocurrency custody situation. He pointed out that if your house completely burns down while you are at work, you would lose less than if you lost your private key. The insurance will pay, your wallet and phone were with you at the time, your important documents are all in the cloud, and you can, however awful it may be, still stand in line at some government bureaucracy to get a new birth certificate.More recently, Ryan McGeehan was helping us put together our security policy and included:“I am aware that cryptocurrency companies are a global anomaly to the security industry. I am aware that these companies are hacked into deletion at a far greater rate than any industry. I will walk through this industry’s graveyard. I will look through this list and appreciate the scale of this problem.”When it comes to cryptocurrency, a single string of characters can cause irrecoverable loss. This space mostly operates in a gray area in regards to taxation, regulation, security and jurisdiction. The loss of your private key results in the loss of your funds.The theft of a private key results in tax-free, identity-free funds that can be mixed, siphoned, used to pay for products or services or converted into (essentially) clean fiat.I’ve joked that MyEtherWallet needs to budget for the years of therapy our support and education team is going to need after spending their days, nights and weekends with people who have lost their funds. Whether it’s phishing sites, malware, unsafe storage of keys, or other exceptionally creative ways (aka “user error”), the worst part is the helplessness.We can educate them about what went wrong, we can try to prevent it in the future, but we cannot make the keys reappear or return the funds. They’re gone. Poof.“Poof” should be a concept reserved for magicians and charlatans. The very real consequences of loss become evident as you spend time in this space and begin to understand the blockchain, cryptography, and key pairs. However, without this baseline knowledge, people only have their experiences with the traditional world (Gmail, Facebook, online banking) which leads to seemingly senseless loss.When they lose, they don’t care why or how, they care about a solution. With each passing bubble, those entering the space care less about the underlying technology and more about potential profits. The investments have become more irresponsible, the losses larger, and the reactions more accusatory, angry, and, at times, suicidal or homicidal.Cryptocurrency is a global anomaly. Accept that. It is onerous, unique, and elusive. People are not stupid, they are uneducated on the idiosyncrasies of the blockchain.Building a product for a limited demographic only works when that demographic dominates the market. As the market expands, what do you optimize for? Your original goals? Integration with traditional world? Decentralization? Security? Advanced users? Control? New users?Growing up means figuring out what you stand for and what you want to stand for. For a product, that means making decisions that are in line with your philosophies and then aligning your user’s expectations with your offerings. It means focusing your efforts on the best solution for the people you are building for, not an amalgamation of all the possible solutions. It is becoming apparent that the policies, systems, fees and regulations that we vehemently rebel against exist for a reason. They can subsidize refunds for fraudulent transactions. They can shut down accounts. They can protect innocent ignorants from being scammed.A single product cannot effectively address the full spectrum of a user’s needs and expectations when it comes to custody. One company cannot simultaneously give you your private key while offering two-factor authentication. A team cannot hold your funds while allowing you to send wherever you want, whenever you want. An interface cannot perfectly automate and hide the shifting variables (e.g. ethereum’s gas costs) while you generate that transaction via an air-gapped device in the middle of a field covered in foil.A more diverse population of users demands a more diverse population of custody solutions. It demands a more diverse talent pool to build these products, help people understand the blockchain and help the blockchain understand people.We need products that optimize for ease-of-use over advanced features. We need third-party funds with insurance that hold and grow your investments. We need multi-factor solutions that target traditional businesses and can work within their established accounting practices. We need systems for transparency for ICOs and charities. We need teams that focus on ultra-private solutions for those in high-risk situations, or simply value control above all else.We also need resources that target the growing ecosystem.This means resources for institutions, my mom, and the kids who have been Snapchatting since they were 10 years old. We need tools for the unbanked, the banked and the over-banked. We need documentation and research so that those who have the expertise can use their advanced skills to advance the systems. We need the teachers who know the technology inside and out, and those who have the perfectly accessible analogy for everything.To have a better future, we have to start building it today.The people building it must be as diverse as the people who will be part of it. It’s easier if those who are part of it are the ones building it. It can’t just be technical experts or big corporations. Not every project requires millions of dollars or advanced college degrees. It requires both researchers at universities and teens with YouTube channels. It’s publishers, writers, and random commenters who to take the time hold someone’s hand and bring them onboard. It’s talking, sharing, connecting, and iterating.But mostly, it’s realizing that those who change the world don’t always set out to do so. All it takes is a decision to do something today, do it better tomorrow, and to not stop doing it…ever. One day, you’ll lean back, zoom out, and realize the peaks and valleys that have consumed you were just the runway and the real lift-off has yet to occur.Luckily, you’re already on-board, building the ship, and there is no getting off now. The future is coming. HODL tight.Don’t think it’s early days anymore? CoinDesk is now accepting original submissions to its annual 2017 in Review.

cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, comparing them to failed ...","Nov 20, 2017 at 13:00 UTC",It’s been two years since a former managing director of the Moscow Exchange resigned his position in the aftermath of Russia’s annexation of the Crimean region in his native Ukraine.,"Now, after years of exploring his options, Roman Sulzhyk has become the latest in a string of senior-level executives around the world to make the jump to the blockchain sector. Not only has Sulzhyk invested in the Ukraine-based blockchain startup Distributed Lab, he’s taken on a leadership role as chairman of its board of directors.But while entering the blockchain industry has been compared to a religious experience for some, Sulzhyk’s motivation is decidedly more political.After spending much of his career working for big banks, Sulzhyk resigned as the managing director of Moscow Exchange’s futures market in 2015, a year after Russia controversially took over Crimea.Since then, the Moscow Exchange press office and Sulzhyk himself have both expressed support for one another, even while complexities around the departure persist.“Unfortunately, the political situation between our two countries at the moment does make it difficult,” Sulzhyk said. “Let’s just say, I’m opposed to the politics of Putin.”Still, the former chairman of the supervisory board of the National Depository of Ukraine and well-known advocate for transparency in the financial markets sees an opportunity in blockchain that goes beyond his professional history and past roles.Sulzhyk told CoinDesk:“It’s a natural evolution of my career. I don’t view this as a sort of setback, I view this as a massive opportunity for me personally to be part of a revolution.”In this way, Sulzhyk sought to frame his departure as a twist of good fortune, one that triggered his exploration of the right opportunity at the right time.Sulzhyk said he knew almost nothing about blockchain before leaving the exchange, and as it turns out, that’s exactly when the founders of Distributed Lab started to educate him.Then, this July, he’d caught up enough on the technology that Distributed Lab invited him to speak at its BIP001 cryptocurrency conference in Odessa, Ukraine, and by September he’d personally backed Distributed Lab with an undisclosed amount of money.But while Sulzhyk identifies as a co-founder, as well as investor, in Distributed Lab, the startup itself isn’t new to the blockchain space.Founded in 2014, the company now lists 50 people on its team working to build a wide range of enterprise-grade systems for issuing traditional assets on a blockchain.“I’m not day-to-day running development,” he said. “I’m more trying to work together with the guys to develop the vision of where the company wants to be in a year from now.”Among the projects for which Sulzhyk is currently consulting as part of his new work is the National Bank of Ukraine, which has been exploring issuing the nation’s native hryvnia currency on a blockchain since at least November 2016.And though many details about the project remain behind a non-disclosure agreement, Distributed Lab founder Pavel Kravchenko confirmed to CoinDesk that his company is working with the central bank to explore moving “e-money on a blockchain.”As for Sulzhyk, he doubled-down on his previously stated skepticism about cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, comparing them to failed incarnations of the U.S. Federal Reserve.But he further elaborated on the potential value to central banks of future cryptocurrencies that could eventually incorporate “a read-only key for a blockchain,” giving them the ability to monitor transactions “in real-time.”“Once central banks understand this,” he said, “I think they will start moving in that direction because it gives them better visibility into the financial system.”So far, the most mature of Distributed Lab’s efforts is TokenD, a framework for helping groups of enterprises digitize assets. Sulzhyk calls the framework an “Oracle-like product for blockchain,” comparing it to the large cloud platform provider that’s also exploring blockchain.In addition to including a codebase for building systems that convert traditional assets into digital tokens on a blockchain, the TokenD framework consists of a list of best practices and security and quality standards.One early effort Sulzhyk is exploring on the topic is with the CEO of Ukraine’s national depository, Mindaugas Bakas, in which the standards are being used to overcome legal concerns about issuing assets on a blockchain.Among the other projects in the works using TokenD is the soon-to-be-announced BullionCoin, registered with the Financial Services Authority in the Isle of Man.Going forward, Sulzhyk said Distributed Lab is exploring business models other than transaction fees, such as charging per solution or extended support services – and it’s here where he’s perhaps most excited about the company’s path to market.He concluded:“This is a fundamental game changer.”Roman Sulzhyk image via Distributed Lab"

The etymology comes the “weird Facebook” phenomenon, a collection of meme-pages, wholesome and less-wholesome trolls and pseudonymous profiles made all the more wonderful by their unlikely home, the social network your family and your boss use.And maybe in that definition, I point to why weird blockchain is worth talking about now, at the end of 2017 – because finally, weird blockchain feels weird.The blockchain community has always been prolific with in-jokes and memes. Early crypto adopters share a vernacular of signs, symbols and idiosyncrasies – from yelling “MOON” in trollboxes, to HODLing, to the entire existence of dogecoin at all in any capacity.But this year, blockchain hit banks, it hit business, it hit $10,000, and in its success it welcomed the masses like never before.In the early days of crypto, anyone staying up all night to trade (or spending months of their life writing software no one thought would be useful) crossed the bridge of self-selection into the land of the outsider. This is no longer the case.Now, in no particular order – my faves of the year’s absurdity:Useless tokens of all kinds, among them the eponymous “Useless Ethereum Token.”UET bills itself as “The world’s first 100 percent honest ethereum ICO,” raising 310.445 ether. This one’s basically a meme blockbuster, culminating in a listing on HitBTC and at one point trading at $4.95. Yet, it also had an early and less-well-known predecessor, ponzIco, a more biting variant, hatched by Josh Cincinnatti of the zcash foundation.It comes with a pun-filled whitepaper, and was name dropped by Matt Levine on Money Stuff:“The great art project of our age is to entirely collapse the distinctions between ‘fraud’ and ‘performance art,’ so that one day mortgage-bond traders will be able to say, ‘Wait, no, I wasn’t lying about bond prices to increase my bonus, I was performing a metafictional narrative about bond-price negotiations in order to problematize the underlying foundations of bond trading in late capitalism.'”Memes live in the liminal space between art and jokes.A troll of a different variety is Fluffypony (Riccardo Spagni), the lead developer for monero, whose hype campaign for a “big announcement” in May 2017 culminated in a 2x run-up in price.When the video finally dropped, it was instead a two-minute long stock-footage filled parody of inspirational corporate propaganda, culminating in the slogan, “Putting the fun back in fungibility.”Hailed as art by some and with outrage by others:The moment when a cypherpunk developer became an artist.

sincere token that will somehow get Vitalik Buterin a probably-non-consensual personal trainer.Moving more squarely towards the camp of what I’ll call “intentional art,” we find Bad Shibe written by Rob Myers and illustrated by Lina Theodorou.The story is a near-future sci-fi novella set under a rising Doge Moon – a young shibe named YS starts to question the underpinnings of the tokenized-reputation system that governs their world. Written in 2014, but only now published in 2017, the meme is still strong – and the story more relevant than ever.Bad Shibe is part of Artists Re:Thinking the Blockchain, an anthology of speculative fiction, interviews, illustrations and theory published by Furtherfield, a centre for arts and technology based in the U.K.The book includes a rich collection of takes … everything from a round up of cryptocurrency mining in contemporary art, a blockchain developer’s Hippocratic oath and blockchain LARP. Furtherfield has also been hosting the DAOWO programme – a series of workshops on reinventing the arts lab with blockchain.Another irreverent project with a postwork dystopian twist, Max Dovey’s Respiratory Miner allows people to mine cryptocurrency by breathing.Breath (BRH) is part of an art performance and interactive exhibit that uses a spirometry, a medical technique for measuring lung capacity, to mine monero with a hashrate adjusted for rate-of- breath. It was recently exhibited at Generator Projects in Dundee in an exhibition curated by Alejandro Ball and Inês Costa, and will be exhibited again in January as part of Money Lab 2018.But of course, another dimension of the fake news era is – beyond the blurry synergy of jokes-as- art and art-as- jokes – is reality itself competing to out-weird them.How can you distinguish the troll from the truth?

That move erased previous record highs near $1.10 set on Aug. 17, and caused IOTA to jump up to become the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization on the CoinMarketCap rankings.As of writing, the cryptocurrency is at $3.50. Also as per CoinMarketCap, IOTA has depreciated by 26.17 percent in the last 24 hours. While the decline may look staggering, when compared to the 450 percent rally, the 33 percent drop feels nothing more than a good old technical correction.Furthermore, the price chart analysis points to $2.50 as the new base for the cryptocurrency.The above chart shows:IOTA prices may test $2.55 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement) in the next 24–48 hours (as the RSI and stochastic have turned lower from the overbought territory), but the support may hold, courtesy of the upward sloping 10-MA (seen sloping upwards towards the $2.50–$2.60 region tomorrow).Clearly, the base has shifted higher to $2.50 levels and it appears the rally is here to stay.

Last month, BNM issued an investor warning for those participating in blockchain token sales, also called initial coin offerings (ICOs).That announcement came soon after Chinese authorities issued a statement in early September ordering an immediate halt to all token sales. Under seeming regulatory pressure, leading cryptocurrency exchanges came forward in the subsequent weeks to announce they would be voluntarily closing their doors in light of the ban.Bank Negara Malaysia image via ShutterstockThis article has been updated for clarity."

was to emphasize the value of the native assets that incentivize a ...","Oct 28, 2017 at 00:12 UTC",Chris Burniske is a cofounder of Placeholder Ventures in New York and former blockchain products lead at ARK Investment Management LLC. Jack Tatar is an angel investor and advisor to startups.,"In this opinion piece, adapted from their book Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor’s Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond, they explain what mainstream financial commentators still don’t understand about the space – even if the markets are starting to get it.This has been a breakout year for crypto assets, but not so long ago we were thickly in “blockchain, not bitcoin” season.When we began work on our book, the consensus play seemed to be stripping the native assets out of blockchains and privatizing these originally open networks.With the book, we set out to make a stand for public blockchains as the more important innovation, to confront the misguided (and persistent) claim that crypto assets are elaborate scams, and to reassure macroeconomists that not all crypto assets are currencies.One of the main motivations for writing the book was to emphasize the value of the native assets that incentivize a distributed set of actors to provision a digital good or service with no central operator, i.e. crypto assets.Given the recent boom in interest around crypto assets, it seems counterintuitive that much of 2014, 2015 and 2016 were dominated by the idea that blockchain technology was important, while crypto assets could be forgotten and little would be lost.The term distributed ledger technology (DLT) became popularized to convey this concept, effectively washing those pursuing DLT-strategies clean of association with bitcoin. Many in the financial services industry were all too eager to forget that bitcoin was the mother of blockchain technology.Fall 2015 was when the frenzy around private blockchains really began, with Blythe Masters and Digital Asset Holdings featured on the cover of Bloomberg Magazine, and the Economist running a front cover piece called “The Trust Machine.”The combination of Masters, Bloomberg, and the Economist led to a spike in interest in blockchain technology that set off a sustained climb in global Google search volumes for “blockchain.” In the two weeks between Oct. 18 and Nov. 1, 2015, just after Bloomberg and the Economist published their articles, global Google search volumes for ‘blockchain’ grew 70 percent.We find ourselves on the flip side of Jamie Dimon’s reasoning: we believe the majority of private blockchains and DLT implementations will become the CompuServes and AOLs of the cryptoasset movement.Time and again through the history of information technology, open has won out over closed, public has won out over private. This is not to say there isn’t a place for closed and private, but rather that the impact such systems have on the world consistently pales in comparison to the change brought about by open and public systems.As we write in the book,“We see many DLT solutions as band-aids to the coming disruption. While DLT will help streamline existing processes — which will help profit margins in the short term — for the most part these solutions operate within what will become increasingly outdated business models.”Famously, Nout Wellink, former president of the Dutch Central Bank, said of bitcoin, “This is worse than the tulip mania…At least then you got a tulip [at the end], now you get nothing.”Nout displays a type of anti-crypto asset bias many baby boomers suffer from: if these things have no physical form, how could they possibly have value?To start, such a mindset then raises the same question of much of our world, which is increasingly based upon things that have only digital representations and amass massive amounts of value.For example, the market caps of Twitter, Facebook and Google are largely based on 100% digital services—certainly, those services produce cash flows, but cash is paid in exchange for a digital service, implying a purely digital service can have value. To sate the skeptical, in our book we provide a deep dive into methodologies for valuing bitcoin, and explain how the methodologies can be put to use for crypto assets more broadly.One of our favorite explorations was working to quantify the contributions of developers, which we don’t think we nailed, but hopefully provided a basis for future work and exploration. Below is one of the developer graphs, showing the frequency of activity based on code repository points and the number of days a crypto asset project has been in the works.In addition to explaining how crypto assets have a very real form of value, we spend two chapters exploring the most famous market disasters across all kinds of asset classes, including John Law and the Mississippi Company that brought France to its knees, the cornering of the gold market by Jay Gould, and different forms of this time is different thinking.We spend a significant chunk of time exploring the history of financial speculation to highlight that all asset classes go through growing pains, and we should expect the same of crypto assets.We may have new bad actors in the crypto markets, but they are playing old tricks.A question asked by many new to the industry is, why do we need more than 1,000 currencies? Can’t we do with just a handful? And if these things intend to be currencies, why are they so volatile?For that reason, we titled the book Cryptoassets, and not Cryptocurrencies, and we explain our thinking as follows:Historically, crypto assets have most commonly been referred to as cryptocurrencies, which we think confuses new users and constrains the conversation on the future of these assets. We would not classify the majority of crypto assets as currencies, but rather most are either digital commodities (crypto commodities), provisioning raw digital resources, or digital tokens (crypto tokens), provisioning finished digital goods and services.A currency fulfills three well-defined purposes: to serve as a means of exchange, store of value, and unit of account. However, the form of currency itself often has little inherent value. For example, the paper bills in people’s wallets have about as little value as the paper in their printer. Instead, they have the illusion of value, which if shared widely enough by society and endorsed by the government, allows these monetary bills to be used to buy goods and services, to store value for later purchases, and to serve as a metric to price the value of other things.Meanwhile, commodities are wide-ranging and most commonly thought of as raw material building blocks that serve as inputs into finished products. For example, oil, wheat, and copper are all common commodities. However, to assume that a commodity must be physical ignores the overarching “offline to online” transition occurring in every sector of the economy.In an increasingly digital world, it only makes sense that we have digital commodities, such as compute power, storage capacity, and network bandwidth. While compute, storage and bandwidth are not yet widely referred to as commodities, they are building blocks that are arguably just as important as our physical commodities, and when provisioned via a blockchain network, they are most clearly defined as crypto commodities.Beyond cryptocurrencies and crypto commodities — and also provisioned via blockchain networks—are “finished-product” digital goods and services like media, social networks, games, and more, which are orchestrated by crypto tokens. Just as in the physical world, where currencies and commodities fuel an economy to create finished goods and services, so too in the digital world the infrastructures provided by cryptocurrencies and crypto commodities are coming together to support the aforementioned finished-product digital goods and services.Crypto tokens are in the earliest stage of development, and will likely be the last to gain traction as they require a robust cryptocurrency and crypto commodity infrastructure to be built before they can reliably function.We wrote Cryptoassets to cut against the grain of thinking that claimed bitcoin and its digital siblings were a niche movement, and instead to emphasize to investors that this represents the greatest opportunity for investors and entrepreneurs since the Web.In the midst of writing, the markets came to the same realization, taking the aggregate network value of crypto assets up roughly 15-fold, and doing much of the convincing for us.Nonetheless, we hope the book serves as a useful guide to the uninitiated, an explainer for befuddled financial professionals, and a reflection on the wild ride it’s been for the crypto OGs.Tulip image via Shutterstock"

Should that information be changed, additional transactions can be created that detail changes to the data.Apple’s application describes three possible methods for establishing timestamps, with one of these scenarios centering around a blockchain platform.The program would generate a block containing a timestamp, with every subsequent block being added as miners verify each transaction conducted on the chain. This system is part of what Apple is calling a “multi-check architecture,” meaning that another system would confirm the timestamp after the block is generated but before it is added to the chain.According to the application, Apple would consider using a blockchain due to the decentralized security features it offers.As the document notes:“If any party attempts to alter a node some time earlier in the blockchain, each hash puzzle solution for block subsequent to the altered block becomes broken or incorrect. Each participant can see that such a broken blockchain does not agree with their own copy of the blockchain. The broken blockchain is thus not recognized by the nodes.”The benefit of using a decentralized ledger to store timestamps is two-fold, according to the application. Not only can the proper time be maintained permanently, it states, but the network is also protected from corruption if a single node is compromised by malicious actors.Image Credit: View Apart / Shutterstock.com"

Specifically, those benefits include less manual intervention, reduced risk, greater transparency and faster processing, Broadridge said.“Within the bilateral repo market, blockchain has shown that it can play an instrumental role in reducing operational cost and complexity,” Vijay Mayadas, president of global fixed income and analytics at Broadridge, said in a statement.The company said that a private blockchain was used, based on the Hyperledger Fabric 1.0 codebase.Repos are a form of secured short-term financing in which the borrower, typically a brokerage firm, sells securities (usually government bonds) to an investors and agrees to buy them back at a specified date and price. In bilateral repos, the parties are responsible for settling the transaction, rather than relying on a central counterparty.While that may sound arcane, the market for repos is a significant one, with a notional amount outstanding of $2.3 trillion, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. And Broadridge indicated it plans to do more with the technology in this area.The trial’s success “lays the foundation for the development of broader collateral management solutions on blockchain,” said Jerry Friedhoff, head of Broadridge’s securities finance and collateral management group.Broadridge has been actively testing out other use cases for blockchains in financial markets.Earlier this year, the company took part in a blockchain pilot focused on proxy voting, in partnership with JPMorgan Chase, Northern Trust and Banco Santander.

blockchain consortium and partner with the bitcoin app provider Abra.","Nov 16, 2017 at 13:00 UTC","Back in 1927, pilot Charles Lindbergh could have flown cash across the Atlantic Ocean faster than most payments happen over that same body of water today.","Whereas Lindbergh completed his historic solo flight from New York City to Paris in 33 hours and 30 minutes, a typical bank transaction today takes one to two days using Swift, and a typical ACH transaction can take twice as long.So, the news today that American Express has opened up a payments corridor using Ripple that can send money from England to the U.S. in just a few seconds has been a long time coming.A partnership with Spanish bank Santander, the new corridor is being positioned by Ripple’s global head of strategic accounts, Marcus Treacher, as an obviously faster, but also safer way to send payments across the Atlantic.A former Swift board member, Treacher told CoinDesk:“Whereas beforehand Amex had to send Swift messaging to the banks to request the payment to happen, now Amex is connected directly to the banks using Ripple and Ripple’s cryptography, so that the movement of value happens immediately.”Run by American Express’s foreign exchange international payments (FXIP) business, the corridor connects Amex customers in the U.S. using U.S. dollars to Santander bank accounts in the UK using British pounds – all via Ripple’s blockchain, RippleNet.According to Treacher, the integration routes non-card payments through the shared payment network for nearly instant, auditable cross-border payments.The project marks the latest development for Amex in a year that has seen the credit giant join the Hyperledger blockchain consortium and partner with the bitcoin app provider Abra.And for Ripple, which is coming off its recent Swell conference, the new work is another step toward letting its blockchain platform, tested throughout the first half of 2016, fly free.For example, Ripple recently connected Europe and the U.S. via its work with Swedish bank SEB, which late last year revealed its intentions to connect Stockholm with New York City using Ripple.Treacher said the SEB platform has already conducted $630 million-worth of transactions since it launched into production in Q2 of this year.While that project is advancing and is able to transact in nine seconds or less, according to Treacher, it is for now — like the American Express project — restricted to what he calls a “pure” blockchain that doesn’t require a cryptocurrency.What both these projects have in common is “a direct connection,” he said. “There’s no intermediary cryptocurrency.”Going forward, however, Treacher expects that other banks will increasingly follow in the footsteps of financial services firm Cuallix, which last month became the first Ripple partner to convert cross-border fund transfers into the blockchain’s native XRP token.Instead of holding dozens of what Treacher called “exotic currencies” in so-called nostro accounts around the world, Cuallix took the first step toward freeing up those funds otherwise trapped for new uses by holding the XRP itself.With Ripple’s main competitor, Swift building its own blockchain using Hyperledger, and a rising tide of upstarts with their own variations on the cross-border payments use case, it’s this use of Ripple’s native cryptocurrency that Treacher thinks will elevate the company above the competition.“Where these two come together is that as banks and users of banks, like American Express, adopt Ripple and start to connect up, XRP becomes an option they can use for liquidity purposes,” he said, concluding:“And that’s where it really comes to life.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple. Bridge image via Shutterstock"

It sounds too much like ‘IPO,'” he explained.The founder of blockchain development firm ConsenSys, Lubin went on to note that the use of the term (and similar investment language) tends to attract attention from regulators.Yet, the conversation, taking place at Retro Report’s offices in New York, as a preview of a series of films the two news organizations have produced together, was broader in scope.Elsewhere, Lubin acknowledged that there’s a lot of speculators in the cryptocurrency market, but that his company is trying not to get caught up in that aspect of the industry.Lubin told Delaney:“We are just building the system. We are doing our best not to think about price.”That said, he also argued that the interest in the price of crypto assets does draw users into the ecosystem. “I keep getting asked if it’s a bubble,” he said. “Of course it’s a bubble.”Still, he hopes there will be many more bubbles, each of which will bring in a fresh new crop of users who will find value in blockchain technology, whatever happens to the price of the various available currencies.That wasn’t the only provocative statement Lubin made. Delaney also asked whether some of the most notable protocols needed to be better designed to prevent theft of people’s assets.“Bitcoin and ethereum are agnostic when it comes to theft,” Lubin said. “Theft is a social construct.” In other words, he argued theft needs to be addressed in the applications on top of cryptocurrency, not in the protocol layer itself.Values, however, are not something to be installed in a money supply.“I’m not going to warn people about what values they should carry around with them,” Lubin said.Image courtesy of Quartz"

The order of these bases determines what physical traits a person, plant or animal features.The patent application notes that the SMP would use a nucleobase sequencing unit to actually establish the order of nucleobases in a given sample, which would then be verified by the blockchain before being permanently recorded on it.As the filing explains:“The present disclosure introduces methods and apparatuses for accomplishing additional useful work in conjunction with blockchain mining. In particular, as described in greater detail below, the present disclosure introduces methods and apparatuses for using data processing power of a data processing system to determine a sequence of nucleobases in a nucleic acid, and for then using the determined sequence of nucleobases as the basis for a [proof-of-work] for a new block for a blockchain.”The combination of blockchain tech and genetic sequencing isn’t exactly new, and cryptocurrency projects like genecoin have highlighted how the energy-intensive mining process (by which new transactions are added to a blockchain with new coins being minted as a reward) can be applied for scientific purposes.According to Intel’s application, proof-of-work algorithms “make it impractical for an attacker or group of attackers to corrupt or hijack the blockchain.”However, unlike POW systems used by the bitcoin and ethereum blockchains, the one mentioned in Intel’s proposed design would be multipurpose, as it would result in new blocks while simultaneously determining the genetic sequence from the data provided.The POW algorithm would, therefore, be used to both identify the sequence and subsequently verify it, according to the application, and the sequence recorded on one block would be used as a base for the POW problems in the next block.Intel chip image via Nor Gal / Shutterstock"

Based on his body of work, the project aims to solve one of the industry’s biggest challenges: the speed at which transactions are disseminated and recorded by distributed ledger systems.Founders of the project include SPECTRE co-author Yoad Lewenberg, and researcher Ethan Hileman, who worked with the team behind bitcoin privacy project TumbleBit. However, the team is not only equipped with developers, but also business experts – including Guy Corem, the former CEO of Israeli-based bitcoin mining firm Spondoolies-Tech, which raised more than $12 million in venture funding before shuttering operations.Together, the team has founded a new startup called DAGlabs, which is said to be raising $15 million as part of a Series A round.Yet, it’s the vision for the project that is perhaps most notable, given how it intends to achieve its goal.Rather than using a blockchain system, the public cryptocurrency will be among the first to operate via a system called a direct acyclic graph (DAG) – technology that Sompolinsky framed as a way to finally create a viable payments rail with distributed ledger concepts.Sompolinsky told CoinDesk:“We want to change blockchain into blockDAG. Whether you buy coins or not, you should think about this technology as the next step, releasing the blockchain from the naivety of the chain structure. You will feel this is the natural step towards using a real system.”For all the innovation, however, also notable is what the new cryptocurrency will share with bitcoin, today the largest and most valuable blockchain system, but one that is seen as increasingly less relevant for payments.According to the DAGlabs team, the new cryptocurrency will use a proof-of-work mining algorithm in which anyone who purchases hardware can compete for its rewards. That said, Sompolinsky doesn’t see bitcoin and other proof-of-work-based cryptocurrencies as competitors, so to speak.“I’m not competing with this entire plethora of new blockchains. We have a very boutique and niche and specific one and a well-defined one. We want to scale up layer one,” he said.As told by Sompolinsky, the project is also a critique on the current state of blockchain development, which he views as having been held back by in-fighting.In particular, he cited his experience with arguments about capacity levels on bitcoin, in which developers have often tried to push solutions to scalability in a way that did not change or update the first layer of the system – the blockchain itself. Referring to last year’s Satoshi Roundtable summit, an invite-only event in Cancun, Mexico, he recalled an experience where he was shocked by the state of the conversation.“Cancun was an eye-opener for me. In Cancun, everyone was fighting about 1 MB to 2 MB … no one was talking about increasing on-chain scalability by orders of magnitude,” he said.Sompolinsky framed the new cryptocurrency as a “vehicle” to enable researchers to take the next step in evaluating this line of exploration, one he argued will benefit from being tested under open market conditions.But given the slate of open-source projects utilizing the initial coin offering (ICO) model as a way to solicit market funding, often for untested concepts, he was also keen to differentiate his project as one based on years of accumulated research.“There are not 800 projects that implement a concept like DAG. Very, very few, maybe less than five that I know of, try to scale up the layer one. There are not 800 projects that say we should abandon the concept of the chain in favor of a graph of blocks,” he said.Among those that do are IOTA and byteball, the former being one of the few cryptocurrencies yet to garner a total market capitalization of more than $1 billion.When complete, the final network should appeal to anyone who wants to use a cryptocurrency with “very fast confirmation and low fees,” although that’s not to say the concept has been perfected. According to Sompolinsky, there are still plenty of items up for debate.For example, he is still open-minded about how he will structure any issuance, stating he is most strongly considering the model used by Zcash Company – the creators of the zcash protocol – wherein accredited investors are given tokens in stages for their support.Still, even those experienced in the field of cryptocurrency may find the concept odd. After all, after the hype around cryptocurrency faded, the so-called “underlying blockchain technology” was often touted as the real secret sauce.That notable researchers would stake a counter-thesis then, is of interest, though it’s arguably been a development that has simply received less attention over the years.Explored by Sompolinsky since his earliest work, the idea is that the process of ordering transactions into blocks, then selecting one to add to the chain, could be better optimized. In the SPECTRE concept, blocks are created at the rate of about 10 per second (as opposed to, say, ethereum where one block is created every 21 seconds). All of these blocks are referenced in a DAG, and multiple, interwoven threads of blocks are created. Then, the most valid transaction history is “voted” in by miners selecting the most inter-referential block graph.And because this allows for such a high quantity of transactions to be performed on the network, the transaction history won’t be permanently stored. Instead, transaction history will only be stored for a limited amount of time, and once it has been validated, will be removed.Other barriers, including backbone congestions and bandwidth, could lie ahead, though. The team intends to address these potential issues by building incentives into the protocol that encourage participating agents to behave correctly.Still, if the concept on the whole sounds familiar, you’ve likely come across it when reading about ethereum, which incorporated some of these ideas in how it rewards so-called “uncle blocks” – those that are not selected for inclusion in the ethereum blockchain, but still include useful work.Although uncles aren’t considered ultimately valid, they’re still profitable to mine, and still get referenced in the blockchain ledger itself.Indeed, what might be most notable about the SPECTRE project is that Sompolinsky’s ideas have often proved to be of influence. For example, Casper, ethereum’s hotly debated proof-of-stake protocol, derives its name from the GHOST protocol (a play on the “Casper the Friendly Ghost” cartoon series).While the bones of the project are in place, there’s still a few questions that need to be fleshed out before the cryptocurrency can be taken to market.Currently under development, the final protocol will be introduced in an upcoming white paper called SPECTRE2. The tech will then begin testing in autumn next year, and by winter, the new cryptocurrency will be launched. Ongoing updates will then continue apace.For one, DAGlabs has been working on combining the SPECTRE cryptocurrency with MimbleWimble, the natively private cryptocurrency that has been the cause of much excitement in the community. Further down the line, the platform also wants to allow DAG-based smart contracts to be written into the platform.But the final step that DAGlabs is pivoting towards is perhaps as ambitious as the cryptocurrency itself. Once the team has established a functioning cryptocurrency, they intend to allow the DAG infrastructure to facilitate something along the lines of “merged mining,” which is when the underlying hardware can be used to support a number of cryptocurrencies simultaneously.Still, it’s the manner in which Sompolinsky will launch the project that he ultimately wants to call attention to – calling the years of research and engagement with the open-source community, a “respectable” path to market.He concluded:“The easy path for us was to do an ICO; way easier than what we’re doing now. We’re going for the more respectable path of an equity.”Correction: Some quotes have been updated for clarity.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Zcash Company, the for-profit entity that develops the zcash protocol.Scary balloons image via Shutterstock"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Dec 2, 2017 at 16:00 UTC","Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.","What separates a real-deal token from a scam?A new wave of tech enthusiasts is asking that question as tokens rack up big gains and take over market discussions. And it’s certainly not one with an easy answer – even for long-time market observers.That said, big-name investors are attempting to make sense of the market, looking to separate the wheat from the chaff to find projects that can deliver real-world value.Amidst this sea change in the crypto space, CoinDesk spoke to Boost VC, Compound VC and Pantera Capital to get a feel for what tokens they’re investing in, or at least, planning to.To start, for many investors in the space, like Compound’s Joshua Nussbaum, decentralizing traditionally centralized systems has huge appeal.Nussbaum told CoinDesk:“Given the nascency of blockchain technology today, I’m most excited about projects solving open problems impeding self-sovereign decentralized applications.”Indeed, one thing that separates “serious” projects is their goal of functioning as underlying infrastructure that other apps will be built on (what Union Square Ventures has referred to as “fat protocols“).But while all of the projects below have piqued interest, it’s important to note the fruits of their labor and the money raised in ICOs may still be a long way off.Brayton Williams of Boost VC said:“Decentralizing the web will bring a massive rise in decentralized apps, but we are years and years away from the basic infrastructure being ready.”The following projects were each brought up several times in conversations (listed in rough order of ICO launch):For all cryptocurrency’s promise, investors have seen millions of dollars lost and jeopardized by coding mistakes.As such, the industry has called for reform, and it seems some of that might come in the form of another cryptocurrency token, Quantstamp, riding on a protocol for enabling the automation of security audits on smart contracts.In short, the team is building a set of code that can check smart contracts (the number of smart contracts on ethereum went into the millions this year), and that allows developers to farm out auditing to a team of hackers and verifiers on the network who will be rewarded for finding bugs.Quantstamp CEO Richard Mar told CoinDesk:“I was a pretty early investor in ethereum, because I’m a programmer, and the idea of a programmable currency really appealed to me, and I actually invested all my ether into the DAO in 2016. For a period, I actually lost all my ether while they were debating what to do about it, so that was really the birth of Quantstamp.”Mar continued, saying with the project “we’re really supporting other projects.”Quantstamp’s token sale launched Nov. 17 and will run through Dec. 16, unless it hits its $30 million cap on investments sooner.The past couple years of data breaches have illustrated how dangerous centralizing people’s personal data can be, culminating dramatically with the Equifax breach.The team at Bloom decided the best way to keep similar losses from happening again was to create a decentralized credit rating system, which includes identity, risk assessment and credit scoring.“What we’re able to establish is this opportunity to improve the way this data is aggregated,” Daniel Maren, from Bloom’s team, told CoinDesk.According to Bloom’s white paper, decentralization and the company’s privacy model will put loan recipients at the center of all transactions, in an effort to decrease the risk of exposure. This should not only bring some much-needed competition to the monopolistic credit agency industry, but also facilitate more consumer lending across borders and into communities that have a difficult time establishing credit.Bloom’s token – which will serve as a staking mechanism, a payment system and as a governance tool – is already available to investors as a part of the presale. The public sale opened on Nov. 30 and will last for a month, unless its $50 million hard cap is hit earlier.Keep’s a spin-out of Fold, which came out of the company’s interest in finding a way to store private information (specifically, gift card data) on a public blockchain.But then, “we realized that the privacy solution we were building was more valuable than the exchange we were building,” Matt Luongo, founder of Fold, told CoinDesk.That privacy solution, called Keep, is a privacy layer for ethereum that uses secure multiparty computation to store data in multiple places in such a way that smart contracts can still use it. None of the places know where the other pieces are, and yet they still have the ability to run the necessary computations with the parts they have.Luongo explained:“What zero-knowledge proofs do for users, secure multiparty computation does that for contracts.”While the people who run nodes will need to stake them with the Keep tokens, payments to use the network and to the nodes themselves will all be done in ether.“I’m sort of philosophically opposed to payments in utility tokens,” Luongo said.Across its presale and public sale, Fold has a $30 million hard cap. At the end of the public sale, which will start in January and will likely run for only two weeks, the company will debut its staking client, with the first product being an auditable random number generator.Another security-focused token to open its public sale soon (likely in early 2018) is NuCypher.The company has already commercialized proxy re-encryption whereby a user can encrypt their keys but then delegate access to those keys to other people in more traditional verticals. Now, it wants to adapt that product to smart contracts.For example, a user on a service would continue to be granted access to a pool of data so long as certain conditions were met, and the smart contract could rescind access if a user failed to meet certain conditions.“The important piece is you can do that delegate re-encryption without having to decrypt in the middle,” said MacLane Wilkison, co-founder and CEO of NuCypher.It’s a way of controlling large pools of data as it moves on and off-site.While broader details of NuCypher’s blockchain rollout have not been announced, in order to run its decentralized services, it will need to establish a network of nodes to run encryptions. The token will allow those nodes to stake themselves as part of NuCypher’s network.“By staking our token, we have a mechanism where if you’re misbehaving as a node you can be challenged and forfeit your stake,” Wilkison concluded.Morningstar estimates that YouTube earned $12 billion in 2016, yet tension between the site and the content creators who made it a multi-billion dollar company have gotten heated lately.Ben Yu, CEO of Stream, said:“Content creators and platforms are at fundamental economic war with each other, because each of them are working to take as much money as possible.”And in turn, Stream wants to fundamentally alter the incentive structure for user-generated video, decentralizing the process from start to end through the use of blockchain.For now, Stream sits underneath YouTube and Facebook, enabling videomakers to earn funds either from ads or direct viewer support, the latter a new revenue source for most videomakers. Later, the company will offer a Chrome extension that sits under videos and permits direct donations to videomakers who’ve joined the Stream network.But for all this to work, Stream needs a cryptocurrency token to monetize its platform. And it will be controlling the deflation of that token in an effort to better drive engagement on the platform.For instance, as Stream’s market capitalization rises, it will emit new tokens and split them up between existing token holders and creators.“We are able to capture the value that is accrued as the market value grows over time, and distribute that in the emission of a new token,” Yu said.Stream’s presale is running now, but it has not disclosed its public sale dates, although Yu said it was likely to kick off in January. The token sale is capped at $33 million.The “sharing economy” is less about sharing and more about rent-seeking by marketplace middlemen taking a substantial cut, or at least that’s how the team at origin sees it.Origin wants to change that, hoping to decentralize the sharing economy with ethereum by creating a peer-to-peer network for transacting directly for just about anything.In order to prove it works, the team anticipates it will probably have to build one of those verticals itself, but it hopes in doing so it will entice other entrepreneurs to build more.In reality, co-founder Matthew Liu acknowledges ethereum is probably not ready to handle a high-transaction market, like sharing homes or bikes. The team is currently thinking about building a product around selling professional work, such as design or coding.“I think the more complex scenarios like an Uber are not going to be the ones that emerge at the beginning,” Liu said. “We’ll probably be surprised.”In fact, he anticipates much smaller scale sharing projects (such as neighborhood tool sharing) will shake out, ones that would be too costly to build without the financial return should entrepreneurs have to build those marketplaces from scratch.The company hasn’t finalized its token offering plans, but it’s token, which serves as a staking and incentive mechanism, will likely be available in 2018, after it has completed a basic, functional product.In particular, Liu is optimistic about using tokens to reward early adopters, perhaps in the form of a cash-back scheme, where early users would get some tokens back after successfully completing a transaction.He told CoinDesk:“We believe in the better-than-free business model.”And last, but not least, especially for crypto enthusiasts who care deeply about decreasing surveillance and censorship, Orchid claims to be an enabler of surveillance-free internet.It’s product, the team believes, will allow web users to route around spying and censorship with a more robust network of nodes than The Tor Project network, because it will pay people for sharing unused bandwidth. By giving people a reason to put their computers on the network when they aren’t in use, the theory is it can get so many nodes on its network that surveillance would become all but impossible.“I think one of the biggest issues that other people who have tried to decentralize the internet is they’ve failed to have incentives to do it,” Brian Fox, one of the project co-founders, told CoinDesk.Orchid has already raised $4.7 million in venture funding from Andreessen Horowitz, Blockchain Capital, Compound VC, Crunchfund and Danhua, along with Draper Fisher Jurvetson, MetaStable, Polychain Capital, Sequoia and Struck Capital.And while ICO tokens have been primarily used as a fundraising mechanism, Fox said Orchid’s token is a “utility token,” meaning that it will provide owners of the token with a use on the platform.“When our protocol is 100 percent ready for consumption, so will our token. And we expect to see that happening sometime in the next six months,” Fox said.Lightbulbs image via Shutterstock.Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated Keep’s hard cap. 3:05 PM December 2, 2017."

The IDMA regulates the city-state’s media and information communications industries.The proof-of-concept phase took place between February and May of this year, according to the firms involved. The aim was to shift away from cumbersome, paper-based approaches – which can take days or longer to complete – to wholly digitized ones. By including a shared ledger, banks can verify a customer by turning to information that is being stored and updated overtime.In a statement, IDMA expressed support for tests of this nature, particularly through the lens of broader work within Singapore on developing new systems to serve an increasingly digital economy.CEO Tan Kiat How said of the trial:“IMDA supports the ambitious use of technologies to transform businesses and create value to citizens. This willingness to experiment is crucial in achieving our vision of a dynamic Digital Economy for a Smart Nation. Revamping the KYC process using blockchain technology is one such example. We are heartened that financial institutions are developing innovative FinTech solutions to improve productivity and deliver a better experience to their customers.”As for the results of the trial, the banks said that the outcome was mostly positive. According to OpenGov Asia, the group reported that the system saw significant uptime during operation and was resistant to tampering attempts.Looking ahead, the banks are said to be leaning toward additional testing.

According to an Oct. 31 blog post from Centra, both Sharm and Trapani exited the project following the sale’s completion, as well as a profile of them and the ICO by The New York Times.In the complaint, lawyers for the plaintiff alleged that the Centra sale constituted an unregistered offering and sale of securities.They wrote:“…in connection with Centra Initial Coin Offering (the “Centra ICO”), Defendants raised over $30 million in digital cryptocurrencies by offering and selling unregistered securities in direct violation of the Securities Act.”The complaint also accused the defendants of misleading investors about the nature of its relationship with card networks Visa and Mastercard, as well as listing fake team members on its website.In a statement posted to its blog, the Centra team disputed the lawsuit filed by “an alleged purchaser of Centra Tokens.”“This lawsuit, which for the most part, appears to repeat unfounded claims regarding Centra Tech, alleges that Centra Tech’s initial coin offering of Centra Tokens was an unregistered sale of securities. The plaintiff’s complaint attempts to mimic claims and allegations the Securities and Exchange Commission has lodged against other cryptocurrency offerors,” the startup wrote, adding:“Centra Tech disputes the allegations in the complaint.”The Centra ICO was notably promoted by Mayweather as well as music producer DJ Khaled prior to its completion.

260,www.coindesk.com,"Oct 3, 2017",Appcoin Law Part 2: The SAFT Solution,https://www.coindesk.com/appcoin-law-part-2-saft-solution,"The investors send their purchase money (in dollars, ether, bitcoin, etc.) 
to the developers. In exchange, the developers sign a SAFT and work ...","Oct 3, 2017 at 12:00 UTC",Marco Santori is a fintech lawyer based in New York City where he leads the blockchain technology team at Cooley LLP.,"In this opinion piece, part of an ongoing series on the state of U.S. law as it applies to initial coin offerings and token sales, he explains the significance (and limitations) of the recently announced SAFT project.Nearly a year ago, I gave a generalized explanation of how some token sales might violate federal securities laws in the U.S. I also gave some tips on how to build a token and network that would avoid security status.Unfortunately, many token sellers have continued selling tokens to the public prior to developing the network’s actual functionality in what I’ve taken to calling a “direct presale.” Many commentators, myself included, have found the “direct presale” model to be a blunt and risky strategy. I warned against it at the end of my October 2016 op-ed.Now the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has fired its shot across the bow of the industry in the DAO Report, and other countries have imposed outright bans.In this Part 2, I propose an alternative: a comprehensive transaction framework that could significantly reduce the risk of the token seller running afoul of the securities laws. We’ve been working on developing this structure with a few different participants in the industry, including investors, issuers and developers. A few of our clients are already testing it in the wild.It’s called the SAFT: Simple Agreement for Future Tokens. Obviously, it’s a play on the Y Combinator SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity). The SAFT is a contract between developers and investors. The SAFT framework is a transaction flow with this contract at its heart.We didn’t invent the SAFT. It was being used in an unexamined way by token sellers before we started suggesting it. It’s high time someone looked under the hood, though, and examined whether it actually, you know, works.At a high level, the SAFT looks like this:Compare this two-step process to the direct presale, where developers sell a pre-functional token directly to the public for immediate delivery or for delivery at some date in the future.The developers raise millions of public dollars, and use that money to develop the network protocol to functionality. The public takes on all the risk that the project fails, and does so without the benefit of standard disclosure principles, fiduciary duties, heightened antifraud standards or accreditation requirements.I remain a supporter of the token sale in general, but the direct presale is troubling for at least a few reasons. To keep with the theme of Part 1 of this series, I’ll focus on one reason: a direct presale could be considered the sale of a security to the public without a registration statement or exemption in place. That’s illegal in the U.S.I think the SAFT framework addresses this concern elegantly. The SAFT is a written document (available as an exhibit to this white paper here) that looks like a SAFE, and, like a SAFE, the SAFT is a security. At least we think it has a very good chance of being considered a security – and the parties fully intend for it to be one.We aren’t trying to avoid the securities laws here. We’re trying to use them.Investors purchase the SAFT not because they intend to use the tokens on the network once it is developed, but because they seek to sell the tokens on the open market and realize the profit from their discount. There is no (or almost no) consumptive intent here. The investors expect to profit from the efforts of the developer.Because the SAFT is a security, the developers treat it like one. That is to say, they follow the securities laws when they sell it: they file the requisite form with the SEC, they accredit their investors (if required) and they might even circulate a private placement memorandum.The investors send their purchase money (in dollars, ether, bitcoin, etc.) to the developers. In exchange, the developers sign a SAFT and work over the next few months or years to develop the network into something genuinely functional.Once it is functional, the developers create the tokens and deliver them to the investors. Once any lockup period in the SAFT has expired, the investors can then sell the tokens on the open market. The developers can sell them publicly as well.The most common criticism to this approach goes something like this: “OK, the SAFT is a security. You’ve followed the securities laws there. But once the developers sell the tokens to the public, plenty of purchasers will buy them just to speculate by trading on an exchange! Isn’t that a security as well?”Well, probably not. Remember, just buying something to resell it for a profit on a secondary market doesn’t make the thing a security – not even if all of the other prongs of the Howey test are satisfied. The question is: Where can the buyer reasonably expect that secondary market value appreciation to come from?Remember from Part 1, for a token to be a security, the Howey test requires that the purchaser expect his profit to result “from the efforts of others.” If the purchaser expects profit, but it’s predominantly from something other than the efforts of others, the thing he bought is not a security under Howey.For example, when someone buys gold or sugar rights as an investment product (i.e. just to resell it on an open market), that person expects profits, but that profit isn’t from the effort of any particular third party. It’s from the great variety of market factors affecting supply and demand for gold or sugar.The price of a functioning token is similarly determined. The value of a functioning token being put to its intended use will be determined by a great variety of global supply-and-demand forces. For a pre-functional token, though, the buyer should expect one force to predominate the others: the efforts of the developer who has promised to imbue the token with functionality.Thus, the “efforts of others” prong of Howey can be satisfied relatively easily by a pre-functional token.Once functional, the efforts of the developers will no doubt still figure into the value of the token on secondary markets, but it would be difficult to say that protocol upgrades could be the “undeniably significant,” “essential efforts” (both Howey requirements) that typically cause the price to move.The “essential” efforts of the developers have usually been expended already in creating the functional network. Purchasers of tokens on that already functional network no longer need to rely on the developers to expend those efforts.Indeed, in most cases it might be difficult to say that the price move was caused by any “efforts” at all. For functional tokens, price moves can be caused by any number of forces affecting supply and demand. To use examples from the SAFT Project white paper: A token acting as a medium of exchange on a decentralized market for graphics processing power (I’m making this one up) could fluctuate with the release of a hit video game franchise or the availability of rare earth elements used in graphics card processing.A token acting as a simple coupon for a free box of razor blades (making this one up, too) could fluctuate with the price of steel, or even the popularity of beards in a target market. To be sure, the token sellers’ managerial efforts in updating the network will factor into the price, but will it predominate all the other forces? For an already-functional token, not often.In a SAFT transaction, the relatively heavyweight securities laws apply at the early stages, when the whole project could fail and they’re most needed.Recall that the SAFT is a security, so anti-fraud provisions, accredited investor requirements and the like apply to the transaction. The more manageable consumer protection laws apply once the network is functional and, at minimum, buyers expect the network to function.So, the SAFT framework calls for securities laws when the buyer takes on enterprise risk, and calls for the consumer protection laws when the buyer takes on product risk. That struck us, the authors of the white paper, as the right state of affairs, and we think the SAFT gets us there.That said, there are plenty of limitations on the flexibility of the SAFT framework. For example, the SAFT:Even understanding the limitations, the SAFT isn’t quite ready to serve as a market standard. For one thing, the analysis we’ve done is limited to U.S. law. Another reason is that the commercial terms of the SAFT are bare-bones and basic.For these and other reasons, we’ve launched the SAFT Project. It’s meant to be a forum for discussion and sharing ideas around the SAFT framework. Our door is open for suggestions and criticisms.In Part 3 of this series, I intend to discuss some SAFT best practices, including tax management strategies and the kinds of tokens that are most compatible with the SAFT framework.Have an idea for a commercial provision for the SAFT? A criticism of the regulatory arguments supporting it? Noticed a policy consideration we overlooked? Think this whole SAFT thing is doomed? We’d like to know why!

As an example, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation could be removed from secondary trading.“There’s been extensive investment in research and proofs-of-concept for blockchain in enterprise over the last several years, and very little of it has reached enterprise value yet,” Wilcox said, adding:“One of the major blockers that has been preventing larger adoption is the privacy problem, and we have a live solution to that privacy problem for the first time.”But while this is the first implementation of ZSL in an enterprise blockchain, it may not be the last.As part of the announcement, JPMorgan and the Zcash Company jointly expressed plans to continue working together with other enterprises building blockchain technology. Further, variations of the ZSL integration could someday include different parameters to define the proofs.In the initial implementation, those parameters came directly from zcash (which has a market cap of $559 million as of press time), but the JPMorgan source said they could be modified to accommodate other concerns in the future.Also revealed, as part of an expansion effort to attract new talent, ZSL is scheduled to be released as open-source software at a future date. In this way, individuals and other organizations will be able to experiment and test new applications of the code.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Zcash Company, the for-profit entity that develops the zcash protocol.JPMorgan building image via Shutterstock"
