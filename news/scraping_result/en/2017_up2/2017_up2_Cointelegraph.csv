Platinum, an alleged scam created by a South Korean teenager.","Dec 10, 2017","According to JoongAng, South Korea’s largest mainstream media outlet, investors in the local cryptocurrency exchange market are outraged over Bitcoin Platinum, an alleged scam created by a South Korean teenager.","The Twitter handle @bitcoinplatinum, the official account of the Bitcoin Platinum project has advertised the project, as a hard fork of the Bitcoin Blockchain. Earlier this month, the creator of Bitcoin Platinum claimed that a group of miners, developers, investors and Bitcoin users will hard fork the Bitcoin protocol at block 498,577.However, the Twitter account has not provided the public with any information about supporters, developers, investors and/or miners. Even before this most recent incident that set off the South Korean Bitcoin community, investors remained highly skeptical of the project given its vague description and vision. Bitcoin Platinum claimed to achieve “Satoshi’s original vision of Bitcoin as decentralized electronic cash,” copying the vision of Bitcoin Cash.Adding to the skepticism, the Bitcoin Platinum account has not offered any additional information apart from PR gibberish. One statement from Bitcoin Platinum read:“Bitcoin Platinum brings true Blockchain ledger to the world. Merchants and users are empowered with low fees and reliable confirmations. The future shines brightly with unrestricted growth, global adoption, permissionless innovation and decentralized development.”Earlier today, on Dec. 10, after releasing all of the statements in English since the first week of November, the Bitcoin Platinum Twitter account holder wrote in Korean:The brief statements above, written with a highly informal tone, read:“[Bitcoin] shorting very good,” and “so who told you to buy Bitcoin, shorting [Bitcoin] is the best.”Based on the tweets released by Bitcoin Platinum, the motivation behind the Bitcoin Platinum project evidently was to try to decrease the price of Bitcoin by introducing a hard fork and profit off the short-term price trend of Bitcoin by shorting it.JoongAng and other South Korean mainstream media outlets revealed that the administrator of the Bitcoin Platinum Twitter account and the creator of the project, which is now suspected be a scam, is a South Korean teenager, who allegedly introduced the project to find an opportunity to short Bitcoin in the South Korean Bitcoin exchange market.The teenager then admitted on Twitter from the Bitcoin Platinum account that the project was created as a scam. The Bitcoin Platinum creator wrote:“Please forgive me. Bitcoin Platinum is a scam coin. I created the project to earn five mln Korean won ($4,590).”Last month, a $200 mln Ponzi scheme was unraveled, which targeted middle-aged investors. The operators of the Ponzi scheme established a Bitcoin consultancy firm in Seoul, lured in investors in the market, and offered unrealistic profit margins, claiming that their money would be invested in Bitcoin.Ultimately, the five individuals behind the Ponzi scheme were arrested, as investors requested a local police department to investigate into the scam many months after they did not receive any payouts from the operators.In the upcoming months, the South Korean government and its cryptocurrency task force formed by five ministries and commissions, including the ministry of strategy and finance, will create policies to regulate the South Korean cryptocurrency market. The upcoming regulation is an effort to crackdown on scams and fraudulent operations, such as the $200 mln Ponzi scheme mentioned above and, most recently, Bitcoin Platinum."

or trade can be a lot less stressful. 50008 Total views. 2053 Total shares.","Nov 23, 2017","Taking the plunge and entering the crypto space can be daunting. There is no centralized authority to hold your hand, and the rumors and stories circulating around digital currencies can be fear-inducing.","Thankfully, the cryptocurrency community tends to be very helpful and is in no shortage of good advice. In this article recently published on Forbes, the author sums up the most important things to keep in mind in just 5 concise points.With these few straightforward tips, negotiating that first Bitcoin transaction or trade can be a lot less stressful.There is plenty of hype, rumor, success stories and tales of horror when it comes to Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Make sure you understand exactly what you’re getting into, and don’t risk more money than you could afford to lose.Bitcoin is an exciting world to be in, but it is one that is complex and confusing if you only enter it on hype. Many people buy expensive cars, not knowing how the engine works, and that is fine because if it breaks there are mechanics and garages. In the cryptocurrency world, it is you against the world, it is decentralized and there is no one to hold your hand.Pawel Kuskowski, CEO & co-founder of Coinfirm, gave this advice:""The more you understand, the better off will be.""Don’t simply speculate about the big money there is to be made, actually go out there and learn how Bitcoin and Blockchain work. Lucas Geiger, founder and CEO of Wireline, says:""This may seem obvious, but I think the first thing is take time to understand the Blockchain. I say this strongly because few people will do this. If you don't have a high-level understanding of how a Blockchain stores secure data (such as coins), then you are investing in the equivalent of tulip bulbs.”A good place to start is the beginning - with Satoshi Nakamoto's white paper. Crypto fund manager Jacob Eliosoff wrote:""If you have any technical bent whatsoever, take 10 minutes to leaf through the original 2008 Satoshi white paper. It's only eight pages, legible and an inspiring work of genius!""The great thing about the cryptocurrency ecosystem though is that there is a lot of material and information out there. Loads of websites and resources are aiming at trying to make the technology easier to understand.Even more than that, the investment world is also trying to simplify things by making Bitcoin more available to traditional investors. The introduction of things like futures will help people understand how Bitcoin works.In any investment there will be risk, but that risk is somewhat magnified by Bitcoin’s newness and extreme volatility. Eliosoff emphasized:""This is still an extremely high-risk space. Don't invest money you can't afford to lose!""It is tempting to be bold and brazen, throwing money at Bitcoin after hearing the success stories, but especially as a first timer, caution is the better part of valor. There is no reason to look to become a millionaire overnight with Bitcoin, and by sinking huge amounts of capital in it from the start, you will be met with more problems than solutions.Marshall Swatt, a serial entrepreneur, suggested:""Start small and invest a small portion of your capital.""Additionally, from Tim Enneking, managing director of Crypto Asset Management, advises:""Don’t chase Bitcoin prices. Decide on a entry point and stick with it. With Bitcoin, you’re almost always right in terms of foreseeable price action – it’s your timing that might be off. So, be patient, and let the Bitcoin price come to you.""There are a number of investing strategies that work really well with Bitcoin, and those that offer the most success are often the most cautious.Things like ‘Dollar Cost Averaging’ - putting in the same amount of money into an investment at the same time each week or month - is great for Bitcoin as it helps you ride out the lows, as well as the highs.Most new digital currency enthusiasts hear first about Bitcoin, but there are thousands of other cryptocurrencies out there, and some have grown much faster than even Bitcoin. Diversification is wise, particularly since many of these “altcoins” perform well when Bitcoin drops. Tech entrepreneur Oliver Isaacs writes:""Hedge against volatility and don’t put all of your eggs in one basket. Much like investing in the stock market or FX, you should diversify your funds as a risk management technique."" Famed stock picker Ronnie Moas is a strong believer in diversification. It is easy to become infatuated with one cryptocurrency, especially Bitcoin, but it is important to hedge your bets.“Do not put all your Crypto money into Bitcoin,” Moas warns. “You must diversify across at least a dozen of the more than 1,000 names. Focus on names in the top 50.”There is still a lot of hacking and thievery that goes on in the crypto space, and it is important to take precautions. It isn’t too hard to make hackers’ lives difficult. Use the exchanges for just that: exchanging. Once you have bought a currency, move the money off the exchange and into a wallet that only you control, such as a hardware wallet.A lot of people have been burned on exchange hacks - none more so than the major Mt. Gox one - but even recently, things like BTC-e and the charges against their CEO would have caused many people to lose out on huge amounts of money.Matthew Unger, founder and CEO of iComply Investor Services Inc. suggested:""Just like you keep some cash in your wallet, some in your bank account and perhaps the really valuable stuff in a safe, you need to manage digital currencies in the same way.""Bitcoin is notorious for its volatility, so much so that many traditional investors are terrified of it. A massive drop in Bitcoin’s price does not spell permanent disaster, but it is hard to stay committed when you start heading into the red.Diversification is a great strategy to help with that, but it takes some thought and effort. Of course, the most famous (and so far, successful) Bitcoin strategy of all is to ‘hodl’ - or hold onto -  your investment no matter the market volatility.You can also buy and forget, as not keeping an eye on the market can help keep you from worrying about the dips and miss the volatility."

CBOE launched its Bitcoin futures product on Dec. 10, and CME (a much larger market) will begin trading the cryptocurrency’s futures on Monday, Dec. 18.Markets reacted to rising prices with a snowball effect, triggering mass consumer interest in both buying and trading the virtual currency.

Bankers, mainstream media and pundits continue to call Bitcoin a bubble, even as the bull marches on."

difficult after all. Here's a primer. 77357 Total views. 1202 Total shares.","Nov 30, 2017","With Bitcoin recently reaching a high water mark of an all-time high of $11,500, it’s inevitable that relatives will start asking questions.","tried to convince parents to buy me bitcoin in 2010, they laughed at me and i never got bitcoin because of it.When your parents ask questions, it somehow ends up either they don’t agree with your idea or relate it to their younger years.Of course, that’s not a problem, except if you talk about new innovation that has a potential to change their perspective. Bitcoin is one of the hottest topics today, but not everyone can grasp its full potential, especially when you talk to the oldies like your parents.So how can you explain it to them without getting a blank stare?Don’t go explaining Bitcoin using jargons like cryptocurrency, rather explain it using examples they can relate to. Defining something unknown with something equally unknown is a big no-no.You can relate it to a regular money or stocks. Explain that Bitcoin is regular money that has value and can be used to buy goods and services. It is also similar to stocks because the value fluctuates based on the supply and demand. However, it doesn’t give any dividends, unlike Bitcoin.Now here is the part where your parents will ask where do you get Bitcoins and if you have one available in your pocket. We bet your parents will understand the term “digital money” so you can use it pertaining to Bitcoin.You can also say that it’s like a debit card or when your boss pays you through direct deposit. The money goes straight into an account without touching a hand.On the question where can you get one, we'll use the example of a mountain called Mount Bitcoin where there are miners. Those who mine Bitcoin do it through their computers with a lot of computational power. It's like mining another scarce resource, gold, which also required specialized and expensive equipment. So, these Bitcoin miners are giving up something in the hopes of getting, maybe, one Bitcoin that can be broken up into many little pieces and distributed in exchange for the kind of money you’re familiar with.This will give your mother some thrill. Imagine having one Bitcoin equalling for $11,000?Who wouldn’t go crazy on spending such amount? Since there’s no transaction charged for spending, say a few pennies, you could use it on websites that accept micro transactions or at least Litecoin.Elon, consider accepting Bitcoin for your cars. It's very easy to sign up for a @coinbase merchant account and integrate it. And there's 0 risk. Good PR too.

Future of cars bought with the future of money. Think about that!For your dad, you can say how a lot of people are using them for investments. Like, they’re putting money in Bitcoins because the returns are better. We bet saying Bitcoin values have been pretty volatile. In the last year, one Bitcoin has jumped from $4,000 to over $11,000 will get your dad jump for excitement.You see it is not easy explaining something new to your parents, but if you follow these points and try hard enough, we’re sure they would understand how Bitcoin works.Who knows they might even invest in cryptocurrencies when they see how they could potentially help ease transactions usually made horrible by traditional payment options."

It covers everything from Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to ICO regulation and investment analysis. If you want to become our guest author and get published on Cointelegraph, please send us an email at mike@cointelegraph.com.","It would appear that 2017 could be fairly called the Year of Bitcoin. The most popular and thus valuable cryptocurrency has been breaking record after record this year. On 8 November, 1 BTC was trading somewhere around $7,700; at the beginning of the year it was worth about $960). Crazy.However, due to the fork that did not happen (and the Bitcoin community was rather looking forward to it, as the intended development should have increased the speed of transactions), the market reacted harshly. Bitcoin quickly lost quite a chunk of its value. At one point in time, it was as low as $5,600, but at press time had rebounded to $7,200. Hence, it is growing. Again.Despite seeing all of this, I am still quite surprised that many people tend to think that Bitcoin is a currency, though at this point in time it is not a threat to our regular fiat currencies. On the other hand, a number of people seem to realize that transaction times, energy inefficiencies in Bitcoin mining and the like are some of the key challenges that prevent Bitcoin from becoming a true alternative to USD, GBP or EUR.No matter which position you hold, I must disappoint you (but stay me with nevertheless!) – Bitcoin is no longer a currency, and it will never be one. Here’s why.Money, or essentially any fiat currency (such as USD, GBP or EUR) should satisfy three key criteria:It should function as a medium of exchange,It should be a unit of account, andA store of value.Although Bitcoin has some of the attributes listed above, it most definitely fails to meet them all. Let us take a look at them one by one.We most probably have to agree with this one as more and more merchants are starting to accept Bitcoin as a payment option (Google has launched its payments API with Bitcoin, Amazon is rumored to soon start accepting payments in Bitcoin, etc). Moreover, the network of Bitcoin ATMs and the number of Bitcoin Payment Cards is growing constantly, which makes this crypto similar to our beloved fiat.However, this is only one side of the coin. In fact, the most popular cryptocurrency performs quite poorly as a medium of exchange. This is fundamentally due to high volatility, which makes it inconvenient and impractical to denominate goods or services in Bitcoin. For example, at the beginning of the day you might price your MacBook at 1 BTC, but due to daily fluctuations (that can range up to 30 to 40 percent), at the end of the day it should cost 1.5 BTC. To put this into perspective, the daily exchange rate between USD and EUR is on average 1 to 3%.In economics, a unit of account denotes a nominal monetary unit of measure or currency used to represent the real value of any economic item such as goods, services, assets or liabilities, income, expenses. Again, referring only to volatility, we can understand that Bitcoin does not satisfy this criterion.Another important point to consider is that no lenders use Bitcoins as the unit of account for such things as consumer credit, loans or mortgages, nor are credit or debit cards denominated in Bitcoin, per se (you can spend your Bitcoin, but the real transactions happen in fiat since the digital currency is sold on the back-end).The last trait that should be found in any currency is probably the only one that fits Bitcoin the best.It is quite clear, and I have argued this numerous times, that Bitcoin has emerged as a digital peer-to-peer cash, and thus is challenging current monetary systems. Yet, over the years it has outgrown its initial purpose, and now it is more similar to a store of value, or an alternative investment.The latter two are essentially driven by speculation and hype around the cryptocurrency space in general, and Bitcoin in particular. We can look no further than Google search trends for Bitcoin, and compare those with the price of BTC. Put those together, and you will see nearly 1-to-1 correlation.Moreover, many people are buying (or storing their wealth in) Bitcoins simply because they expect the price to rise, at least for a while. This is reminiscent of the Greater Fool Theory which states that people buy something simply because they expect that there will be a greater fool that will buy their asset later at a greater price.But there are others who are storing their wealth in Bitcoins simply because the alternative (fiat) is non-functional. Look no further than Zimbabwe or Venezuela. In the former, BTC is priced somewhere around $13,000! Due to high inflation, the demand for Bitcoin has skyrocketed lately in this Southern African country, as not only people, but also businesses demand Bitcoin for day-to-day purchases.Nevertheless, though the store of value resembles Bitcoin pretty well, it is still rather different to what conventional money should have. Probably one of the key features of currency as a store of value is that it should be stable. And this is especially important for countries that are striving to attract investment. Simply put, those who invest are expecting some stream of future earnings, and unstable currency compromises investors’ ability to accurately predict future earnings, which makes investments less valuable, and hence less attractive.After taking a look at the key attributes of a currency, we can easily see that Bitcoin is not one. Taking into account slow transactions, relatively high costs and energy inefficiencies for running the network, as well as some fundamental disagreements (in terms of future developments) within the Bitcoin community, it is more than obvious that this cryptocurrency will never seriously challenge USD, GBP or EUR.However, this does not mean that Bitcoin has no future. Quite the opposite. I can imagine it being quite a popular and strong (alternative) asset class. With the help of network effects, rising interest from institutional investors, as well as more crypto-friendly regulatory framework, Bitcoin can become quite a something.Disclaimer: The views and interpretations in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of Cointelegraph.Bio: Linas Beliunas is a business developer, sales professional, FinTech strategist, as well as cryptocurrency and blockchain enthusiast.

The views and interpretations in this article are his own and do not necessarily represent the views of the World Bank or Cointelegraph.,"*The article was updated October 15 17:45 UTC“- I will have one Big Mac, large French fries and a Diet Coke please- Sure, 12 bits please”Will there ever be such an exchange or is this just science fiction? In this hypothetical world, 1 Bitcoin is worth $1,000,000, 1 bit is worth $1.00 (1 millionth of a Bitcoin) and 1 Satoshi is worth 1 US Cent. There is no consensus on what the value of one Bitcoin is or should be. The spectrum of opinions ranges from Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, who thinks it is a fraud and therefore worthless, to Bitcoin maximalists who believe that the sky's the limit. Somewhere in the middle of that, Mohamed El-Erian recently said that “The current prices [of Bitcoin] assume massive adoption, which is not going to happen."" He went on to say that Bitcoin should only be worth “a third” of its value at the time - $4,000. Mohamed El-Erian is a smart guy, he is the former billionaire CEO of PIMCO and former IMF economist, could he be right? Has Bitcoin already peaked?Unlike other cryptocurrencies that may have more sophisticated uses, like smart contracts for Ethereum, Bitcoin’s main uses are being a store of value and a medium of exchange. Its competitors are therefore the established main fiat currencies (US Dollar, Euro, Yen) and Gold. If the Bitcoin price already assumed massive adoption, the market capitalization of all Bitcoins should be close to that of the US Dollar and Gold, right? It turns out that nothing could be further from reality. While the market capitalization of Bitcoin is currently $90 bln, the money supply of the US Dollar, i.e. M2, cash, deposits and money market funds, is $12,500 bln while the value of all the gold ever mined is close to $8,000 bln. This means that Bitcoin is only worth around 1% of the value of its two main competitors. I am not sure this would qualify as “massive adoption”, so I guess I have to respectfully disagree with Mr El-Erian on this one.For the Bitcoin price to assume massive adoption, its price should increase... a lot! The following charts illustrates what it would mean for Bitcoin to reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion ($1,000 bln) and for the price of a single Bitcoin to reach $1,000,000.This illustration assumes that 16.5 million Bitcoins, the number of Bitcoins mined to date, are available. In reality, the pool of Bitcoins available is most likely much smaller. Hundreds of thousands or even millions of Bitcoins may have been lost in the early years, at a time when Bitcoins were basically worthless. Satoshi Nakamoto - Bitcoin’s enigmatic founder - never moved any of his one million Bitcoins (now worth more than $5 bln). So either he is the greatest hodler ever, or he disappeared and his private keys are gone with him.The head of the IMF said two weeks ago to a room full of Central Bankers that they should not “dismiss” cryptocurrencies as they may very well give Central Banks “a run for their money”. If this is indeed the case, then forget the price of one Bitcoin, the number that everyone will be quoting very soon will be the price of one bit.*Expert Blog is Cointelegraph new series of articles by the crypto industry leaders.

is ...","Nov 27, 2017","There are a number of threats to any asset, be it gold, fiat currency or even stocks. Some of these have real-world issues, such as loss, theft or destruction, and Bitcoin is not separate from that.","There is more than enough literature on the theft of Bitcoin, people leaving themselves exposed to cyber criminals, but there are also instances where people are losing their coins.Just like Gold can be sunk with a pirate ship, or wads of dollar bills burned in a fire, digital currencies can also be lost and never found again on the Blockchain.New research by Chainanalysis, a digital forensics firm that studies the Bitcoin Blockchain, showed that 3.79 mln Bitcoins are already lost. This is on the high estimate of the study's finding, with their low estimate still sitting at an astonishing 2.78 mln. This makes the percentage of lost coins based on what has been mined today to be at between 17 to 23 percent.According to a breakdown supplied by Chainanalysis, their research seems to be quite thorough and a little more than just speculation.In their segmentation of coins that have been lost in different ways, they have broken it down into coins mined in 2017 - which they believe are still all intact and available. It makes sense that there would be more caution in 2017 with the value of fractions of coins worth huge amounts.When they refer to strategic investments, they are looking at people who have been holding their coins for a very long time, and thus are perhaps not lost, rather just growing in a stagnant position.Interestingly, and in a big claim by Chainanalysis, they take into consideration the coins that originally belonged to Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. He is estimated to be in the possession of over one mln coins.However, Chainanalysis have decided to class that collection of coins as lost forever. It is a claim on which their research hinges on as Nakamoto's coins make up nearly half of their higher estimate of lost coins.Should, one day, Nakamoto wake like a sleeping giant and bring his coins back into play, this research will be inconsequential and the market will have to front up to a rather large boom in supply.Because Bitcoin operates on a promise of a limited supply, missing coins, especially verging on 25 percent, will clearly be playing a big part in determining the market. Supply and demand will be quite skewed if those coins mined are not reflecting on the market.However, do these missing coins really mean that Bitcoin is more scarce than people assume?“That is a very complex question. On the one hand, direct calculations about market cap do not take lost coins into consideration. Considering how highly speculative this field is, those market cap calculations may make it into economic models of the market that impact spending activity,” said Kim Grauer, Senior Economist at Chainalysis.“Yet the market has adapted to the actual demand and supply available – just look at exchange behavior. Furthermore, it is well known monetary policy procedure to lower or increase fiat reserves to impact exchange rates. So the answer is yes and no.”"

seen its fair share of them. 17644 Total views. 609 Total shares.","Sep 20, 2017","With Bitcoin price reaching a new high of $5,000 recently, and then dumping back down to nearly $3,000, it’s been a wild ride this month.","These crashes are part and parcel of the volatile digital currency, and drops of 10, 20, even 40 percent are not that uncommon.Since Bitcoin began, there have been some major crashes, but there have also been some good lessons to learn.In one of the earlier and larger drops, Bitcoin price went from $233 to $67 overnight, a massive 71 percent drop in 12 hours. It would take seven months to recover.This meltdown was attributed to Bitcoin rubbing shoulders with the mainstream for the first time. The digital currency had never crossed $15 before 2013 but a flood of media coverage helped drive it well above $200.This was a drastic and violent correction that followed the exuberant price rise, although, there was also an outage at Mt. Gox which was said to be a catalyzing factor.After April, Bitcoin price hovered around $120 until later in the year when prices suddenly skyrocketed to a high of $1,150 in late November. However, by mid-December, the price had tumbled back down to less than half of that, and that’s where it would stay for four years before crossing $1,000 again.The late 2013 crash had all the signs of a bubble, as amateur investors rushed the digital currency. It was further perpetuated as regulators took a positive stance on it, while exchanges such as Coinbase had started making the buying process far easier.Adding to the long road to recovery after the collapse in December 2013 was the Mt. Gox calamity that nearly sunk the whole Bitcoin boat. Bitcoin was steadily growing through January and February when it suddenly fell nearly 50 percent from $867 to $439.This collapse was triggered when Mt. Gox announced that it had had a major hack. On Feb. 7, the exchange halted withdrawals, and later revealed thieves had made off with 850,000 Bitcoins (which would be worth around $3.5 bln today).In early January of this year, Bitcoin price once again crossed the $1,000 mark which set off a massive price spike as through June the digital currency was topping $3,000. However by Mid-July it had fallen back 36 percent to $1,869.Despite the boom and increased interest, there were still concerns about the code and a civil war was brewing. The Aug. 1 hardfork was looming large and scaring many investors as to the future of the coin, since users and miners sought different solutions.Ironically, such a fork did materialize in August in the form of rival Bitcoin Cash — but this seems to have done no long term harm to Bitcoin.With the fork out of the way and peace restored between different parties, Bitcoin once again tore off on a huge growth spurt. It climbed close to $5,000 at the start of September before plunging 37 percent by Sep. 15, shaving off over $30 bln from Bitcoin's total market cap in the process.This drop has been put down to one thing really, and that’s China. The socialist country first loudly cracked down on ICOs, and then went after digital currency exchanges, making its feelings on the disruptive monetary system known.While it is not a lesson, more a way of life with Bitcoin, it must be plainly known that the digital currency is volatile.What’s just as apparent is that Bitcoin crashes seem to coincide with speculative run-ups coupled with exogenous shocks, such as a major hack or a government crackdown.However, it has been seen that Bitcoin always bounces back. The bouncing back process can be anywhere from a week to a couple years, and the cautionary tale there is long term holding bypasses any stress caused by massive drops.The crashes of late have been far smaller, less susceptible, and the bounce backs have been quicker and more resilient. This is indicative of a maturing market. Today, the cryptocurrency market is so much bigger and has proven to be resilient."

But the currency came back stronger every single time. It is currently roaring at $7,000. You would think that more mainstream journalists would take a step back and wonder why this cryptocurrency keeps coming back stronger and stronger every time it is under attack. But you’d be wrong--most mainstream journalists suffer from a serious case of confirmation bias. That means they dismiss any information or data that does not support what they already believe, namely, that Bitcoin is a bubble, end of discussion.Each time the Bitcoin bubble burst, Bitcoin showed how resilient it was. Bitcoin has been demonstrating its antifragility - term coined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his book Antifragile - every time it has been threatened. It is not only robust, but it actually gains strength from disorder and instability. This has led a number of people to refer to the currency as “antifragile.”The more the status quo establishment fights Bitcoin, the stronger it will get, as people realize that no one has the power to stop Bitcoin. You do not go after Bitcoin this hard if you do not believe that it has the power to disrupt entire sectors of the economy.There are thousands of Bitcoin Core nodes located around the world, all it takes is one node to survive for Bitcoin to stay alive. This is how powerful a decentralized system is.The world’s largest option exchange - CME Group – announced this week it is going to start listing Bitcoin futures contracts before the end of the year. This first step will pave the way for financial products such as ETFs that will open the market to retail investors.The “Bitcoinization” of a few economies has also already begun. One of the only ways to send money to Venezuela these days is through Bitcoin, while in Zimbabwe, Bitcoin trades above $10,000 as the country is going through a severe currency crisis. Bitcoin is quickly becoming the safe haven of the 21st century. You can take money in and out of any country in seconds. No other asset allows you to do that.Of course, Bitcoin will go through many other ups and downs, the road is going to be bumpy and the outcome is uncertain, but one thing is for sure: it is going to be one hell of a journey!Bio: Vincent Launay is a finance specialist at the World Bank in Washington DC.

landmark decision to offer futures. 59591 Total views. 776 Total shares.","Nov 3, 2017","This week, Bitcoin price, on its usual upward trajectory, barely blinked as it smashed through the $7,000 mark. The Bitcoin community obviously celebrated as the king of digital currencies shows no sign of slowing, but what is behind this latest rally?","The biggest factor behind the rally was the announcement of Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s decision to offer Bitcoin futures.Firstly, what is a Bitcoin future and why is it causing such a buzz on main street, Wall Street, as well as on the Bitcoin price.Futures are an essential part of mainstreet trading and investing; however they are also reserved for more steady and less volatile assets. Now, with this decision, Bitcoin is being legitimized somewhat, and that has again piqued Wall Street’s interest.  Wall Street, despite their divide and their clashing of ideologies, still has an important role to play in Bitcoin price as the financial bastion has shown their influence before.In an earlier rise, coming after the Aug. 1st fork, Bitcoin hit a massive rally that was attributed to Wall Street flooding into Bitcoin once the heat was off from the so-called ‘civil war.’Now, this move by the CME has again given Wall Street more reason to put faith in Bitcoin and thus the demand has skyrocketed, along with the price.Bitcoin’s step into mainstream trading, however, is also a poignant reminder that the digital currency is still in diapers when it comes to institutionalized trading and investing.Large-scale mass adoption in trading has a long way to go as there is still room for ETFs, which would really open things up, but that is a long way off still.The SEC has maintained their position on a Bitcoin ETF, stating that it is not on the cards while they continue to watch its volatility and nature.Bitcoin’s rally reached as high as $7,300, but quickly fell over $500 in a mini-correction. However, it has leveled off again over $7,000.While in the world of Bitcoin that does not seem like a massive swing, it is those moves that the SEC does not like the look of.The SEC noted that Bitcoin had “fundamental flaws” that made it a “dangerous asset class to force into an exchange traded structure.”"

But for many of us involved in the world of cryptocurrencies, this has been one Christmas Special we will never forget.","November was an extraordinary month, as Bitcoinsmashed barrier after barrier on its way to the $11,000 mark. Despite multiple corrections, time after time, the virtual currency bounced back from volatile swings in price.Some called it a bubble, others said is was just the tip of the iceberg, but no one predicted the wild ride Bitcoin would endure in the weeks leading up to Christmas.Last month the price of Bitcoin reacted strongly to the news that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) were planning to launch Bitcoin futures - which eventually led to a massive bull run. Both mainstream exchanges successfully launched their new offerings and in both instances the price of Bitcoin reacted favourably, although the CME launch a week after CBOE had far less of an affect on the price of Bitcoin.The general sentiment ahead of the futures’ launch was that mainstream financial institutions openly trading on the Bitcoin market would cause a greater stream of money to flow into Bitcoin, raising the price. Indeed, that is exactly what happened - for a time. But not long after Bitcoin hit the meteoric $20,000 mark, the market underwent a massive correction, sinking down to just under $11,000 on Friday, December 22.It wasn’t just Bitcoin that endured a wild ride, as the whole cryptocurrency market saw losses, with the combined market cap dropping $200 bln in a single day.Another curveball that had some effect on the market was the surprise announcement that Coinbase was launching Bitcoin Cash trading on it’s platform. That saw the price of Bitcoin Cash surge - but the integration was soon marred by scandal.Coinbase had to suspend buy and sell orders on its GDAX exchange due to significant volatility. A day later, the company confirmed it would also investigate allegations of insider trading by employees, who were prohibited to trade Bitcoin Cash in the lead up to the launch.Meanwhile Litecoin founder Charlie Lee made two controversial moves. First, he tweeted his belief that a multi-year bear market was coming which could see Litecoin drop as low as $20.Ok, sorry to spoil the party, but I need to reign in the excitement a bit...Buying LTC is extremely risky. I expect us to have a multi-year bear market like the one we just had where LTC dropped 90% in value ($48 to $4). So if you can't handle LTC dropping to $20, don't buy! ?Roughly a week after expressing his views about Litecoin’s future, Lee sold or donated all of his Litecoins, citing a conflict of interest. Lee’s announcement became national news, as the likes of CNBC, Fortune, Forbes and others reported on it. However, The Verge has questioned Lee’s motives, suggesting that for a currency’s founder to sell his entire holdings would seem to indicate a lack of confidence in the currency’s future.Litecoin also saw a drop in price from it’s recent all-time high at $360 to settle around $280 at press time.Watching Bitcoin nosedive from $20,000 was quite a sight - and social media platforms were awash with all sorts of memes amid both positive and negative sentiment. Many were adamant that they would ‘hodl,’ while others panicked and looked for advice.Well-known Blockchain engineer Jameson Lopp summed up the mood perfectly in this Tweet:Good things come to those who HODL.H/T @thecryptopher pic.twitter.com/Z5lGwAhHhUWhile there is still plenty of market volatility across the board - Bitcoin, Ethereum and other altcoins seem to have steadied after what is sure to dubbed the ‘Great 2017 Correction.’What we do know is that 2018 has plenty in store for the cryptocurrency market. Back in November, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said that a host of institutional investors have been waiting to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, a lack of trust in current exchange service providers led many to believe they couldn’t risk their clients money.He estimated that at least $10 bln is ready to be invested into the market. Mike Novogratz has been singing the same tune - saying ‘the herd is coming’ in relation to the changing sentiments of mainstream financial institutions towards cryptocurrencies.However, following recent volatility, Novogratz has now hit the pause button on a $500 mln fund he was preparing to launch.The history books will tell us that CBOE and CME were the first mainstream exchanges to actively invest money into the cryptocurrency market. Nasdaq isn’t far behind, given their plans to launch futures next year.And amid the carnage of a cryptocurrency market freefall, banking giant Goldman Sachs is planning to launch a cryptocurrency trading platform by mid 2018. They would be the first major Wall Street investment bank to actively trading virtual currencies.Considering that Bitcoin grew in excess of 1,000% in 2017, anything could be possible in the next 365 days. It’s clear that many financial institutions have taken stock of the emergence and establishment of cryptocurrencies and are looking to step into the market. Failing to do so risks getting left behind.Financial analysts, Blockchain specialists and cryptocurrency experts will be gearing up for an exciting year ahead. With so much already planned, one thing is for certain: digital currency is here to stay."

There could be some big swells from some big whales on its way.As it stands, the man with a fraction of a coin is as happy as the man with 100 the way the Bitcoin market operates at the moment. The more the price rises, the happier each of them are. Higher price means better returns and more money for nothing.There is no need for the big name players in the Bitcoin market to cause too many waves as they are currently profiting happily from the way things are going. However, futures introduce a different type of playing field as whales, and these are whales that make Bitcoin whales look like shrimp, have an incentive to drive the market down.Cash markets, such as Bitcoin, are there to serve investors, but a futures market is something different, it is there for people to hedge against risk. It is a pessimistic way to invest, and it bases itself on profiting when things go bad.Futures are seen a lot in farming as crops are subject to so much volatility (from pricing and markets to weather and pests) so a farmer will sell his corn on a futures market to guarantee the price when he does eventually get his crop to market.At the same time, someone who wants the farmer’s crops will buy that futures contract in the hopes of securing a price should the price of the crops rise. Both of these players are now hedging on opposite ends and a balance is essentially struck.Understanding futures like that, and applying the model to Bitcoin, there is a clear gap.Miners sell their ‘futures contract’ to make sure they get the price for the coins they intend to mine in the future. Bitcoin holders are doing the same sort of thing in order to hedge their downside.But now, there is no hedger on the buying side, so there is no equilibrium and the pressure is asserted on the downside. There is balance coming from the buyers, the speculators, but that equilibrium has always been met by a strong Bull market.Now, there is a reason to be a strong bear with Bitcoin futures as three is profit to be made hedging against Bitcoin. Those entering the market, flush with never before seen cash, could enter as a bear and do all they can to drop the market.Because the market is still just in its infancy, there is a chance that bears could overwhelm it, and still profit."

asserting its dominance as the father of crypto. 146425 Total views.","Nov 22, 2017","While the price of multiple cryptocurrencies continue to see their values soar, the current price of Bitcoin suggests it is still very much the father of digital money. Max Keiser, host of Russia Today’s Keiser Report, agrees, and believes that Bitcoin will ultimately reach a price of $100,000.","The price of Bitcoin hit an all time high over the weekend - moving past the $8,000 mark following an uncertain couple of months that had the SegWit2x fork hanging over the markets like a dark cloud. Yesterday, Bitcoin continued its rise, nearly touching $8,400 and establishing another all time high.Keiser believes that Bitcoin’s ability to survive numerous changes and countless altcoin competitors proves it is the most dependable cryptocurrency:“Bitcoin will dominate and lead crypto going forward. Hundreds of obituaries have been written about Bitcoin and none of them have come true and none will. Fact is, Bitcoin is a gift from God to help humanity sort out the mess it has made with its money.”While Keiser’s assertions bode well for Bitcoin, it doesn’t change the fact that the network is still facing growing pains. SegWit2x may have been abandoned for now, but the short-comings it aimed to solve are ever-present. The simple fact is that the increasing amount of transactions are putting strain on the network capacity - and the backlog of transactions makes Bitcoin cumbersome as a payment method.However, Keiser believes he has an answer for that: Bitcoin should focus on its role as digital gold and leave the job of payments to others. Keiser said:“Dash is emerging as the crypto payment rail while Bitcoin asserts itself as Gold 2.0. I suggest those frustrated by the Bitcoin scaling debate to embrace Dash for payments and leave Bitcoin Core alone to continue working on Gold 2.0.”Many investors seem to be responding well to the narrative of Bitcoin as digital gold. There’s a lot of talk of mainstream institutional investors breaking into the market with massive, billion dollar investments. Indeed, a plethora of good news has recently buoyed Bitcoin’s price, with much of it relating to Bitcoin’s growing connections to traditional finance. The biggest news by far is CME’s upcoming launch of a regulated Bitcoin futures market, with major hedge funds announcing they will begin trading the digital currency as soon as this futures market goes live.Suddenly, Keiser’s prediction of Bitcoin hitting a $100,000 high doesn’t seem so far fetched. The broadcaster likened Bitcoin’s emergence, resilience and success to Apple:“I remember when I bought Apple stock in the late 1990's when it was valued for less than $100 million, Michael Dell publicly said that Apple should shut its doors and stop the embarrassment of being in business. Twenty years later, it's approaching a $1 trillion market cap, and nobody talks about Michael Dell anymore.”In August, Cointelegraph interviewed Keiser about Dash’s sponsorship of his Great American Pilgrimage. During the interview, he made this prediction about the future of digital currency:“I don't like price predictions because it takes away from the single best way to participate in the crypto economy, buy and HODL. The next 10 yrs will be planet-changing as money transforms into global networks of monetized thoughts interacting seamlessly, globally, consciously and unconsciously; intermingling in a spontaneous joyfest of bountiful, life-affirming cryptoeconomics.”"

views. 438 ...","Oct 30, 2017","The Bitcoin boom has forced the mining sector to try and keep up, as the energy and effort put into mining a single coin is paying higher and higher. However, it’s also causing the mining sector to go into overdrive seeking the elusive prize.","One way that miners have sought to gain an additional edge in the game is to try and cut their energy costs. It’s good for the miners, for Bitcoin and for the environment if energy usage plummets.The Bitcoin mining industry consumes 22.5 TWh of energy annually, which is the equivalent of 13,239,916 barrels of oil. With 12.5 Bitcoins being mined every 10 minutes, that means the average energy cost of one Bitcoin equates to 20 barrels of oil.It seems an inodramate amount of oil to be spending on mining a digital currency, yet when considering the worth of one coin, which is now valued at more than 100 barrels of oil, it becomes understandable.However, despite the lucrativeness of it all, there are serious implications environmentally for the mining sector of Bitcoin. Accordingly, if the boom continues there should be plans to try and keep energy costs down.To put this in perspective, the total energy consumption of the world’s Bitcoin mining activities is more than 40 times greater than that required to power the entire Visa network.It’s unsurprising to find that the countries that have been seen as the superpowers of Bitcoin mining have been those who’ve had cheap electricity, or worked towards it.China has long been a Bitcoin mining hub as it has some of the cheapest electricity, however, with its stance on Bitcoin changing Russia is stepping in.There were plans for Russian subsidization for Bitcoin mining, but the socialist country is heading down China’s route in regards to its feeling towards Bitcoin.This has led to other countries becoming mining powerhouses.The future of mining seems to be a lot greener and a lot more efficient and economical. Many mining companies are looking to places like Iceland and Kazakhstan, where the temperatures are lower and there’s no need to spend money on cooling.Additionally, there have been forays into using sustainable and renewable sources of energy to power mining operations. These are beneficial to the plant and to the miners, as power is a lot cheaper in many parts of the world."

Total views. 11923 ...","Nov 28, 2017","Bitcoin has finally surmounted the greatest psychological barrier of all, passing $10,000 and showing no signs of stopping. Following a week of consolidating at all-time high levels around $8,000, Bitcoin found the strength to move up powerfully over the Thanksgiving weekend.","Black Friday saw the currency hit new highs in the upper $8,000s before surmounting the $9,000 level Saturday and immediately charging toward the $10,000 mark Sunday. These price increase come on unusually high volume, with fear of missing out (FOMO) bringing new investors in rapidly.Bitcoin has had a stunning year, by anyone’s accounting. Having started the year at just under $1,000, the price jump to over $10,000 represents some incredible changes. This growth is not a flash-in-the-pan either, but is supported by growing mainstream adoption and massive trading volume. In just the past 24 hours Bitcoin’s trading volume has exceeded $5 bln.The year has been filled with major announcements that signal the widespread acceptance and growth of Bitcoin. Extensive coverage by mainstream analysts was followed by huge growth in Bitcoin hedge funds and institutional investors.Now the launch of regulated futures markets is imminent, and Bitcoin has become the investment du jour of the financial community. Whether they love it or hate it, big bankers can’t keep their mouths shut about Bitcoin.The attention Bitcoin has garnered from mainstream media has been astounding. Only a year ago, news would spread of a local newspaper mentioning Bitcoin, and the community would be thrilled. Now, major publications mention Bitcoin daily, and no one is surprised. Bitcoin has literally gone viral.Further, the growth in hedge funds that invest in cryptocurrencies has exploded as well. As early as August, the news that 70 new funds could be starting was a headline. Now, the existence of 120 new or modified crypto related funds barely warrants a head nod.Another major contributing factor for Bitcoin’s sizeable gains is the reality that Bitcoin futures will soon be traded on major regulated markets. Two of the world’s largest futures markets, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE), will soon launch Bitcoin futures.As adoption increases, the network is forced to keep pace. However, Bitcoin has continued to maintain a huge transaction volume as the price has increased. As shown below, the daily transaction volume is now over $2 bln.  As transactions continue to proliferate, Bitcoin mining has become increasingly profitable as well. Miners today make $1.5 mln in fees alone, not including block rewards. Consider the chart below, as the market has increased, the mining returns have increased exponentially as well.All this growth in adoption is not localized either. The entire global community has begun to embrace Bitcoin, from Venezuela to Zimbabwe, and from South Korea to Switzerland. The international transactions numbers have been steadily rising since Bitcoin’s inception.  The numbers are staggering, but what is most encouraging is that the growth in markets has not been geographically localized. A simple perusal of charts from various countries around the world indicates that adoption is not localized, but global, and nearly uniform.Regions with greater access to technology have, of course, seen the most consistent adoption curves. For example, consider the European adoption graph below, and note  that the adoption has steadily grown, but the huge jumps are not the norm.However, other nations with substantially less democratized technology are just now catching up. Venezuela is a great example; as the Bolivar has devalued, the adoption of Bitcoin has risen exponentially.Part of the growth in global access has been the sudden increase in Bitcoin ATMs, as well. A remarkable 4.8 Bitcoin ATMs are installed somewhere on a daily basis, and those numbers will only continue to grow as new ATM companies come online all the time.  With all this news, it should be no surprise that Bitcoin has crossed the $10,000 mark. And certainly, as adoption continues to grow, the price will undoubtedly increase, since new users must buy in at current rates and will drive the price up.Whether the bulls or bears will ultimately have their way remains to be seen, but an analysis of volume and transactions would indicate that not only is there no bubble, but the vast majority of the public are now beginning to gain awareness of digital currency. Coinbase, and other exchanges report huge moves in user growth. This could be just the beginning."

A decentralized currency takes a huge amount of power out of the hands of the government who look to keep tabs on currency within their borders. Taxes and regulations of money is a powerful tool for governments.There has even been talk about how Bitcoin is the most crowded trade, indicating that traditional trading is clearly taking a hit.With a successful digital currency, big governments will lose seigniorage income—the benefits derived from printing money, and they will lose the ability to control the economy.For the banking sector, losing the ability to handle the money that flows between central banks and the economy is at the core of the banking business and the very existence of the monetary economy.These fears may well be a little too strong although Bitcoin flies in the face of a traditional monetary economy, and it is a decentralized system, there is an understanding that it can be supplementary rather than an undermining technology.Apostolos Pittas, adjunct professor of economics at LIU Post, has said:“Digital currency, as is the case with Bitcoin, helps to smooth the lending process. Recall what happened in 2007-2008 during the financial crisis. Credit dried up as banks stopped lending, and the markets froze. With a digital currency like Bitcoin, lending is decentralized, or peer to peer, and as a result, lending may continue, allowing money to reach those who need it."""
16,https://cointelegraph.com,"Dec 3, 2017",Is Bitcoin Diamond a Better Bitcoin?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/is-bitcoin-diamond-a-better-bitcoin,"Bitcoin Diamond claims faster transactions, better privacy and lower costs. 
92771 Total views. 645 ...","Dec 3, 2017","Cryptocurrencies can be novel from the point of view that they bring their own nomenclature into existence, which makes users who do not know about these terms nervous or filled with anxiety. Add to this, the confusion that media generates surrounding certain events like hard forks, which are just a change to a protocol of a cryptocurrency that makes previous invalid blocks or transactions on the Blockchain valid. In a hard fork, there is a permanent moving away from a previous version of the Blockchain and the older version nodes would not be accepted by the newest version. So, in essence, there is a split in a cryptocurrency.","These splits are in a way a form of market democracy and supporters of various chains get a chance to take their own stance and stand. A famous hard fork for example was in Ethereum, post the DAO hack when the team of Ethereum (ETH) tried to rollback transactions to try to restore the stolen funds. The resulting disagreement led to the birth of the new cryptocurrency called Ethereum Classic (ETC).  Bitcoin is not immune to such hard forks either. The latest hard fork being that gave birth to Bitcoin Diamond (BCD), which was forked at block 495866 and assumed its very own chain. The fork took place on Nov. 24, 2017, due to the efforts of Team EVEY and Team 007, two Bitcoin miners who, Reuters report, “were not happy with some of the major downsides of Bitcoin.”Bitcoin (BTC) has been the most popular cryptocurrency of its times. However, it is not free from its shortcomings. BTC transactions have been taking notoriously long time to process and they have gone expensive over time. This is because BTC blocks have been limited to one megabyte in size, which translates into around three transactions per second. BCD, on the other hand, has now raised the block size limit to eight MB, this will improve transaction capacity and blocks will be generated five times faster. The cost of BTC transactions has been rising, which has been casting a shadow on its practical applications. BCD, on the other hand, seeks to bring down costs related to transactions. A BCD executive was quoted at a press conference as saying:“Our primary objective is to lower the cost for participation thresholds by reducing the transaction fees and the cost of participation. The total amount of Bitcoin diamond is 10 times as much of Bitcoin, which translates into reduction of the cost for new participation and reduction of the thresholds.”Finally, at the moment BTC transactions are visible in the public domain and anyone can see data related to how much amount is in another person’s wallet and their conducted transactions as well. BCD will encrypt the amount and balance, which will afford greater privacy to users of the new cryptocurrency.At the time of writing of the article according to the Bitcoin Diamond Foundation, BCD had already been launched at 33 exchanges around the world. Some of the exchanges that have embraced this new cryptocurrency include Binance, OKEX, Huobi.Pro and Bit-Z. EXX.com has also announced futures trading of Bitcoin Diamond. The foundation also claims that there are at least six wallets that will support BCD, which are BitGo, Bitpie, Coldlar and ATOKEN.The BCD Foundation has also announced the accession of Linke Yang, co-founder of BTCC to the foundation. Yang, co-founded BTCC, which was the first digital currency exchange in China. It is thought that the Yang’s role as BCD advisor, would come as a shot in the arm for Bitcoin Diamond and help it gain ground in China. In an emailed communication by Bitcoin Diamond Foundation, Cointelegraph has been informed that the Chinese, Italian and Korean community teams have been established. The foundation says that the North American and Australian community are ‘progressing.’  We were also informed that more ‘pioneers’ may be joining the BCD advisor team, which is likely to boost the cryptocurrency’s R&D efforts and also lead to an increase in popularity.As Bitcoin Diamond starts to go mainstream, they have a plan for the future in place. We are told that the medium-term plan with a time frame of December 2017 - December 2018 (Q2), which is based on communications between BCD development teams EVERY and 007 laid out the hard fork for Bitcoin block at height 495866 on Nov. 24, 2017. This gave birth to Bitcoin Diamond.By December 2017, there are plans to have the Bitcoin Diamond mainnet, wallet, nodes code and API release as well as the open source on GitHub in place. (Follow BIP-044, Index999). It will be possible to mine BCD either with a full node client or alternatively with a pool. Three pools will support BCD mining and mining will commence after mainnet releases. BCD will support both AMD and Nvidia based GPU mining. Finally in December, there are plans to conduct an algorithms upgrade for BCD main chain encryption, this will encrypt both the transaction and balance amounts.Whether or not Bitcoin Diamond is a better Bitcoin, depends on who you ask. In recent days, there have been hard forks that have led to the emergence of Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold and now Bitcoin Diamond. The idea behind a hard fork is that a new chain emerges, and hopefully a better one. The stated and ultimate aim of Bitcoin Diamond is to become “the better coin,” which does not suffer from a lack of privacy protection, slow transaction confirmations or a high threshold for new members. This will allow them to provide better solutions to financial companies worldwide.The total supply of Bitcoin Diamond would be 210 mln or 10 times more than that of Bitcoin. 170 mln of these coins would be on the market, while the rest would be reserved for the community in a ‘rewards pool’ for the purposes of tributes and mining. One of the criticisms that has been made about Bitcoin Diamond was that the teams behind the cryptocurrency have remained anonymous, but we should not forget that to date the founder of Bitcoin has remained an enigma as well. Anonymity should not come in the way of adoption and at the end of the day markets will reveal if Bitcoin Diamond offers features that they think are worth their while.

It is up to the investor to decide.There are five methods described below that can help turn a sickening crash into a chance to make more money than before.A lot of these methods are well known, and almost cliched, but the real difficulty is not simply knowing them, it is being brave enough to enact them in the face of a collapsing market.With Bitcoin’s path on a constant upward trajectory, buying the dip is one of the easiest ways to make compelling gains. However, it is not always easy to pull off as it requires timing the market.Yazan Barghouti, project lead at Blockchain company Jibrel Networks, emphasized:“Buying a dip in a crash can be difficult, because when do you know it has bottomed out?""Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged digital currency platform Whaleclub, also spoke to the caveats surrounding this particular strategy:""Buying the dip only works in a general bull market. If the global trend reverses, buying the dip is useless.""While the cryptocurrency markets seem to be intrinsically linked, and will broadly be in a bull or bear mode, there are still opportunities to be made on certain strong coins through the market.Vinny Lingham, CEO of Civic, suggested that investors ""find quality coins with teams you can trust to execute and weather the storm"" and then hold.In trying to identify these opportunities, one must identify coins with a solid foundation and a compelling business model.A byword when it comes to cryptocurrencies, holding on through the bad times is the most basic and respected strategy. If you do not sell your coins when they are below what they were bought for, you have not made a loss.This equates to buying digital coins and simply holding onto them through thick and thin. It is one of the most basic strategy for dealing with a crash - do nothing.Additional advice offered by Zivkovski is to make sure you are holding the top five cryptocurrencies by market cap as they probably have the best foundation and ability to beat the crash.A somewhat controversial strategy, and one that flies in the face of holding is exiting to fiat currencies.Crypto asset managers are notorious for doing this when there is a crash. However, it is difficult as it again requires timing the market both on exit, and then again on reentrance. Marshall Swatt, founder and CTO of Coinsetter, said:""Exiting to fiat requires that you be able to time the market, both when you exit and again when you return. The smartest strategy is to allocate money you can afford to put at risk, and then stick with your plan regardless of the variations in the market.""This is a tool used mostly by traders, and it is one that if executed correctly offers huge returns.A few popular exchanges do offer this as an option, but it takes a lot of skill and experience to get this right. Shorting an asset involves borrowing it from somebody else, selling it, and then buying it back later to return to the person you borrowed from. If the price drops, you’ll make a fortune. If the price rises, you could lose everything.The strategy you use should be based on your skill level and your comfort with risk. If you don’t want to take any chance of losing your digital currency, then holding is probably best. If you don’t mind being in fiat for awhile (possibly forever), then you can sell at highs and try to rebuy lower. If you’re a high flying and experienced trading, short selling might work for you. Use whatever strategies you are most comfortable with, and always know your investing goals."

Following the spectacular break of the $5,000 barrier last week, many ...","Oct 20, 2017","Bitfinex, the highest volume BTC/USD exchange, broke the $6,000 barrier earlier today and has now been joined by all other major exchanges. At press time, the price of Bitcoin had reached $6,041 according to Coinmarketcap.com, causing its market capitalization to exceed $100 bln for the first time ever.","The latest surge comes after a week of consolidation over the $5,000 mark, despite the comments of naysayers like Jamie Dimon and the president of Brazil’s central bank. In the last month, China banned ICOs and Bitcoin exchanges, South Korea banned ICOs, the US SEC stepped up scrutiny of ICOs, and the CEO of Chase Bank has been unable to keep his mouth shut.None of it matters.For years, Bitcoin has been called “the honey badger of money,” and “antifragile.” The “Bitcoin don’t care” meme is perhaps most applicable of all right now. Bitcoin simply doesn’t care what China does, or what bank CEOs say, or what central bankers think. The only thing Bitcoin cares about, apparently, is increasing in price and adoption.Many have speculated that institutional money is making its way into Bitcoin, and they are likely correct. LedgerX was recently approved by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to create a regulated Bitcoin options market. Such a market would give institutions wary of holding the actual digital currency a way to expose themselves to its price movements. LedgerX is scheduled to debut Bitcoin options trading this month.Bloomberg reports that industry executives expect approval of a Bitcoin ETF in the future. They point to LedgerX, saying that with a regulated derivatives market having been approved by the CFTC, it’s only a matter of time before the SEC gets on board and allows an ETF to be created. Earlier this year, SEC had themselves stated that in the event a regulated options market is developed, they may reconsider their position on Bitcoin ETFs.The approval of an ETF, or exchange traded fund, is seen to be the holy grail of institutional Bitcoin adoption. Such a fund would be required to actually possess enough Bitcoin to be fully “backed,” and would be easy for institutional and retail investors to use.Perhaps the most surprising aspect of Bitcoin’s latest price moves is the rapidly approaching SegWit2x hard fork. Though 85% of miners are still signalling their intention to go through with the fork, recent defections (such as F2Pool) and statements from exchanges like Bitfinex and Coinbase may have convinced investors that the hard fork will not actually happen.When asked about SegWit2x, industry CEO Bharath Rao commented that the debate seems to be between miners and businesses on one side, and users and developers on the other. He suggested that whatever chain the miners and businesses ultimately support will likely end up being successful, though it’s hard to predict people’s actions and their ramifications.Still, Rao believes that forks can actually be perceived as a good thing, because when a winner emerges from such a fork, the marketplace will assume the controversy is ended and will boost the price of the victor.If Bitcoin’s scaling crisis is finally resolved this November, through the victory of either chain or by means of a last minute fizzling of the hard fork threat, the market will likely continue to act favorably.Read more: How to Buy Bitcoin: Best Practices, Where to Buy, Tips"

One of the fake exchanges was BitKRX, named after Korea Exchange (KRX), the largest financial trading platform in South Korea established by KOSDAQ, South Korea Futures Exchange and South Korea Stock Exchange.The BitKRX exchange marketed itself as a branch of KRX, coaxing users into its platform by promoting its businesses as a regulated and legitimate venture led created by KRX.Chosun, one of South Korea’s largest mainstream media outlets, reported that local financial authorities and law enforcement have begun to crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges with deceptive marketing and fraudulent operations. Specifically, local financial authorities disclosed that several cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea are unregulated but are operating as legitimate businesses by utilizing the branding of leading financial institutions, like BitKRX.One member of the South Korean Bitcoin community told Chosun:“A small group of individuals that are not qualified and experienced enough to run high-traffic and large-scale platforms are running cryptocurrency exchanges in the local market. Consequently, traders are not able to properly execute buy and sell orders in a timely manner, causing major losses and difficulties for investors. Strict regulation of the market by the South Korean market will further stabilize the local cryptocurrency market.”Earlier this week, South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb, which is also the second largest trading platform in the global cryptocurrency market, stated that a right set of regulations for businesses and investors would nurture the cryptocurrency market and facilitate its exponential growth. Bithumb said:”A right set of regulations will rather nurture the (virtual currency) market, and we would welcome that.”For cryptocurrency exchanges like Bithumb, Korbit and Coinone, that process billions of dollars in trades on a daily basis, regulations are necessary because a rather large portion of investors in the South Korean cryptocurrency market are falling victim to Ponzi schemes and scams.This month, a $200 mln cryptocurrency-inspired Ponzi scheme was unraveled by the local law enforcement. 14 individuals of MiningMax, a cloud mining Ponzi scheme, were arrested by South Korean police with several charges, including economic crime and fraud.According to cryptocurrency market data provider CryptoCompare, the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange market only accounts for 4.6 percent of the global cryptocurrency exchange market, behind the US, Japan and Europe.A $200 mln Ponzi scheme in a relatively small market can be avoided if investors directly trade cryptocurrencies on regulated platforms and exchanges."

Payments made by users await in the mempool until miners arrive to confirm the transactions. The size of the Bitcoin mempool, which remains at around 79 mln bytes at the time of reporting, represents the aggregate size of transactions waiting to be confirmed.If the size of the Bitcoin mempool is high, transaction fees recommended by wallet platforms such as Blockchain, Coinbase and Trezor surge and failing to attach high fees could result in a transaction being delayed for many days, if the Bitcoin mempool does not clear.On Dec. 7, the size of the Bitcoin mempool reached 120 mln bytes, spiking by more than two-fold within a 24-hour span. As a consequence, transaction fees of Bitcoin recommended by wallets surged up to $30, depending on the size of the transaction and the number of inputs or outputs.Bitcoin Fees, a Bitcoin fee predicting application on Earn.com, previously known as 21 Inc, currently recommends a fee of 450 satoshis per byte for median-size transactions, resulting in a fee of 101,700 satoshis. In US dollars, the recommended fee of Bitcoin Fees for median-size transactions is $16.Nic Carter, an experienced Bitcoin analyst and researcher, stated that the abrupt surge in the size of the Bitcoin mempool is suspicious, given that many one satoshi per byte transactions clogged up the mempool and the Bitcoin Blockchain network.Carter suggested that a spam attack of low-fee transactions is preventing the Bitcoin Blockchain network from clearing transactions and processing payments.Suspicious behavior in the Bitcoin mempool again. Be on your guard this weekendhttps://t.co/8MIPUW0Cxw pic.twitter.com/npMXjHP4MaBut, others also claimed that it is possible the recent performance of Bitcoin price has led to a genuine increase in the Bitcoin network’s daily transaction volume, and that the size of the mempool has expanded drastically because of the rapid growth rate of Bitcoin.For small to medium-size transactions, the current Bitcoin transaction fees could be too high, especially for merchants. As such, Steam, one of the most popular game marketplaces, temporarily stopped accepting Bitcoin as a payment method due to increasing complaints from its users with Bitcoin’s high transaction fees.For large-scale transactions worth at least a thousand dollars to millions of dollars, a transaction fee of over $10 is not relatively high compared to the global banking system. As Ari Paul, the co-founder of BlockTower explained in an interview with Business Insider, if Bitcoin’s current use case is a robust store of value and it is trying to compete against gold and the international offshore banking industry, high transaction fees could still be dealt with, considering the complexity and efficiency of banking services.Still, for Bitcoin merchants, specifically the tens of thousands of Bitcoin-accepting merchants in Japan, the current Bitcoin transaction fees could be difficult to handle."

The comment came during a segment aired on CNBC.","Cramer is no fan of Bitcoin, in spite of, at one point, mentioning that the price could go to $1 mln. He believes the current run up is a bubble that has been driven to new highs by traders in order to short the value once the futures market opens. According to the famous investor:""I think the short selling is just going to annihilate people when you can start trading it. Once this thing starts trading the futures, they are just going to kibosh it.You’re going to see a lot of shenanigans.”While Cramer has expressed the concerns of many on Wall Street, others, including industry insiders, disagree. The general feeling among Bitcoin-aware investors regarding the run up is that, while there are potential dangers in every market, the market will continue to maintain stability, even as the futures market begins to take hold.For example, Barry Hayut, chairman and CEO of Hayver Corporation says:""Unlike Monopoly money, there are many real services and products that can be purchased with Bitcoin today. Money is a store of value. Every day there are tens of thousands of people around the world that see this value in Bitcoin and exchange it with volumes recently exceeding 15 bln dollars a day. That is more than Apple, Google and Microsoft average daily trading a day combined.”    Additionally, while the comparisons with other bubbles (the tulip bubble of Dutch fame, or the land bubble in the mid 19th century) the underlying Blockchain technology provides a basis for value in the Bitcoin ecosystem that is maintained by the consensus of the majority.Instead, the utility of the system, along with the disconnectedness of Bitcoin produces the fear among bankers and traditional investors. Itay Shechter, Founder of Vanywhere said:“The value of Bitcoin is derived from social contracts and the millions of users involved. The Blockchain revolution takes the power and control back to the community. Banks and regulators are not used to something that is completely out of their hands, so they attack. The volatility of Bitcoin reflects the ‘hype,’ FOMO and other factors in society. Bitcoin might have gone up too fast too soon recently, but Jim completely ignores the utility and technology behind it.”"

Many people who live in those types of countries want to be paid in Bitcoin.”The comments further reflect the divide that is fast forming in Wall Street, with those who are very positive about the coin’s future, and those who consider it a fraud or a tool for money laundering.However, the reality that adoption continues to grow has made it impossible to ignore the cryptocurrency. Nevertheless, according to many industry insiders much still needs to be done as adoption growth continues. According to Ami Ben David, Co-Founder of SPiCE VC:“Bitcoin is now rewriting the definition books. Historically people thought of a store of value as “an asset you can predictably hold or trade”, but Bitcoin is a DIGITAL store of value, and as such, it adds the exponential Network Effect - Bitcoin is the Facebook of money, used by millions today, but over the next 10 years, it’s real challenge will be to adapt and improve as it reaches billions of users.”These challenges will continue as the cryptocurrency market continues to mature. However, the reality of the need for utility to create stores of value continues to plague the minds of some experts. Eyal Hertzog Co-Founder of Bancor:""Store of value"" is one of the ways a currency can be used. For anything to be used as SoV it has to be valuable otherwise. Money can be used as SoV since it’s useful for commerce. Gold can be used as SoV due to the market demand for that specific rare substance. For a digital currency to be useful as SoV it probably has to be useful for other purposes.”"

In this case, the government of Vanuatu has explicitly expressed a desire to be at the forefront of adopting new technologies, officially encouraging the VIC to receive payments in Bitcoin.”Under the citizenship program, foreigners who want to become Vanuatuan citizens should pay Bitcoins through an Australian digital currency exchange. The exchange should comply with the requirements mandated by financial regulations in Australia.As Vanuatu is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, its citizens are allowed to travel in 113 countries, including European Union (EU) states, Russia, and Great Britain, without a visa. This privilege will also be given to foreigners who have acquired Vanuatuan citizenship.According to investment migration expert and VIC advisor Christian Nesheim, Vanuatu’s move to accept Bitcoin as payment will give it a competitive advantage in the global citizenship market.“Many early investors in Bitcoin would like to realize some of their earnings without incurring large capital gains taxes. Ideally, then, they would convert their cryptocurrency into tangible assets in a low-tax jurisdiction… As Vanuatu will now be the only country to offer citizenship for Bitcoins, I think the program will see a surge in interest more or less immediately.”We’ve seen investments where investors could pay for their real estate in the form of Bitcoin, but this is by far the first country to offer its citizenship investment payable through Bitcoin."

We, therefore, have no current plans to include them in our investment strategy.”Ironically, the analyst noted the potential applications of Blockchain technology as something the bank is paying close attention.Staying clear of a Blockchain-based cryptocurrency, Coutts could potentially invest in other industries that find innovative ways to apply Blockchain technology, according to Chovin:“In our view, the development of Blockchain technology, which sits behind so-called ‘cryptocurrencies’ like Bitcoin, is a far more interesting area to watch.”“This new technology has the potential to disrupt any field where there’s the need for secure, transferable records.”While most banks have kept their distance from cryptocurrencies, there is no doubt that they will be watching the launch of Bitcoin futures by CBOE and CME in the next two weeks.The trade exchanges will blaze the trail ahead of less-ambitious institutional investors - and their success and failure will be scrutinized by the rest of the financial world."

He said that his situation, choosing digital currency is not a matter of politics but of survival. Bitcoin transactions are relatively swift for anyone with a smartphone: Websites like LocalBitcoin and Colibit function as exchanges where Venezuelans can buy and sell bitcoins using a local bank account.Cryptocurrencies have become so fashionable that even President Nicolas Maduro has proposed a government-backed version called the Petro.

Instead, he purchased them abroad with Bitcoin and used courier services to deliver them to Venezuela.Authorities have largely permitted trading of Bitcoin in Venezuela, though they have heavily fined and detained people who attempt to mine the digital currency. For Villar, the stakes are especially high, and not just for his business. An engineer who once ran a biometrics enterprise, he is staking his financial future on the development of a game involving an alternative cryptocurrency called PepeCash.A dozen employees operate from a small office filled with computers in an industrial community east of the capital.

Analysts including BitFury Vice Chairman George Kikvadze attributed the surge in the trading volume of the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market to the exit of Bitcoin traders in China.,"Earlier this week, the Chinese government, local authorities and financial regulators officially requested Chinese Bitcoin exchanges and trading platforms to halt their services by the end of September. OKCoin and Huobi, the two largest exchanges in China, were granted leeway to operate until Oct. 30, considering the fact that they have not been involved in any initial coin offerings (ICOs) in the past.But, it seems as if traders are not willing to take any chances with the Chinese government and their unpredictable nature. The Chinese Bitcoin exchange market’s daily trading volume has halved within a period of three days, from 15 percent to less than seven percent.According to various trusted Bitcoin market data providers such as CryptoCompare, China only accounts for 6.4 percent of global Bitcoin trades at the time of reporting.CryptoCompare shows that Japan accounts for over 50% of all #bitcoin trades.

The abrupt migration of traders led to the short-term surge in the trading volume of Japan, allowing the market to overtake the US by over 20 percent in global Bitcoin exchange market share.Contrary to many negative reports, prominent developers, analysts, researchers and experts within the cryptocurrency and Blockchain sectors including Litecoin creator Charlie Lee and billionaire investor Tim Draper expressed their optimism toward the shutdown of the Chinese Bitcoin exchange market.

China can no longer play with the markets by banning Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency cannot be killed by any country. One solution to centralized exchanges is decentralized ones. I hear the Decred Project team has something cooking that helps with that.”As Lee emphasized, the exit of the Chinese Bitcoin exchange market should really only have affected around 10 to 15 percent of traders in the global Bitcoin exchange market. Yet, speculators and impatient traders initiated a major sell-off as the Chinese government banned exchanges, leading to a major correction on Bitcoin price.Over the next few weeks, the global Bitcoin exchange market will stabilize, as traders move from the Chinese market to South Korea and Japan, two markets that have developed significantly more efficient regulations, industry standards and policies for both cryptocurrency exchanges and users.It is likely that as Lee and Draper noted, the closure of the Chinese Bitcoin exchange market could lead to the stabilization of the global Bitcoin exchange market, which may be beneficial for Bitcoin in the long run."

is still in its genesis. 47956 Total views. 2046 ...","Nov 28, 2017","With all the news of adoption and mass appeal, people need to remember that despite Bitcoin price breaking $10,000, less than one percent of the world’s population actively uses it. There is a lot of noise around the digital currency, but it is still a small fish in the global economy.","Many have likened Bitcoin to the dotcom bubble, waiting to burst as people throw money at it like the companies back in the emergence of the Internet. But Bitcoin is not a company, it is a technology, and it sits on the precipice like email did in 1994.Back in 1994 email was globally adopted by around 0.25 percent of the population. However, it was invented in 1972 by Arpanet engineer Ray Tomlinson. It was, for a very long time, the only ‘killer application’ for the Internet.It all sounds quite familiar. Bitcoin, invented in 2008, was mostly a toy for tech geeks and anarchists who saw a revolution in money as the global economy collapsed. But it was just a hobby, nothing else.Then, as it gained momentum, it became the only ‘killer app’ for the Blockchain, and dominated that space for some while by itself.In order for email to move from being more than just a toy for techno geeks into the space of mainstream commercial and retail use, it needed to tick three boxes.The technology itself had to develop so far that it was standard and stable and of course useful to users. It had to be made approachable and the User Interface had to shift to be accessible to the every-man. And, finally, the user base needed to grow as that in itself gave email its value in a virtuous cycle.The early similarities between email and Bitcoin are there. But it is when you start to plot its adoption graph that you note more similarities. 2013 had signs of adoption as Coinbase did a lot to open the market up with easy access and a good interface for any user to understand and use Bitcoin.But, there was still a lot of technological issues that needed to be solved. Problems like an unintentional hard fork, few user-friendly interfaces, and a minimal network effects, all dogged Bitcoin’s growth and adoption.That has changed now, in 2017, as even the so-called ‘civil war’ is over and the protocol has proved steady in the face of most technological gremlins.User interface and ease of use is so through the roof that elderly mothers and grandmothers can use wallets and access their Bitcoin, and even more so with the announcement of ETFs, Futures, and even ATMs.And finally, Bitcoin, of course, provides value, it is literally a store of value, but it is also a disruptive technology that is challenging the hegemony of the banking system and freeing many people from their chains of debt.Bitcoin entrepreneur Erik Voorhees said, back in 2014: “We still have a very long way to go in absolute terms,"" in response to the idea that Bitcoin was already breaking into the mainstream back then. It was worth $340 to $530 in April of that year.Voorhees added: “Both the Internet and PayPal had a long period where people heard of it and sort of knew what it was before they really tried it out.""Previous Bitcoin Foundation Executive Director Patrick Murck said back in 2014 as well:""Blockchain-based products are starting to emerge that solve real problems for people, that will drive adoption and grow the pie for the whole Bitcoin community.""Really, there has been a jump from 2014 to 2017, and relatively it is large. But in terms of globally, it is not even noticeable."

Last week, the price of the cryptocurrency reacted favorably to the launch of Bitcoin futures on the CBOE. Exactly one week later, CME launched trading of Bitcoin futures contracts on their platform, which was met with a drop in Bitcoin’s price.Then on Wednesday, America’s biggest Bitcoin exchange, Coinbase, announced the surprise launch of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) support on its platform and exchange, GDAX. BCH price soared, while Bitcoin shuddered somewhat.Speaking to RT this week, renowned analyst Peter Schiff, credited for predicting the 2008 housing market collapse, issued a foreboding warning to investors buying Bitcoin at current prices.Even with a shaky week, Bitcoin is hovering around the $16,000 mark, after a two-month bull run that saw the price rise by more than 200 percent.Schiff says those trying to ride the bubble are too late:“People who got it years ago, even people who got it at the beginning of the year have the opportunity to cash out and make a lot of money. But people who are buying it at these prices or higher prices are going to lose practically everything.”The old adage, “buy on the rumor and sell on the news,” seems to be the perfect way to sum up Schiff’s sentiments on the current attitude of green investors trying to make a quick buck out of Bitcoin:“These currencies are going to trade to zero or pretty close to it when the bubble pops. Right now, the only reason why people are buying Bitcoin is because the price is going up. When it turns around, they are not going to sell it for the same reason.""He also voiced by now common criticism of Bitcoin Core’s transaction functionality, noting the low speed and high cost of transactions on the network:“There is no value in Bitcoin, you can’t use it as money. It’s too slow, too expensive and too vulnerable.”"

It is now up to the next billion people to start to use Bitcoin Cash. In at most six months I'm sure we'll just drop the ‘Cash’ and call it ‘Bitcoin,’” he stated.BCH shot up in price over 35 percent in anticipation of a new hard fork set for Nov. 13, reaching its highest value almost since it debuted.In the aftermath of SegWit2x’s apparent failure, funds appear to be flowing into the rival Bitcoin fork as investors hedge bets over a duplicate chain appearing.“The fact that the Legacy chain is stuck at 1 MB, and likely always will be, confirms the Cash chain's viability. Now the market will decide,” Zander added.Until news of the hard fork, BCH had largely held a sideline position beyond significant publicity efforts led by Bitcoin.com’s Roger Ver.Now, further public support is coming from cryptocurrency figures including Rick Falkvinge, founder of the Finnish Pirate Party and regulator commentator.With recent developments, I'm putting all available dev resources to retool my software for #Bitcoin Cash.

With the price over $11,000, there is a lot of money to be made. Like any factory, mining rigs use electricity. A lot of electricity.According to UK based company Power Compare, the surge in Bitcoin price has directly influenced the demand on power supply.Citing Digiconomist, the combination of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash’s estimated annual electricity consumption has climbed to 31 terawatt-hours. They also estimate that Bitcoin mining generates $9.7 bln a year.They have developed their own Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index, which has provided the most recent data driving these insights.Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash mining is using a total of 0.13 percent of the global energy consumption - which ranks the combined mining operation as the 61st highest power consumer in the World.Interestingly, but not surprisingly, the power consumption of Bitcoin mining in November increased by nearly 30 percent - no doubt linked to the massive bull run.If the demand for electricity caused by mining continues keeps at its current rate - mining will consume all of the world’s electricity supply by 2020.As it stands, Bitcoin mining uses more power than most African countries - as shown in Power Compare’s illustration below.Secret symbol № 24: q What is this?"

containing 7,500 Bitcoins. That lost drive would be worth over $80 ...","Nov 30, 2017","During the summer of 2013, while cleaning out his desk, a Welsh man named James Howells threw away a hard drive from his broken Dell Laptop.","Unfortunately, he realized several months later that the drive held 7,500 Bitcoin mined back in 2009. At the time, with Bitcoin approaching and finally just exceeding $1,000 in price, the scrapped hard drive would have been worth over $7 mln.The story created a lot of hype about the rising the value of Bitcoin and the fortunes - or misfortunes - of the currency’s first miners and investors. Many of them had dabbled with the currency while it was in its infancy, only to forget about it and fail to backup their wallets.Howells, who essentially dumped $7.5 mln (£4 mln) onto a landfill in Newport, Wales was of course furious, disappointed and dumbstruck. Over the next few years, he may have come to terms with his loss, only to have old wounds reopened as the currency began its long climb this year. At press time, Bitcoin’s price stands at $10,700, giving that trashed hard drive a value of over $80 mln.Howell had mined those 7,500 coins himself as a hobby back when Bitcoin was a mere plaything for the technologically inclined. Howells related:""You know when you put something in the bin, and in your head, say to yourself 'that's a bad idea'? I really did have that.”Howells explains how he stopped mining when his girlfriend complained about the noise from the laptop and the heat it was producing. When he spilled lemonade on the laptop the following year, he dismantled it for parts. He initially kept the hard drive for a few years before finally discarding it.Back in 2013, Howells said:""I'm at the point where it's either laugh about it or cry about it. Why aren't I out there with a shovel now? I think I'm just resigned to never being able to find it.""Once can only imagine how the unfortunate Howells feels today.“Don’t tell my Wife”Howells isn’t the only person to experience the pain of such financial loss. An Australian man, who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of the wrath of his wife, has also come forward with a tale of thousands of missing Bitcoin.Alex, as he wants to be called, describes how in 2009 he mined “thousands, plural” of Bitcoin as part of a novel new idea. Then when the program for mining got a little too big and cumbersome, he gave up, deleted the program, and stashed his Bitcoin on a cheap USB. He said:“The thinking was that it’s offline, not on my PC, so in case something bad happened to the PC — [if] it blew up, or [was] hacked — I still had a backup.”Around the end of 2013, when the Bitcoin price peaked at just over $1,000, he suddenly remembered his wallet:“[I plugged] the USB stick back in to try and access the file, but the stick died. It was one of those cheap made-in-China ones.”Just like Howells, Alex has had to watch the Bitcoin price balloon, counting the tens of millions of dollars he lost everytime a new milestone is reached.“Worst mistake of my life. Never back up anything on a cheap Chinese-made disk or USB stick.”Other stories of lost Bitcoins abound, including that of a Gizmodo editor who threw away a hard drive containing 1,400 Bitcoins in 2012. He paid $25 for the coins, at an average price of only 1.5 cents each. They would now be worth almost $15 mln.These cases and others inspired a new study that has estimated that as many as four million Bitcoin are gone forever. The study puts the majority of the lost coins in the category of ‘out of circulation’ as of course, those coins still exist on the Blockchain, they just cannot be accessed.One difficulty in estimating the number of “lost” Bitcoin is uncertainty over whether Satoshi is still alive and still has access to his private keys. The study’s numbers assume that Satoshi’s approximately one million Bitcoins are lost, but of course, nobody can be certain of that.One of the first rules for Bitcoin newbies is to keep your coins off exchanges where they are vulnerable to online threats. However, there are a number of offline threats that can also occur.These two case studies show just how easy it is to lose a digital asset that is not stored online; from a broken hard drive to a corrupt USB, even misplacing the thing becomes a problem.Matthew Unger, founder and CEO of iComply Investor Services Inc. suggested:""Just like you keep some cash in your wallet, some in your bank account and perhaps the really valuable stuff in a safe, you need to manage digital currencies in the same way."""

envisage that Bitcoin will be as huge and valuable as it is today. 
That's ...","Nov 21, 2017","You could be forgiven for thinking Bitcoin Cash was dead; the currency had slumped to about $600 before a sudden revival last week caused the price to soar to $2,600 while simultaneously knocking Bitcoin down a few notches.","As a brief recap, Bitcoin recorded a new all-time high of about $7,800 on Wednesday, November 8 followed by a downward trend, which saw Bitcoin fall by nearly 30 percent to under $5,630 by Sunday, November 12. The root of this was that the Bitcoin community couldn’t reach a consensus to proceed with the proposed SegWit2x hard fork. However, it didn’t take long for Bitcoin to return to its previous values and seek new highs.The discussions of a hard fork finds its root in the one megabyte block size limit that the original developer of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, set to make the digital currency more secure. Given the limit of only 21 million Bitcoins, Satoshi most likely didn’t envisage that Bitcoin will be as huge and valuable as it is today. That’s certainly understandable since nothing like it had ever existed.However, now that the digital currency has become more popular than Satoshi probably envisaged, the currency is dealing with the modesty of its original design. Bitcoin’s lack of capacity has led to the growing amount of time it takes to process Bitcoin transactions. Those who would like to have their transactions confirmed in a timely manner have to pay relatively more transaction fee as an incentive for transaction validators (miners) to prioritize their transactions.According to a website that tracks Bitcoin fees, the current “fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 770 satoshis/byte.” For reference, a comment on BitcoinTalk pointed out that the recommended fee (same as the fastest and cheapest fee) as of January 2017 was 120 satoshis. That’s over 500 percent increase in the recommended transaction fee since the beginning of the year.This is contrary to the promise of speed and affordability that has been publicized as one of the advantages that Bitcoin offers over the traditional ways of conducting financial transactions.The aim of the shelved SegWit2x hard fork was to solve these challenges by increasing the amount of transaction data that each block can handle to two megabytes. Once this fork was cancelled, some investors grew weary and pulled out of Bitcoin and moved into Bitcoin Cash, a digital currency that resulted from a Bitcoin hard fork in August.Bitcoin Cash recorded an all-time high of over $2,500 when Bitcoin was falling on November 12. Considering that the scaling limitations inherent in the Bitcoin system still lie unfixed, coupled with the social buzz around Bitcoin Cash, investors are likely to be worried about what the future holds for Bitcoin. Here are some thoughts from industry experts.According to DNX Community CEO Conradie Graeme, the failure to push the SegWit2x hard fork through is a setback for Bitcoin.“Everyone is focused on scalability issues, but I believe there’s a bigger vulnerability issue about Bitcoin Think about it, as it stands, if you can afford to pay more in transaction fee, you can have your transactions confirmed quickly and there is no limit to the amount of Bitcoin you can buy or sell. And in reality, it’s only the big money investors/traders who can afford to pay more in transaction fees. So in theory, big money can pump and dump Bitcoin using the unfair advantage of being able to get their transactions confirmed quickly by paying more. They can dump before anyone else to take profits. This could mean that Bitcoin will remain highly volatile and high volatility could hinder it from ever becoming huge in the digital payment space.”Maksim Balashevich, CEO and Founder of Santiment, believes that Bitcoin will drop in value.There is always time to accumulate and then also time to reduce the risks. #bitcoin is risky now more than rewardy #cryptocurrency pic.twitter.com/FC2PnhX3bZSantiment believes Bitcoin’s value will drop, being redistributed among other ‘cash payments protocols’ such as Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Dash, Monero and Ripple. He adds:“The Bitcoin Core [developers] (and Blockstream) should feel the real pressure and pain for what they’ve been denying for too long time. Once this pain is obvious and on all discussion boards, we might find the way for relief.”Eric Jackson, CEO and Co-Founder, CapLinked, on the other hand, believes that Bitcoin’s widespread institutional support and adoption means that it will likely be here to stay, adding that its recent price rebound confirms that. That doesn’t mean Bitcoin Cash has no chance. Here are his words:“I also believe that it is possible for Bitcoin Cash to coexist with Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s appreciation over the past half-decade has turned it into a store of value more comparable to gold than a currency. The very notion that Wall Street is developing derivatives of Bitcoin also suggests that it is on its way to becoming the world’s first digital commodity. Bitcoin has smaller block sizes and higher transaction fees compared to [Bitcoin Cash], making [Bitcoin Cash] mechanically better suited as a payment option than Bitcoin. Thus, assuming the rise of [Bitcoin Cash] is in part due to the need for a more flexible digital payment mechanism, I think there is room in the world for both.”Clem Chambers, CEO of global stocks and shares website ADVFN also shares the view that several digital currencies can coexist:“There is room in the market for both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, and for that matter many other coins including eccentric issues like Bitcoin Gold. In classic coinage, there are many denominations for the very same reason that there will be many different cryptocoin denominations. There are also many different currencies on top of denominations and for that matter an infinite set of designs. Cryptocurrency will follow a similar path.”At press time, Bitcoin is trading at an all time high of just under $8300.#CT_questions #Bitcoin vs. #BitcoinCash: Can Both Survive?"

This, however, does not take anything away from the plenty technological inputs going on in the background with Bitcoin, Blockchain and the entire crypto ecosystem.","For instance, due to the amount of its user base, miner base and network size, Bitcoin is a very secure yet isn't very adaptable to market's needs. This is where smaller scale cryptocurrency such as PIVX, Litecoin and Dash come in where they are able to innovate and improve its underlying technology utilizing the different block consensus and governance system. This allows adding of new Blockchain technology without guesswork if its users will support the change.Simply put, such developments allow people to experience new technology earlier while the developers are able to gain new knowledge and data sooner rather than later thus helping the overall growth and development of Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrencies.The meteoric rise of Bitcoin's fiat value is doing what it took geeks more than 20 years to accomplish: convince regular people that there was something worth looking at in this new experiment of creating, storing and safely transact digital value.Recently, we have even heard about people taking out mortgages to invest in cryptocurrency.  A lot of the new market participants only need a few pieces of information to engage -In fact, with little knowledge about the underlying technology, exchanges like Coinbase make it easy to get started with their simple and friendly user interface, a limited number of coins supported and the ability to integrate payments for your crypto with familiar western banking tools (i.e. checking accounts and credit cards).""2017 will be known as the year of the Bitcoin forks.”Jason Cassidy, president of Blockchain TVThere are dozens of these forks, which bring varying degrees of change and value to the space. If a fork (which is for all intents and purposes a copy) brings little value to the ecosystem, it is often generally disregarded. However, not all forks are created equal.A very small percentage of these forks come into existence due to real needs in the industry, regardless of whether the entire community shares that view. These forks often give a 1:1 matching to the Bitcoin you hold at the time of the event. If timed correctly, one can make a decent amount of wealth from simply holding a Bitcoin. Understanding what each fork brings and if there is any long-term, inherent value is a question that requires due diligence on behalf of the investor.On the other hand, the CEO of Netcoins, Michael Vogel believes that most forks end up serving as a gateway into Bitcoin for investors and a fantastic way for new ideas and features to be tested and later implemented in the ""mainstream"" Bitcoin.“The irony is that many forks and altcoins have no real substance from a function perspective. And although a lot of alts have had meteoric price increases (even greater than Bitcoin on a percentage basis this year), investors ultimately realize that Bitcoin already has the infrastructure and user base that other coins don't yet have,” says Vogel.Therefore, the dominant pattern sees users entering into the ecosystem by converting their fiat currencies first into Bitcoin in most cases via the exchanges. This enables them to purchase the tokens that are usually on sale during the ICOs of these forks, and most often after the ICOs they head right back to Bitcoin whose value has been sustained over time.Blockchain Evangelist, Melvin Petties explains that limited intelligence of the underlying protocol fundamentals, dynamics and nuance make cryptocurrency speculation for everyday folks a more risky endeavor than they may be aware of.    “I doubt if the ""new money"" in the game can talk at length about inherent risks or present/potential uses cases of these new asset management systems as a supporting argument  for the positions they have taken.”Human beings are wired to try to make sense of new phenomena by processing all the information of the past.  Sometimes that can bite in the rear as may assume similarities where there are none.  As such, it helps to assimilate any new or additional information in the context to help make more sense of it in comparison to other experiences.For example, imagine your buddy invites you to ""catch some waves"" and to your surprise, after two hours on the road you finally pull up to an indoor resort water park where they have one of those cool new ""wave pools;"" the waves are generated mechanically and are meant to impress, but not utterly frighten well-meaning vacationers. This is not the same as a trip to the beach right. The same can be said of traditional investment vehicles vs. cryptocurrencies and assets.  Some key interactions with each are very familiar; however, the context of operating within a purely virtual universe where the data is publicly distributed and infrastructure is community owned is very important to how you choose to engage.Anyone might want to know some of the machinations and nuances that make HODLing and transacting in this new medium different from the traditional experience that they are used to.  Let’s identify some of the ideas that could raise some eyebrows:The point of these considerations is not to scare people away from using or investing in cryptocurrency, but to better illuminate the context of this new environment and how it differs from our closed network design today. Hopefully, this perspective encourages investors to weigh the pros and cons of each coin they buy and judge the overall utility and value by present and future context.One of the important inventions that we take for granted as society is the rule-of-law - a common and agreed understanding/ social construct for the proper/expected behaviors and consequences for various interactions between humans and the things they make. To be perfectly clear, we are just scratching the surface on how to do this in a coherent, dynamic, and flexible way as it relates to globally operated asset management systems.  Rules for a Flat World dives into some of the challenges and opportunities we face in getting there, but take a look at some of the cool rules we have created regarding data privacy and the stewardship of information managed by private institutions today:None of these constructs have a way of being expressed just yet, but folks are working on the problem and some really fun and interesting business models will be built to fill the gap. Cryptocurrencies are here to stay and we need a new governance mechanism to help us cope with the inevitable mistakes and hacks that will occur.Most cryptocurrency platforms and projects could fall into one of two buckets: currency and non-currency. Of course some protocols like Ethereum straddle the fence, but in general this rule is pretty sound.Humans are always doing work on something, whether that's serving each other or entertaining ourselves. At the end of the day, lots of developers and entrepreneurs decided to go the ""non-currency"" direction as they explore Blockchain technology for other purposes. On the currency side, you have projects that form out of dissent with existing implementations (known commonly as forks) or projects that are built from the ground up to address shortcomings they discovered in predecessors.Bitcoin is and will continue to be the leading cryptocurrency but alternative cryptocurrencies through continuous innovation fuel the growth of the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole. For example, the PIVX combined proof of stake with the zerocoin protocol provides a case study for Bitcoins development and also opens up other avenues of entry for users who may want more privacy. Other innovations that have been forked off the Bitcoin protocol with the specific offerings to the ecosystem include Litecoin, Dash, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Classic, among others.Bitcoin vs. Ethereum is a classic study of currency vs. non-currency.  Just look at how they each describe themselves:Again, the point is to highlight how better information and the idea of context can go a long way to shape decisions about investing. Everyone who endeavors to create and support a cryptocurrency or Blockchain project is effectively raising the collective consciousness of the community.  Therefore, users and investors are expected to give great feedback through their actions by evaluating them more on their merits."

However, under the surface, Bitcoin’s alarm bells were close to sounding as the hash rate fell to around 50 percent.","Bitcoin showed signs of its potential for triggering this dynamic over the weekend.This metric if performance measurements for a coin like Bitcoin is vital, especially when the reason for its drop was a direct competitor taking the limelight. Bitcoin Cash rocketed up its own value, reaching as high as $2,500, but it also sapped a lot of the hash power of Bitcoin.The danger of losing a large amount of hashing power for Bitcoin is that it could trigger a chain death spiral. Many feel that as a market, there is nothing that can stop Bitcoin, but that is a surface-view under the hood, things are a little more fragile.As terrifying as the name sounds, what exactly is a ‘chain death spiral?’The Bitcoin network currently adds a new bundle of transactions, known as a “block,” roughly every 10 minutes. The exact time is determined by how long it takes for a miner to process a block of transactions. This, in turn, is set by something called the “difficulty” on the network.Difficulty automatically adjusts itself to match the hash rate so that transactions won’t take too long. But the difficulty only adjusts every two weeks at the moment, so, if the hash rate suddenly plummets the difficulty could be rendered too high for the amount of processing power on the network. This in turn could mean severe delays in completing Bitcoin transactions.This was felt and mentioned by many over the weekend and it left Bitcoin on the cusp of a catastrophic failure. The spiral starts once the delays are unbearable and investors decide to dump the coin. This leads to a price drop which ultimately makes it unprofitable for miners who then move to other coins.“Transactions get backlogged to a point where the coin becomes basically useless,” says Peter Kim, who co-founded a developer tool called Nitrous.Those who had their eyes too closely glued to Bitcoin price, worrying about every little dollar it dropped, would not have seen the bigger picture. It sounds far-fetched, but the signs that a storm was brewing were there.The transactions slowed on the Bitcoin network over the weekend, and to boot, Bitcoin Cash was also rocketing making it more profitable for miners who switched their operations to the forked coin. Bitcoin’s hash rate thusly fell as much as 50 percent.That drop meant that transaction times doubled at the very least. Analyst Jimmy Song explains just how much more enticing Bitcoin Cash suddenly became for miners.“Bitcoin cash was up to 100 percent more profitable to mine because of the price run-up. When it’s more profitable to mine Bitcoin Cash, miners will go there. When it’s more profitable to mine Bitcoin, like right now, miners will go there,” Song says.This hash rate flip was only brief however and just like the pump and dump of Bitcoin Cash, the hash rate has fallen and returned for Bitcoin.

the reality is a lot more complicated. 16703 Total views. 465 Total shares.","Nov 21, 2017","Regulators have been struggling to come to a consensus, keep in touch and set a working relationship with Cryptocurrencies since they became big enough to worry about. The idea is simple, but implementation is much more difficult due to the quasi-anonymous nature of digital currency.","Regulators worldwide have not yet decided on a consistent approach. Some go the direct route, like China, and try and implement bans which are not as effective as they would hope. Others, like Switzerland, embrace the digital coins, hoping to attract more Blockchain builders.Thus there is a large gray area at the moment, with regulators floundering in the middle.Regulating cryptocurrencies should be quite simple, in theory. After all, unlike fiat money which can be transferred without any records, cryptocurrencies leave a digital footprint. That footprint is not as simple to follow as a bank transfer, for example, but it is not impossible.Professor Andrei Kirilenko, director of the Centre of Global Finance and Technology at the Imperial College of London, believes that by their very nature, cryptocurrencies have a reporting system built in, but individuals sometimes obscure their identity in various ways.He believes that if digital currency transactions were regulated in such a way as to compel transparency, cryptocurrency would be no harder to regulate and tract than bank transfers. Of course, it’s unlikely that users would just accept such regulation without protest.Kirilenko adds that the 2008 financial crisis created a perfect environment for the rise of digital currencies. Rapid technological development, in conjunction with a mass talent exodus, the failure of previous systems and the affordability of computing, meant fintech was given the space to flourish.But that flourishing has been so rapid that regulators can’t keep up with the evolving cryptocurrency space. However, there will come a time when regulators keep up, believes Dr Co-Pierre Georg, senior lecturer at AIFMRM and Director of the UCT Financial Innovation Lab.“This means it is only a matter of time before they are so widely used that their regulation will be non-negotiable.”This battle to keep up currently is coupled with the fact that Cryptocurrencies are unprecedented, creating far-reaching complications.There exists a desire in many parts of the world, and by many citizens of the global cryptocurrency ecosystem, to see some form of regulation as it would add legitimacy. However the drive for regulation has been de-prioritised in many areas because the resources required for regulation require justification to taxpayers and there are frequently more pressing problems. As such, cryptocurrencies are often dealt with on a case-by-case basis.There is no leading law, or jurisdiction, or precedent out there that states how to deal with cryptocurrencies; instead, regulators must resort to experimentation. Kirilenko says:“There are multiple aspects to the regulation of cryptocurrencies. Suppose I’m a regulator. What do I regulate? There are different ways to touch that elephant, There are different pieces of regulation. If you are going after one, some or all of them, you have to know what would be your main mandate — whether it is a monetary policy mandate, for instance.”Regulation may seem like a dirty word in the decentralized Bitcoin community, but smart regulation will increase adoption. The fact that only 802 people paid tax on Bitcoin in the US in 2015 has galvanized the IRS, who is now using a company called Chainalysis to try and catch tax cheats. Regulation is inevitable, if for no other reason than tax agencies wanting their cut. Proper regulation and taxation will bring Bitcoin in line with existing monetary systems and spur investment by mainstream finance players."

you some clues on when to enter the market. 64631 Total views. 787 ...","Oct 28, 2017","Prior to the Bitcoin Gold fork two days ago, the market made some interesting moves.","Bitcoin price reached a new all time high on Oct. 20, 2017 - five days before the Bitcoin Gold fork -surpassing $6,000 for the first time and eventually climbing to nearly $6,200.Those of you who have endured past chain splits are aware of what usually happens when there’s a split from the Bitcoin network. Ordinarily, the community complains, reddit.com, medium.com, and twitter.com become platforms for soapbox speeches, and a lot of trash is talked by factions within the community.However, have you noticed the other events that are correlated with a chain split? Once a chain splits, you suddenly own a number of split tokens equivalent to the number of tokens you had on the Bitcoin network. This is because the new chain will be an exact copy of the Bitcoin Blockchain up until the point where the fork occurs.If the wallet you use supports the forked chain’s software, you will be the owner of two digital tokens: Bitcoin and the Forked Chain Token. In our example we will use Bitcoin Cash (BCH) as the forked token. When the Bitcoin Cash chain forked off of the main chain, owners of Bitcoin became owners of an equivalent amount of Bitcoin Cash. This is because the chains were identical until the fork occurred. If you owned 10 BTC before the split, then you owned 10 BTC and 10 BCH after the split. This is where the slope becomes slippery.  People or organizations with unfathomable amounts of money can use forks as an opportunity to extort both the Bitcoin network and the forked network for enticing capital gains when a fork occurs.#CT_questions How important is the impact of #Bitcoin forks on Bitcoin price?Let's say Randy owns 35,000 Bitcoins; at a value of $5,000 per Bitcoin, Randy’s digital assets are worth $175,000,000. Just like anybody with large amounts of money invested in a market, Randy pays attention to news that may affect his position (wealth) in that market. Randy learns that there will be a hardfork in the Bitcoin network and that the hardfork will create a new token, Bitcoin Cash (BCH).On top of this, Randy learns that his Bitcoin wallet provider will support the forked software, so he knows that he will own Bitcoin Cash as well as Bitcoin once the fork occurs. Now, Randy expects to have 35,000 Bitcoin Cash tokens in addition to his 35,000 BTC after the fork.  If Randy was to increase his position by millions of USD worth of Bitcoin, he would be the owner of more Bitcoin than he previously owned.However, he would also create a buy wall that drives the Bitcoin price up since he is such a large player in the Bitcoin market. When Randy increases the amount of Bitcoin he owns, he also increases the amount of Bitcoin Cash he will own once the fork occurs.Because Randy is an educated investor, Randy decides to increase his position in Bitcoin so that he owns 50,000 Bitcoin the day before the fork. Randy did this because he would like to own even more Bitcoin Cash than the 35,000 he would have had if he did not increase his position in Bitcoin. Now when the fork occurs, Randy expects to have 50,000 BCH in addition to his 50,000 BTC.When the Bitcoin Network forks, some of the value that was in the Bitcoin network splits into the forked chain. When Bitcoin Cash forked from the Bitcoin network, the value of Bitcoin went from $2800 to $2700 (July 23,2017).As a result of the fork, Bitcoin Cash was created and was valued around $555 at the time of it’s launch. (July 23, 2017).When Bitcoin dropped from $2,800 to $2,700, Randy's digital assets (wealth in Bitcoin)  dropped from $140,000,000 to $135,000,000, a $5 mln loss. However, because of the fork, Randy now has 50,000 BCH worth $555 a piece. Because Randy is an educated investor and has no plans to use the Bitcoin Cash (BCH), he immediately sells his BCH for a profit the moment the option to sell BCH becomes available to him on his preferred exchange.Randy sells all 50,000 of his BCH for a profit of $27,750,000. A nice $28 mln gain (rounded number) to make up for the $5 mln loss that he suffered due to the decline in the price of Bitcoin. At the end of the day, Randy profits around $23,000,000 from the chain split.Keep in mind, there are other investors like Randy who are highly educated and extremely skilled at what they do. Furthermore, they may be executing a similar or even more efficient strategy as Randy regarding the hardfork; buy a lot of Bitcoin, anticipate a chain split where you are left with a number of new altcoins equivalent to the number of Bitcoin you own, quickly sell off the altcoin for a profit and then decrease your position in Bitcoin because it is overvalued.Individuals like Randy are referred to as whales: individuals who hold positions so large in the Bitcoin market, that their bid and ask orders are capable of shaking up the market. Since it only takes a few big players using a similar strategy to drive the value of Bitcoin up or down, when an opportunity like this presents itself (a hardfork), the price of Bitcoin may not reflect the true value of Bitcoin.Since educated investors know that the Bitcoin price may be artificially high due to big players like themselves implementing a hardfork strategy, the big investor(s) have an incentive to lower their position in Bitcoin once they have executed their hard-fork gameplan. This is because they expect the Bitcoin price to correct to a value that is closer to its true value once all the hard-fork affiliated nonsense subsides.Because there are multiple people like Randy who have a relatively large position in the Bitcoin market, when these people decrease their position in Bitcoin to an amount that they are comfortable owning during a bear period (and that number may be zero) their collective ask offers are capable of creating a sell-wall that drives down the price of Bitcoin.After the big sell off of both the altcoin - because investors find it virtually worthless for them to hold for the long term - and Bitcoin - because investors know the price is artificially high for the short term due to their market strategy - investors capitalize on the low price of Bitcoin from the massive sell-wall and they buy back the Bitcoin that they previously unloaded.On top of the profit investors make from selling-off all of their altcoin, investors will experience capital gains from selling their Bitcoin at an artificially high price and then purchasing Bitcoin back once the price is lower. During the period where investors buy back Bitcoin, we tend to see the price stabilize for a short period of time.Investors may have stockpiled Bitcoin anticipating an equal amount of altcoin and then sold off a significant amount of both Bitcoin and altcoin - in our example Bitcoin Cash - to reap the massive capital gains available to them.I can’t rule out the possibility that several other market factors had an effect on the Bitcoin price surge and subsequent plummet, but that being said, how plausible do you think it is that the whales set off the surge and fall of Bitcoin?"

JPMorgan Switches Tact, ...","Dec 5, 2017","After Jamie Dimon drew a line in the sand for JPMorgan, calling it a ‘fraud,’ the company has once again stepped over that line, praising the digital coin as a ‘new gold.’","Analysts at JPMorgan believe that Bitcoin has changed its shape and that it could soon be joining gold as a reliable, long-term way to store wealth. Recent growth and recent changes have seen Bitcoin lean more towards being digital gold, and this is where JPMorgan see its value.According to JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, the incredible spike in the value of Bitcoin is allowing it to start competing as an asset class; and seemingly at the same time drop out of the currency race.There are changes afoot in the Bitcoin market, especially when it comes to making the digital currency easier to invest in. Panigirtzoglou said:“The prospective launch of Bitcoin futures contracts by established exchanges, in particular, has the potential to add legitimacy and thus increase the appeal of the cryptocurrency market to both retail and institutional investors.”There is an ongoing debate over which is more popular, and if one can kill the other when it comes to talking about investing in gold and Bitcoin. However, the precious metal may be steady and safe, thus not as exciting as Bitcoin, but it still holds a large chunk of influential sway.Bitcoin still falls short of Gold’s $6 tln valuation, however, it is the speed at which it has grown which is more impressive. The huge growth spurt could make cryptocurrencies match or even surpass gold quite soon as an investable asset.Around the time Dimon was spurting his rhetoric on Bitcoin, there was a feeling that the banks and Bitcoin were in a battle royale. The one was being challenged by a young upstart of a digital currency, and losing ground.Banks were nervous of Bitcoin as a currency and how it could liberate people from the clutches of the government-backed fiat, however, that fight has died down somewhat as the future is now aimed at accumulating the valuable asset.Instead of a flying in the face of the institutionalized banking system, Bitcoin looks like it has outgrown its angsty teen stages.There is now a literal digital gold rush as the fear of missing out sweeps the globe."

movements of the U.S. dollar. 23444 Total views. 542 ...","Oct 30, 2017",What does the constitution and fiat currencies have in common?,"It’s very difficult to effect a change in a constitution. In most cases, a constitutional amendment is only ratified after two-thirds of the House and Senate approve the amendment proposal. After that, lawmakers send the proposal to the states for a vote. Three-fourths of the states must support the proposed amendment before it actually makes it into the constitution. That’s a long and tedious process.It also requires a long and tedious process to stimulate the foreign exchange market. Here’s how.A recent study conducted by Bank of America Corp.’s Alice Leng revealed that foreign exchange trading — or forex, which essentially means the exchange or conversion of one fiat currency for another based on the values of each participating currency — now responds to shocks in the market less meaningfully. Even when the forex market responds meaningfully to shocks, it’s usually not sustained for a long period. It’ll potentially take six times the effort it took 15 years ago to stir volatility in the forex market today, Leng wrote in a note published Monday, Oct. 9. The low volatility in the forex market is obvious in that the JPMorgan FX volatility index is 12 percent lower than its five-average, according to a Bloomberg.The recent low volatility of fiat currencies stands in stack contrast to Bitcoin, which has been criticized for its high volatility. Central bank or securities administration agencies globally have warned that people should be cautious of Bitcoin and other digital currencies mainly because of their volatility. But fiat currencies haven’t always been stable. Let’s dig a little into the volatility history of the U.S. dollar as a case study.A good way to check the volatility history of the U.S. dollar is by checking the U.S. Dollar Index. The U.S. Dollar index tracks the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the values of a basket of six international currencies. Maintained by the ICE Futures U.S., Inc., the U.S. Dollar Index is geometrically averaged and tracks the value of the U.S. dollar against the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss franc.Chart of the U.S. Dollar Index since November 1985. Source: tradingview.comOf course, that’s a huge chart and it’s difficult to make out anything from it. We’ll break the chart down into three different charts, each representing a decade to see the volatility history of the U.S. dollar. First, I would like to point out that for the purpose of this article we’ll be associating volatility to major, steep falls in the value of the U.S. dollar, since that’s typically the major focus when discussing the volatility of Bitcoin.The chart above represents the decade between 1985 and 1995. The major sign of volatility in the U.S. dollar during this decade was the overall drop in the value of the dollar between 1985 and 1987 — around the period that the Latin America debt crisis hit. Within those years, the U.S. Dollar Index fell from about 124.99 to 85.42, a 31.7 percent decline. The value of the dollar didn’t quite rise in value for the remainder of the decade, on an overall basis.The chart above represents the movement of the U.S. dollar index between 1995 and 2005. The U.S. dollar, once again, showed signs of volatility during the period between Jan. 1, 2002 and Dec. 1, 2004, with the U.S. dollar index dropping from roughly 120.28 to 80.85, a 32.8 percent drop. This period coincided with the dotcom bubble.Finally, we’ll look at the decade between 2005 and 2015 as shown in the chart above. The biggest sign of volatility during this decade occurred between November 2005 and March 2008 — around the time that the last global financial crisis got serious. During this period, the U.S. Dollar Index dropped from about 91.57 to about 70.53, a 23 percent decline.Please note that I’ve only looked into the cases of the largest volatilities in the decades we’re considering here. As the charts show, the U.S. dollar showed several signs of volatility during these decades. This is especially the case during the decade between 2005 and 2015.Yes, I agree, this is an insane thing to do. But who knows what we might find. Again, for the purpose of this article, we’ll be associating volatility to major, steep falls in price.Chart showing the Bitcoin price movement since 2013Since it was created in 2009, Bitcoin has risen from about $4.89 to record an all-time high of over $6,200, as of the time of writing. This dramatic rise is one of the reasons the digital currency is unpopular within most of the traditional investing community. Hello, Jamie Dimon!Bitcoin rose on the back of a string of events, a major highlight being the approval of Bitcoin by the People’s Bank of China in November 2013. After the approval by the Chinese central bank, Bitcoin went on to record a then all-time high of about $1,242 just before the close of November 2013.However, two major events — the struggles of the then-largest Bitcoin exchange MT Gox and the Chinese central bank banning financial institutions from using Bitcoin — started the first highly volatile Bitcoin price movement. Between Nov. 29, 2013, when Bitcoin recorded the $1,242 high, and Dec. 18, 2013, Bitcoin shed about 54.8 percent in value. Although it recouped some of the losses at the start of 2014, the digital currency reached another low of $386.20 in April 2014 — declining by 60 percent from a $958 high in January 2014. Over the next year Bitcoin would continue its downward trend to record a three-year low of under $200.Bitcoin started rallying again in 2016, rising above 138 percent in 2016. The highest drop witnessed in 2016 was a 19 percent drop between June 19 and June 23. By the standards of previous volatility signs, it’s safe to say 2016 was quite a stable year for Bitcoin.As of the time of writing, Bitcoin had risen by nearly 500 percent in value since Jan. 1, 2017. Despite the huge gain, the largest major drop in the price of Bitcoin was 33 percent — between Sept. 1 and Sept. 14, the period when the Chinese government cracked down on Bitcoin.The short answer is that Bitcoin’s biggest volatility moves are more intense than the dollar’s volatility moves historically. And that shouldn’t be surprising. Here’s a bit more detail.First, the longest overall downward streak in the U.S. Dollar Index that led to the highest decline in the value of the U.S. dollar was between January 2002 and December 2004. That’s nearly three years. The index dropped by about 32.8 percent during that period.By comparison, Bitcoin’s sharpest downward streak that led to the highest decline in price was between January 2014 and April 2014 — about three months. The digital currency lost about 60 percent of its value during that period. There was no time over the last three decades that the U.S. dollar lost so much of its value within months. In addition, Bitcoin’s longest downward streak lasted between November 2013 when it reached a high of about $1,242 and January 2015 when Bitcoin reached a low of about $192 — an 85 percent drop.Bitcoin trading volumeYes, Bitcoin has been volatile and it still is.The bright spot, however, is that stability is gradually becoming a part of Bitcoin. As mentioned earlier, the steepest decline in the price of Bitcoin in 2016 resulted in a mere 19 percent drop. In addition, the largest major drop in the price of Bitcoin so far in 2017 has been the 33 percent drop in September with the news of Chinese regulations on ICOs and cryptocurrency exchanges. This was a bigger event than in 2013 when the price of Bitcoin dropped by roughly 55 percent after the Chinese government banned financial institutions from using Bitcoin. The increased stability is mainly due to the fact that Bitcoin’s trading volume has increased considerably compared to 2013 — as shown in the Bitcoin volume chart above.For all the publicity of Bitcoin’s volatility, little has been said about how it’s gaining stability. As its trading volume increased over the years, elements of stability have kicked in. It’s safe to say, the more stable Bitcoin’s trading volume becomes, the more stable its price will be."

Real adoption. pic.twitter.com/Mmglv3NEhI Since 2014 Hyosung has collaborated with leading Bitcoin service providers within the South Korean cryptocurrency industry such as the Tim Draper-backed Coinplug. For over three years Hyosung has enabled South Korean ATM users to buy and sell Bitcoin through tens of thousands of Hyosung ATMs, located at nearly every convenience store and subway station.Through the Coinplug mobile app, Hyosung has allowed South Korean users to easily withdraw and deposit cash to sell or obtain Bitcoin, increasing the liquidity of Bitcoin for general consumers in the region.As seen in the photograph below, the efforts of Coinplug and Hyosung to transform many of the existing bank ATMs in South Korea to Bitcoin-supporting ATMs have led to an increase in mainstream adoption of Bitcoin.In the upcoming weeks Hyosung intends to roll out its full integration of Bitcoin into its international ATM models that will be shipped to supporting countries, such as the US and most European countries.Since 2016, most leading Bitcoin markets and their authorities have pressured Bitcoin exchanges and trading platforms to enforce strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies to crackdown on illicit use cases of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Litecoin.Consequently, the process of account verification and updating daily or monthly limits of Bitcoin trading accounts has become significantly challenging. On most exchanges users are required to spend at least a few weeks to submit necessary documents including personal verification (IDs or passports), bank documents, and even conduct a face-to-face interview for maximum monthly limit upgrades.For large-scale traders and investors it is worthwhile to go through such a rigorous verification process to create trading accounts. For beginner users and casual investors however, Bitcoin ATMs are significantly simpler to use to buy and sell small amounts of Bitcoin.Currently, major Bitcoin brokerages and exchanges such as Coinbase and Gemini are focusing on providing support for institutional and retail investors. Cointelegraph recently reported that Coinbase launched Coinbase Custody, a Bitcoin custodian platform for institutional investors planning to invest a minimum amount of $10 bln in Bitcoin.A handful of companies including Coins.ph of the Philippines, the largest Bitcoin brokerage in Asia with nearly 3 million active users, are working to provide services for general consumers and small-scale Bitcoin investors.In the long-term, the integration of Bitcoin into hundreds of thousands of bank ATMs globally would further increase the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin."

Those who sought bigger blocks therefore hard forked away from Bitcoin and created Bitcoin Cash (BCH).","Since the creation of Bitcoin Cash in August 2017, there has been a tug on both sides of the divide and many key players and stakeholders have publicly taken sides based on reasons that are peculiar to them.After the hard fork, Bitcoin Cash followed a general downward trend following its initial surge post-creation, while Bitcoin continued to smash the roof and set new record-highs repeatedly. Recently, Bitcoin retraced significantly over a short period of time - about $2,300 in just a few days. The difference between this dip and previous corrections was the corresponding surge in value of Bitcoin Cash which many people see as a direct rival to Bitcoin.This Bitcoin Cash surge has caused formerly-neutral trading platforms like eToro to add Bitcoin Cash to their platform, with members paying a closer attention to developments around the cryptocurrency.Roger Ver is known as ‘Bitcoin Jesus’ due to the fervour with which he preached the Bitcoin gospel in its early days, but now appears as the main face behind Bitcoin Cash. He insists that his version of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin Cash, is the future of Bitcoin.Ver tells Cointelegraph:“Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin and will have the bigger market cap, trade volume and user base in the future.”Currently, Bitcoin Cash has a market cap that is just about one-fifth that of Bitcoin, a daily trading volume of over half and a circulating supply that is slightly higher when compared to Bitcoin. Following the recent price fluctuations, the crypto community is beginning to pay closer attention to Bitcoin Cash.The CEO of Netcoins, Michael Vogel, sees Bitcoin and cryptocurrency as the world's largest and most ambitious open source project. The closest parallel, according to Vogel, is the open source nature of Linux, which is notorious for the sparring that happens between the backers of different versions of the software. Vogel believes that the rivalry between different camps of the Bitcoin community is just a temporary roadblock that will lead to a more robust and resilient technology.Vogel says:“I do not think the challenges and in-fighting between various crypto camps are a bad thing. In another way we're effectively witnessing democracy in action. These are, in part, simply growing pains of a new technology, but by blasting through these roadblocks Bitcoin also becomes more robust and resilient. This is why, in my opinion, Bitcoin continued to rally to all-time highs after the Bitcoin Cash fork during the summer; Bitcoin users have realized that ""Bitcoin is still Bitcoin"" any time a new fork occurs.”Dana L. Coe, Director at BitLox, sees the current situation as a deliberate action of market makers who are taking advantage of the tender stage of the crypto ecosystem. Coe tells Cointelegraph that the activity between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash is pure market volatility driven by rumors and speculation, which essentially drives all markets. However, he notes that in this case one can easily observe the market makers as they are quite obvious. This is especially so, as we have seen Bitcoin recover fully from the fall in price and subsequently break the $8,000 mark.Coe says:“The cryptosphere has come a long way, but let us not forget that compared to the economy as a whole, it is still small. Therefore, when actors from the larger national economies take an interest, crypto prices are most certainly to be subject to outsized influences. In the end, Bitcoin will stand or fall on the faith of it’s users and it’s users alone.”Apparently, there is genuine attention being paid to the two most expensive cryptocurrencies at the moment. Most proponents have taken to social media to show support or criticize either Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash, depending on which one they support.Immediately after the hard fork, exchanges such as Bittrex, Kraken, ViaBitcoin and Bter all listed Bitcoin Cash on their platforms, after which its adoption seemed to have reached a plateau. But with more trading platforms listing Bitcoin Cash in the wake of its biggest push since creation, it is only normal to expect more developments around the community as time goes on."

This has allowed Bitcoin to thrive as a global, apollitical currency and store of value, impervious to outside factors that would otherwise undermine its value and efficiency.However, as it is common with technology, when one problem is solved, another one arises from the solution. This is the case with Bitcoin mining, a once harmless practice that could be performed from any regular desktop computer. Today it’s a billion dollar industry with an estimated consumption of 288 megawatts, according to data from the Global Cryptocurrency Benchmarking Study by the Cambridge Judge Business School.The continued growth of cryptocurrency mining is not only affecting our environment, it is also harming cryptocurrencies themselves by promoting centralization and industrialization.

These mammoth miners keep all the incentives and have all of the power over the network.So, what should we do? Proof of Work mining is viewed by some as an indispensable part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, acting as the “only” foolproof anti-Sybil mechanism that can keep networks such as Bitcoin safe. Other will argue that alternative methods can achieve the same, if not better results, without the need to give up security or decentralization in the process.Today, we are going to take a look at some of the most and least popular alternatives to digital currency mining. Some of these can help reduce or end the centralization of Bitcoin mining and the environmental devastation that is being left in its wake. We are going to talk about alternative energy sources, new consensus mechanisms and innovative implementations of Proof of Work.In 2016, BBC revealed that 70% of the Bitcoin hashrate was located in China. Unfortunately, the vast majority of electricity in the country is produced by burning coal, resulting in one of the biggest carbon footprints in the world. Despite recent efforts by the Chinese government to halt coal power projects, the “dirty black rock” is still being burned throughout the country. From industrial boilers to home stoves, coal generates more than 75% of the nation’s electricity.It has become clear that as long as mining remains profitable, more mining computers will come online, consuming even more power. The long-term solution may lie not with alternative mining/issuing methods but with the source of electricity itself.As electricity requirements continue to grow for miners, it is likely that miners will start turning towards renewable energy sources. HydroMiner, for example, is a cryptocurrency mining company using hydropower stations in the Alps region to power its mining operations. Known as one of the most effective and cleanest sources of energy, the electricity that is generated from hydropower emits just about 5-10% of the CO2 released by conventional fossil fuel power.By using hydropower, the company pays less for electricity. As a matter of fact, the company’s cost of electricity is actually 85% lower than the Europe’s average price – making it competitive with China.Since wind and solar power do not produce a steady supply of energy, hydropower seems to be the most suitable power supply for digital currency mining. Hydropower generates a vast amount of electricity without relying significantly on climatic conditions, air current flow, and complex start-up processes. Operating and maintenance costs are typically low, as these procedures are almost fully automated and require no fuel.Proof of Work is not the only way to do run a digital currency. An alternate consensus mechanism, called Proof of Stake (PoS), relies on a process called “forging.” Each user can “stake” his currency and have a chance to be selected to forge a block and earn more currency. Those who own more currency receive more chances to forge blocks.The concept is simple: the more coins you have, the more coins you’ll earn. In its application, however, Proof of Stake is much more complicated and comes in several variations.While opinions on these matter vary, it’s hard to ignore the advantages provided by Proof of Stake mining, the most relevant of which being the lower energy consumption. PoS also allows anyone to participate in the network without any special hardware or technical knowledge, given that all that is needed is to leave one’s digital currency wallet/node running.In terms of security, Proof of Stake also offers some less-than-obvious advantages. For example, a Proof of Work miner must invest in hardware in order to mine coins. This  would normally mean that he has a vested interest in the well-being and success of the network. However, the current cryptocurrency landscape allows miners to use their equipment profitably on other coins, especially when dealing with GPU mining.Proof of Stake, on the other hand, requires the user to purchase coins in order to participate in the network, ensuring that his mining power cannot be used elsewhere. In terms of security, this prevents certain attacks, given that the demise or disruption of the cryptocurrency at hand would result in a loss of investment for the malicious actor.In the world of Proof of Stake, several different implementations have been created. The Waves Platform, for example, uses a Leased Proof of Stake system in which miners can “lease” their tokens to full nodes in order to generate revenue without having to host their own nodes. A similar approach is used by DPoS cryptocurrencies who vote on delegates to generate blocks and vote on important decisions.Systems similar to those applied in Proof of Work cryptocurrencies can also be implemented through the use of Smart Contracts.Another viable alternative is mining through the use of smart contracts for Ethereum-based (ERC-20) tokens. This system is obviously dependent on the security on the Ethereum Blockchain which, at the moment, is provided by a wide network of Proof of Work miners. Future plans will see Ethereum move to a PoS system.Minereum, for example, is an Ethereum-based token that uses a system of smart contracts to issue and distribute tokens without having to adopt any “proof” system. Their announcement reads:“Minereum is the first ever self mining Smart Contract Token. Coins are generated on the fly with a mathematical formula.”Despite being extremely attractive, this practice it is still dependent on the integrity of the Ethereum Blockchain, which itself runs on a Proof of Work system. Nonetheless, it is a notable step towards a more sustainable mining industry where utility tokens can have complex issuing schedules without having to resort to their own independent Blockchain and the associated energy costs.Delayed Proof of Work (DPoW) is a fairly new concept in the world of cryptocurrency mining. DPoW allows any cryptocurrency to be as secure as Bitcoin itself without the need to have a large network of miners protecting it.Delayed Proof of Work relies on a secondary network of notary nodes in order to provide this improved security mechanism. Notary nodes take the block hashes from a currency’s Blockchain and insert them into the Bitcoin Blockchain by making transactions. At the same time, the information about previous blocks stored on the Bitcoin Blockchain is constantly checked by nodes in order to ensure the the currency’s network.By stamping the block hashes from “weaker” cryptocurrencies on the Bitcoin Blockchain, these become resistant to previously-open attack vectors where a malicious actor with large amounts of hashing power could disrupt the network by “rewriting” the information on it. By timestamping the block hashes on the Bitcoin Blockchain, they become as immutable as Bitcoin itself and allow the notary nodes to identify the attack attempt.Although mining on these chains occurs through Proof of Work, it’s done through an on-demand block generation process. Another concept put forward by DPoW developer “Jl777,” on-demand block generation, ensures that blocks are only mined when a transaction needs to be processed. This reduces the computational power sent by miners and the storage requirements for nodes. Polycryptoblog, who works with Jl777, explains:“On-demand block generation saves energy on its own Blockchain whereas dPoW makes the Bitcoin Blockchain more energy efficient.  When a transaction is detected in the mempool the mining process starts.  This saves energy on many fronts, CPU cores sit idle when they aren't mining, comparable to proof of stake.  This also leads to smaller Blockchain sizes due lack of empty blocks being mined, which leads to less syncing time and saving on space and electricity in the process.”Some would argue that Bitcoin’s Proof of Work is still useful given that it protects the network. However, when we say useful we mean recyclable. If we can leverage the energy being wasted on Proof of Work for other computational-heavy services, then we’re no longer wasting it.This is a concept that has been explored in the past by projects like Gridcoin and FoldCoin. By adding an incentive layer in the form of cryptocurrencies, these projects allow users to “mine” coins while contributing to good causes such as medical research and climate studies. This can be seen as one of the first instances of useful PoW.Another currency uses “Useful Work” system in which computational power is replaced by storage space. Their white paper reads:“We propose a useful work consensus protocol, where the probability that the network elects a miner to create a new block (we refer to this as the voting power of the miner) is proportional to their storage currently in use in relation to the rest of the network. We design the Filecoin protocol such that miners would rather invest in storage than in computing power to parallelize the mining computation. Miners offer storage and reuse the computation for proof that data is being stored to participate in the consensus.”We usually like to wrap articles like these in a nice little package where we draw some sort of conclusion or solution from the analysis conducted. However, the truth is that we don’t really know what the future holds. When Satoshi Nakamoto wrote the Bitcoin whitepaper he did not envision ASIC miners or mining pools, and he certainly did not envision a 288 megawatt mining industry.Nevertheless, if necessity is the mother of invention, the solutions listed above indicate a clear need for an alternative to the current norm. Weather it’s the green energy sources being explored by HydroMiner, a Proof of Stake implementation, or something else entirely, one thing is certain: the current scenario is not sustainable."

In fact, it is challenging their monetary system which is intrinsically linked to banks, and especially central, government-backed, banks.China, especially, Russia, recently, Japan and the US have played their hands in varying degrees of harshness in efforts to try and control the decentralized monetary idea.In fact, traditional centralised, powerful organisations like banks, governments, regulators and technology behemoths are all spending billions in figuring out how to use and control distributed trust technologies.Banks have existed unchallenged for hundreds of years, and that is the key issue here; Bitcoin, backed by a solid platform such as Blockchain technology, is a ghost that is incredibly hard to control due to its decentralized nature.""John McAfee has been brazen about regulators’ power plays to try and control Bitcoin, saying that they will never be able to ban it.""The power and control of money is being ripped away from traditional institutions, which can also be seen on Wall Street.

They trade like any other basic call or put option, in which an investor pays a premium for the right - but not obligation - to buy or sell an agreed amount of currency on an agreed date. Currently, there are two types of Bitcoin options—a binary option and an exchange-traded option.A binary option is a simple type of option that is valued according to a true/false statement. For example, if the price of the underlying asset Bitcoin is above a certain level, the call (long) option will pay 100; if it is below, it will pay 0. For a put option, the reverse is true.Binary options make for simple valuation and are therefore a good way for traders to avoid complicated valuations, which often work in favor of option issuers to the detriment of buyers.Both types of brokers are often referred to as a Bitcoin binary options brokers (BBOB).  Most BBOBs only offer it as a virtual currency pair versus the USD.On July 24, 2017, in a breakthrough ruling, the US Commodities Futures Trade Commission (CFTC) approved a proposal to launch a regulated Bitcoin derivative clearing market, New York-based LedgerX. According to the company, LedgerX allows institutional investors to obtain virtual currency and then hedge its volatility using a US federally regulated venue. “Initially, LedgerX intends to list a Day Ahead Swap and one to six month Bitcoin to US Dollar options contracts,” a company spokesman said. Noting that “the New York-based LedgerX, the first and only digital currency exchange and clearinghouse licensed by the US Federal Government, has begun exchange and clearing operations for centrally cleared Bitcoin contracts. In the first week of trading, 176 swaps and options contracts traded with notional values of more than $1,000,000.” These trades were executed by 20 institutional investors -- including investment banks, asset managers, hedge funds and proprietary-trading shops.At a Bitcoin derivatives exchange, virtual currency listings and prices are tracked and can be looked up by ticker symbol.  By publishing continuous, live markets for Bitcoin option prices, an exchange enables independent parties to engage in price discovery and execute transactions. Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group (CME) and Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), the world's largest options exchanges will roll out Bitcoin futures by the end of this year or early next year.  The largest futures market in Argentina, the Mercado de Termino de Rosario (Rofex) is considering offering Bitcoin futures as well.  Other platforms that offer virtual currency options trading are Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange, owned by Seychelles-incorporated HDR Global Trading Ltd., Deribit of Amsterdam, Singapore-based Coinut options exchange and Dublin-based Predictious.Options are widely used to manage hedge funds’ portfolio risks or “to hedge or speculate on the price of an underlying asset with a quantified risk,” according to retired hedge fund manager Michael Steinhardt, whose career earnings made him a legend in the industry.Steinhardt set up his first fund in 1967, “following a strategy created by Alfred Winslow Jones. He married (1) short sales to hedge against stock market risk; (2) leverage to boost stock trading returns; (3) and long positions in stocks, to continuously extract stock market trading profits as their prices moved up and down.”  Steinhardt, in an interview, explained that he expanded on Jones’ strategy  “by incorporating bonds in addition to stocks, as well as new derivative hedging products that entered the markets in addition to short sales” to his portfolio, throughout his career.  He  began hedging with “long and short exchange-traded stock options to hedge the price of stocks when stock options debuted in 1973, at the  CBOE.” That same year, two professors, Fisher Black and Myron Scholes, conceived the Black Scholes Options Pricing Model, which standardized options pricing at options exchanges. Over a period of 28 years, using  his own “Steinhardt Style Hedged Trading Strategy,” he earned “hedged annual returns of 24.5 percent - triple the S&P 500 average,” Steinhardt said.    The illustrious careers of hedge fund legends has inspired contemporary Bitcoin traders, to set up Bitcoin-invested hedge funds that surf Bitcoin’s extreme price volatility on the world-wide-web just like:Since CFTC’s approval of New York-based LedgerX, 70 additional Bitcoin-based hedge funds announced that they would be launching soon. Among these hedge funds is Silicon Valley-based Pantera Capital, which will launch a SEC, registered $100 mln ICO focused hedge fund. And French bank BNP Paribas, which will add Bitcoin to one of its currency funds.  There are now about 120 virtual currency hedge funds:  (1) those that have portfolios containing exclusively virtual currencies, Bitcoin options and ICOs; and (2) those that have added some virtual currency to a mix of other asset types.  Source: Autonomous NextIn China, the Fintech Blockchain Group runs an exclusively virtual currency invested hedge fund which trades virtual currencies 24 hours a day, seven days a week using a cutting-edge computerized lightning quick trading strategy to arbitrage tiny price discrepancies on the countless web venues where it changes hands. Zhou Shuoji, Fintech Blockchain Group’s high-speed Bitcoin trader said: “It’s the golden age to be in the Bitcoin market because it’s imperfect.”In the US, hedge fund manager Timothy Enneking of Crypto Asset Management said ""I don't think the world has seen but the pointy end of the spear in terms of what's going to happen in cryptocurrencies""  and launched the first SEC-registered Crypto Asset Fund exclusively invested in virtual currency products.  Hedge fund manager, Mike Novogratz who was the president of Fortress Investment Group (US) that was among early investors in virtual currencies and exchanges admitted that ""10 percent of my net worth is invested in Bitcoins and it has been the best investment of my life.” Softbank Group acquired Fortress Investment Group earlier during this year.According to a spokesman for FinCEN, “A foreign hedge fund may have to register with FinCEN depending on several factors. If the foreign hedge fund is registered with, and functionally regulated or examined by the SEC, CFTC or if it engages in activities that, if conducted in the US would require it to register with the SEC or CFTC, then it would not have to register as an MSB. If it does not satisfy this condition, the answer depends on how it operates, on behalf of whom and where its customer base is located.”  Bitcoin invested hedge funds can be legally structured in a variety of ways.  For example, a Swedish company, XBT Provider that is listed on the Stockholm Nasdaq exchange is structured as an ""exchange-traded note"" (ETN) that tracks the price of Bitcoin. An unregistered virtual currency hedge fund managed by John Chalekson is structured as a plain vanilla, limited partnership. This hedge fund, using a “game theoretic equilibrium” trading strategy, to “dominate the hedge fund indices with extraordinary numbers,” delivered an astonishing “2,129 percent investment return to his investors through August 2017 primarily by investing in new virtual currencies, ICOs in long positions, without hedging or using any leverage—266 times the S&P 500 average.” Traditional hedge  funds, on average, returned 3.7 percent through the first half of 2017, according to data provided by HFR, and the S&P 500 gained 8 percent over the same period.  US mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments, with $6.3 tln under administration, joined with the $10 bln Coinbase Inc, a Silicon Valley virtual currency exchange, ""to enable Fidelity clients to track their digital assets alongside more traditional investments, like stocks, bonds and mutual funds."" Fidelity did so because, a company official said,  “we can see that the evolution of Bitcoin and Blockchain technology is setting the investment industry up for disruption.”As virtual currencies seep into the current world regulatory and financial infrastructure while transforming it at the same time, the good news is that there are several virtual currency based financial alternatives that will satisfy both the Bitcoin bulls and the bears.Disclaimer: this article is reproduced with permission from Tax Management International Journal, 46 TM International Journal 575, 10/13/17.

But does Bitcoin really need Wall Street?","Global banks have paid over $10 bln in penalties to settle allegations that they defrauded their clients while engaging in foreign currency trades on their behalf. The banks typically shortchanged their customers by front-running - a process of executing trades for the bank's proprietary trading desk before executing trades on their client's behalf.They used their knowledge of the client's impending trade to make profits for their bank. The list of banks who have settled include Bank of America, Citi, HSBC and Barclays. The penalties paid by the banks may not be the end of the story - a former HSBC FX trader, Mark Johnson, has been convicted on nine charges of fraud for front-running a $3.5 bln order of Cairn Energy to convert dollars to pounds.Big banks have come to play a large role both in the physical commodities space as well as the market in commodity derivatives. After Goldman Sachs entered the aluminum business in a big way, it led to an increase in prices.There were allegations that this was not just due to simple supply-demand imbalance, but due to an element of market manipulation as well. It led to traditional users of aluminum, like Coca Cola complaining to the LME about how these actions were impacting it. Goldman has been fined for causing a spike in oil prices as well. More recently, Barclays has been sued for $850 mln by a hedge fund for misusing the knowledge of its trades and ramping up the price of copper.If market manipulations in the FX and commodities were performed by individual bankers, manipulation in the Libor market was by banks collaborating together.Libor, or the London Interbank Offered Rate, is the benchmark rate used to set interest rates in a variety of contracts across the world. It is calculated by polling various banks on the interest rates that they expect to pay on a particular day.There are a number of derivatives which are based on Libor and banks have manipulated Libor (by inflating or deflating the interest rate they expect to receive) to profit on their trading positions.The Libor scandal resulted in banks paying record fines - Deutsche Bank paid a fine of $2.5 bln. It also resulted in certain high profile scalps, including the resignation of Marcus Agius and Bob Diamond, the Chairman and CEO of Barclays.While a few early investors might benefit from the rapid increase in price, it is debatable whether Wall Street's entry will have an overall positive impact. It could result in higher volatility and more scrutiny from regulators.The examples mentioned above don't even talk about mortgage markets, where excessive risk taking by banks resulted in a worldwide financial crisis in 2008.Given the history of Wall Street's firms in pursuing higher profits, even if it means ignoring their fiduciary responsibilities, Bitcoin could be better off if Wall Street kept away."

With most of their investments in precious metals, the fund has decided to invest five percent of its portfolio in Bitcoin and will reinvest the profits back into the gold and silver markets.Speaking in the latest episode of The Keiser Report, the host made a jibe about Naylor-Leyland’s about-turn in sentiment on Bitcoin:“Ned is talking about Bitcoin effectively being gold, that it was designed to be gold. Now he’s invested in it, putting money to work in it.”Keiser said the fund manager should have taken his advice years ago when the price was a fraction of what it is today:“We’ve spoken to him many times about Bitcoin, he’s been reluctant and hesitant, resisted the idea that it’s gold 2.0. Now he’s been sucked up into the vortex, into that black hole that is Bitcoin.”Keiser believes that more mainstream, institutional investors will be changing their tune on cryptocurrencies sooner rather than later.“Now the old gold fund has become the new crypto-fund. Ned is now a convert, all these names that have been crypto skeptics will get sucked up and become converts - I guarantee it’s going to happen.”Known for his animated and charismatic humor, Keiser believes Bitcoin is going to change the way gold is being traded on Wall Street. He hit out at short selling and manipulation which he insists is rife in current times:“Bitcoin is helping gold by shattering the matrix of Wall Street that is incurring the naked short-selling and financial manipulation that is going on in the futures market of gold.”Keiser believes this could lead to a surge in the gold price:“We’re going to obliterate all the machinery that is killing the gold price. Bitcoin is like Moses, parting the sea of derivatives and through the gap, the gold price will finally get to two or three thousand dollars an ounce- thanks to Bitcoin.”Reflecting on Naylor-Leyland’s statement that Bitcoin will see the world “revert to sound money” as quoted by Bloomberg, Keiser goes back to Aristotle’s definition of money.The Greek philosopher wrote that money must meet four characteristics. It must be durable, portable, divisible and have intrinsic value. Keiser says like gold, Bitcoin also meets those conditions:“The condition of scarcity is the one that people have trouble with. They don’t understand how you can have digital scarcity. But that is the genius of the protocol, it creates for the first time in history digital scarcity that is scalable and immutable - it fulfills all the characteristics of money.”Check out the full episode here: "

Similar to Amazon, Uber does not process many automobiles to operate the world’s most widely utilized ride-sharing and transportation network. Airbnb does not hold much real estate to sustain a network in the hospitality marketplace.Despite their lack of physical assets, the three above mentioned companies have completely transformed their respective industries with innovative and truly revolutionary technologies.Bitcoin is leading a nearly identical digitalization process in the global finance industry and of money. While Bitcoin users can choose to hold the cryptocurrency in the form of physical money, the vast majority of Bitcoins are stored in wallets and trading platforms. Bitcoin transactions are settled in a peer-to-peer manner without the existence of intermediaries.As prominent author, entrepreneur, and trader Stephen Burns stated:$AMZN has almost no stores ?$Uber owns almost no cars ?$FB creates no content ✏️$BABA has no inventory ?$AirBnB owns no real estate ?
Bitcoin has no physical coins ?As of current, Bitcoin is being increasingly recognized and acknowledged as a robust store of value, a safe haven asset and digital gold. Hedge funds, institutional investors and retail traders have been rushing into the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets to engage in Bitcoin investment, which CME chairman Leo Melamed described as a “new asset class.”In the long-term, Bitcoin will compete with fiat currencies and existing monetary, financial and banking systems that dominate the global market, and ultimately solidify itself as the global digital currency."

the London School of Economics, explained Bitcoin is nothing short of ...","Nov 28, 2017","Dr. Garrick Hileman, an economic historian at the University of Cambridge and the London School of Economics, explained in an interview with CNN that Bitcoin is nothing short of an economic miracle.","Hileman stated:""Many economists dismissed it as a flawed form of money, something that could never achieve the level of adoption that it has. Today we estimate 5 to 10 million unique active users of cryptocurrencies, and in my opinion that's nothing short of a minor economic miracle.""Bitcoin is the world’s first form of decentralized money; a store of value that is censorship-resistant and that is immutable against manipulation by central entities, authorities and governments.The decentralized structure and peer-to-peer protocol of Bitcoin are unique in that they allow the Bitcoin network to operate as its own economy, without intermediaries and third party service providers. While some central banks and financial institutions have begun to fear such aspects of Bitcoin, the Bank of Finland encouraged economists to study the “marvelous structure” of Bitcoin.In a paper entitled “Monopoly without a monopolist: An economic analysis of the Bitcoin payment system,” Bank of Finland researchers wrote:“Bitcoin is not regulated. It cannot be regulated. There is no need to regulate it because as a system it is committed to the protocol as is and the transaction fees it charges the users are determined by the users independently of the miners’ efforts. Bitcoin’s design as an economic system is revolutionary and therefore would merit an economist’s attention and scrutiny even if it had not been functional. Its apparent functionality and usefulness should further encourage economists to study this marvelous structure.”As mentioned above, Hileman described Bitcoin as an economic miracle, but a “minor” one. However, at this stage in which the market valuation of Bitcoin has surpassed that of major banks at $166 bln and the liquidity of Bitcoin is higher than that of most stock markets, it is difficult to justify any aspect of Bitcoin as “minor.”Bitcoin has had a major impact on the global financial system over the past eleven months, and it will continue to transform the finance industry at a rapid pace. Already, institutional investors have begun to move into the Bitcoin market. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong revealed that approximately $10 bln in institutional money are awaiting to be invested in digital currencies such as Bitcoin.“Over 100 hedge funds have been created in the past year exclusively to trade digital currency. An even greater number of traditional institutional investors are starting to look at trading digital assets (including family offices, sovereign wealth funds, traditional hedge funds, and more). By some estimates there is $10 bln of institutional money waiting on the sidelines to invest in digital currency today,” wrote Armstrong.Naturally, as major hedge funds and large-scale investment banks shift towards Bitcoin, general consumers and casual investors will follow. Then, Bitcoin will no longer be a minor economic miracle but a major one, which will inevitably shape the finance sector in the long-term.Leading economies like the US, Japan and South Korea have already recognized Bitcoin as a legal currency and store of value, providing regulations to cryptocurrency exchanges, businesses and investors.  As a currency, Hileman also noted that Bitcoin is increasingly being used in the luxury markets, to process or settle large transactions without the expensive and inefficient services of banks.""If you're only paying a $2 transaction fee on a piece of art that's worth tens of thousands, the fee is basically zero. But if you're paying two or three percent on a piece of art of that value, then the numbers can go up quite a bit,” added Hileman."

Musk clarified that he is in fact not the creator of Bitcoin.","Nov 29, 2017","The debate on the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto promises to be a never-ending one. After a former SpaceX intern blogged that Elon Musk is probably Satoshi, Musk clarified that he is in fact not the creator of Bitcoin.
","People have speculated about Satoshi's origins ever since Bitcoin was invented. The trigger to get the rumour mills rolling this time was a blog post by Sahil Gupta, former intern at SpaceX, who blogged that Elon Musk was probably Satoshi Nakamoto. Sahil uses Elon Musk's background in Economics, experience in production level software and history of innovation to speculate that Elon Musk 'probably' invented Bitcoin. Given the divisive nature of the blocksize debate in the Bitcoin community, Sahil sought Elon's (or Satoshi's) intervention and asks him to play the role of a founding father (similar to Vitalik Buterin in Ethereum).
Elon Musk, has however, denied that he was Satoshi Nakamoto and going on to add that he had lost the Bitcoins which were sent to him a few years back.
Elon Musk tweeted
Not true. A friend sent me part of a BTC a few years, but I don’t know where it is.
  There has been chatter on social media in the past about whether Elon Musk could be Satoshi, but nothing ever came of the talk. Musk’s earlier stated views on Bitcoin were not flattering. In an earlier interview, Elon Musk had said:
""I guess it is primarily going to be a means of doing illegal transactions. That is not necessarily entirely bad.  Maybe some things shouldn't be illegal.... You should have a legal to illegal bridge.""
  Previous hunts for Satoshi Nakamoto have not ended well. Craig Wright claimed in 2016 that he was Satoshi and managed to convince a few mainstream media organizations and Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen, before his claim was debunked.
In 2014, Newsweek’s cover story claimed that the magazine had uncovered the identity of Satoshi. They speculated that an engineer named Dorian Nakamoto was actually the creator of Bitcoin. A media frenzy followed, despite Dorian Nakamoto’s repeated denials that he wasn't Satoshi. Eventually the Newsweek story was debunked, the magazine was left with egg on its face and Dorian Nakamoto’s life was turned completely upside down, bringing great financial hardship to the man.
Various people from Hal Finney to Nick Szabo were thought to have been Satoshi at various points in time, but nobody knows for sure. Many still believe that Satoshi is actually a group of people rather than a single individual.
While Bitcoin has grown organically and drawn millions of users into its fold without the active involvement of Satoshi, questions will always remain about his identity. Nonetheless, the development of the Bitcoin protocol has proceeded apace without Satoshi, given the talented developers who work on Bitcoin and significant community support.
However, if Satoshi is still alive and if he still holds his private keys, he is believed to own about one million Bitcoins. With Bitcoin having just breached the $10,000 level, that gives Satoshi a net worth, on paper, of $10 bln. Given that many believe Satoshi no longer has control over the coins, if he ever decided to sell his Bitcoins, the price of Bitcoins might plunge.
Given that Satoshi has remained out of the limelight for so long, it does seem likely that he values his privacy more than the billions that his Bitcoins are worth. Then again, with Bitcoin’s epic bull run, nobody knows at what point the mysterious founder might change his mind.

Instead, we’re seeing more and more millennials jumping on the bandwagon and picking Bitcoin as their top choice over other investment options.Such reality is further revealed in a survey conducted by LendEDU in November 2017 with approximately around 77 percent of the polled 565 Americans claiming that Bitcoin price will increase higher and faster next year than its seventeen-fold appreciation in 2017.Considering that most investors prefer Bitcoin for its decentralized nature, most respondents do not favor the implementation of additional digital currency regulations next year.“We found that the plurality of Bitcoin investors do not want additional regulation in 2018. However, we thought it was interesting to see that 20 percent of our respondents are unsure about the idea of increased regulation.”When asked whether many of these investors are likely to invest more in cryptocurrency, it shows that almost 75 percent of the respondents claimed that they plan to increase the size of their Bitcoin investments in 2018, with fewer than 10 percent stating that they have no intention to do so.Whether it’s highly based on price increase speculation or not, around 31.5 percent said that they will sell some of their Bitcoin holdings next year, with 40 percent claiming that they would not and 28.5 percent stating that they are not yet sure on what to do.Around 51 percent of the pollsters said that they are planning to make at least one physical purchase using their digital currency, whereas 30 percent are still unsure if they will use it in their purchases or not.When asked if they favor more regulations on Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market, roughly 50 percent of participants claimed that they are not in favor of additional laws, while slightly more than 30 percent expressed their willingness to embrace more regulations.With such varied opinion, it goes to show that many regular Bitcoin investors are likely to look into locking in their profits when 2018 comes despite the increasing price projections and market cap."

early adopter phase? 58369 Total views. 473 ...","Dec 14, 2017","One of the reasons that Bitcoin is capturing the hearts and minds of individuals is the stories of instant millionaires who have made their fortune from being an early adopter. People who were mining the coin or accumulating it by the hundred, and were smart enough to hold onto it today are experiencing unprecedented profit.","With the monumental price gain, however, people are starting to wonder where the ceiling is, and if it is not fast approaching. To this end, there is a section of the population who are wondering: ‘is it too late to get into Bitcoin?’However, this is not a new question, it is a question that was asked when Bitcoin was at $10, $100, $1,000 all the way up to over $17,000 where it sits today.There is, of course, no doubting that those who were really early to the party are the biggest profiteers, and for envy’s sake, it is worth looking at what has been achieved in just seven years.Had you put $100 into Bitcoin starting back in 2010, and going through the years, you would have made massive profits along the way.July 28, 2010: $100 back in 2010 - baring in mind this is a full two years after Satoshi Nakamoto put out his whitepaper on Bitcoin - would net you at today’s value a whopping $28,341,266. One Bitcoin back then was worth just $0.06Dec. 12, 2011: Within 18 months, there would have been plenty time to get involved in Bitcoin, but by this time the price was up over 3,000 percent, and people were already asking, ‘is it too late?’. Bitcoin was worth $3.19 and $100 back then would net you over half a million dollars ($533,065)Dec. 10, 2012: A year later, and Bitcoin was still climbing high, now breaking into the teens sitting at $13.54, a gain of 300 percent. $100 would have turned to $125. Still remarkably impressive in terms of gains, but slowing somewhat from 18 months earlier - Does that mean its rise is coming to an end perhaps?Dec. 16, 2013: Hindsight is, of course, a fantastic thing as the next year the price of Bitcoin was up to $638 and thus doubling as an investment. So, $100 worth back then would be pocket change right? Well, it would be worth $2,665 today.Dec. 8, 2014: Bitcoin was starting to be heard in whispers around the dinner table about now, but people also heard that there were black markets, hacks, and other nefarious uses, yet $100 worth back then would be worth $4,859 today.Dec. 12, 2016: Through the harder years from 2014 and the slowed growth, Bitcoin would not have been that attractive, but really, it would have been a perfect time to buy. The explosion was just about to happen. Bitcoin was trading for $780. Had you put $100 into it, that investment would have increased by more than 2,000 percent to $2,180.June 12, 2017: Six months ago, no one thought Bitcoin could go much higher than the $2,500 it stood at. But of course, it was about to take off again.Dec. 5, 2017: This week alone has seen some crazy movement. Had you bought $100 worth of Bitcoin just a few days ago, you could sell it today for $145.Dec. 10, 2017: – If you had bought at the low on Sunday’s slump (when prices fell to $13,160), that $100 would be worth $129.No one knows what will come next, but it could be safe to say that pretty much anyone who bought Bitcoin more than a week ago is profiting already.They may still be classified as early investors, or they may not, and although they may not experience gains of 3,000 percent, the feeling is Bitcoin has a long way to grow.Ronnie Moas, a famed stock picker has put forward an argument that Bitcoin is highly undervalued even at today’s prices. Moas said:“We currently have $200 tln in the world tied up in cash, stocks, bonds and gold alone and all four of those, in my opinion, are overvalued. If 1/2 of one percent of that 200 tln dollars ends up in Bitcoin, you are looking at a one tln dollar valuation that would be above where Apple Computers, the most valuable company in the World, is today.”"

He also issued a criticism of the proposals for applying a value to the cryptocurrency.,"Based on a report by MarketWatch, Buffett presented his views on Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market during an annual question-and-answer session in Omaha, Nebraska in early October 2017. During his remarks, Buffett claimed that Bitcoin is a “real bubble.”""People get excited from big price movements, and Wall Street accommodates. You can’t value Bitcoin because it’s not a value-producing asset.""Bitcoin sustained its phenomenal performance after fluctuating at about $4,300 in early October. Bitcoin price has jumped to over $6,100 on Oct. 20.Meanwhile, the negative view of Buffett on Bitcoin is not surprising as the well-known investor has already expressed such comments in the past.

In those early days there was little room or scope for women in the burgeoning technology ecosystem.","However, as the digital economy has expanded to be worth just under $400 bln doors have been opening up and it’s women who’re stepping into the breach, making successes of themselves in a market that has no preconceived gender roles or prejudices.Four out of 30 of the largest initial coin offerings this year through October had female co-founders, and two of their ICOs were among the largest so far.With the cryptocurrency market expanding rapidly and new niches and subsidiary markets opening up, there is an abundance of new jobs and it seems that women are flooding in to take up these positions.It’s not only successful ICOs that are being headed up by women. Key speakers at a number of conferences are women and Coinbase said 46 percent of its new hires this year are women, or indeed, are ethnically diverse.It is a positive and interesting social experiment as this new market has sprouted in less than seven years and in that time there has been this new influx of talent from a previously marginalized sector of the population.It hints that other sectors in which women struggle to break into - such as banking and finance, the main rival to сryptocurrencies - may contain institutional prejudice.The сryptocurrency market is also showing its disruptive nature when it comes to hiring, as this inclusive culture spreads above and beyond gender, racial and cultural differences.There has been evidence of determined women who scrapped their way to the top of ‘old boys’  sectors, jumping ship to lead a new dawn for cryptocurrencies.For example, Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan Chase & Co. banker, quit her job to run Digital Asset Holdings. Another is Elizabeth Stark, who taught at Yale and Stanford universities before co-founding Lightning Labs, which is testing a technology to speed up cryptocurrency transactions.Maxine Ryan, who launched Bitspark after dropping out of university and has made a success in that ICO, says there is a notable feminine influence:“It’s still a handful, even though it’s growing,” said Ryan, about the presence of women in the Blockchain world.Digital CUrrency Group’s director of development Meltem Demirors says women don’t always get the credit they deserve: She recalls being referred to as a “random marketing chick” earlier in her career and just last month had a man try to explain to her how crypto technology works at an event in Hong Kong where she delivered the opening remarks. She said:“I truly believe a lot of the women are the ones who are actually doing a lot of the hard operational, strategic work.”Kathleen Breitman, the San Francisco-based co-founder behind Tezos, says things are really on the up for women.“I think things are much better than they were before,” said Breitman, who a year ago met with a New York hedge fund in lieu of her male co-founder and husband, only to have them remark that they were “really surprised” she was smart. Breitman concluded:“The improvement now is due to more sophisticated actors entering the space across development and investment. There are also a lot of women who have entered the space across development and operations. Both trends have elevated the professionalism.”"

On the nature of Bitcoin, she commented that though the cryptocurrency has seen a remarkable growth in recent months, it is still a “highly speculative asset” and “not a stable source of value."" She also noted that Bitcoin remains a very small part of the overall payment system.Yellen also commented on the Fed’s relationship to Bitcoin. She reiterated her 2014 position that the Fed does not have the authority to regulate the cryptocurrency. On Wednesday, she confirmed that the scope of the Fed’s regulatory power extends only to those banking institutions that they already supervise, stating:""The Fed doesn't really play any regulatory role with respect to Bitcoin, other than assuring that banking organizations that we do supervise are attentive, that they are appropriately managing any interactions they have with participants in that market, and appropriately monitoring anti-money laundering, bank secrecy act responsibilities that they have.”Yellen noted that the Fed does not differentiate between Bitcoin and any other type of currency -- the central bank is responsible for supervising other banks, regardless of the currency being used.During the conference, Yellen also made a distinction between decentralized digital currencies like Bitcoin that are neither issued nor given value by any particular state, and digital currencies issued by governments themselves.She stated that, though central bankers globally are discussing the option of making centralized digital currencies that constitute legal tender, at the present moment, the Fed has no serious intention of introducing a digital dollar. She stated:""I really want to caution, this is not something the Federal Reserve is seriously considering at this stage. While we're looking at research on this topic, there are, I think to my mind, limited benefits from introducing it, a limited need for it and some substantial concerns.""This year multiple governments around the world have indicated their intention to research and implement a national digital currency.

No centralized authority or country can affect it by its outward politics. But, does that mean that should World War Three strike or an apocalyptic event strike, Bitcoin will survive?","Bitcoin has shown on a few occasions that not much politically can scare it. On a more micro scale as well there are indications that those who know a thing or two about the end of the world, have backed the Bitcoin horse.While many think that Doomsday Preppers are a bit looney and that their measures are unnecessary, what they do have on their side is planning and knowledge. People disregard Preppers because they are planning for something that has a low chance of happening but they are planning.Among their stores of canned food and bottled water, there are more and more instances of Preppers stockpiling Bitcoin, rather than other valuables - such as the traditional gold.Alarm bells immediately ring in that if there is a global catastrophe, the Internet as well as electricity, may be knocked out rendering Bitcoin useless, but that hasn’t dissuaded them. Even staunch survivalists are convinced Bitcoin will endure economic collapse, global pandemic, climate change catastrophes and nuclear war.“I consider Bitcoin to be a currency on the same level as gold,” Wendy McElroy, who lives on a rural Ontario farm with her husband, said. “It allows individuals to become self-bankers. When I fully understood the concepts and their significance, Bitcoin became a fascination.”There are huge flaws in their reasoning about the use of Bitcoin in a post-apocalyptic world, but the logic is sound. Bitcoin is pretty apocalypse-proof.If the world reached a stage where there was no electricity, power, food and water for that matter, Bitcoin would hardly be on anyone's minds. But taking a step back, Bitcoin has shown its ability to resist in political upheaval, as well as aid.There have been a few instances just this year where Bitcoin has come to the fore. The first bit of evidence was when the US was threatening North Korea and all global markets - barring one - felt the sting.In August, almost across the board, markets dropped by about one percent with the escalating tensions between North Korea and the US, but Bitcoin only continued to rise.With the recent peaceful coup in Zimbabwe and even a long time before that, the troubled African nation showed how important a non-centralized currency can be. The economy collapsed a long time ago, forcing Zimbabwe onto Dollar bonds, but now with a digital alternative, the demand has skyrocketed.The South American country is also going through a political crisis where its currency has essentially become worthless. This has seen a massive surge in interest in cryptocurrency, especially mining it.It is clear that while there is a society and some semblance of an infrastructure, Bitcoin can be a lifeline to those downtrodden by economic turbulence and political upheaval. However, for it to truly stand the test of an apocalyptic time, there will need to be some lucky breaks.“I doubt Bitcoin is a safe haven from an extreme-risk environment. In that sense, Bitcoin isn’t gold,” said Charlie Morris, the London-based chief investment officer at Newscape Capital Advisors Ltd.However, in counter to that, Rob Harvey, a Bitcoin investor who prepares for natural and nuclear catastrophes, makes an interesting point about the Blockchain.“It may be difficult, if not impossible to access for a while, but once things start returning to some level of normality, then the Blockchain will return as it was before the disaster,” said Harvey. “The Blockchain does not need a specific place or a specific person to survive—that’s a strong survival tactic.”"

No one knows who he is, where he is or what he is doing with his millions.That is millions, as in millions of Bitcoins as it has been reasonably estimated that Nakamoto could own over one mln coins.Matt Green, a cryptocurrency professor at Johns Hopkins University, says Nakamoto has the power to tank the currency if he wants to.Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 mln which is expected to be reached by the year 2140.Nakamoto's one mln Bitcoins amount to five percent of the entire cryptocurrency.""The thing about Bitcoin is if you control a million of them, you have the ability to flood the market at any point.

If somebody could dump hundreds or thousands of Mickey Mantle trading cards, rare ones, onto the market, they wouldn't be worth so much anymore,"" said Green.Nakamoto has really gone undercover since he decided to pull away from his creation, and for a man with such high value, his influence has not even been noted among the pseudo-anonymous Bitcoin network.However, if Nakamoto were to put his coins up for sale, the entire market would be flooded, and the Bitcoin price would tank.While Nakamoto remains a sleeping giant and a potential dormant volcano, he is no threat or promise to the Bitcoin Network. However, he is still an extremely significant figure in the digital currency's future.Ben Yu, a Bitcoin investor living in San Francisco, says Nakamoto's stake in Bitcoin is extremely significant.""If Bitcoin fulfills its role of becoming a global currency, then Satoshi Nakamoto would likely be the richest person in the world and also hold a proportionately higher share of the ultimate supply of Bitcoin than something like the US government holds in gold today,"" said Yu.Yu's math works out. The US government holds the most gold reserves of any other entity in the world, at about 8,000 tonnes.That's a little over four percent of the world's total supply, less than Nakamoto's five percent stake in Bitcoin."

Instead of bouncing off that target or consolidating, the second stage engine fired up, pushing the currency as high as $19,700 on one exchange. A correction followed, pushing the price down to $13,500 on the GDAX exchange.","While the drop made some investors jittery, particularly as every news agency under the sun calls Bitcoin a bubble, investors merely had to “hodl.” The launch of CBOE’s Bitcoin futures has caused another surge in the price of the digital currency, with the futures market overheating several times and trigger circuit breakers.Some people simply cannot handle losses and are quick to cash out, but BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes is warning that this ride is only going to get more wild with with an even bigger futures market opening in a week.Futures are being hailed as the entry point for big money traditional investors to get involved with Bitcoin, but without getting their hands dirty (holding and securing the actual asset). It’s likely that there’s a great deal of Wall Street money about to enter the futures market, particularly when CME opens their futures trading on December 18. CME is significantly larger than CBOE. The current market cap of the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem exceeds $455 bln, but even that is a drop in the ocean in terms of the size of global markets. Thus, when Wall Street-type money enters the ecosystem, there is going to be some big waves.Hayes explained:“Initially, because of the way these contracts are structured, they will actually increase the volatility of Bitcoin.”Why exactly will futures cause new volatility? There are a few high-level philosophical debates going on about potential market manipulation. But the structuring of futures on such an already volatile market could see the effect magnified. Hayes noted:“Let’s take an example — the CME contract is closed over the weekend. So the price closes on Friday and reopens Sunday night just like any Globex futures contract. And it has a 20 percent upper limit and down limit, meaning the contract over a 24 hour period cannot trade 20 percent above or 20 percent below where it closed Friday at London 4pm time.“Let’s take the Bitcoin Cash situation, the price of Bitcoin dumps 30 percent between Friday and Sunday. The CME contract opens limit down, so no one can trade. From the exchanges’ point of view you could possibly have a situation where you immediately open the exchange and a certain subset of traders are instantly liquidated because they don’t have enough collateral to cover the loss on that contract.”There are also other issues that could contribute to rapid swings as well:“You also have the fact that half of the exchanges in their index are extremely illiquid and have technical problems with handling even today’s load on their exchanges. You could see a situation where a malicious actor would DDOS the exchange and move the price before one of the settlement periods to affect how the futures contract trades or how brokers have to liquidate some clients. It’s going to be interesting to see.”Indeed, the new CBOE futures market has already seen technical problems, as their website crashed on the opening of Bitcoin futures due to high demand. CBOE launched Bitcoin futures trading at 5 PM Central time and their website went down within minutes."

He began at $11,000 for the new year but then changed it to $14,000, before now settling on $20,000 for a split-adjusted price.Tom Lee, much more cautiously, said:“Bitcoin fell to $5,600 and since then rebounded. In our view, this move to $5,600 cleaned up weak hands and we no longer feel caution is warranted. … We recommend steady buying of Bitcoin at these levels.""He went on to predict 40 percent growth in seven months, but in all reality, Bitcoin fell short $200 of his $11,500 target this week.Max Keiser is another one who has made a big and bold prediction, although it is only one-tenth of McAfee as he says Bitcoin at $100,000 is an eventuality.Secret symbol № 16: v What is this?"

However, that inflation has hit almost 100 percent as it trades about $13,000 per coin.Unsurprisingly, with this latest political coup by the entrenched president, there is much speculation and worry about the already fragile and almost non-existent fiat currency system. Zimbabwe operates on bond notes linked to the US dollar.Traders have been trying to move out of monetary assets as even on the dollar there is a 62 percent premium. It has meant that investors are trapped by the currency shortages, seeking an alternative to exit the country - such as Bitcoin.Despite hitting a price of over $13,000 traders say that Bitcoin is booming as it is the strongest alternative.Zimbabwe is beginning to act like an interesting case study for what happens when a country begins to collapse around its monetary system - it is also being witnessed in Venezuela.Moving money out of Zimbabwe is starting to become impossible, and as people try and flee monetarily out of the crumbling state, they are finding refuge in Bitcoin.Soon, banks in Zimbabwe have stated that Visa debit cards would no longer be usable for international payments without prior arrangements and pre-funding with hard currency.“You will be required to make prior limit arrangements with the bank,” Stanbic said in a message to depositors last week. Econet Wireless has also stopped foreign payments on its MasterCard linked EcoCash mobile money debit card.Because of the decentralized nature of Bitcoin, there is no impact on it from this political upheaval, in fact, it is only benefiting from it. The Bitcoin premium of almost 100 percent is not because of the political issues, rather the high demand surrounding worry of collapse.Bitcoin again shows its potential and power when the banking system again shows its potential for mass collapse and hysteria."

In an interview with Swedish tech site Breakit, Oldenburg said that he had sold all of his Bitcoin and switched to Bitcoin Cash, a hard fork of Bitcoin created in August 2017.","Oldenburg justifies his actions, saying:“An investment in Bitcoin right now I would say is the most risky investment one can make. It is extremely high-risk. I’ve actually sold all of my Bitcoins recently and switched to Bitcoin Cash.”Despite the fact that Oldenburg’s company is in fact a Bitcoin wallet, the CTO says that he has become disenchanted with Bitcoin due to its high transaction fees and slow confirmation time, saying Bitcoin’s current performance is “completely unreasonable.” Increased transaction speed and lower costs are the main features supporters of Bitcoin Cash point to when comparing the two coins.Based on analysis, Bitcoin transaction fees have indeed increased from an average of 20 cents to about $15 over the course of 2017.Addressing the apparent conflict of interest between his company and his personal views, Oldenburg explained that the wallet is also moving away from Bitcoin to focus on Bitcoin Cash:“We’ve actually stopped developing new services for the old Bitcoin network now and are focusing mostly on [developing for] Bitcoin Cash. Where it costs only 10 öre [$0.12] to send [BCH] and there’s no waiting. The only backside is that it requires larger hard drives, but that’s not a problem for most people.”Oldenburg further argued that the problems with Bitcoin transactions emerge during the recording of the transactions on the Blockchain. He claimed that the bottleneck on the Blockchain results in a highly risky and illiquid digital currency:“There's only a limited amount of transactions per second you can make in the Bitcoin network, which in part depends on the ‘block size’ of the memory that store the transactions on the Blockchain. This bottleneck makes for a highly risky and illiquid cryptocurrency…the old Bitcoin network is as good as unusable.”The price of Bitcoin, however, continues to grow and has already breached the $20,000 level this week. It is currently trading at around $18,000 as of press time."

Bitcoin one. Comparing the cryptocurrency market cap and the money ...","Dec 4, 2017","The same talk of Bitcoin being in a bubble has been dogging it since late 2013, and many time before and after that. The talk remains today as Bitcoin continues to smash barrier leaving the pessimists asking: ‘When will we hear the pop?’","Yet, Bubble or not, Bitcoin seems unperturbed about the negative press, only focusing on the huge adoption and the increase in promising market conditions. It is, however, even on the upswings, a scary ride.It is probably prudent to understand what would happen if there was a catastrophic failure and the Bitcoin market did pop like all the others it has been compared to.The obvious starting point would be to discuss what would happen to all those who invested loads of money into Bitcoin if it collapsed. That is simple though, they would lose money. It is more interesting to examine the effect on the global economy of this revolutionary monetary system.In all honesty, if Bitcoin was wiped from the face of the earth, the global economy would barely even know it had gone. Bitcoin is minuscule in comparison to some of the other big market players out there. The residential real estate market is over 500 times bigger than the Bitcoin one.Comparing the cryptocurrency market cap and the money involved - just over $350 bln - to the money that was in the dotcom bubble, it is nearly negligible.Adrian Lee, a senior lecturer in finance at the University of Technology in Sydney, explains in an Australian example:""So, it wouldn't affect the Australian dollar I'd say because nobody really uses it at the moment. If you think about it, there's trillions of trading in the Australian dollar whereas Bitcoin is at most worth $200 bln at total, so it's hardly anything compared to the trillions in foreign exchange.”Additionally, lessons seemed to have been learned in the property market bust of 2008, or it may be that Bitcoin is a different asset, but it is unlikely that there is much borrowing going on to buy Bitcoin.RMIT Professor of Economics Jason Potts adds:""There's very little evidence of anyone borrowing money to buy cryptocurrency and if I was a bank or a lender, there's no way I would loan out money to do that.""Bitcoin’s bigger scope of effect, even for the naysayers, is not that grand. Many are calling Bitcoin a bubble because of its size, and the speed of its adoption. But as expressed earlier, Bitcoin is tint, and it is still in the early adoption phase.Potts goes on the explain why Bitcoin collapsing would not even scratch any of the global markets or lead to a bleed which would have damaging repercussions. At the same time, he is essentially confirming Bitcoin is too small, and too young, to be a bubble.Potts uses the analogy of Bitcoin being like email in 1994, indicating its early adoption phase, he then goes on to explain:  ""The sort of people who would hold superannuation funds … they're not in this market and might not be for some time,"" he said.That would limit the fallout to the wider economy in a worst-case scenario. ""If it crashed, it would only largely be those people who speculate on it, maybe people who use Bitcoin and maybe the exchanges may lose money. But then again the exchanges don't require much overhead to run it, so if it fell they'd still be Okay,"" Mr. Lee chimed in.Thus, it seems clear that because Bitcoin collapsing cannot have any effect on the global market, it is too small to even collapse. The effect of Bitcoin’s demise would only affect those who have sunk money into it - a bit like a business venture. But when a business venture fails, it is not seen as a bubble, pop; it is something different.Perhaps the talk of bubbles needs to be left for now, while Bitcoin tries to catch up to markets that have, and can, pop, like the real estate market. That is not to say Bitcoin can’t collapse - but can it pop, not likely."

He bases this prediction on the steady increase of Bitcoin’s 200 day moving average. Mayer is extrapolating the rise of the 200 day moving average, assuming it will reach $5,767 by February. If this is the case, he asserts that a per-coin value of 4.75 times the moving average, or $27,395, would be a “fair” price.","A good month of $BTC consolidation. 200 day moving average rising well. Next six months should be very interesting & fun. LedgerX! #NO2X ? ? pic.twitter.com/Q1n3ns1myuTrace Mayer, J.D., was one of the “first popular bloggers to publicly recommend Blockchain technology” according to his website. At the time, Mayer recommended that his followers purchase Bitcoin, the price per coin was just $0.25.Like most Bitcoin early adopters, Mayer is extremely wealthy, having recently challenged Roger Ver to a 25,000 BTC wager. There are very few people in the world with enough juice to make $121 mln bets. In addition to his early adoption and recommendation of Bitcoin, Mayer provided seed money for Kraken, BitPay, and Armory.On his website, Mayer describes himself as:“An entrepreneur, investor, journalist, monetary scientist and ardent defender of the freedom of speech. Trace Mayer holds degrees in accounting and law. He studied Austrian economics focusing on Murray Rothbard and Ludwig von Mises.”Mayer has long been concerned with privacy and regulation, fearing that IRS action and AML/KYC laws could hamper growth and incentivize bad behavior.Technical analysis is the art of trying to determine the future price movement of an asset based on its history. While many derisively claim that it’s merely a pseudoscience, others believe that technical analysis has its roots in human psychology. Analysts are clear to point out that their work is based on probability, thus it’s possible to say that the price will likely go up or down, but the unpredictability of the markets keeps it from being a certainty.According to Investopedia, a moving average is:“A simple technical analysis tool that smooths out price data by creating a constantly updated average price...A moving average can help cut down the amount of ‘noise’ on a price chart...or act as support or resistance.”The 200 day moving average that Mayer cites is simply the average price of Bitcoin over the last 200 days. Every day, the oldest day’s data is removed, the most recent day’s closing price is added, and the metric is recalculated. Because the 200 day moving average is weighted with such old price data, in a bull market it lags significantly behind the current price. The measure’s purpose is to show the general trend of price movement.In Bitcoin’s case, the 200 day moving average continues to rise, indicating that we remain in a bull market (momentum is on the side of the bulls). Should the moving average falter, that would be a sign of weakness and possible reversal. The current price should remain within a certain range of the moving average. If the price goes too far above it, the gains are likely unsustainable.Mayer is predicting that the 200 day moving average will continue to rise, and that Bitcoin will remain a reasonable level above the measure. Only time will tell if Mayer is right or wrong, but history certainly seems to be on his side. After all, I wouldn’t want to bet against a guy who has made at least $120 mln off Bitcoin’s growth."

one. It takes the strengths of each and leaves the weaknesses behind.","Oct 13, 2017","Digital currency could quite possibly be transformative, providing a paradigm shift in the world’s interactions with money and finance. As Jihan Wu, CEO of Bitmain, recently blogged:","“[Bitcoin] essentially rolls gold, cash, and our credit card system into one. It takes the strengths of each and leaves the weaknesses behind. It has the limited supply quality of gold, but can be used to purchase everyday items. It has the speed of a credit card, but respects and protects your privacy. Transactions are settled instantly like cash, but are recorded on a public ledger.”Bitcoin and other digital currencies are seriously lacking in one vital area: accessibility. It’s prohibitively difficult for new users to obtain cryptocurrency. An individual who wants to obtain a small amount of Bitcoin would probably find even the easiest route to be rather challenging.Setting up a Coinbase account would be relatively simple in itself, but then the person must link either a credit card or bank account. Depending on several factors, the purchase may be instant or may require several days for an ACH transaction to be processed. Our new user now owns some shiny new Bitcoin...and probably has no clue what to do next.Buying larger amounts of Bitcoin is even more difficult, requiring users to go through an extensive process to comply with “Know Your Customer” (KYC) and “Anti-Money Laundering” (AML) laws. This involves submitting numerous personal documents such as driver's licenses and utility bills, then filling out a long questionnaire and awaiting approval. Such users must then figure out what wallet they want to store their currency in, and wrestle with issues such as two-factor authentication and the like.For users wanting to purchase altcoins (outside of Ethereum and Litecoin), they must do all of the above, then transfer their Bitcoin to another exchange. There they will likely repeat the same KYC/AML process, and only then will they be allowed to trade their Bitcoin for their favorite altcoin.Selling one’s digital currency for fiat is even more difficult, as doing so nearly always requires AML/KYC verification and additional hoops to jump through. Very few retailers accept even Bitcoin, much less less-known altcoins, so using one’s digital currency to directly purchase product is prohibitively difficult.Over the past couple of years, several solutions to this vexing difficulty have been attempted. The first such attempt was the creation of the Bitcoin ATM. This machine is similar to the bank ATM that we are all familiar with. A user inserts some cash and receives a printed paper wallet which holds their new Bitcoin purchase.Bitcoin ATMs are expensive, however, and are only suitable for areas with high levels of foot traffic, a sophisticated tech-savvy user base, and reliable Internet access. In some jurisdictions, AML/KYC questionnaires are still required, and many ATMs are merely one-way, as they lack the ability to convert Bitcoin to cash. Thus it remains even more difficult to get fiat money out of cryptocurrency than into it.Recently another solution has emerged: the Bitcoin debit card. Users deposit Bitcoin in the debit card provider’s web wallet, and they receive an ordinary looking Visa card. When the swipe the card at a retailer’s point of sale, the appropriate amount of Bitcoin in their wallet is immediately sold, converted to cash, and then the cash is sent to the retailer as payment. This all happens in seconds, allowing the transaction to be completed as quickly and seamlessly as an ordinary debit card transaction.While many digital currencies focus on more arcane areas such as smart contracts, tokenization, or the like, the digital currency Dash has always focused on payments. The name Dash is itself a portmanteau of the words “digital cash.” Founded by Evan Duffield in 2014, Dash aims to promote faster transactions with its InstantSend technology. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, that can take an hour or more to fully confirm, Dash’s InstantSend transactions are fully confirmed and irreversible in just four seconds.Such speed would make Dash highly useful in physical stores, as there is no need to wait minutes or hours before a transaction clears. However, as with all digital currencies, direct acceptance of Dash at retailers has lagged behind. Since Dash is a payments-oriented digital currency, Dash debit cards seemed like a logical next step.Bitcoin pioneer and early investor Charlie Shrem came to the Dash community and asked for funding from Dash’s treasury system to fund development of a Dash-branded debit card in March 2017. He received funding directly from the network and began work on the project, but has not yet released the card.Shortly after Shrem made his proposal and received funding, Dr. Julian Hosp of TenX requested funding to integrate Dash into their Bitcoin-only debit card. His proposal was approved by the Dash network and was funded directly by the Blockchain. That integration was completed in late-April.At September’s Dash Conference 2017, the Dash team announced an integration with a Bitcoin debit card provider that will allow Dash to be used at any retailer that accepts Visa, both in-store and online. This effectively allows Dash to be spent at over 40 million merchants worldwide. Also, owners of Dash will be able to withdraw their funds, in cash, at any ATM in 210 countries around the world.More work still needs to be done in order for digital currency to truly reach the masses, but cryptocurrency debit cards are a crucial early step. At the same time, a number of industry leaders are working with the Blockchain Caucus in Congress to cut through the red tape and standardize regulation across the US.Dash and other cryptocurrencies continue to work on making themselves more accessible to ordinary people. At present, Dash’s development team is working on an update to their software called Dash Evolution. The goal of Evolution is to make using Dash so easy “even your grandmother can figure it out.”Dash’s previously mentioned treasury system uses a portion of the block rewards to fund development of the project and its ecosystem, making it the first self-funded digital currency. Each month, 6,650 DASH are available to fund Dash’s development team and other projects approved by the Dash community. At current prices, that equates to an annual development budget in excess of $23 mln."

It should be applauded because they’ve been horribly bad actors. We need to get rid of them and let Bitcoin transform our world.”His statements are nothing short of revolutionary as investors pile into multiple cryptocurrencies. While the likes of renowned stock picker Ronnie Moas advocates diversification of investments in multiple virtual currencies, Keiser believes Bitcoin will have no rival in the foreseeable future.As the cryptocurrency market capitalization hits the $300 bln mark, Keiser suggested that major financial institutions will step away from conventional markets which could lead to an economic crash.“That’s something that no central bank or country will be able to stop, and it’s becoming a real scenario, a real threat.”As the Bitcoin train continues to hurtle down the tracks, the major question is when will it slow down?Pundits have thrown around a number of predictions, but Keiser believes Bitcoin will only see a major price correction around the $25,000 mark. He also cautioned investors not to lose their heads and panic buy or sell.“Don’t just buy a Bitcoin without knowing about it first. That way, when a correction does come and it inevitably will, you have some intellectual foundation to keep you in the game and to not panic sell.

The UK market accounts for a small fraction of that, less than one percent of the global Bitcoin market.A Zerohedge report released on Dec. 3 claimed that a sudden Bitcoin price plunge from $12,000 to $10,600 occurred because the UK government released its plans to regulate Bitcoin exchanges and impose strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies.However, while the report was not entirely inaccurate given that the Bitcoin price did experience a minor correction, it was highly unlikely that the UK government’s announcement on a new Bitcoin regulation caused the price of Bitcoin to plunge. It was more likely that the market briefly panicked, given that Bitcoin price increased exponentially over the past two weeks, without several major corrections.More importantly, Bitcoin price was actually up five percent, and hence a “plunge” in value did not occur. Also, it is not possible for the UK Bitcoin market to trigger a plunge or any type of major decline in Bitcoin price because it only accounts for less than one percent of the global market. A small fraction of any market cannot force it to plunge in value.Zerohedge reports #bitcoin price suddenly ""plunged"" because UK cracked down on it.

1. Bitcoin price IS UP 5% in the past 24 hours. ($11,325)
2. Europe's bitcoin market share is 7.5%. UK's market share is a fraction of that.
3. Less than 1% of the market can't force a ""plunge.""Another report from a major news publication The Street claimed that Bitcoin price decreased from $11,000 to $9,500 because a former European Central Bank official called Bitcoin a scam. However, it is evident that the short-term price trend of Bitcoin was not affected by a statement of a former ECB official.  It was rather a correction after Bitcoin price achieved a new all-time high. Thus, the Bitcoin market was merely stabilizing after a spike in volume and demand.The fundamental issue with the approach of mainstream media is that the media outlets tend to explain every price movement of Bitcoin with the same method of evaluating the price trend of stocks.This approach is used in providing coverage on Bitcoin for the vast majority of news publications --apart from a select few such as Forbes that have created cryptocurrency market-specific departments.  The Bitcoin market has already evolved into a nearly $200 bln market. While the value of Bitcoin is often moved or influenced by events within the sector, most of the time, Bitcoin price is unaffected by commentary from the traditional finance industry.Secret symbol № 25: 2 What is this?"

Cuban’s own perspective on Bitcoin has undergone a metamorphosis this year. Despite considering its price as a bubble, the billionaire subsequently invested in both an ICO and a dedicated cryptocurrency hedge fund.While some skepticism remains, Cuban’s 10 percent figure is still higher than that advised by fellow investor Fred Wilson, who last week suggested a maximum of three to five percent crypto holdings for the “average” investor.“I think that’s likely at the high end of what the average person should have, but I also think it’s not a ridiculous number for the average person to have,” he said discussing the topic.“Many endowments, pension funds, etc allocate three to five percent of their portfolio to venture capital.

But content producers and rights holders may soon be embedding hidden Bitcoin bounties on to their work to help lead authorities to the pirates spreading it illegally.,"Anonymously claiming a hidden Bitcoin wallet embedded on a piece of media will firstly reward the so-called snitch, but also send an alert that information has been pirated and illegally shared.It is a constant battle for right holders to maintain the control of their work, as blocking and closing down illegal websites is becoming more and more futile.It has seen a tech company based in South Africa called Custos Media Technologies take a different approach.Their idea is that a hidden watermark, which contains a small amount of Bitcoin, can be placed on media files like movies or ebooks. If you’re the first person to find the watermark, you can claim the Bitcoin prize and in doing so will alert Custos.“Each watermark contains a Bitcoin wallet, with a reward for anyone who anonymously claims it once the media has passed out of the control of the original recipient,” the company says.“Media downloaders who want to search for such rewards can do so anonymously, from anywhere in the world. The moment a bounty is claimed — and by the nature of cryptocurrencies, this can only happen once — the transaction reflects on the Blockchain, and Custos notifies the media provider of the incident.”This idea set out by Custos again shows how Blockchain technology’s scope is increasing and finding more and more uses.In this case, as a bounty, the Blockchain is effective in delivering the bounty as the pirated software is found and reported.The system relies on a peer-to-peer architecture which allows users to transact directly without needing an intermediary and all transactions are recorded in a digital ledger that can’t be altered.Of course, the system also allows those doing the reporting to remain anonymous."

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.","* BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.Though the stock markets around the world are in a bull run, their returns pale in comparison to the cryptocurrencies. Hence, wealth managers will soon have to start investing a portion of their assets in digital currencies.In that regard, a French asset management company TOBAM has announced the creation of a Bitcoin mutual fund, which will help its clients gain exposure to Bitcoins.Even JPMorgan Chase, whose CEO Jamie Dimon has been critical of Bitcoin is likely to offer its clients access to Bitcoin futures.While many investors like Mike Novogratz and Ronnie Moas continue to be bullish on Bitcoin, commodity guru Jim Rogers has warned of a bubble. Let’s study the charts to find out if we can spot a trade.Yesterday, though the bears attempted to break the momentum in Bitcoin, their endeavor was met with strong buying by the bulls at lower levels.   The digital currency has closed above the $8,000 levels for the past two days. This shows that the momentum is intact and buyers are willing to step in on every dip. However, the bullish momentum will halt if the bears manage to push Bitcoin below $7,700 levels.On the other hand, a breakout above the ascending channel will be bullish for the cryptocurrency. I anticipate a move to $9,969 if Bitcoin sustains above $8,500 levels. However, it is unlikely to be a straight dash towards the target. Whole numbers, usually, act as a resistance; hence, I expect a hurdle at $9,000.For any fresh trades, the risk to reward ratio is not favorable, as the stop loss is deep. Therefore, I am not suggesting any long positions at the current levels.For the past three days, Ethereum has been facing resistance at the downtrend line of the symmetrical triangle.  If the digital currency can breakout and close above this resistance line, it will become positive.Its immediate targets are $395 and $421. However, I anticipate a breakout of both these overhead resistances. Hence, I suggest holding on to the 50 percent open positions initiated back at $315 levels.Our present stop loss is way back at $315. Let’s protect some of the paper profits. You might want to raise the stop loss on the existing position to $330, which is just below the 20-day EMA.After trading in a tight range for the past three days, Bitcoin Cash is trying to resume its uptrend. It has broken out of the small downtrend line, which is a bullish development. Traders can initiate long positions at $1,360 levels and keep a stop loss of $1,100.I expect the traders who missed out on the previous rally to buy, once the uptrend resumes. There is a small resistance at $1,400 and another one at $1,549. However, I expect Bitcoin Cash to breakout of these resistances and rally towards $1,825 and $2,054.9, which are 50 percent and 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the fall from $2,799 to $851.12.Don’t initiate the long positions at lower levels because a failure to sustain above the downtrend line will indicate selling at higher levels. Therefore, please wait and buy at the suggested levels. This is a risky trade, hence, please keep the allocation size only about 50 percent of the usual.The trade on Ripple is live from Nov. 16 at a buy price of $0.22713. I had expected the digital currency to pick up momentum once it crossed above the downtrend line and both the moving averages.However, it is struggling to move above $0.245 levels. A correction from the current levels can push the cryptocurrency back to $0.22, which is a strong support.On the other hand, if it can rally above $0.245 levels within a day or two, it is likely to rise towards $0.30, which is a good place to lock in at least 50 percent profits.On the previous two instances, the virtual currency faced considerable selling at $0.3 levels. Generally, it is seen that the breakout happens on the third attempt. Hence, I believe in keeping 50 percent long positions with a trailing stop loss. A breakout above $0.3 can propel Ripple towards the lifetime highs.   Our traders are carrying long positions from $60.4 levels. I had suggested booking 50 percent profits at $71 and holding the remaining positions with stops at breakeven. However, for the past five days, the digital currency is finding it difficult to breakout of $72.  It is facing selling at the upper end of a larger range. If Litecoin doesn’t breakout of this overhead resistance soon, it will start a correction. Therefore, stops on the remaining positions can be raised to $64. Let’s at least protect partial paper profits.However, if the digital currency breaks out and closes above $72, a move to $82 or even to the lifetime highs is possible."

Is high volatility such a bad thing for Bitcoin after all?","One reason why traditional investors have shunned Bitcoin is that its price has swung from one extreme to another. Its price increased from around $1,000 at the beginning of the year to a peak of over $5,000 in September 2017 (gain of +400 percent), before crashing to a low of $3,000 (-40 percent from its peak). Even this represents an improvement from the initial days when Bitcoin price crashed from $32 to $2 in 2011 (a drop of 94 percent). There have been periods of low volatility, but these have been few and far between. Bitcoin may be called digital gold, but in terms of volatility, it looks more like stock markets on steroids.For day traders and short-term investors, volatility presents an opportunity for making profits. By correctly predicting the short-term trends in Bitcoin, traders can make substantial profits; much more than investors who have a buy-and-hold strategy.Highly volatile markets also create demand for secondary derivative products like options.As the cryptocurrency market develops, we could see increased trading of derivative products rather than actual trading of Bitcoin.As per the London Bullion Markets Association, it is estimated that 95 percent of gold trading in London is in unallocated metal (which is not settled). Bitcoin is still in its infancy, but as the market develops we could see the same trading characteristics in Bitcoin as well.Merchants, no matter how tech-savvy they are, hesitate to accept Bitcoins for their goods and services. Their core competence lies in providing goods and services, not in managing Bitcoin's volatility.They work on thin margins and hate even the one to two percent transaction fees imposed by credit card companies.The Bitcoin price can move substantially between the time they accept Bitcoins from customers, and they sell these Bitcoins in exchange for their local currency. This price movement can wipe out their entire profitability.This is the reason why most merchants accept Bitcoin only through payment processors like Coinbase, which removes the risk associated with holding Bitcoins. In the end, merchants have to pay their bills using fiat currencies, not Bitcoin.Bitcoin is a relatively new asset class. Although the level of awareness about Bitcoin among the general population has increased, only a small proportion of them hold significant amount of Bitcoins.Moreover, institutional investors have largely avoided Bitcoin, given its unregulated nature and the risks associated with it.As Bitcoin adoption increases and demand increases, its price can move up rapidly.Similarly, when there is negative news about Bitcoin, like the Chinese shutting down cryptocurrency exchanges, some of the holders of Bitcoin will sell and its price can crash rapidly.Until the holding of Bitcoin becomes widely distributed and its liquidity improves substantially, we will see substantial volatility in Bitcoin price."

Could a crypto winter be in the offing?","A year after the block reward halving, with media buzzing about Bitcoin, and a multifold increase in price - this is not just a description of 2017 but also perfectly fits 2013. After the block reward halving in 2012, the price of Bitcoin shot up during the following year. The price increased from around $13 at the starting of 2013 to a peak of over $1200.The reasons for this jump are manifold (including the bots  - Willie and Markus, which bought Bitcoins on Mt. Gox), but the almost 100 fold increase in price was unprecedented. The 500% increase in price of Bitcoin in 2017 appears tame in comparison. Of course, the base effect does make such 100 fold increases in price almost impossible now, with Bitcoin's market capitalization crossing $100 Bn.When comparisons to 2013 are made, the common refrain is “this time is different.” There is increased Bitcoin adoption, there is no Mt. Gox, the ecosystem is better developed, institutional money is coming in and so on. If time has taught us one thing, it is that history usually repeats itself. Or rather, as Mark Twain said, “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.”A 500% increase in price in just a year is the sign of a bubble building up. There has been no catalyst driving the growth and a fear-of-missing-out mentality seems to be at play. Newbies are being attracted to Bitcoin (and ICOs) driven by the promise of massive gains. They believe that ""this time is different.""While traditional economists believe that the market is made up of rational investors, behavioural economists believe otherwise. People who have made windfall profits take higher risks than they normally would. This is similar to gamblers taking higher risks after winning, believing that they are playing with ""house money.""With Bitcoin's rapid rise in price this year, a lot of investors have seen their portfolio appreciate rapidly in price. Rather than evaluating whether Bitcoin is overvalued and it is time to sell, these investors may be willing to hold longer because of their windfall profits.The crash of 2013 was the first long term downtrend in Bitcoin's price. Although there were previous crashes with higher percentage drops (from $32 to $2), this was the first time that the price didn't recover quickly. Bitcoin's price had risen during every calendar year until 2013 and people believed the price would recover in 2014.This was not to be. It would take more than three years for the price to cross the $1200 levels attained in November 2013. This year has been extremely strong so far, but a crash would be terribly painful. A lot of recent cryptocurrency converts could get hurt and it could take even longer to recover this time."

In 2008, Epstein was convicted of soliciting an underage girl for prostitution, for which he served 13 months in prison.","Epstein excelled at finding hidden value for his clients and himself, identifying anomalies in the market, and using arbitrage to profit from them. He has now identified Bitcoin as another potential opportunity.There are a lot of Wall Street banks, bankers and investors who are sharing their opinion on the digital currency, some more politely than others. Jamie Dimon has called it a fraud, and on the other side, there are rumours that Goldman Sachs will begin direct Bitcoin trading.However, these opinions are so polarised that they are either so deep in one camp or another that they seem to have hidden agendas.""Epstein is the Brooklyn-born financier who in 1982 formed J. Epstein & Co., the money management firm that famously held a secret client list containing only the names of people worth $1 bln or more.""In 1976, Epstein started work as an options trader at Bear Stearns, where he advised high-net-worth clients on tax strategies.In 1980 Epstein became a partner at Bear Stearns. The International Business Times reported that papers filed in a 2006 lawsuit alleged that Epstein installed concealed cameras in numerous places on his property to record sexual activity with underage girls by prominent people for criminal purposes such as blackmail. Epstein allegedly ""loaned"" girls to powerful people to ingratiate himself with them and also to gain possible blackmail information. In 2015, evidence came to light that one of the powerful men at Epstein's mansion may have been Prince Andrew of the UK.In 2008, after Epstein pleaded guilty to a single state charge of soliciting prostitution from girls as young as 14, he was sentenced to 18 months in prison. At release, he was registered in New York State as a level three (high risk of re-offense) sex offender, a lifelong designation.As not only a sex offender but also a former math teacher, Epstein appreciates the security that comes from the mathematical work that goes into Bitcoin’s Blockchain.As a former math teacher, Epstein appreciates the security that comes from the mathematical work that goes into Bitcoin’s Blockchain.Counterfeiting is a major problem with conventional money but because each Bitcoin has a unique identifier, and any coins numbered outside a certain range are fake — the whole system is mathematically controlled.While there is no formal or legal definition of what a currency actually is, Epstein does not think Bitcoin can be classified as one anyway.Traditional currency is money that has a sovereign guarantee behind it, a governmental promise that the value is secure. But because Bitcoin is backed by technology, it misses that mark.However, he adds that it works as a store of value:“When we talk about gold as a store of value that just means a lot of people agree to pay the same price for one ounce of gold. In 2017, enough people agree on the value of bitcoin that it can serve the same purpose. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins, but this limit comes from computer code, not by how many bitcoins are left to remove from the earth. If we learn tomorrow that half of Montana contained a secret cache of gold, the value of gold would decrease instantly. Bitcoin doesn’t have this problem.”Finally, the billionaire sees Bitcoin as a powerful catalyst that can start to change the landscape of business and finance.Terms such as currency, money, wealth, value and even cost need to be updated and revisited. He believes it is Bitcoin that can make people rethink these ideas."

Through the years, and changes in monetary policies, even the inflation of currencies, gold has remained steady.","However, there’s a new kid on the block when it comes to a store of wealth, especially one that is unmatched by any centralized authority. Bitcoin has been ruling the roost when it comes to asset growth that is similar to gold.Whenever there is global turmoil or geopolitical fears take center stage, an asset like gold is the first to rise, as people appreciate that it is not tied to any of the goings on. Along with gold price, the VIX index also rises.The VIX measures volatility and is also known as the fear index. It’s relationship with gold still exists, but there is a much stronger correlation with Bitcoin as the digital currency benefits far more from global turmoil.Since May 1, we have had four noticeable increases in volatility.  Bitcoin responded much more acutely than gold did to each of those rises.  Now, almost six months later, Bitcoin is up over 15.5 percent while gold is only up 1.6 percent.There are a few things to ponder as to why gold, as a mature asset, is losing its battle as a safe store of wealth when things go wrong. It has never let anyone down, yet Bitcoin, still very new and unprecedented, is streaks ahead in this race.It could be that it is simply that much more accessible. People have a much easier time acquiring Bitcoin, as well as the types of people buying Bitcoin probably would not know where to even start buying Gold.Cryptocurrencies are also not burdened by borders or of course physical locality, thus they again are that much more accessible. Being entirely digital, there is none of the hassle that comes with a physical store of wealth.Additionally, while Gold has stood the test of time, and has not had much revolutionary competition, there’s a feeling that digital currencies are here to take its place, rather than to live alongside it.However, one of the key reasons for cryptocurrency leading the race against gold is that its adoption is spreading like wildfire. Gold has built its market and essentially stagnated on it, while the Bitcoin hype train keeps steaming on.Those who want to own gold already own it, thus limiting new flows, while Bitcoin is still a nascent 'product' to be used as a potential hedge and an exciting and accessible asset."

They began their life in the shadow of the dark web and for that reason picked up a reputation that has stuck to this day.However, cryptocurrencies and their inherent makeup are designed to be trustless and ultimately immutable and unhackable. They are decentralized, they are reliant on a tamper-proof public ledger and they are transparent.However, it is not the Blockchain or the Bitcoin that is the issue; it is people taking advantage of the people and the ecosystem in which they operate. Thus, it takes a little common-sense, and a few simple measure to stay safe.One of the most foolproof ways to keep digital currencies safe is to take it off the grid and remove it from the clutches of potential hackers and thieves. Hardware wallets are the answer to this.A hardware wallet is essentially a USB stick that stores private keys and digital currency on a physical drive that is disconnected from the Internet. It is a good idea to store any significant amount of digital currency on one of these.Storing a large amount of coins on the public-facing Internet, especially on exchanges which are honeypots for hackers, is simply inviting an attack. The only issue a hardware wallet has is that it can be damaged or lost, but at least that cannot be blamed on anyone else but yourself.Another downside to keeping all your hard earned coins on a hardware wallet is that it essentially becomes a vault, and thus if you are looking to spend digital currency on small transactions, it becomes a chore.Thus, it is prudent to store the majority of your coins on cold storage, but also wise to keep a small amount, that you’d be willing to lose on an online wallet.You can, of course, use wallets that are are interoperable with popular hardware wallets can make your setup more seamless.When it does come to using your online wallet though, one of the biggest rules is to try and keep your private key. However, some of the bigger and more popular exchanges and wallets don’t allow this.Another way to avoid losing your investment is to not invest poorly. There are hundreds of new ICOs popping up all the time, in an attempt to try and temp more investors, but a large majority of them are gimmicky or even fake.The best example of this is OneCoin which markets itself as a competitor for Bitcoin, attacking $350 mln in investment, but it turned out to be a Ponzi scheme.Just like anything, especially when it comes to being smart about money, it is important to use common sense and to do the basics right.""We encourage all customers to take a few foundational, and free, actions to put them on a much more stable security footing,"" says Philip Martin, director of security at the cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase. ""Use a password manager, use two-factor authentication, leverage enhanced security protocols for your email address."""

The latest trojan, Cryptoshuffler, has managed to steal Bitcoins worth $150,000 so far.","The modus operandi of CryptoShuffler is very simple - It strikes when a user copies a Bitcoin address onto the clipboard, presumably to paste it in the destination address of his wallet and send across Bitcoins. Cryptoshuffler then replaces the address in the clipboard with an address owned by the malware creator. Unless a user notices that the address he has pasted is different, the funds will be transferred to the malware creator. Given Bitcoin transactions' irrevocable nature, the user has no way to retrieve his Bitcoins once the transaction is confirmed.The malware targets not only Bitcoin users, but the users of other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, ZCash, Monero, Dash and Dogecoin. The Bitcoin address linked to Cryptoshuffler has received 23 Bitcoins so far, valued currently at $150,000. The Trojan has been active for over a year, with the first reported Bitcoin transaction to the malware creator's address occurring in September 2016. After a brief lull in its activity, the number of affected transactions has increased in the last few months.Sergey Yunakovsky, malware analyst at Kaspersky Lab, writes about Cryptoshuffler“Cryptocurrency is not a far-off technology anymore. Lately, we have observed an increase in malware attacks targeting different types of cryptocurrencies and we expect this trend to continue.”Clipboard hijacking is not new - trojans have been known to repeat the same modus operandi with bank accounts. However, CryptoShuffler seems to have been especially successful using this old strategy, lurking in the background of various computers.“The malware described is a perfect example of a “rational” gain. The scheme of its operation is simple and effective: no access to pools, no network interaction, and no suspicious processor load.”The recent success of CryptoShuffler has shown that there are no shortcuts when taking care of computer security. Do not install any software from untrusted sources. If software is digitally signed, ensure that you verify the signature before installing it. Keep your antivirus updated and a firewall in place. Store most of your cryptocurrencies in a cold wallet or a wallet which requires two factor authentication. Always be alert when sending Bitcoins. Small precautions taken can go a long way in safeguarding your cryptocurrencies."

While Westerners eye the sensational $10,000 level, Japan has seen their biggest psychological price barrier shattered. This is fitting, since there’s reason to believe that Japan started the massive Bitcoin rally to begin with.","Granted, Bitcoin’s price has been steadily rising since the fall of 2016, but April’s news that Japan had formally recognized Bitcoin as a legal currency certainly helped propel the currency to new heights. By exempting the currency from an 8% consumption tax, Japan further increased citizens’ desire to own Bitcoin.Bitcoin’s rising price has been attributed to increasing adoption and continuing integration into mainstream financial markets. In Japan, good news continues to come to the fore, with major conglomerates becoming involved with Bitcoin, and trading volume from shuttered Chinese exchanges coming to Japan’s markets due to favorable regulations.In fact, China’s ban on Bitcoin exchanges pushed Japan to the forefront of the world’s Bitcoin markets. Beginning in September, and continuing to the present time, the majority of Bitcoin trading has been denominated in Japanese yen. At press time, the yen is responsible for an impressive 59.6% of all Bitcoin trades worldwide.While China dominated the Bitcoin trade for years, it’s clear that the crown has passed to the island nation of Japan. What happens on Japanese markets has powerful ripple effects throughout the global Bitcoin economy. Japan’s continued bullishness, indicated by Bitcoin’s current price of 1,084,000 yen, makes an assault on the West’s $10,000 level nearly inevitable."

It claims to have raised $10 mln in funds, accepts cryptocurrencies and is planning an ICO.","A self-drive rental firm in India, Drivezy, has raised $10 mln in a combination of debt and equity from American and Japanese investors, including Axan Partners that have invested $5 mln for an equity stake in the company.The company has a fleet of over 1300 vehicles in four cities in India.A consortium of Indian banks and financial companies have subscribed to $5 mln of debt. The company is also coming out with an ICO, to raise 17,625 ETH (~$5 mln).  
The CEO and Co-founder of Drivezy, Ashwarya Pratap Singh, said:""Considering the rising cost of important assets and resources such as housing and transportation, I believe the future is a shared one. With the growing popularity of Bitcoin in India, we feel that this is the right time to open ourselves up to alternative means in the sharing economy. This ICO is a part of our vision to leverage the power of Blockchain to build an open, secure and transparent technology to globalize the Indian car sharing marketplace.""An Indian firm planning an ICO raises several questions, primarily because cryptocurrencies operate in a grey area in India. Unlike regulators in the US, China or even Gibraltar, regulators in India have remained largely silent. So it comes as no surprise that the ICO of Drivezy will be launched in Japan and open to accredited investors only. That way, Drivezy can stay clear in case Indian regulators come out with sweeping regulations against crypto tokens in India.One of the biggest problems with merchants accepting Bitcoin is the question of its volatile price. Drivezy has tied up with a payment processor, Unocoin, to manage this risk. While its customers might pay in Bitcoin, Drivezy receives the rupee value of those Bitcoins and is protected from volatility. This also means that if you have to get a refund, the amount of Bitcoins might be less/more than the Bitcoins you paid initially, depending on which way the price of Bitcoin has moved.Smaller firms like Drivezy have much more flexibility to take decisions like accepting cryptocurrencies for payment. For large companies like Uber operating in multiple jurisdictions, the decision is seen to be more difficult.They have to ensure that they have a comprehensive policy about accepting cryptocurrencies and ensure that regulators are on board.The incremental benefits of accepting Bitcoin are also smaller for companies like Uber, as their existing customer base is large, and cryptocurrency users are a niche community.In spite of having a Bitcoin-friendly CEO, Uber has bigger problems to worry about, including loss of its London licence and a culture which supported gender discrimination and sexual harassment."

According to him, there is a future for digital currencies, but he thinks it’s essential for digital coins to get “some sort of backing” by central governments.In his opinion, a central bank will sooner or later introduce their own cryptocurrency, which will be more sustainable.“There will be a time when everybody is freaking out about Bitcoin and dumps it and who knows what’s going to happen?”In a situation like that there’s no buffer, for example the Federal Reserve, to cushion the blow.He issued a final warning to investors and said, “Be very careful not to invest a lot of money into something that could vanish very quickly.”"

Good",https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-law-enforcement-can-investigate-bitcoin-related-crimes-and-why-thats-good,"How Law Enforcement Can Investigate Bitcoin Related Crimes And Why That's 
Good. Blockchain makes it both easier and harder for law ...","Oct 5, 2017",Bitcoin is just the first app we are using when dealing with the Blockchain. Soon we will see more ways people can squeeze the most out of Blockchain.,"Back in the 90s when the Internet was first becoming profit-oriented, no one would possibly have imagined that the Internet would breed Facebook, Google, Uber, online streaming, etc. This is where we are with the Blockchain now. There exists a whole world of opportunities out there.In order to realize that potential, it’s critical that law enforcement has the ability to chase down the individuals who use the Blockchain for unrighteous things. We need to craft a Blockchain that is secure for legal commerce and is advantageous to everybody except for criminals.Law enforcement agencies have a lengthy history of changing their procedures to pursue criminals who make use of the latest technology to commit crimes. The law has always found a way to evolve to address new tech challenges. There is no reason to expect that law enforcement won’t be able to get a handle on Blockchain.With Blockchain still being in the embryonic stage, we have the opportunity to make it much easier for law enforcement to understand. At the same time, we need to implement improvements to make the Blockchain safer for commerce while making it harder for criminals to use.It’s tough to identify a user from a Bitcoin address. When investigating cybercrime, prosecutors are looking for ways to isolate and connect a certain IP or MAC address, or an email address, to a particular person. It’s harder to do that if someone is using multiple IP addresses, TOR, proxies, etc.One more problem is that most email providers can’t, nor is there any need to, validate the data their users give them. The same is often true of cell phone companies, too.One way to succeed in dealing with these challenges is to analyze data from multiple sources to identify the single bad apple in the bunch.Even with all of these problems the Blockchain, in fact, gives the law enforcement a few advantages.One of the good features of Bitcoin, from law enforcement’s perspective, is that you are able to track all the transactions of a specific Bitcoin address, with records dating back to their first transaction. This enables law enforcement to trace the cash in a way that they could never do before.Bitcoin is much less anonymous than people think. A Bitcoin address is essentially an account number. If you can connect a person to the address, then you may know all of the transactions that person made.One major problem law enforcement agencies have with phone and Internet companies is that each one has its own regulations about retaining customer data. It can take years to go through numerous providers, often passing through different countries, just to locate the provider that has the information you seek to trace a high-level cyber-criminal. Even then there’s a chance that the trail has gone cold. The Blockchain stores everything forever. That data isn’t going anywhere and you can get it easily.Third party doctrine is a concept that says people shouldn’t expect that data they share with a third party like an ISP to be kept confidential. Third party doctrine makes it possible for law enforcement to get records from ISPs, banks, and cellphone carriers with a subpoena instead of a search warrant.It’s even easier to get access to transaction history when dealing with Blockchain; no subpoena is required. The Blockchain is designed to be open and accessible by all.Whenever evidence shows up in another country, US law enforcement must follow the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) procedure to get assistance from foreign agencies. Right now, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) is in litigation with Microsoft over whether the DOJ has the jurisdiction to get data kept at a Microsoft data center in Ireland with a US search warrant. Microsoft is arguing that the DOJ may not use a warrant to get data kept overseas. That is not a problem with Blockchain as you can access it all over the world with no need for MLAT.The Silk Road case has demonstrated how the law enforcement organizations are already quite capable of tracing transactions using the Blockchain. Carl Force was the DEA agent accused of stealing Bitcoins during the Silk Road investigation. Among the exhibits presented in the case was a chart showing how law enforcement tracked the funds through the Blockchain despite the fact that Carl Force tried to split the transactions across numerous addresses.Bitcoin can’t continue to be the criminal currency. It’s crucial that the Blockchain becomes a place criminals don’t feel secured.That is why people interested in the Blockchain should help law enforcement learn the technology. A good way to accomplish this would be by making use of a public-private info sharing process to exchange details about cybersecurity threats.These dialogues could help create a mechanism for the Bitcoin community to use their knowledge to overcome challenges law enforcement may face while investigating cybercrime.It’s a clear-cut fact that there will always be unlicensed money remitters. It’s impossible to fully drive criminals away from the Blockchain or from the Internet in general. What we can do is create solutions to make it tougher for illegitimate businesses to prosper. Law enforcement should focus on the areas of Blockchain where criminals keep popping up. People need to work out innovative tactics law enforcement can implement."

At that time, only the top five cryptocurrencies had breached the $100 mln market cap level; today the top 23 digital currencies have over $1 bln in market cap. To find a currency with “only” a $100 mln market cap, one must scroll down to number 90 on the list.Many pundits, particularly those from the world of “traditional finance,” believe that the digital currency market is in an epic bubble. Bitcoin-hater and JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon also calls Bitcoin a bubble, but refuses to short the currency because he thinks it could go as high as $100,000. Global Chief Economist of Swiss Bank UBS recently wrote:“The bubble to end all bubbles continues. Cryptocurrencies only have value if accepted as currencies. However, they cannot be used for the most important transaction in an economy, and cryptocurrency supply can only rise and never fall (making them a poor store of value).”While digital currency may in fact be in a bubble, it’s worth remembering that past bubbles have often lasted for years and grown far larger than anybody expected. Dimon may well be right about his $100,000 Bitcoin prediction. In that case, before the bubble bursts, many of you who are reading this today will be millionaires - and some of you will be billionaires.Yet there are signs that this may not be a bubble at all. Technology tends to follow a so-called “S-curve” where adoptions grows slowly at first, then increases exponentially in an almost vertical line, then flattens out again once mass adoption is reached. If digital currency adoption is in fact following an S-curve, then the massive crash many are expecting may never happen. While dips and spikes are expected, a jaw-dropping 80-90% correction may not come."

In an interview to CNN a month back, he stated that he would not be surprised if Bitcoin reaches $10,000 by April 2018. Bitcoin's strong rally in the last month has made him revise his prediction. He now expects Bitcoin to cross $10k by the end of 2017.Speaking to Bloomberg TV, Mike Novogratz said:I think literally we end the year at $10,000 in Bitcoin. I think that is a decent move from here. I think we end the year at close to $500 in Ethereum.While Bitcoin might have stolen the thunder in 2017, Mike believes that Ethereum could now be poised to make rapid gains:Just in the last few days, Ethereum has started to move. I actually think it's gonna put a new high soon. There are a lot of positive things happening in the Ethereum ecosystem.Mike Novogratz, who was a partner in Goldman Sachs and hedge fund manager at Fortress Investment Group, is deeply invested in Bitcoin. He was an early investor in Bitcoin, purchasing Bitcoins for $50 each in 2013. He also invested in Ether at the IPO, picking it up for about thirty cents. He has stated that he has invested 10% of his life savings in Bitcoin and Ether. Given the massive increase in prices of Bitcoin and Ether over the past year, that proportion is likely to have increased. Novogratz is currently looking to raise up to $500 mln to set up a hedge fund in the cryptocurrency space.Bitcoin has moved from strength to strength, shrugging off the $30 mln hack of tether on Monday. According to Novogratz, while security and safe custody of cryptocurrencies is a concern, the market has not reacted badly since $30 mln is small compared to the overall crypto marketcap of $250 bln. In 2017, nothing seems to affect Bitcoin - whether it is Jamie Dimon's negativity or China's crackdown. With the huge momentum behind Bitcoin, it wouldn't be a surprise if Novogratz is forced to revise his projection once more before 2017 ends."

currency based on M1 aggregator. 28285 Total views. 879 Total shares.","Nov 6, 2017","Jameson Lopp, the lead developer at BitGo, a Blockchain security company, has calculated that Bitcoin would rank 32nd globally for its value in circulation. He created a clone money supply aggregator M1 Index, similar to This puts it ahead of Singapore and South Africa, and just behind Finland and the UAE.","By creating a clone of the global M1 index, a metric for the money supply of a country which includes physical money — both paper and coin — as well as checking accounts, are valued, Lopp calculated that Bitcoin would finish pretty high up.In the index, narrow money is used as a metric to determine the value of a currency. The narrow money of a country essentially is every piece of existing currency, taking into account all paper money, as well as coins, and even digital money stored in bank accounts. Liquid assets held by the central bank are also considered.Using this metric, and the value of Bitcoin in circulation, Lopp comes up with a figure of $122,406,125,890 for Bitcoin - its market cap at the time of calculating. However, with its fluctuations, Bitcoin has reached as high as $125 bln in the last three days alone, which would put it in 31st - above Finland.Bitcoin continues to skyrocket with it’s high recently hitting $7,500. This has seen its overall market cap also skyrocket, as well as dominate the cryptocurrency market with over 60 percent domination.Bitcoin price and its market cap are key determining factors in its overall value, but it is metrics like Lopp’s that start to put into power just how influential and powerful the digital currency is.Because Bitcoin crosses the boundary between currency and asset, it is difficult to pigeonhole it. However, it's two categories are helping across different lines.Recently, a decision by CME Group, the world’s largest exchange owner, to introduce Bitcoin futures by the end of the year, helped Bitcoin’s value soar as more traditional investors spotted an opportunity.However, its liquid nature allows it also to be considered a currency and thus is comparable to other countries and their money.There are predictions that the cryptocurrency market could cross $1 tln in 2018, and because of the dominance of Bitcoin, a lot of that push will be from the original cryptocurrency.Additionally, many believe that Bitcoin rapid market cap growth is impressive, going from under $20 bln on Jan. 1 all the way to $201 bln on Nov. 5, but only once $1 tln is reached will it be a major player.A $1 tln market cap for Bitcoin would rank it comfortably in 8th, ahead of Spain, and just under Italy, the lowest ranked country with $1 tln in narrow money."

It’s a monetary system for the unbanked, it’s trustless and far less corruptible, and it can create a new monetary system where there’s no long legacy of banking and financials.","However, across the continent, in different countries, the uptake has been surprisingly slow. From South Africa and Nigeria, as the biggest players in Bitcoin, to smaller nations like Tanzania who are seeing big growth, but with small numbers.Perhaps one of the biggest issues facing Bitcoin adoption in Africa is educating people about digital currencies. Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency world is still a foggy minefield for those who are actively using it, so it’s difficult to try and educate a whole continentAfrica is largely a cash-based infrastructure with a simplistic model, even banking is still a novel concept to a large portion of the population.However, there’s also not much alternative, if understanding and education in digital currencies is low, their adoption in industry and retail is even lower.Chad Robertson, co-founder and chief executive officer of South African startup Regenize, says awareness will help:“Specifically, in South Africa, we have such a huge gap that keeps on growing regarding wealth, but also knowledge, on the ever-changing tech landscape. If I’m sitting in a coffee shop in the CBD, it’s quite likely someone will know what Bitcoin is. However, head down to the Cape Flats or townships (slums), and it’s highly unlikely that there’ll be many people who are aware of this.”But again, Robertson brings it back to industry. Those who will accept Bitcoin in Africa are even rarer than those in the rural areas that have heard about it.“However, this lack of education and awareness could be drilled down further on to find the root cause. There are too many people living in poverty in South Africa and Africa. They simply cannot think about using Bitcoin, as it’s not relevant to their needs. The local spaza shop (corner shop) does not accept Bitcoin, so how will someone get their bread or milk? Schools don’t accept it for school fees. You cannot buy electricity with Bitcoin to keep your lights on. So why would they care or want to be educated on it?”Of course, Africa is a diverse place, and one that has a huge gap between rich and poor. So while those near the bottom of the economic rung may not have heard of Bitcoin, or see any place to use it, those near the top have other issues.Security concerns also need to be addressed before mass adoption, which also links back to education. Robertson said:“There are many people who’ve been scammed on the Internet, especially those who are digitally uneducated. Therefore, there’s a fear and a stigma around using the Internet as a place to transact.”Visibility is also an issue, with the majority of Africans used to having a brick and mortar institution available for their enquiries.“With Bitcoin, there’s no visible place to lay a complaint or an enquiry. I would think change management would play a large role in the transition from using a bank. For generations, people have given their money to the bank and there’s a trust, as the bank is a brick and mortar institution. With Bitcoin, people might have fears of what happens to my money? Who do I complain to?”"

continues, as the CFTC releases a primer on virtual currencies.","Oct 19, 2017","The Commodities Futures Trading Commission just released a primer on virtual currencies. This guide covers the basics of virtual currencies, the risks associated with them and CFTC's role in regulating them.","Daniel Gorfine, CFTC's Chief Innovation Officer, said at the release of the primer.“As people worldwide try to understand and wrap their heads around the virtual currency ecosystem, we thought it timely and important for our first primer to help explain the space, identify how developments involve the CFTC, and highlight risks that investors or users of virtual currencies should carefully consider.”The primer highlights that the definition of commodity in the Commodities Exchanges Act (CEA) is broad and covers physical commodities (like grain), natural resources (like gold) and currency or interest rates. Moreover, the CTFC has oversight over derivative contracts and its jurisdiction is triggered when virtual currencies are used in derivative contracts.There has been much debate about whether virtual currencies should be classified as a commodity or a security. As early as 2015, the CFTC had opined that Bitcoin was a commodity and would be subject to its jurisdiction. The SEC has recently asserted its own authority, taking action against ICO operators recently and finding that some ICO tokens may have security-like features. The CFTC primer clarifies that the actual structure of the token would decide whether the token is classified as a security or derivative contract with an underlying commodity.“There is no inconsistency between the SEC’s analysis and the CFTC’s determination that virtual currencies are commodities and that virtual tokens may be commodities or derivatives contracts depending on the particular facts and circumstances.”The price of Bitcoin crashed by $500 to just under $5,100 following the release of this report, but has since recovered almost all of its losses. Regulatory action of any kind generally induces short-term panic in Bitcoin traders, but the price typically recovers quickly. Bitcoin has over the past few months bounced back after China banned ICOs and shut down exchanges, the SEC declared that ICOs may constitute securities offerings and South Korea completely banned ICOs. This might be the surest indication that the market believes that the ability of governments to exercise control over Bitcoin is limited."

Bitcoin provides a safeguarded space for the store of wealth that can be kept secret from everyone.","It is one of the attractive features of Bitcoin for some, but it also means that it is all too easy to take a fortune of digital currency to the grave.There have been some recent examples of people dying without making provisions for their Bitcoin fortune, which can lead to some sticky situations for the next of kin to try and claim it.In a recent case, a man in Colorado passed away leaving more of a burden and debt for his family to sort out than an inheritance - or so they thought.Turns out, the man had been investing in Bitcoin back when it was nearer to $13 a coin, rather than the $4,000 it finds itself at today. His Bitcoin fortune was stored in a virtual wallet, which provided its own problem.This man had been using Coinbase as a wallet which was one of the reasons that his family was able to claim his money.Upon reviewing his bank account, which revealed debits to Coinbase, his family with documents in hand approached the exchange, which confirmed the existence of a wallet and is now in the process of transferring its contents.Of course, this can lead to many issues with fraudsters using fake death certificates and other documents to make claims on certain customer’s Bitcoin wallets.Of course, this instance was reliant on Coinbase accepting his family’s story and opening his wallet for them, but there is another way to secure the future of your Bitcoin fortune for your next of kin.The private key of a wallet is the access pass for a wallet but is not always handed out by some of the more popular online wallets.If a Bitcoin owner dies without passing on the private key, his heirs may discover his wallet only to realize that they will never gain access to the wealth inside. To prevent this, the owner simply has to ensure that someone gets a copy of the private key by writing it down, storing it on a flash memory drive or entrusting it with a commercial service that manages them.There are of course instances, where Bitcoin can be lost forever, should a holder die and not make it know that he owns the digital currency. Because there is no forced taxation attached to Bitcoin, executors cannot even use that to locate assets.The Bitcoin situation can be likened to a time when people died with stock certificates in shoe boxes — sometimes they would go unnoticed for decades until the corporation that issued them concluded that nobody would redeem them and turned them over to a state government’s unclaimed property division."

He agrees with Dimon’s assessment adding that his concerns also go into the security surrounding an online currency."

Standpoint Research’s Ronnie Moas, who is one of the most bullish analysts on Bitcoin, has revised his prediction upwards.","Ronnie Moas had surprised observers by his bold prediction in July 2007 that Bitcoin could reach $5,000 within months.The price was less than $3,000 when he made the prediction, but it jumped up to over $5,000 in Sep. 2017 before retracing briefly.In August 2017, the rapid increase in Bitcoin price led to Ronnie Moas revising his projection to $7,500 by the end of 2017. Bitcoin's rapid increase in price has dwarfed that projection as well, with Bitcoin price crossing $7,400 today. Ronnie Moas has now revised his projection, raising it to $11,000 in 2018.In an email to his clients, Ronnie wrote:Every day more headlines are hitting the newswires on crypto. More countries are embracing it, and the few obstacles that were standing in the way are falling down like dominoes.Ronnie Moas is ultra-bullish about Bitcoin's potential in the long-term and believes that it will rival gold one day. He has predicted that its price will cross $20,000 in three years time and $50,000 in 10 years time.Given the current bull run of Bitcoin, he might even shorten the time frame projected for Bitcoin to reach those levels.While Apple might be the company with the highest market capitalization and whose value is reaching record levels each day, Ronnie believes that Bitcoin will overtake Apple in just five years.Ronnie believes that the price increase will be driven by increased awareness of Bitcoin and a larger proportion of the world's population investing in it.It is estimated that less than 0.5 percent of people currently have invested in Bitcoin and Ronnie believes that this could increase to five percent.Since the supply of Bitcoins is fixed, the demand-supply imbalance will cause the price to soar. Bitcoin's current rally has clearly divided people into two opposing camps, with the bulls becoming more bullish and the bears crying bubble."

In July of 2016, the market valuation of GE briefly surpassed $300 bln, nearing the market cap of other major firms like JPMorgan. But, since 2015, GE has struggled, as its market cap fell by nearly 50 percent.Meanwhile, since 2015, the market cap of Bitcoin has increased from $2.5 bln to $185 bln, by 74-fold.As a store of value and a digital currency, the market valuation of Bitcoin should rather be compared to other assets, stores of value and currencies such as gold and reserve currencies. But, it is important to acknowledge the rapid growth rate of Bitcoin in comparison to companies in leading industries because the transformation Bitcoin has brought upon the finance industry has been truly impactful.Bitcoin has surpassed leading currencies on the M1 index as well this year. This week for instance, the market valuation of Bitcoin surpassed the total money supply of the British pound.Many experts and analysts including billionaire hedge fund legend Mike Novogratz have stated that Bitcoin price could easily reach $40,000 by the end of 2018, or $1 tln in market cap. Novogratz said:""Bitcoin could be at $40,000 at the end of 2018. It easily could. There's a big wave of money coming, not just here but all around the world. What's different about these coins than other commodities ... there is no supply response here. So it's a speculator's dream in that as buying happens there's no new supply response that comes up. So every price move gets exaggerated. It's going to get exaggerated on the way up. There will be 50 percent corrections. It will get exaggerated on the way down.”As Bitcoin price enters the $45,000 range and the market cap of the cryptocurrency achieves $1 tln, analysts will begin to compare Bitcoin with conventional safe haven assets such as gold.Currently, the entire Bitcoin market is about three percent of the multi-trillion dollar gold market. But, if Bitcoin continues to increase in value and reaches $40,000 by the end of 2018 as noted by Novogratz, it will soon be able to compete against the gold market and other stores of value such as reserve currencies."

mln Bitcoin buy in 2013. 63673 Total views. Winklevoss Twins ...","Dec 5, 2017","They say that revenge is a dish best served cold - in this case, perhaps with a side of Bitcoin?","While Mark Zuckerberg’s stake in Facebook has made him one of the richest men in the world, his rivals, the Winklevoss twins, found another way to become billionaires. The twins sued Zuckerberg in 2011 and received a $65 mln payout. While that number was paltry in comparison to the company’s worth, it was enough to take the twins’ net worth past the billion dollar mark.According to The Telegraph the twins invested $11 mln of the payout in Bitcoin in 2013. Fortune points out that the twins paid about $120 each for their approximately 91,666 Bitcoins giving them about one percent of all the Bitcoins that had been mined at the time.Fast forward five years and the price of Bitcoin has skyrocketed. As of press time, Bitcoin is sitting above $11,400. It’s believed that the Winklevoss twins are the first investors to make a billion dollar return on their investment.The industrious entrepreneurs sit at or near the top of a prestigious list of Bitcoin owners. They are also in the process of launching their own Bitcoin ETF - which was rejected earlier this year. Their very own Bitcoin exchange, Gemini, has been operating for around a year following a lengthy battle for approval.We have to fess up - in early November we published an article stating that the Winklevoss had then become billionaires. As it turns out, that was based on an inaccurate estimate of their total Bitcoin holdings. They owned 1% of all Bitcoin back in 2013, not 1% of all Bitcoin in November 2017. It’s probably more accurate to calculate their holdings using the amount they invested ($11 mln) and the price per Bitcoin at the time ($120). Thus they own approximately 91,666 Bitcoins, not the 120,000 Bitcoins we were estimating at the time.Of course, the twins never released the exact number of Bitcoins they own, so any estimate is likely to be off by a small amount. Assuming the 91,666 estimate is correct, at press time, the value of their holdings is $1.063 bln.In early November, a number of crypto news outlets published similar stories to our own, but mainstream media never took note and apparently didn’t care. It took them an entire month to catch up with the story, and though their estimates are likely more accurate, their reporting is behind.Math aside, it’s truly extraordinary that a pair of Bitcoin investors have made over a billion dollars from their investment. It’s exactly this type of story that’s fueling the flames of mainstream adoption, and that’s driving mainstream media into a frenzy of Bitcoin reporting.Because of the pseudo-anonymous nature of Bitcoin, there may be others who own even more Bitcoin than the Winklevoss twins. Satoshi Nakamoto, if he is still alive and has access to his private keys, is believed to own about one million Bitcoins, or about $11 bln worth.Other early Bitcoin investors are candidates for billionaire status as well. Roger Ver is widely believed to have 300,000 Bitcoins. Trace Meyer is another candidate for billionaire status, having purchase Bitcoin when the currency was trading for around 25 cents each. A few months ago, Ver and Meyer made a 25,000 Bitcoin bet over the future of the Bitcoin scaling debate (Ver sided with the big blockers and now supports Bitcoin Cash). Clearly they are both very wealthy.Given the twins’ high-profile around the world, they are likely to continue playing a major role in the uptake of Bitcoin and altcoins into mainstream consciousness. Their influence carries weight among multiple spheres, in business, academics and sports. Yes, sports. The twins competed in the men’s pairs rowing at the 2008 Beijing Olympics."

institutions could look to Bitcoin if a major financial crash hits global 
markets. “ ...","Nov 27, 2017","As Bitcoin powered ahead to a new high for a second week in a row, some have speculated that institutional investors could seek safe haven in the virtual currency in the future. The prevailing rhetoric over the past month has been more affirming than damning of cryptocurrencies, with the likes of Ronnie Moas and Max Keiser predicting new highs in 2018. Speaking to RT, eToro analyst Mikhail Mashchenko says financial institutions could look to Bitcoin if a major financial crash hits global markets.","“The demand for Bitcoin is growing as the crypto market has become less volatile, and an increasing number of professional investors see it as insurance.”The current bull market in stocks is the second-longest in history, according to Fortune, having lasted 104 months so far. The longest bull market in history ended in 2000 after an impressive 113 month run. With the current rally getting a bit long in the tooth, many on Wall Street are making contingency plans for the stock market’s inevitable turn. If Mashchenko is right, Bitcoin will have a role in some of these plans.Mashchenko’s statements come on the back of changing sentiment in the mainstream financial sector. Last week, JP Morgan Chase announced plans to offer Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange - an important move by one of the biggest banking and financial services providers in America. Even more satisfying, this moves comes only months after Chase CEO Jamie Dimon condemned Bitcoin as a scam.Online banking service providers and exchange operators LedgerX and Revolut are also adopting Bitcoin support. The former was recently cleared to offer Bitcoin derivatives as people look to do more than just trade the cryptocurrency.“LedgerX launched its first long-term options for Bitcoin, with an expiration date of December 28, 2018. In the coming months, we will continue to see the ‘domestication’ of Bitcoin: the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are planning to launch tools based on the cryptocurrency in the near future.”If and when a stream of institutional investors start investing large amounts of capital into cryptocurrencies, some of the stunning predictions made by Bitcoin bulls could well be realised. However, Mashchenko’s prediction was quite conservative, suggesting that Bitcoin reaching a $10,000 high by the end of 2017 would be driven by emotion rather than fundamentals:“We could see a Bitcoin at $10,000 in a month or so. However, such a surge will be based on emotions, not on fundamental factors. So, further growth of the cryptocurrency will require something more than euphoria.”Having hit the $8,000 mark last week, Bitcoin surged another $1,000 dollars in just a few days, breaching the $9,000 level during the Thanksgiving weekend. At press time, the price of Bitcoin sits at $9,500, just $500 below Mashcenko’s predicted level."

Ajay Banga, the CEO of Mastercard, has leveled a scathing attack ...","Oct 9, 2017","Ajay Banga, CEO of Mastercard, has leveled a scathing attack on any and all cryptocurrencies that are not government mandated, calling them “junk”.","Digital currencies are almost direct competition for a company like Mastercard, and when asked his opinion on the futuristic technology, Banga was not complimentary of how things stand at the moment.Knowing that digital currencies are big disrupters in the traditional money market, traditional investors, and now even established money movers, have been scathing.Banga was not totally against the idea of Blockchain-based money and tokenization, however, his big caveat was that it needs to be government backed.“If the government creates digital currency, we will find a way to be in the game. We will provide rails for moving currency from customer to merchant. The government mandated digital currencies are interesting. Non-government mandated currency is junk,” he said.Banga’s attack on Bitcoin brought up nothing new or visionary, spurting the usual concerns without much backing or research. He criticised Bitcoin for its volatility, and use-cases for illegal activities, such as ransomware attacks:“If I pay for a bottle of water in Bitcoin, one day it is two bottles for a Bitcoin the other day it is 9,000 bottles. This does not work. Any currency needs stability and transparency, otherwise you will get all the illegal activities in the world. Why was the ransom for the virus (wannacry ransomware) collected in Bitcoin? Why has China cracked down on Bitcoin?”Banga seems to be another bigwig who has a stake in the game, and thus is not happy to give up that piece of pie. He, along with traditional bankers and investors, are fearful of Bitcoin as it continues to break new ground and blow precedents out of the water.The divide of big names on Wall Street seems to grow daily as those in the camp of Jamie Dimon, who called Bitcoin a ‘fraud’ continue to recruit those who seem to be more fearful than certain.Meanwhile, there are those who are looking to profit, and those who are major backers, despite coming from traditional and closed-off investment channels.Axel Weber, the former President of Bundesbank and Chairman UBS, said:“I get often asked why I‘m so skeptical about Bitcoin, it probably comes from my background as a central banker.”Meanwhile, Brock Pierce, Chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, is taking these knee-jerk reactions as good things.“When the incumbent industry is making statements like this and acknowledging you...it’s a sign that what we’re doing is working...it’s a huge validation,” said Pierce."

Blow Bitcoin, Don ...","Dec 5, 2017","Sandra Phlippen of AD Newspaper, owned by a Belgian private news company, in the Netherlands is imploring citizens to spend all their Bitcoin now in order to avoid the supposed inevitable crash. The Economist states that Bitcoin is building to a point where, when - not if - it crashes, it will be so big that it would destabilize the real world economy.","The argument goes that Bitcoin is already a threat to government and undermines the central authority of banks in sovereign states. Thus, as it continues to grow, it will cause irreparable damage to the economy, and again when - not if - it collapses, she states, the damage will be gigantic.The recent growth spurt has got many people talking on both sides of the Bitcoin. Some are elated at the adoption and the associated price jump, while others are fearful of just how high the roller coaster goes.Phlippen argues that, with information sourced from Joshua Brown, a New York financial advisor, on his private blog, that Bitcoin needs $17 mln a day to carry on without crashing. As more and more interest flows towards Bitcoin then, it is argued that that figure will rise. But because it is still such a new market, it could start to miss the predicted magical figure.Brown explains:“Speaking of the dot-com boom, I think this is the same thing. The people who are buying into this mania most heavily, in an emotional sense, were in elementary school for that.”Phlippen's biggest fear of Bitcoin, however, is that it undermines the government. She spouts the usual rhetoric about tax avoidance and money laundering. Additionally, it is a concern, she states, that the additional revenue that comes from Bitcoin’s growth in citizens’ wallets cannot be used to benefit the centralized government. It is the issue with gains tax and the anonymity that is empowering citizens that is unpleasant to the author.Not only does Phlippen highlight the plight of the government when it comes to a big Bitcoin market, but she also has concerns for the banks too.Phlippen says:“Central banks also have less influence on keeping the economy stable. In times of crisis, central banks can, through their influence on ordinary banks, ease credit conditions and encourage people to consume. The bank has no control over the Bitcoin economy and an economic crisis can become deeper.”Through all this doom and gloom of Bitcoin getting so big that it eventually reaches its breaking point and blows, along with the rest of the world economy, Phlippen's advice is: ‘sell.’“So there is nothing else, dear Bitcoin-fans, that Bitcoin can only crash very quickly, so, before it disrupts our economy, If I had one, I would sell it now.”Secret symbol № 26: F What is this?"

He is the grandson of the founder of Saudi Arabia, King Abdulaziz Alsaud. According to Forbes, he is the 45th richest man in the world. Through his venture Kingdom Holding Co, he holds stakes in a variety of companies including Lyft, Twitter, Citigroup and even the Savoy Hotel in London.","He had built a reputation for himself as an early-stage investor in technology companies like Twitter and AOL, but seems to have missed the Bitcoin bus. He was previously involved in controversy after being accused of exaggerating his wealth to make it to the list of Forbes top 10 billionaires.Speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box, the prince said:“I don't believe in this Bitcoin thing. I believe it is going to implode one day. I think it is Enron in the making.”In spite of his reputation as an early-spotter of new and successful technology trends,  the prince said that the lack of a centralized governing authority was the reason why Bitcoin's failure is certain. He has much in common with Chase CEO Jamie Dimon in that regard.“It just does not make any sense. It is not under the supervision of the United States Federal Reserve or any other central bank. I don't believe in it at all. I am in agreement with Jamie Dimon.”Enron was a textbook case of fraud - a company using accounting loopholes to present a misleading picture, auditors conniving with management and a Board blind to the faults of the managers and executives. The result of this systemic fraud was the bankruptcy of Enron and the dissolution of Arthur Andersen, which was one of the five largest audit firms in the world at that time.There are simply no similarities between a fraudulent company and a decentralized currency. The prince apparently believes that Bitcoin's price will collapse, as Enron's share price collapsed from $90 to under $1.What Jamie Dimon and Prince Alwaleed don't realize (or don't want to realize) is that being outside the control of a central governing authority is not Bitcoin's weakness, but its strength. We have seen authoritarian governments, including China and Russia, try to muzzle Bitcoin by shutting down exchanges and proposing stringent regulation. Bitcoin threatens the establishment by letting people be in control of their own money. It is no wonder that Wall Street royalty and Middle Eastern Princes feel threatened enough to run it down."

In fact, he isn’t actually aware of what Bitcoin is, saying “Whatever it is, I missed it.” Nevertheless, via a technically sound ‘smell test’ Rogers has suggested that Bitcoin is a bubble. In fact, the investment guru said:“It looks and smells like all the bubbles I have seen throughout history.”In contrast, Ronnie Moas has recently suggested Bitcoin will reach $14,000 and notoriously bearish Tommy Lee, founder of Fundstrat has remained exceptionally bullish on the nascent technological monetary device.Other industry insiders agree. A rapid increase in price is not necessarily a sure sign of a bubble. Rather, rise price points may in fact represent adoption on a larger scale. Consider Ted O’Neill’s (Founder, Narrative Network) statement:A traditional speculative bubble occurs when exuberance causes a price to rise well over the intrinsic value of the asset. While Bitcoin certainly has seen a meteoric rise, and will experience wild swings in value until it matures, I would argue that it still represents a good value, especially when you consider that the total amount of money in the word is around $60 tln and the current value of Bitcoin is only $136 bln. That represents 0.2 percent. As both a store of value and as “money” Bitcoin is poised to achieve a much larger market capitalization.While many institutional investors may sniff at Bitcoin, those familiar with the technology and the potential it has are not concerned about bubbles just yet."

As a result, Bitfinex has decided to assert all of its legal rights and remedies against this agitator and his associates.”Kyle Samani, a partner at Multicoin Capital, stated that Bitfinex had made a critical mistake by initiating a lawsuit against Bitfinex’ed and other potential “bad actors” in the cryptocurrency space.Over the past few months, Bitfinex’s involvement with Tether, the US dollar-backed cryptocurrency, has been questioned, given that a long-promised third party audit on the USD reserve of Tether was never performed. Critics such as Bitfinex’ed claimed that not all of the Tether issued are backed by US dollars. Tether (the company) shares many of the same owners as Bitfinex.Charlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin and former executive at Coinbase, also urged Bitfinex to conduct a third party audit on Tether, to put an end to the controversy.There's a fear going on that the recent price rise was helped by printing of USDT (Tether) that is not backed by USD in a bank account.

I urge @bitfinex and @Tether_to to perform a 3rd party audit to prove their reserves. Please do the right thing. Thanks.A third party audit would be beneficial for both Bitfinex and the cryptocurrency sector, as it would calm many investors who fear that Bitcoin’s price is being manipulated. It would also reassure holders of Tether that the cryptocurrency is backed by a USD reserve.However, as Samani noted, instead of performing a third party audit, Bitfinex chose to pursue legal action against its critics.As a crypto exchange, when you're accused of being a fraud, you have 2 choices:

1) produce bulletproof audits and *demonstrate* (not just say) a commitment to transparency

2) threaten your accuser with litigation@bitfinex chose #2

Bravo @Bitfinexed.https://t.co/YCfaKQSjAESeveral analysts and experts have recently questioned the USD reserve of Tether. Tim Swanson, the founder at OfNumbers and a risk analyst for Blockchain firms, stated that a serious problem could emerge in the short-term if Tether is not backed by USD by a 1:1 ratio.“Is there anything backing this? If these aren’t backed 1-to-1, then what is the contagion risk if one of these exchanges goes down?”Given that Bitfinex remains as the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the global market and Tether has evolved into a $813 million cryptocurrency, Bitfinex and Tether should conduct a third party audit to prove their solvency in the upcoming months. Failure to do so will continue to ignite more controversy within the global cryptocurrency community, which is not beneficial for any party involved.On November 19, Bitfinex revealed that the exchange was targeted by a coordinated attack designed to disrupt the market. The Bitfinex emphasized that both fiat and cryptocurrency withdrawals are functioning as normal, and that the exchange is solvent, after several inaccurate reports circulated in online Bitcoin communities.The company also encouraged the cryptocurrency market to request for evidence before drawing any conclusion in regards to the insolvency of Bitfinex.Bitfinex is solvent and both fiat and crypto withdrawals are functioning as normal. We are seeing increasing FUD which we believe is a co-ordinated attack to create a market disrupting event 1/2Currently, the stance of the Bitfinex team is to defend the exchange and its trading platform against “bad actors” in the cryptocurrency sector and inaccurate allegations.Tether has previously come under criticism for claiming that their tokens aren’t money at all. The “legal” section of Tether’s website states:“Once you have Tethers, you can trade them, keep them, or use them to pay persons that will accept your Tethers. However, Tethers are not money and are not monetary instruments. They are also not stored value or currency. There is no contractual right or other right or legal claim against us to redeem or exchange your Tethers for money. We do not guarantee any right of redemption or exchange of Tethers by us for money. There is no guarantee against losses when you buy, trade, sell, or redeem Tethers.”The company responded, saying they cannot legally guarantee redemption for dollars, even though they have every intention of honoring redemption requests:“Our Terms of Service have been carefully picked apart by various malcontents and twisted to suggest that Tethers would not be redeemable for currency on some bizarre, malicious whim by Tether. That is untrue. While we reserve the right not to redeem for any particular customer, as we must, we will not do so for no reason. We have a duty to try to ensure that our service is not being used by persons from sanctioned countries, that is otherwise on a sanctions list, or that has some background check problem. In short, redemptions will not be unreasonably denied, but we reserve the right to selectively deny redemption and creation of Tethers on a case-by-case basis.”"

transaction costs, it'll look again. 6067 Total views. 197 Total ...","Nov 15, 2017","David Gledhill, group chief information officer at DBS, one of Asia's largest banks, has put his opinion forward of what Bitcoin is. Gledhill has reiterated the point that many hold, calling Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme.","However, Gledhill’s criticism is mostly aimed at the high transaction costs that Bitcoin currently has, and he goes as far as to say that should that issue be sorted - essentially a true scaling consensus be met which cuts the transaction fees, there could be more interest in it for the banks.As Bitcoin stands presently, there is very little to entice major banks over to it, although some have taken the plunge. However, many in the crypto space believe that Bitcoin is working to solve its scaling issues and lower transaction costs and that is what the banks could be waiting for.After outing Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme in his and DBS’s opinion, Gledhill addressed the real elephant in the room for many users, as well as banks who would consider integrating and adopting the digital currency.“Bitcoin transactions are incredibly expensive and all the fees are hidden through the crypto-mechanisms,"" he said. ""We don't think DBS being in that game right now is going to create a competitive advantage for us.""For banks, like DBS, there is currently no rush to join the cryptocurrency market as its transaction costs and speed are hampering the adoption for major banks. Rather, it makes more sense for these banks to continue competing in electronic transactions of government-backed currencies.Essentially, the fees for such transactions are centralized and thus determined by the bank. Therefore, it makes sense for banks to have their fingers in such pies, as that is their bread and butter.Gledhill does predict, however, that eventually, Bitcoin will sort out its expensive transactions, which will be part of its scaling. From there, the interest for banks suddenly heightens as not only will adoption across users increase, but also for merchants and traders.There is no current advantage for banks like DBS to offer Bitcoin to its customers. Others, like Falcon bank in Switzerland, have.However, Gledhill explains:“Bitcoin isn't going to help DBS bring in customers, deposits or wealth management so right now, it's watch and learn.""There has long been a cautious approach from institutionalized money men, from banks to investors and Wall Street types. Now, it seems for banks to try and join the Bitcoin wave, rather than quash it they want to see it have much cheaper transactions.The transactions that occur on the Blockchain remain decentralized even if offered to a bank and thus there is nothing to be gained for a bank pushing this technology.The money never comes to them, however, if the transactions are low, then adoption will rise and demand will be created. That higher demand will allow banks to impose some other form of fees where they can thusly profit.It all smacks a little too much of greed from the banking sector, and a lack of understanding to bott. Indeed, Matthew Roszak, co-founder and chairman of Bloq, a Blockchain enterprise software company, responded:""When I hear comments like that, I think a lot of folks are having their Kodak moment, where maybe they don't really understand the magnitude of this technology."""

their gains and income from Bitcoin and other virtual currencies.","Dec 10, 2017","Expert Blog is Cointelegraph’s new series of articles by crypto industry leaders. It covers everything from Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to ICO regulation and investment analysis. If you want to become our guest author and get published on Cointelegraph, please send us an email at mike@cointelegraph.com.","Don’t get excited or fearful just yet. The IRS has not yet announced a tax amnesty for people who failed to report their gains and income from Bitcoin and other virtual currencies. But there has long been speculation that it might happen. And given recent developments, we may now be one step closer.It is well-known that the IRS is looking hard at Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency transactions, hoping to scoop up some tax dollars. Frighteningly, much of the IRS attention now appears to be focused on the criminal end of the spectrum. IRS Criminal Investigation Agents evidently are being trained in the field.The IRS Criminal Investigation Division not only ordered training for its agents. It also entered into a contract with Chainanalysis for tracking. We may expect this area to unfold materially in the coming years and not in a happy way.A Justice Department attorney recently noted that IRS scrutiny on tax reporting could prompt new procedures for users to get right with the IRS. Mark F. Daly, senior litigation counsel in the Justice Department Tax Division, made the remarks in a Nov. 3, 2017 symposium held by the State Bar of Texas Tax Section. It was released by webcast on Nov. 9.Mr. Daly also noted the widely publicized statistic that only 807 people reported Bitcoin to the IRS between 2013 and 2015. In contrast, there are hundreds of thousands of Coinbase account holders and climbing all the time. The sheer transaction volume of all those property transactions is frankly staggering. The IRS is not blind to this.Then there is the Coinbase summons case, mentioned below. There have been more than a few comparisons raised with the Swiss and other offshore bank controversies. For models on special amnesty programs, the IRS has good examples. The Swiss bank controversies of a decade back prompted two programs, and they are both still in existence.If you have undisclosed offshore accounts or income, you can enter the IRS program called the Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program, or OVDP. It involves filing up to eight years of amended tax returns, other disclosure forms, and paying taxes, interest and penalties. But it is formulaic get out of jail free card. What’s more, you can fix your other tax problems too, even if they have nothing to do with offshore income or accounts.For less serious offshore tax problems, the second IRS program is called the Streamlined program. It involves only three amended tax returns, up to six years of FBAR foreign account reports, and paying taxes and interest you owe. The penalties are much smaller than the OVDP. Moreover, if you live outside the US, you don’t even pay any penalties in the Streamlined program.These could be helpful blueprints. Way back in 2013, the Government Accounting Office (GAO) said that the IRS needed to ramp up for digital currencies. The IRS started watching such issues in 2007. In 2009, the IRS posted information on its website on the tax consequences of virtual economy transactions.However, other than the 2014 “it is property” notice, the IRS has not provided taxpayers with more information. Some kind of amnesty seems almost inevitable, eventually. After all, IRS efforts to find untaxed offshore funds hidden in offshore accounts were wildly successful. Some of it was clearly hardball. The IRS has prosecuted big foreign banks for helping Americans stash money and assets overseas. The IRS collected handsome and in some cases punitive settlements.The IRS has also prosecuted high-profile individuals for hiding their money in offshore accounts. The IRS used whistleblowers and foreign bankers who had to take deals or go down with the ship. The IRS also strong-armed foreign governments, as well as foreign banks to make them turn over more data about US taxpayers holding accounts overseas.But perhaps the greatest coup in the IRS’s strategy was a type of limited amnesty. The IRS has won big. It has collected more than $10 bln in these efforts. The money train isn’t done yet either. Remember, it all started with the John Doe Summons to UBS, the Swiss bank. It was a John Doe Summons against Coinbase too.Both the IRS and Coinbase have declared partial victories in that dispute. But some records are going to start flowing like a river. US Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley ruled that the exchange must supply the tax agency with the identities of all users in the US who conducted at least one Bitcoin transaction equivalent to at least $20,000 between 2012 and 2015. The order says that a ""reporting gap"" gave the IRS legitimate reason to demand the information.Magistrate Corley wrote in her judgment:""That only 800 to 900 taxpayers reported gains related to Bitcoin in each of the relevant years and that more than 14,000 Coinbase users have either bought, sold, sent or received at least $20,000 worth of Bitcoin in a given year suggests that many Coinbase users may not be reporting their Bitcoin gains.""With the order, Coinbase will be required to turn over the names, addresses and tax identification numbers on 14,355 account holders out of its nearly six mln customers. The UBS release that started the Swiss avalanche was only 4,250 names. The Court has ordered Coinbase to produce the following customer information: (a) taxpayer ID number, (b) name, (c) birth date, (d) address, (e) records of account activity, including transaction logs or other records identifying the date, amount, and type of transaction (purchase/sale/exchange), the post transaction balance, and the names of counterparties to the transaction and (f) all periodic statements of account or invoices (or the equivalent).This has to be at least unnerving to affected taxpayers. At least this information is limited to those accounts with at least $20,000 in any one transaction type (buy, sell, send, or receive) in any one year from 2013 to 2015. No other records must be produced now. Still, it seems highly unlikely that this is the end of the story, with Coinbase or more generally.Bitcoin values have gone meteoric. It seems likely that the IRS will start formulating some way to offer carrots to taxpayers who have not been reporting their Bitcoin and other digital currency gains. So, stay tuned. In the meantime, the latest in the Coinbase saga can be read here.Bio: Robert W. Wood is a tax lawyer with a nationwide practice in the US.

Advertising and ad placement on the site is largely unavailable due to the nature of the content and as such, it seems as if the administrators of the site went looking elsewhere.Mining cryptocurrency seemed to be their prefered choice, but this isn’t sitting well with users of the site, who were caught unaware by the sudden spike in their CPU’s usage while visiting.“That really is serious, so hopefully we can get some action on it quickly. And perhaps get some attention for the uploading and commenting bugs while they’re at it,” a Pirate Bay user named “Sid” wrote in a comment, according to Torrentfreak.According to The Pirate Bay, who responded to Torrentfreak, this was a test, and it was only to be performed for 24 hours.Despite what The Pirate Bay says, they still have a few questions to answer, and furthermore, they raised a few philosophical questions about the regulation of mining.Cryptocurrencies, as well as newly formed ones in the form of ICOs, have recently come under huge scrutiny, as places like China have upped their regulation, even inflicting bans.This exploitation of users and their CPU power seems to be ethically wrong - even if it is done by a pirate website. Thus, should there be certain policies to restrict who can mine crypto, or should they subject erring users to penalties?If the use of cryptocurrencies are being regulated, should the mining of said coins not also have some sort of laws and rules around them?A balance must be struck, otherwise people are left unprotected and exposed to potentially exploitative methods — like those who “borrow” your CPU to earn a few virtual coins."

""I think Blockchain is a very exciting technology, probably the most disruptive technology in our industry, the financial services industry.""Bao went on to add that those who had gotten into Bitcoin early enough would be profiting, but his overall opinion was doubtful of the digital currency. Bao joins many traditional investors who use the facade of a bubble to discredit the digital currency.The likes of Jamie Dimon and BlackRock’s Larry Fink have been highly critical of Bitcoin in recent weeks. However, they have also both showed their interest in the Blockchain.Bao went on with his praise of the Blockchain and degradation of Bitcoin, by stating that the digital currency aspect is “just one application.”""Obviously, right now it's getting a little bit hot, like the weather outside, getting a little bit bubblish. I'm a strong believer in Blockchain in terms of its wider application in our industry.""There has been a boom in interest and adoption of the Blockchain from a number of major companies and banks - including BBVA, Bank Danamon and National Australia Bank.On top of that, the Bitcoin haters at JP Morgan and Royal Bank of Canada, have said that they will be investing in the Blockchain."

cause, publically condemning Bitcoin as the currency of criminals.","Oct 10, 2017","Russian government-owned RT and Reuters both report that Vladimir Putin has decided to take a stand against cryptocurrencies in general, and Bitcoin in particular. RT reports that Putin believes digital currencies could be used to finance terrorism, evade taxes and launder money, and that Bitcoin itself is a pyramid scheme.","RT quotes Putin as saying that Bitcoin creates:“Opportunities to launder funds acquired through criminal activites, tax evasion, even terrorism financing, as well as the spread of fraud schemes.”After Putin blamed a host of Russia’s criminal problems on Bitcoin, the central bank echoed his remarks, calling digital currency a pyramid scheme:“We have seen how Bitcoin has transformed a payment unit into an asset, which is bought in order to obtain a high yield in a short period of time. This is the definition of a pyramid.”Of course, just a year or two ago, pundits were saying Bitcoin needed to be regulated because the falling price was causing investors to lose money. Now it’s the rising price that’s a problem, apparently.Ironically, just last month Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said:“There is no sense banning [digital currencies], there is a need to regulate them.”Less than a week ago, Siluanov was planning on including the topic of digital currency in the country’s financial literacy strategy.Likewise, at the end of August, Cointelegraph reported that the Moscow Exchange was considering including Bitcoin-based derivatives and exchange traded funds (ETFs) among its many offerings.Even though today is the first time Putin took a direct stand against Bitcoin, clouds have been gathering on the horizon for some time. Russia’s deputy finance minister Alexey Moiseev recently called Bitcoin a pyramid scheme and announced his intention only to allow “qualified investors” rather than “ordinary people” to buy Bitcoin.Cointelegraph reported earlier today that the Bank of Russia is attempting to block all Bitcoin exchanges in the country. Despite the sharply negative news out of Russia today, Bitcoin continues its surge toward $5,000. This comes following a sharp drop from $5,000 to $3,000 last month, and a rapid rebound that has brought the digital currency almost back to it’s all time high.In the last month, the market first reacted to, then shrugged off, China’s ICO ban, China’s exchange ban, South Korea’s ICO ban, and now Russia’s attempt at banning Bitcoin. For the market to remain bullish in spite of the volume of bad news demonstrates just how powerful the Bitcoin bull is."

it could affect Bitcoin. 150055 Total views. 1069 ...","Dec 16, 2017","FCC head Ajit Pai has managed to deal a major blow to free and neutral Internet usage by repealing the so-called Net Neutrality laws. Effectively, this allows broadband companies the power to potentially reshape Americans’ online experiences.","Effectively, the likes of AT&T and Comcast now have the ability to block certain websites to their customers or even charge more for usage of them. Now, the broadband providers can influence what sites of the Internet are used.For Bitcoin, this could have huge implications as the digital currency operates totally online and within the sights of these companies. Bitcoin and its related sectors have also been eyed suspiciously by traditional monopolies, and their stance in the eyes of these broadband providers is yet to be known.For the everyday Bitcoin user, in the US for this instance, there is a pretty familiar pattern.The man on the street logs on to Coinbase buys his Ethereum, Bitcoin or Litecoin and operates from there. The exchange is the on-ramp and the exchange is also an easy target without Net Neutrality laws.Marvin Ammori, lawyer for the advocacy group Fight for the Future told Motherboard:“The average person goes to Coinbase to buy Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin—the average on-ramp is an exchange, and those are easy to block. If Comcast is the monopoly provider in an area, the provider could decide there’s a preferred Bitcoin exchange.”While this is still hypothetical, it essentially means a new weapon has been minted in the fight against Bitcoin. For instance, these ISPs, under the pressure of governments or other major institutions, could set in motion ways to stop access to cryptocurrency exchanges.The likes of Coinbase and other major exchanges have worked hard to grow their reputation and assure people of a safe cryptocurrency space. But if they are shut down or hindered to a point where they are unusable, many crypto-enthusiasts will be left stranded.However, if these ISPs do decide to let Bitcoin live on, there is every chance they will use their new-found power to squeeze the most out of them. Prefered Exchanges will be given preference - and preferred will no doubt mean centralized.According to Cornell University computer science professor Emin Gün Sirer, even if popular sites like Coinbase can pony up and pay a service provider for faster traffic in the name of good business, individual uses of Cryptocurrencies could still suffer.“Peer-to-peer applications may be greatly affected because they’re not in the top 100 most popular destinations on the web. Providers can make the case that supporting those non-top-100 services costs more, and users have to bear that cost.”“My worry is it will affect the ability to run your own node.”A ‘node’ is one of many computers that communicate with each other to run the decentralized network of a cryptocurrency. Throttling nodes would require a service provider to manage traffic at the IP level, and not simply look for a particular protocol.This could put an end to many’s foray into the world of cryptocurrency, shutting down the disruptive force on many different established sectors. However, those who do stay would then be forced back down the dark path of Bitcoin’s past - onto the darknet and other illegal marketplaces."

invented a “multipurpose” POW protocol that uses energy from crypto ...","Dec 18, 2017",Intel has filed a patent for a type of Blockchain system that uses energy from proof-of-work (POW) crypto mining for genetic data sequencing.,"Bitcoin has frequently been criticized for the network’s high energy use, and waste of energy is in fact one of the leading arguments for proof-of-stake (POS) protocols. Intel is seeking not to reduce Bitcoin’s energy use per se, but to harness the power that’s already being consumed to serve another purpose.Since miners would be accomplishing two tasks simultaneously -- regular crypto mining and nucleobase sequencing-- the inventors refer to this type of POW as “multipurpose.” Comparing the process to traditional Bitcoin mining, they state:“The present disclosure, by contrast [to traditional Bitcoin mining] involves a Blockchain protocol which, when implemented in a Blockchain system, enables miners to accomplish additional useful work while generating proofs of work (POWs) for new blocks. In particular, as described in greater detail below, miners determine sequences of nucleobases when generating POWs. And since a miner accomplishes additional useful work while generating a POW, the POW may be referred to as a ‘multipurpose POW,’ and the work to create the POW may be referred to as ‘multipurpose POW operations.’Based on the patent application, the SMP will utilize a nucleobase sequencing unit to determine and establish the order of the nucleobases in a given sample. The result will then be verified by the POW before being permanently recorded on their Blockchain.The SMP will be used in genetic data sequencing, particularly to determine the sequence of nucleobases in a nucleic acid (DNA or RNA, for example). The physical traits of a person, animal, or plant can be determined based on the order of its nucleobases.In their patent application -- filed in June, 2016 and published by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on December 14, 2017-- Intel inventors Ned Smith and Rajesh Poornachandran explain how their project addresses the problem of energy waste in cryptocurrency POW mining. According to their application, Intel’s SMP would use the energy spent by crypto miners generating POW to determine nucleobase sequencesAccording to the application, the results of nucleobase sequencing have many potential benefits for society,“Possibly leading to improved prevention of cancer and other diseases, improved understanding of biological ecosystems, improved tracking of populations and pathology, etc.”"

Consequently, OKEx published an official announcement on Oct. 2. In the announcement, the exchange expresses confidence in its security system, explains the possible causes of the theft, and requires users to improve their security settings.","OKEx states that its security is reliable and it has blocked all withdraw operations done by attackers. However, in order to better protect accounts, users should enable Google authentication. What’s more, OKEx lists several possible causes for the theft and provides suggestions about how to avoid other potential security threats.The full content and translation of OKEx’s announcement are provided at the bottom of the article.Security has been a serious issue since Bitcoin’s birth. For instance, in December 2013, some cyber thieves broke into Sheep Marketplace and stole 96,000 Bitcoins which were worth about $56.4 mln. Because of the very nature of Bitcoin, it can be quite difficult to store safely. This goes for exchanges, too.Unlike the traditional financial system, there is no third party that can reverse a charge or restore your account balance if you lose Bitcoins or have them stolen. Users are responsible for their own security. Bitcoin holders without professional knowledge about cryptocurrency should choose a reliable platform to save and trade their Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies.Secondly, Bitcoin holders with a large number of Bitcoins should be more vigilant about not only their accounts’ security but also their personal computers’ security. They should install the latest antivirus software and change passwords regularly. Last but not the least, Bitcoin holders should encrypt their accounts to improve the security of accounts.Full text of OKEx announcementBelow is the full text of the announcement:Several reminders about improving OKEx accounts’ securityDear OKEx Users:Lately, we have noticed some unusual login activities of a few OKEx accounts.

of Q4, now would be a good time to learn how Bitcoin futures work.","Dec 2, 2017","The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) confirmed Friday that CME Group and CBOE had met the requirements for regulated trading, while Cantor Exchange would also be able to debut Bitcoin binary options.","Futures contracts allow traders to speculate on the price of an asset without actually having to own the asset. The speculators profit by buying or selling a contract in anticipation of the asset’s price moving in a certain direction. In CME Group’s Bitcoin futures market--that they expect to have up and running by the end of Q4-each contract will represent five Bitcoins.If a trader is selling their contract, they are called a short speculator, if a trader is buying a contract, they are called a long speculator.Although there is often a minimum number of contracts that a trader must purchase, to keep this example simple, let's say Bob wants to buy one contract and the price is $50,000 ($10,000 per Bitcoin).Before Bob owns the contract, Bob will need to deposit the initial margin.  The initial margin is often called a “good faith” deposit. Similar to a down-payment, a good faith deposit is a deposit into a trader’s account that shows that the trader intends to follow through with their contract. The initial margin is a percentage of the total contract that is often around five to 10 percent of the total contract. If Bob’s initial margin is 10 percent, Bob will own the contract after he deposits $5,000 into his trading account.Now let’s assume Bob deposits $5,000 to buy the contract and is a long-speculator, meaning he believes/hopes Bitcoin price will rise above the spot price he paid for his contract--10,000 per Bitcoin.CME Group has set the tick--the minimum price movement of the trading instrument--for their Bitcoin contracts at $5.00. This means that if Bitcoin price increases by $4, Bob  will not realize a gain/loss on his contract, because $4 is below the minimum tick. However, each time Bitcoin price increases by $5, Bob will gain/lose $25 on his contract (because each contract is composed of five Bitcoin)The day after Bob Purchases his contract, let’s say Bitcoin price rises by $100 . Because Bob owns one contract,  the minimum tick is $5, and with each tick Bob earns $25, Bob will gain $500 on his contract (20*)(25)=$500.On the other hand, if Bitcoin price declined by $100 during the trading day, Bob’s would lose $500 on his contract and Bob will see the funds in his trading account diminish.Keep in mind, Bob only paid $5,000 to become the owner of a contract worth $50,000. The $40,000 that Bob did not have to pay is borrowed money, in other words, Bob’s Bitcoin contract is leveraged. Because futures contracts are highly leveraged, investing in futures is considered very risky.Now let’s imagine that after four weeks the Bitcoin index (price) increases by five percent or in other words, 500 index points. After four weeks, Bob has earned a profit of $5.00(500)=$2,500 viz. Bob has earned a 50 percent profit on his initial deposit. On the other hand, if the indexed declined by five percent Bob will lose $2,500, a 50 percent loss on his contract.The more contracts a futures trader owns, the greater that trader’s risk. If the price decreases by a significant amount it is possible for Bob to lose even more money than he initially deposited for the initial margin.Bob’s initial margin was 5,000 dollars, now instead of Bitcoin price rising by 100, let’s say Bitcoin price falls by $1,100, Bob’s account will be credited $5,500 at the end of the trading day. Now remember, Bob’s initial margin was $5,000. Because of his $5,500 dollar loss, he will be 500 dollars in debt to CME Group and will have to pay out of his own pocket to bring is trading account balance back to zero.If Bob suffers a loss or a series of losses that deplete his initial margin to an amount lower than the maintenance margin--the lowest amount of money the broker allows Bob’s account to reach before requiring Bob to replenish his account-- Bob will receive a margin call from his broker, telling him to deposit the sufficient amount of funds to return him to the initial margin amount.To mitigate some of the risk involved with Bitcoin’s volatility, the CME Group has placed price limits on Bitcoin Futures. Bitcoin futures will be subject to price fluctuation limits of seven percent, 13 percent, and 20 percent. When the price of a contract fluctuates +/- 7% to the prior settlement price--the price that Bitcoin was valued at when the market closed the previous trading day-- a  two minute monitoring period will begin where contracts will continue to trade, however, within the +/- 7% boundary. If at the end of that two minute monitoring period, the price is still at the limit down or limit up, a two minute halt on trading will begin. During the two-minute halt traders will be able to create market orders, however, they will not be fulfilled until the two minute halt period is over. Afterwards, the price limit will expand to 13 percent without a halt period and will be hard capped at 20 percent without a halt period. However, If the price fluctuates to 20 percent, trading for the rest of the day must occur within the +/- 20% limit.CME Group’s Bitcoin Futures are currently pending regulatory approval, however, if approved, CME will be launching their futures before the end of Q4. CME’s decision to launch Bitcoin futures will most likely cause a number of big banks to keep their eye on Bitcoin. The CBOE has already discussed plans to launch a Bitcoin futures market, and Nasdaq expects to launch their Bitcoin futures market in the first half of 2018. It is likely that many institutional investors are going to be keeping an eye on CME to see how Bitcoin futures pan out."

We are committed to encouraging fairness and liquidity in the Bitcoin market. To promote this, we will initially offer XBT futures trading for free.”Last month, Brian Armstrong, the CEO of the world’s largest Bitcoin brokerage and wallet platform Coinbase, revealed that at least $10 billion in institutional money are awaiting to be invested in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Armstrong wrote:“By some estimates there is $10B of institutional money waiting on the sidelines to invest in digital currency today. When we speak with these institutions, they tell us that the number one thing preventing them from getting started is the existence of a digital asset custodian that they can trust to store client funds securely.”With the scheduled launch of CBOE and CME Group’s Bitcoin futures exchanges on December 10 and December 18 respectively, large-scale institutional and retail investors in the traditional finance market will have a robust platform and infrastructure to invest in Bitcoin.Over the past year, the market valuation of Bitcoin has increased from less than a billion dollars to $195 billion, without the involvement and entrance of large-scale institutional and retail investors, hedge funds, and investment firms. If Armstrong is right, the movement of tens of billions of dollars into this market would lead to a price surge for Bitcoin, as new investors from the traditional finance market reallocate their capital from conventional assets to Bitcoin. Indeed, Bitcoin’s price could grow exponentially, as predicted by billionaire hedge fund legend Mike Novogratz.However, it should be noted that highly liquid regulated futures markets will make it much easier for large institutional investors to short Bitcoin. Though the contracts are cash-settled, major futures traders could likely move the underlying spot market. There exists the possibility that Bitcoin’s price could drop as a result of the futures markets opening.CBOE will launch its Bitcoin futures exchange through a strategic partnership with US-based regulated Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, operated by the Winklevoss twins.Tyler Winklevoss, the CEO of Gemini, explained that the company has worked for several years to build necessary infrastructure for investors in the traditional finance market, and will continue to develop a regulated derivatives Bitcoin market. Winklevoss said:“Developing a regulated derivatives market is the next logical and crucial step towards advancing the broader digital asset market. We have been working for years to build infrastructure to grow the digital asset market and today’s news marks a significant milestone.”Upon the launch of CBOE and CME’s Bitcoin futures exchanges, many leading hedge funds including the Man Group, with over $100 bln in funds under management, will begin trading Bitcoin."

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.","* BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.Mike Novogratz, the ex-macro manager at Fortress Investment Group believes there is a huge opportunity in cryptocurrencies. He reportedly plans to launch a $500 mln hedge fund, investing $150 mln of his own money into the fund, which is likely to start by the end of this year.He said that he sold his Bitcoins around $4,980 and again bought closer to $3,000 levels. But, what should we do? Let’s see.After breaking out of the downtrend line, Bitcoin consolidated in a small range Sept. 26. However, today, Sept. 27, it has resumed its upmove. $4,113.15 is the final resistance, above which, the digital currency will resume a new uptrend, which can carry it to $4,680 levels. There is a small resistance at $4,380; however, we expect it to be crossed easily.Aggressive traders who initiated long on our previous recommendation should maintain their stop loss at $3,500. New positions can be added once the digital currency breaks out and closes above $4,120.The downtrend line should offer support on any fall. Therefore, once Bitcoin breaks out of $4,120, stops can be raised to $3,750. Traders should use less than 50 percent of their usual position size.We expect bears to offer a stiff resistance at higher levels.Ethereum continues to trade within the ascending triangle, which will complete on a breakout of $311. This bullish setup has a target objective of $420.The pattern will be invalidated if the digital currency breaks down of the uptrend line. The breakdown can sink Ethereum to $240 levels.Within the triangle, the cryptocurrency is likely to be volatile. Therefore, we recommend a long position only on a breakout and close above $312. The SL can be kept just below the uptrend line at $260. Though the pattern target is $420, Ethereum may face selling pressure at $344.Therefore, traders should tighten their stop loss if the digital currency struggles to breakout of $344.  Bitcoin Cash is not showing any trend. It is likely to be range-bound between $385 and $549. It will become bullish only when it sustains above the $549 levels. Therefore, we prefer to trade other cryptocurrencies, which are forming a bullish setup.  Nevertheless, traders who want to trade Bitcoin Cash can buy at the lower end of the range at $385 with a stop loss of $350. They should book profits at the upper end of the range at $549.A fall and close below $385 can sink Bitcoin Cash to $300 levels.Ripple has broken out of the overhead resistance of $0.19537.It should now rally to $0.25000 levels. Therefore, traders can enter long positions at the current levels and on any dips towards $0.20000 levels and keep a stop loss of $0.16500.However, this is a high-risk trade because Ripple is not in an uptrend. It is forming a large bearish descending triangle pattern. Therefore, please keep the position size 50 percent of normal.After the sharp fall, Litecoin has become range bound between $44 and $57.729. If the digital currency breaks out of this range, it will start a new uptrend, which has a minimum pattern target of $72.The traders can buy on a breakout and close above $58. The initial stop loss can be kept at $44, which can be raised once the cryptocurrency moves higher.However, if the cryptocurrency fails to breakout of $58, it is likely to remain volatile within the range. Therefore, please buy only on a breakout."

He said that bets during the early days of the Internet were risky just like the investments in the digital currency market as of October 2017.,"According to Goetz, the claims that the virtual currencies are one of the disruptive technologies of today are correct. He also compared the cryptocurrencies to the Internet in the 1990s.“You could be right on the thesis that cryptocurrencies are transformative and you could make what you think is the right bet at the time, but remember one time you had Yahoo and then this thing called Google came along.”The digital currency market worldwide has registered a meteoric rise in 2017, with more than 1,000 cryptocurrencies already in circulation. Bitcoin, the leading virtual currency, posted a significant price increase as it rose by over 450 percent to almost $4,400 per token.Goetz, however, argued that Bitcoin will not remain as the top-dog digital currency forever despite its phenomenal rise. He added that Bitcoin and the other virtual currencies can be toppled by a cryptocurrency with superior technology.“Bitcoin is the most entrenched, it has very stable protocol, it doesn’t change a lot, and it has a very strong developer base, but at the end of the day, it is still software. There is some chance that something an order of magnitude better than Bitcoin, technologically, could come along.”Goetz, however, claimed that in order for a rival cryptocurrency to replace Bitcoin, it should have significantly better capabilities than the crypto top dog. He cited as an example how Facebook has toppled MySpace as the favored social media site.“It’s something like Facebook. If someone creates a new Facebook that has slightly better features, say 10 percent better. That’s great, but network effects are strong. So, that new thing isn’t going to kill Facebook.”"

i bought 40,000 Bitcoin for $40 in 2010, and as you probably know, it boomed. i am well off nowadays so to spread the wealth, i will give 1 bitcoin to 28 lucky people who retweet this. #Bitcoin #ImRich
Some Twitter users were getting well over a thousand retweets for their ridiculous claims.

This clever user noted the trend - and promised to give absolutely nothing away.
In 2012 I picked up no bitcoin. I was mostly drinking beer at the time and didn't even realize what I wasn't buying. Because of this I have decided to give 10 lucky people who RT this absolutely nothing.
  Another user offered some sage advice:
Guys, no-one who bought bitcoin for cheap is going to give it away now. Stop re-tweeting this garbage, have more respect for yourself...
  What this amusing and somewhat annoying trend proves is that a lot of people are trying to get as much as they can out of the trending Bitcoin status.
This goes for social media and the actual Bitcoin markets, as people clamor to get on the runaway train. The next two weeks will be especially telling for the cryptocurrency space, as futures are introduced to the market for the first time.
Expect the Twitter trolls to keep on troll-lol-ing for the foreseeable future.

Now, Royal Bank of Canada CEO David McKay has said his piece, questioning its point and function in society.","The Canadian bank boss sees Bitcoin as a way to move money around undetected, following in a long line of traditional investors who see Bitcoin as a dark art of currency.""The purpose Bitcoin seems to serve today is really to help move money in a hidden way and facilitate, potentially facilitate, criminal activity of moving money in an undetected way,"" McKay said.""I think some people will call it a fraud. I don't think it's fraudulent … But it doesn't solve a main need in society right now.""Because the CEO obviously works closely with fiat currency, it seems he is having difficulty in fathoming its deeper functions. McKay says he battles to see its legitimacy in comparison to other currencies.""A currency is a promissory note on a future good and service and economy. I hold a dollar, or a pound or a euro because I want to exchange it for a physical good or a service sometime in the future and I'm confident in holding that note because of the political system backing it, because of the strength of the economy, because of a central bank with reserves.""""So when you look at those characteristics and the real need for a currency, how do you apply that to a cryptocurrency? Most of those criteria don't fit; it's not backed by a government, it's not backed by the rule of law, it's not backed by economy, there's no reserve against it, you actually have to mine it in a distributed chain environment,"" said McKay.There is little doubting that Blockchain technology is here to stay, and there are many traditionalists that are getting excited about that technology while also shunning its offshoot, Bitcoin.McKay is in this same boat, backing the underpinning technology.""Most people in the world aren't talking about Bitcoin. They're talking about Blockchain, the distributed ledger private or public that underpins the Bitcoin application of it,"" said McKay.""It has a chance to transform everything from our capital markets, and our trading businesses, our security settlement businesses, right into our retail franchise. And so that technology, that ability to work in code and build solutions, are two new technologies and areas that we need."""

career. 24924 Total views. 780 ...","Nov 1, 2017","A bounty is a reward paid out for the completion of a certain task. In the “Old West,” sheriffs used to post bounties in order to encourage bounty hunters to capture dangerous criminals. This concept is alive and well in today’s world and the cryptocurrency space has made it a core concept of its very special culture. In the crypto world, bounty rewards are almost exclusively paid in Bitcoin and ICO tokens.","Bitcoin faucets are websites or apps that dispense rewards in the form of Bitcoin. Visitors can claim this reward in exchange for completing a captcha or task as described by the platform. The main revenue stream from this faucets comes from advertisements.Back in 2009, Bitcoin faucets used to pay up to three Bitcoin per hour. With today’s Bitcoin prices, that would net around $19k. It’s important to note that back then the Bitcoin price was just a fraction of a cent. Nowadays, faucets pay rewards in “Satoshis,” which is a hundredth of a millionth Bitcoin.In the ICO space, a bounty program is an offer made by many startups which enables individuals to receive compensation for performing marketing tasks, reporting bugs or improving a product or service. Blockchain startups that plan to hold a crowdsale often allocate a certain percentage of their total tokens to such a campaign.Bounties are mainly found on forums like Bitcointalk and bounty networks. There are rarely any barriers of entry at all and the only thing a bounty hunter needs to do in order to participate is submit a link to his work. This submission will then be checked by the admin of the campaign who will decide if the submission deserves a reward or not.Many ICO startups choose to hold a bounty campaign because it enables them to get tens of thousands of dollars worth of marketing impact or improvement suggestions for just a small token allocation. Additionally, bounty programs have proven to be an excellent tool to build a community around a project or service.Typically bounty campaigns consist of a variety of bounty types. These bounties range from simple retweets and Facebook likes all the way to article writing, bug bounties, and platform feature ideas. Anyone can complete these tasks and receive a portion of the bounty awards provided the submission meets minimum quality requirements. Generally, bounty campaigns contain detailed instructions explaining to the bounty hunter how to submit completed bounties and receive rewards for doing so.It is very important that a bounty hunter carefully selects what bounty campaigns he dedicates his time and effort to. Many tokens distributed in bounty programs may have no value at all. Some red flags a bounty hunter should be looking for:The times of receiving three Bitcoins an hour from faucets are long over. However, there are still lots of opportunities out there for Bounty Hunters to earn some impressive rewards.As Pascal Thellmann, Co-founder of Bounty0x pointed out in a tweet:“Bounties are becoming a major use case for cryptocurrency. Payments are instantaneous, trustless and anonymous if necessary.”With new ICOs popping up everyday and a general trend towards “tokenization,” the popularity of bounties will very likely follow the trend of cryptocurrency adoption."
127,https://cointelegraph.com,"Sep 18, 2017",Key Findings From Cambridge Cryptocurrency Study,https://cointelegraph.com/news/key-findings-from-cambridge-cryptocurrency-study,"On the exchanges examined, every single one of them traded in Bitcoin with 
Ethereum and Litecoin was the next most popular. Ripple ...","Sep 18, 2017",Cambridge University has put out a comprehensive 114-page study on cryptocurrencies that digs deep into empirical data of the digital currency world as it appears across the globe.,"Key highlights of the study include the number of users and wallets, the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry sectors and the impact the technology is having, as well as interesting information about exchanges, payments and mining.As a nascent industry, information was needed to determine how much of an impact digital currencies are producing. New companies and services have emerged to facilitate the workings of cryptocurrencies, and their data shows that it really is a virgin market.The study found that 1,876 people work full-time in the cryptocurrency industry. Of those, the most find work in Asia-Pacific with 720. Behind that is North America with 676 employees.Information on exchanges offers insight into users of digital currencies, as most people who are involved in crypto have some sort of online wallet. However, the study stated it is nearly impossible to put a figure on how many people actually use cryptocurrency.The study showed that Europe had the highest number of exchanges, followed by Asia-Pacific. As of March 2017, Bitfinex had the highest market share of all exchanges, coming in with 16 percent. However, 25 percent of the overall market share came from a combination of smaller exchanges.Overall, the US Dollar was the most widely supported national currency, appearing on 65 percent of exchanges. Euro came in second with 49 percent prevalence.On the exchanges examined, every single one of them traded in Bitcoin with Ethereum and Litecoin was the next most popular. Ripple, Ethereum Classic, Monero, Dogecoin and Dash were also widespread.What is interesting to note is that these exchanges that see millions of dollars through them can have as little as 11 employees working on them. 49 percent of exchanges have less than 11 employees.These online exchanges also predominantly operate by holding onto their users’ private keys. In fact, 73 percent of exchanges take custody of users’ cryptocurrency funds by controlling the private keys.According to the study, the number of active wallets is estimated between 5.8 mln and 11.5 mln. The large discrepancy between the range must perhaps have something to do with the difficulty in defining what an active wallet is, as many users are actively storing cryptocurrencies.The highest number of active wallet users comes from North America and Europe with both sitting at just about 30 percent.Of the active wallets, only 32 percent of them use closed source software while the other 68 are all open source with mobile wallet apps being the most widely offered to users at 65 percent.More than half of surveyed wallet providers offer integrated currency exchange services; additionally, 20 percent offer linked credit card services.However, what is more worrying is that nearly half of wallets providing currency exchange services integrate a third-party exchange, which raises questions about security.Looking at the recent crackdown on digital currencies it is interesting to note that 76 percent of incorporated wallet providers do not have a license.Mining and large mining pools have a big part to play in shaping the digital currency landscape, and because of their importance, many of them are aware of their influence and power.Over half of miners consider their ability to influence protocol development to be high or very high. This comes after recent developments with the SegWit protocol that was implemented on Aug. 1.Miners and users battled to enact different protocols, and despite half of these big mining pools thinking they have influence, they were probably outdone by the power of the individual users.However, with that, it is the bigger mining pools that still maintain that they have a larger influence on the protocols.It also makes sense to see that 58 percent of the large mining pools are based in China, and that is why it is often believed that China is the key to the Bitcoin mining operations, as well as protocol updates. The US comes in second with 16 percent.Mining revenue, despite the growth of digital currencies, has been up and down. The total Bitcoin mining revenues per year (block reward + transaction fees) if immediately converted to USD was far higher in 2014, than it was in 2016.In 2014, the total came in at $786 mln dollars while 2016 only saw $563, probably due to the increase in difficulty of mining, especially with Bitcoin.However, what did shoot up was Bitcoin transaction fees, as they topped out at $13.6 mln for the year in 2016 while the previous three years combined barely made $7 mln."

The price fell from $3,909 to $1,970 but at press time is back to $3,400.The extreme market turbulence came days after the alleged insider trading at Coinbase, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges.It’s been an extremely volatile week for the entire digital currency industry.

Buying LTC is extremely risky. I expect us to have a multi-year bear market like the one we just had where LTC dropped 90% in value ($48 to $4). So if you can't handle LTC dropping to $20, don't buy! ?Joining major institutions like CBOE and CME in their Bitcoin agenda, Goldman Sachs announced its plans to set up a cryptocurrency trading desk on December 21. It will be opened by the end of June 2018.What prompted the latest dip in the entire market is yet unknown.

wallet ...","Oct 1, 2017","We live in crazy times, don’t we?","Bitcoin, a digital currency, founded in 2009 — and which, as the name suggests, is an electronic currency and cannot be held in a physical wallet — is just about the most valuable “currency” in the world and it has been so for a few years now. Given the circumstances, it’s only normal to question the credibility of Bitcoin. Because who, in the real world, actually believes that an electronic currency, created just about seven years ago, is truly worth more than a fiat currency. Say the British pound, that has been through several economic cycles over several centuries and is still here, right?Image: tradingeconomics.comConsidering that the one British pound can only buy you 0.00032 BTC, it’s 100 percent okay for traditional investors, most of whose investments are valued in the British pound, US dollar and other fiat currencies, to think Bitcoin is a bubble. But the age of Bitcoin — that is, how long it’s been around — is the least of the reasons for that. Here’re some really popular ones.In the last two decades, we’ve witnessed two bubble busts. The dotcom bubble of the late 1990s and the housing bubble that led to the 2008 global financial crisis. For those who were affected by these two bubble busts, it was two wealth-eroding events in less than a decade. A natural response to such an unpleasant experience is defensiveness. After all, once bitten twice shy.Image: Business InsiderWhen comparing the assets that led to the dotcom and housing bubbles to Bitcoin, the odds are ridiculously against Bitcoin, at least, in the minds of traditional investors. That’s because, for the dotcom bubble, there were actual Internet companies that were, purportedly, building or selling products and services that people actually use. For instance, Pets.com, quite the most familiar flop from the dotcom bubble, was selling pet food and supplies, which people actually buy.Image: Business InsiderIn addition, the housing bubble involved real estate, which is quite essential to human existence. In essence, the dotcom and housing bubbles involved assets that the average person could relate without too much education. These attributes don’t exist with Bitcoin. It’s unlikely that it will ever replace fiat currencies, at least if you ask Olaf Carlson-Wee, Coinbase’s first employee and the founder of crypto hedge fund Polychain Capital. “It was a big mistake that any of this was ever compared to currency,” he recently told. Given this superficial, but pessimistic comment from an industry insider, traditional investors are much less likely to see the value in Bitcoin. And when you can’t see value in an asset that’s increasing in price, there’s a bubble.There are actually people who think that digital currencies are here to stay, but are worried about the security of Bitcoin. The “Wolf of Wall Street” Jordan Belfort is one of them. Belfort believes Bitcoin is a fraud and claims he knows people “who have lost all their money” to hackers.
Bitcoin followers would remember that hackers have targeted Bitcoin heavily. As a reminder, Mt. Gox, a now-defunct Bitcoin exchange, which was processing about 80 percent of all Bitcoin-to-currency transactions at a time, first suffered a multimillion-dollar theft in 2011. By the time it would stop operations in 2014, roughly $500 mln couldn’t be accounted for. Hong Kong-based Bitfinex exchange also suffered the theft of 120,000 Bitcoins last year. At the time the stolen sum was worth roughly $72 mln. At current prices, that’s over $500 mln worth of Bitcoin. That’s a potential $428 mln investment gain robbed off investors.Belfort also believes that a digital currency that will take hold will be one created by a central bank.Two of the most publicized value advantages of Bitcoin over fiat currencies are its limited supply and its decentralized nature. But that has created another problem, which has contributed to the volatility of the digital currency. The cryptocurrency was created in such way, that the total number can never exceed roughly 21 mln Bitcoins. And since there can be no direct governmental influence to stimulate value or devalue, it is up to demand and supply spectrum.Since traditional investors are used to penny stock pump and dump schemes, it’s easy to liken Bitcoin to it, in that, a group of wealthy traders could push up the price of Bitcoin by buying a lot of if — thereby stimulating demand — and then sell the digital currency at a high price, which pushes down the demand, and hence, the price. And there is no central figure to check such activities.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon made news earlier in September for calling Bitcoin a fraud at an investor conference in New York. He said he’d fire an employee for trading Bitcoin because “it’s against JP Morgan’s rules and they’re stupid.” He also pointed out that governments can crack down on Bitcoin if something goes wrong and someone gets killed, citing the recent Bitcoin crackdown by the Chinese government as an example of how governments will always be interested in taking charge of money supply. If that happens, and traditional investors fear it will, the value of Bitcoin will take a hit as it happened briefly when the Chinese government took actions against Bitcoin.As of the time of writing, there are 1,142 cryptocurrencies, and the list keeps growing. There seems to be no barrier to entry. Bitcoin’s share of the digital currency market keeps dropping. Bitcoin now owns about 48.9 percent of the digital currency market, down from nearly 90 percent in 2013.Image: CoinmarketcapGoing by the logic of stock investing, the higher the market share of a company in its industry, the more value it potentially has. Conversely, a declining market share, that’s not associated with declining prices, is a bubble. The wider the digital currency market grows, the lesser Bitcoin’s market share will be. This also makes it hard of traditional investors to understand Bitcoin’s valuation.Needless to say that some of these worries are usually overblown. No, I’m not saying that Bitcoin is rightly valued or wrongly valued right now. The point I’m trying to make is that a bit more education on Bitcoin’s pricing might help alleviate some of these worries. Cointelegraph’s “Bitcoin Price, Explained” page is a good place to start.

Bitcoiners never anticipated. Here's how that 1 MB blocksize limit got 
put ...","Sep 19, 2017","Anybody familiar with Bitcoin is aware of the vexing problem caused by the 1 MB blocksize limit and the controversy that arose over how to scale the network. It’s probably worthwhile to look back on how that limit came to exist, in hopes that future crises can be averted by a solid understanding of the past.","In 2010, when the blocksize limit was introduced, Bitcoin was radically different than today. Theymos, administrator of both the Bitcointalk forum and /r/bitcoin subreddit, said, among other things:""No one anticipated pool mining, so we considered all miners to be full nodes and almost all full nodes to be miners.I didn't anticipate ASICs, which cause too much mining centralization.SPV is weaker than I thought. In reality, without the vast majority of the economy running full nodes, miners have every incentive to collude to break the network's rules in their favor.The fee market doesn't actually work as I described and as Satoshi intended for economic reasons that take a few paragraphs to explain.""It seems that late in 2010, Satoshi realized there had to be a maximum block size, otherwise some miners might produce bigger blocks than other miners were willing to accept, and the chain could split. Therefore, Satoshi inserted a 1 MB limit into the code.And he kept it a secret.Yes, Satoshi kept this change a secret until the patch was deployed, and apparently asked those who discovered the code on their own to keep quiet. He likely kept things quiet to minimize the chances that an attacker would figure out how to use an unlimited blocksize to DOS the network.Theymos puts it:“Satoshi never used IRC, and he rarely explained his motivations for anything. In this case, he kept the change secret and told people who discovered it to keep it quiet until it was over with so that controversy or attackers wouldn't cause havok with the ongoing rule change.”It’s also likely that Satoshi never expected the 1 MB blocksize to be a problem. At the time, the average blocksize was orders of magnitude smaller than 1 MB, and it looked like there would be time enough to devise a solution. Satoshi himself said, of the blocksize limit:“We can phase in a change later if we get closer to needing it.”And again:“It can be phased in, like:if (blocknumber > 115000)maxblocksize = largerlimitIt can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade.”It’s apparent that Satoshi foresaw the removal of the blocksize limit as trivial and had no idea that such a minor code change would generate a firestorm.Bitcointalk user “kiba” presciently commented, shortly after the cap was created:“If we upgrade now, we don't have to convince as much people later if the bitcoin economy continues to grow.”In response to Satoshi’s comment that the limit could always be removed if necessary to support higher transaction capacity, Jeff Garzik pointed out:“IMO it's a marketing thing.  It's tough to get people to buy into a system, if the network is technically incapable of supporting high transaction rates.”Clearly the warnings were present.Many have asked why Satoshi didn’t create a larger blocksize, like 8 MB. The answer is three-fold:It wasn’t needed, as even 1 MB was far larger than the largest blocks that had ever been mined.It was technically easy to change, simply substituting one value in the code for another.Larger blocks create technical challenges.Back in 2010, Internet technology was such that larger blocks would not have propagated properly. In 2015, Theymos recalled:“One obvious and easy-to-understand issue is that in order to be a constructive network node, you need to quickly upload new blocks to many of your 8+ peers. So 8 MB blocks would require something very roughly like (8 MB * 8 bits * 7 peers) / 30 seconds = 15 Mbit/s upstream, which is an extraordinary upstream capacity. Since most people can't do this, the network (as it is currently designed) would fall apart from lack of upstream capacity: there wouldn't be enough total upload capacity for everyone to be able to download blocks in time, and the network would often go ""out of sync"" (causing stales and temporary splits in the global chain state).”Today’s Bitcoin uses a piece of code called Segregated Witness (SegWit) to separate signatures from transaction data, effectively allowing the network to “cheat” by creating larger blocks than 1 MB, yet still counting them as being below the cap. SegWit also fixes a vulnerability called transaction malleability, enabling the creation of something called the lightning network.The lightning network is envisioned as a way for Bitcoin users and/or merchants to open payment channels with one another in a secure and trustless fashion. Funds can be exchanged between these parties without the transactions being written to the Blockchain. This keeps the Blockchain small, capable of being served by reasonably powerful computers. The lightning network would periodically need to “anchor” to the main Bitcoin Blockchain, but would allow enormous increases in transaction capacity with very small increases in the size of the Blockchain.So far there is no working implementation of lightning network on mainnet, although there are versions on test net. Lightning network will be entirely optional, and users can choose to send ordinary transactions instead, if they so choose."

Most stocks, there is no intrinsic value because you have no true ownership rights and no voting rights. You just have the ability to buy and sell those stocks. Bitcoin is the same thing. Its value is based on supply demand. I have bought some through an ETN based on a Swedish exchange,” said Cuban.In September, immediately after JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon offered baseless condemnation on Bitcoin, it was revealed that JPMorgan Securities traded Bitcoin on behalf of its clients through custodian accounts on the Nordic Nasdaq, using the XBT Provider Bitcoin ETN.High profile investors such as Cuban and large-scale investment firms are restricted to invest through strictly regulated stock markets and investment platforms. Hence, while it is possible for Cuban and other major investors to purchase Bitcoin with personal savings on Bitcoin brokers and exchanges, with a large portfolio, it is difficult to invest directly in Bitcoin.Several leading Bitcoin brokerages including the $1.6 bln company Coinbase introduced platforms targeted at institutional and retail investors. Coinbase Custody for instance, enables investors to allocate at least $10 mln into Bitcoin. As Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong wrote:“Coinbase Custody is only available to institutional investors with a minimum of $10 mln in deposits. Retail customers can utilize Coinbase.com as a custody solution.”Armstrong added that Coinbase already stores billions of dollars worth of digital assets on behalf of the firm’s clients and retail traders.“We already store billions of dollars worth of digital assets on behalf of our customers. We serve thousands of institutions via our GDAX product, the leading digital currency exchange in the US,” said Armstrong, adding that around $10 bln in institutional money is awaiting to be invested in Bitcoin. “By some estimates, there is $10 bln of institutional money waiting on the sidelines to invest in digital currency today.”Upon the launch of Bitcoin futures exchanges by CBOE and CME, two of the largest options exchanges in the global finance market, the volume of regulated Bitcoin investment instruments such as ETNs on Nordic Nasdaq and GBTC will spike, as demand from the traditional finance market surges over time."

We are now building a new home,” Sloggett said.Bitcoin has been beneficial for Sloggett in both helping him freeing himself from the debt of his mortgage, but even originally, it was the banking rules that made it difficult to transact internationally that drew him to digital currencies.It all started with his supplement business and the need for international transactions to purchase supplements for the store. Sloggett said he moved to Bitcoin about five years ago because of the expense of paying thousands of dollars in fees for exchange through the banks, as well as the time taken to make settlements.Because banks held such hegemony over money and transactions, there was never anywhere else to go, but with Bitcoin coming to the fore as a disruptive technology, banks are starting to look seriously outdated.Sloggett is a new face for the digital currency, proving there is a huge benefit in adopting this new technology if done right.

Gold fork, there will ultimately be 63 mln coins in existence. This is ...","Oct 9, 2017","There’s been some panic lately over the various “forks” of the Bitcoin network, particularly among the less tech-savvy who hear inaccurate or incomplete news on the mainstream media. It’s important to clear up some confusion, because there are more so-called “forks” coming.","First, the most important thing to know is this: there will only ever be 21 mln Bitcoin in existence. Period. End of story.There have been and will continue to be currencies that fork from the Bitcoin network, taking with them a full snapshot of the network up until that point. Yet there’s still only one Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin-anything-else, none of them have interoperability with the real Bitcoin network.Bitcoin skeptics have been telling people that with the Bitcoin Cash fork, there will now be 42 mln Bitcoin in existence. It won’t be long before they start claiming that with the upcoming Bitcoin Gold fork, there will ultimately be 63 mln coins in existence. This is complete falsehood.Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold cannot be spent on the Bitcoin network. As far as Bitcoin’s network is concerned, they are merely altcoins like Litecoin, Dash, and so on. They are not Bitcoin and cannot make the argument that they are. There is only one Bitcoin, and there will only ever be 21 mln coins on that network.Many less sophisticated investors get worried every time they hear about an upcoming fork. Calm down: there’s nothing wrong with a fork. Bitcoin and numerous altcoins have successfully forked countless times over the years with no ill effects. In fact, the currency Dash executes a carefully staged hard fork (called the “spork”) every time it does a protocol upgrade. None of these forks have ever caused a chain split.There are two types of forks: soft forks and hard forks. Soft forks are backwards-compatible, meaning that upgraded nodes can use the new features, while old nodes will still function but won’t have the new capabilities. Bitcoin’s recent SegWit upgrade is a great example of a soft fork.With SegWit, not all nodes were required to upgrade their software. Anybody who doesn’t want to use SegWit’s features (namely, lower fees) is free to continue using their older version of the Bitcoin client. It will still work just fine.A hard fork is the exact opposite: all nodes must upgrade. Any node that doesn’t upgrade will simply not work anymore. The real danger is this: soft forks are reversible, because following the new rules is optional. Hard forks are not reversible, and any bug in the code or unanticipated behavior on the network can only be fixed by issuing another hard fork. This can lead quickly down a deep rabbit hole.The worst-case scenario in a hard fork situation is a chain split. A chain split occurs when a hard fork goes poorly and the network itself splits in two. Part of the network follows one set of rules, while the other part follows another set of rules. Chain splits are incredibly dangerous and essentially make the network unusable until the split is resolved by another hard fork. With a network and economy as large as Bitcoin’s, it would be extremely difficult to execute a follow-on hard fork to fix a chain split.A bad enough chain split could literally kill Bitcoin.When it became obvious the SegWit solution was going to be the winner in Bitcoin’s civil war, a group of disgruntled developers decided to create an alternate version of Bitcoin. This version, called Bitcoin Cash, would keep Bitcoin’s entire transaction history and all of its rules and structures. Only three things would be changed: the 1 MB blocksize limit would be increased, the SegWit code would be removed, and an “emergency difficulty adjustment” (EDA) was added.Due to the nature of the fork, everybody who owned Bitcoin now owned an equivalent amount of Bitcoin Cash. Yet the two networks did not directly compete with one another. For one, Bitcoin Cash added a feature called “replay protection,” which prevented transactions on one network from affecting the other network.Another reason for the lack of direct competition is because virtually all Bitcoin’s miners continued to mine Bitcoin, except for a few hours here and there when they were able to exploit Bitcoin Cash’s EDA for greater profits. Most Bitcoin owners, finding themselves flush with Bitcoin Cash, either sold the new currency or completely ignored it.There was never any danger of Bitcoin Cash replacing Bitcoin. In fact, Bitcoin Cash was probably a good thing in the long run, because it removed discontents from the Bitcoin community by giving them their own altcoin to run.Bitcoin Gold is an upcoming fork of Bitcoin that will occur on or around Oct. 25, 2017. As with Bitcoin Cash, when the fork officially occurs, Bitcoin owners will also possess an equal number of Bitcoin Gold coins. As with Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin owners who find themselves in possession of Bitcoin Gold may either do nothing and keep the new coins, or may sell them and potentially increase their stash of Bitcoin (assuming the new coin is worth anything).Just as with Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold will be an altcoin. Bitcoin Gold will feature replay protection as well, and since virtually no miners will leave the Bitcoin network to mine Bitcoin Gold, it will not threaten Bitcoin’s network in any way. There is zero chance that Bitcoin Gold will “take over” or “kill” the main Bitcoin chain.Bitcoin Gold is a protest of the growing power and centralization of miners. Bitcoin miners continue to use more and more powerful specialized ASIC computers to mine Bitcoin. These ASICs are extremely expensive and benefit greatly from economies of scale, resulting in greater centralization on the Bitcoin network. At present, a handful of miners (or mining pools) control the majority of Bitcoin’s mining power.Bitcoin Gold will be changing the consensus rules for its new network by using a different algorithm for mining. This change in algorithm will keep ASICs from working, resulting in miners using easier-to-obtain GPUs. This change is expected to decrease miner centralization on the Bitcoin Gold network.Again, it should be emphasized that Bitcoin Gold will not affect Bitcoin in any way. Bitcoin Gold will be an altcoin, with its own network and its own rules.While Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold are technically forks of Bitcoin, they don’t affect Bitcoin’s network in any way. They are not a threat in any way. They simply use (most of) Bitcoin’s code, and they distribute their currency proportionally to all Bitcoin holders.Considering that the term “fork” is usually associated with an attempt to upgrade a network, using that word to describe Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold tends to get quite confusing for novices. A better word might be “airdrop.”An airdrop is a means of distributing the initial supply of coins when an altcoin is created. Byteball is a great example; users link their Byteball address to their Bitcoin address(es), and at certain times, they receive a number of Byteball tokens proportional to their Bitcoin ownership. Given that the only thing Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold are using the Bitcoin Blockchain for is initial token distribution, they really act more like airdrops than forks.Don’t worry. None of these forks in any way harm the Bitcoin network. They aren’t increasing Bitcoin’s supply. How could they? They aren’t Bitcoin!"

Bitcoin Gold has released their source code. We are currently working on developing support for TREZOR.

You will be able to split your BTG from BTC once our claim tool is ready, assuming you held BTC on TREZOR before block 491407. The Bitcoin Gold hard fork was expected to occur in late October, led by Jack Liao, CEO of LightningAsic. The initial goal of Bitcoin Gold was to provide an ecosystem wherein mining is more decentralized across a larger community by closing the gap between GPU or CPU miners and ASIC miners.As Bitcoin developer and Paxos principal architect Jimmy Song wrote:“The goal of BTG is to become a better gold than Bitcoin. The chief way they have decided to do this is trying to solve miner centralization through a proof-of-work change. Changing proof-of-work is generally going to require a hard fork and BTG has decided to go that route. The proof-of-work that they’ve chosen is Equihash, a memory-hard algorithm that’s fairly ASIC resistant and also used by ZCash.”The launch of Bitcoin Gold has been delayed for many weeks, and as a result, their development team has struggled to provide a specific date for the execution of the hard fork. After weeks of delay, the Bitcoin Gold development team has released their source code on GitHub, officially initializing the project.Some of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in the Bitcoin sector including ShapeShift, Bithumb, Bitfinex and Bittrex adopted Bitcoin Cash relatively quickly subsequent to its hard fork in August. This provided useful price discovery for the market and created a way for Bitcoin investors to easily sell their Bitcoin Cash tokens.However, because of the lack of both community and industry support behind the Bitcoin Gold hard fork, major businesses and trading platforms are currently reluctant toward integrating support for Bitcoin Gold. At present, the only trading platform that will likely process Bitcoin Gold trades is Bitfinex, as it already has introduced Bitcoin Gold futures market on its trading platform.For the most part, the reluctance towards the Bitcoin Gold hard fork from the community comes from the Bitcoin Gold development team’s decision to include a premine mechanism, wherein developers are able to mine BCG before miners in the market can begin producing BCG.Tim Enneking, managing director of Crypto Asset Management, stated:""Miners control too much of the space to allow Bitcoin Gold to be successful – at least in the near term.”Following its debut, Bitcoin Cash price stabilized at around $300. However, once the SegWit2x project was canceled, Bitcoin Cash surged as high as $2,600 before falling to half that level. Even with support from Bitmain, the largest Bitcoin mining manufacturer and operator of the largest Bitcoin mining pool in the industry, Bitcoin Cash debuted at $300.Given the lack of community and industry support for Bitcoin Gold, it is unlikely that BCG will debut at a value higher than the initial value of Bitcoin Cash at $300.More important, because Bitcoin Gold lacks strong replay protection, only a handful of companies, wallet platforms and exchanges including Trezor will add support for Bitcoin Cash, restricting the market and liquidity of BCG."

I also know that Bitcoin has a rather complicated governance model. At first, it seems rather simple: miners have the final say on which code changes to accept because that’s the way Nakamoto consensus works. The longest chain is the winner, the end. Full stop.There are those who argue that even more important than miners are the “economic actors.” Supporters of a proposed user-activated soft fork, which never occurred, had argued:“There are strong economic incentives in the Bitcoin system for nodes to cooperate and remain in consensus to prevent chain splits. If the economic majority is signaling as of Aug. 1st, miners have many incentives to follow along. Not following along would make it difficult to sell coins mined after August 1st as the blocks would not be accepted by the economic majority. Essentially, miners would be producing an altcoin not recognized by users and exchanges, making them less useful and in lower demand.”This is an interesting point-of-view, and while it’s unlikely that exchanges and wallets would choose to go a different way from the overwhelming majority of hashpower, I’ll leave that argument for others to sort out.Then, of course, there are the merchants and their payment processors, such as BitPay, whose opinions must be taken into account. Finally, but not least of all, are the end-users of Bitcoin. Their support is most important of all, yet from a technical standpoint, they essentially have no say in the matter.I won’t rehash the four-year scalability drama here, but suffice it to say that Bitcoin was divided into two camps: the big blockers and the small blockers. The big blockers wanted just that--an increase to Bitcoin’s 1 MB blocksize. They also believed in on-chain scaling, such that all transactions occur on Bitcoin’s Blockchain. Now and forever more.The small blockers were looking for a more elegant and permanent solution, and they eventually settled on a code called Segregated Witness (SegWit). This code separated the signatures from the transaction data in each block, then only counted the transaction data as subject to the 1 MB cap. SegWit also allows off-chain scaling through something called the Lightning Network. Transactions would occur off the Blockchain between parties on the Lightning Network, while periodically being “settled” on Bitcoin’s Blockchain. This solution would theoretically allow virtually unlimited scaling.Neither group could gain more than about 40 percent support from miners, so at the appropriately named Consensus conference in May, both sides agreed to a compromise. SegWit would be activated in August, and Bitcoin’s blocksize would be doubled in November. Over 80 percent of miners agreed to this compromise, and the activation of SegWit was successfully accomplished on schedule.There’s one interesting twist to this story, however. An overwhelming majority of Bitcoin’s miners and Bitcoin-based companies agreed to the plan, but Bitcoin’s core development team refused to get on board. Core supported SegWit and were delighted when it activated. But they will not support any increase of the blocksize in November.Now all Hades is breaking loose, because some of the signatories of the agreement, such as Bitwala and F2Pool, are reneging. They will not go through with the doubling of the blocksize in November, no matter what the supermajority of miners decides.Following the “Breaking Bitcoin” conference in Paris recently, famous Bitcoin investor Tuur Demeester tweeted:Hardly any NYA representation (segwit2x) at the most technical Bitcoin conference of the year. https://t.co/oDt14KptM4Since the blocksize increase would require a hard fork to carry out, an overwhelming majority of miners would have to agree to it. Even just a few miners withdrawing their support could doom the plan.I frankly couldn’t care less whether the blocksize is increased to 2 MB or not, and I can’t imagine that it would make much of a difference in the long run in any event. But what I do care about is Bitcoin’s ability to solve future, unforeseen problems. The project we call “Bitcoin” is more than a network and more than computer code; it’s a diverse ecosystem of countless individuals and groups with varying motivations and different incentives.Withdrawing one’s support from important agreements erodes trust within the community. Parties that don’t trust each other have a difficult time compromising and meeting possible future challenges.What will be the next crisis? What happens if Bitcoin faces something potentially catastrophic, like the creation of a true quantum computer capable of running Shor’s algorithm? Will we be able to implement Lamport signatures quickly enough, if nobody in the community trusts one another?Trust is one of the most precious resources in the universe, and once betrayed, it grows back ever so slowly. Parties that don’t trust one another won’t work with each other and won’t sacrifice a little of their own interests for the greater good. If Bitcoin is going to become as huge as we all believe, we can be assured that there will be even more serious, possibly existential, crises in the future. Now is the time to for the signatories of the New York Agreement to decide if they are as good as their word, or if they can’t be trusted to keep their promises--neither those of today nor of tomorrow."

Could this result in a shift to Bitcoin, the digital safe haven, in the Middle East?","Saudi Arabia has initiated a sweeping crackdown, ostensibly against corruption, today. King Salman has ordered the arrest of senior princes and ousted many senior officials from ministerial roles. The list of people arrested includes Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the richest Arab in the world.Prince Alwaleed was in the news recently for his negative views on Bitcoin, saying that Bitcoin would face an Enron-like collapse. While the public reason given by King Salman for the arrests is his drive against corruption, many commentators believe that the King could be clearing the route for his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to take over as the King.From early June 2017, Qatar's neighbors - Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and UAE have imposed a blockade on the country, accusing the country of harboring Islamic militants and maintaining a relationship with Iran, Saudi Arabia's staunch enemy.Qatar is a small country in the Middle East, with large natural gas reserves. According to the World Bank, it is the country with the highest per capita GDP based on purchasing power parity ($127.5K in 2016). It will also play host to the 2022 Fifa World Cup.Many believe that the actual reason for Qatar's neighbors imposing a blockade is Qatar's support for Al Jazeera, a news organization which has aired views contrary to the established position in the Middle East. Given the absolute power enjoyed by governments in the Middle East, an independent news channel in the region has raised many hackles.Bahrain is one of the smallest economies in the oil-rich Middle East, with its GDP five percent the size of that of Saudi Arabia. Its economy is oil dependent and the recent lull in oil prices has resulted in its economy getting strained.The Central Bank of Bahrain has pegged its currency to the US dollar (0.376 Bahrain Dinar = 1 US dollar), but this has come under strain with dwindling foreign currency reserves. According to Bloomberg, Bahrain has approached Saudi Arabia for support to stave off a financial crisis and impending devaluation. Currency devaluation in Bahrain would spark a contagion effect in the Middle East, where most currencies are pegged to the US dollar.Misconduct by governments, either in the political or monetary space, results in people trying to find safe havens for their wealth. Traditionally this has been gold, but Bitcoin is fast developing as an alternate safe haven, with its decentralized and boundary-less nature.The Middle East is strategically important, both because of its vast oil and natural gas reserves and the tremendous wealth of its citizens. If rich sheikhs in the Middle East think that parking a fraction of their wealth in Bitcoin makes sense given the uncertainty in the region, Bitcoin's price could scale new highs."

Wine prices grew by 25% in the last year and 231% in the past decade.From dominating the rankings over the past few years, classic cars have only appreciated in value by 2% in the last year despite prices have risen by 362% over the past 10 years, while prices of watches have appreciated by 4% and 65% in the past 12 months and over the past decade respectively.Using data from sources including AMR, Stanley Gibbons, HAGI, Wine Owners and the Fancy Color Research Foundation, the Knight Frank Luxury Investment Index, launched in 2013, calculates inflation like a consumer price index.It puts, for example, prime central London property as having depreciated by 6% in the last 12 months despite the market having risen by 38% during the last 10 years. It also puts gold prices as having fallen by 5% though bullion prices have risen by a massive 362% since 2007.Chinese ceramics have been down by 12%, continuing the downward trend over the past five years owing to the slowdown in the Chinese economy while prices of antique furniture fell by an average of 3% within the same period.Colored diamonds have stagnated in price overall though blue diamonds have risen in value by 5.5% over the past year and since 2007, prices of stamps have risen by 103%, according to specialists Stanley Gibbons.Fine art appreciated by an average of 7% and collectible coins rose by 4% over the past year though their prices have increased by 182% since 2007, with rare coins from Islamic countries cited as among the biggest risers.Bitcoin prices, on the other hand, have risen more than 400% in the past 12 months. They started the year at about $968 and have increased to the current rate of over $4000. This is due to the various advantages digital currency brings over the fiat monetary system which imposes capital controls on the amount of money that can be transacted at a given time in some cases, and daily limits by banks and freezing of accounts in other instances.Bitcoin also enables global reach, which is especially important in those countries with high inflation rates who fall back on it as a store of value.Several other factors make Bitcoin a better and more attractive investment option including the liberty it gives the users to create their own banks through secure Bitcoin wallets. Hopefully, the reality will sink deeper with time and Bitcoin will become the darling of those seeking a viable investment alternative."

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.","The huge volatility in Bitcoin on Nov. 29 caught a number of novice investors off-guard. This serves as a reminder to the traders that cryptocurrency trading should be taken seriously. Additionally, this fall is likely to renew the debate among the believers and the non-believers.Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize winner, went as far as to demand a ban on Bitcoins. On the other hand, John McAfee, founder of McAfee Associates, has gone ahead and raised his target on Bitcoin to $1 mln by the end of 2020.Nonetheless, other than for the long-term investor, these sky-high targets are unlikely to be of much use. The trader is more concerned about the next 20-40 percent move. So, let’s try to jump into the charts and attempt to forecast the next direction.On Nov. 25, I had forecast a rally to $9,969, which proved to be a very conservative target. Bitcoin launched a vertical rally on Nov. 24, which peaked on Nov. 29 at $11,420.82 levels.Vertical rallies are unsustainable and lead to a crash. Hence, it is good that the rally stalled. The present correction is likely to find support at the resistance line of the ascending channel. The trendline,  green color on the chart, also coincides with the channel support. So, I expect the zone of $8,750 to $9,100 to act as a formidable support.If, however, the bears succeed in breaking down this support, the 20-day EMA at $8,530 will act as the next support, below which a decline to $8,000 is possible.On the upside, yesterday’s high of $10,570.49 and the lifetime high of $11,420.82 will act as a stiff resistance.The volatility is likely to remain high for another four to five days when both the bulls and the bears will try to establish their supremacy. Thereafter, I expect the volatility to subside.The risk to reward ratio in the current volatile environment is not conducive for trading. Hence, I don’t recommend any trade today. It is better to stay safe and preserve capital than lose money in the whipsaws.Luckily, we had booked 50 percent profits on the existing positions in Ethereum at $483 levels. I had been expecting a retest of the breakout levels, but I had not envisaged a fall below $393. Therefore, I had recommended an SL of $390. Nevertheless, I was proven wrong and the SL was hit yesterday.    However, the ascending triangle pattern is still intact. If Ethereum manages to stay above the $393 levels, it is likely to resume its uptrend and attempt a rally towards its pattern target of $652.On the other hand, if the digital currency breaks down of $390, it is likely to slide to $350. Below this, a fall to $290 is also possible.I will prefer to stay on the sidelines and watch the setup develop over the next two days before any trade.     I had forecast a rally to $1,827 and $2,056 on Bitcoin Cash in my previous analysis. However, the digital currency could not breakout of the $1,758 levels.After trading within a range of $1,507 to $1,758, the virtual currency broke down on Nov. 28.Currently, the bulls are attempting to take support at the 20-day EMA. If this level breaks down, a fall to $1,150 is likely. This is the final support, below which, the decline can extend to the 50-day SMA at $827.On the other hand, if the buyers step in at the 20-day EMA, a retest of $1,507 and $1,758 is likely.A very risky trade setup is a buy above $1,420 with a stop loss of $1120. The target objective on the upside is a retest of $1,758 levels. Only aggressive traders should take a shot at this trade and with only 50 percent of the normal position size.I had anticipated a rally to $0.3 on Ripple; however, it could not cross the $0.28 mark. From there, it plunged back to the critical support of $0.22.I expect the $0.22 levels to hold, at least in the short-term. The rebound is likely to face a stiff resistance at $0.25 levels, which is the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the fall from $0.281 to $0.2195. Just a few days back also, $0.25 had acted as a strong resistance.Once above this level, a rally to $0.28 and thereafter to $0.3 is likely.Contrarily, if the $0.22 level breaks down, it can sink Ripple to $0.18 levels. Aggressive traders can attempt to go long at $0.251 and keep a stop loss of $0.218. The target objective on the upside is $0.28 and $0.3. This is a risky trade; hence, the position size should be less than 50 percent of usual.In my previous analysis, I had suggested a probable retest of the lifetime highs, which proved to be correct.However, only the nimble-footed trader would have benefitted from the rise, because the digital currency plunged to about $76 levels on the same day.The positive news is that the 20-day EMA has not broken down, which keeps the uptrend intact.The next rally will face resistance at the $93 levels and at the lifetime highs. On the other hand, a decline is likely to take support at the 20-day EMA. However, if this support breaks, a fall to $64, to the 50-day SMA is possible.I will wait for the volatility to subside before recommending any trade.I had forecast a price target of $650 for Dash in my previous analysis, which was easily surpassed. In fact, this is one of the rare cryptocurrencies that was left untouched in the overall cryptocurrency market Nov. 29.Currently, Dash is at the resistance line of the ascending channel, which is likely to be a difficult level of cross.I expect a couple of days of consolidation before the bulls attempt to resume the uptrend.The breakout and close above the ascending channel gives it a pattern target of $960.On the other hand, any correction is likely to find support at the trendline of the ascending channel, around the $680 mark.However, at the current levels, I don’t find any setups on the charts that offer a good risk to reward trading opportunity. Therefore, I have no recommendations a trade on it so far.* BTC/USD, ETH/USD, LTC/USD and BCH/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange."

Combined, they increase the risk profile for Blockchain asset investors.But with increased risk, the potential for reward should increase as well. In this post we explore one method professional traders use to handle volatility and liquidity issues and explore ways to profit from these inefficiencies.Volatility is driven by uncertainty. Some strategies, however, profit from volatility and even illiquidity. At the same time these strategies help mitigate market inefficiencies and should be rewarded for that.Mean-reversion is the assumption that a stock's price will tend to move toward its average price over time. In other words, deviations from the average price could be exploited for profit, based on the knowledge that the price should tend to revert to the mean in time.A simple implementation of this strategy is to quote both a sell and a buy price, like a market maker. If the market is in fact mean reverting, then the strategy profits from the difference between the buy and sell price. The difference is also called the quoted spread.Mean-reversion strategies trade the market as if the market oscillates around a fair price for an asset. The swings are driven by the uncertainty of other market participants or illiquidity at different market levels. Mean-reversion strategies bridge the gap between buyers and sellers and can expect to generate a profit from that.This strategy is most effective in markets that are both high in volatility and are mean reverting. Volatility measures the size of the market’s swings. With high volatility, market swings are large and the mean-reversion strategy has a high probability of generating a profit. In markets with low volatility only small spreads are possible and the strategy is less profitable.The best market scenario for mean-reversion is a sideways market with large volatility or market swings. This market scenario is damaging for trend-following strategies but profitable for market making or mean-reversion strategies.The figure below shows an example of a profitable trading day using a mean-reversion strategy. At the beginning of the day, both buy and sell orders are placed in the market. The day develops and volatility drives a random walk of the price.Throughout the day, the strategy buys one Bitcoin at $4377.70. At some point later during the day, you sell this Bitcoin at $4421.48 and generate a profit of 1%. From this profit, fees have to be added or deducted. Some exchanges charge as little as 2.5 basis points for providing liquidity using such passive strategies.Source: Kraken, 02/10/17, Buy: $4377.70, Sell: $4421.48As we have already learned, mean-reversion strategies capitalize on the spread between buy and sell prices. These are usually placed around a mid price. The mid price incorporates all assumptions about the true price. For example, if the market exhibits large trends, these would be considered to adjust the mid price.In general, buy and sell orders are determined byBuy/Sell = Mid Price +/- SpreadThe spread is determined largely by the market’s volatility and the skew of the its returns. The skew is determined by the probability of up or down moves of the market. Such moves are usually not equally probable and therefore the spread is adjusted.The volatility determines the size of the spread. With a high volatility, buy and sell orders are executed with a higher probability because the market shows larger price swings. On the other hand, if the volatility is small, the buy and sell might not be hit and the strategy keeps a long or short position, i.e. either ends up holding the underlying asset or holding cash and being short the asset.To measure the volatility σ of cryptocurrency markets, usually an exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) is applied with:The recursion is usually initiated with the variance over the first 10 days. λ determines the half-life of the EWMA system. The half-life is the time required for the system to forget half of its former value. With daily data, the half-life is usually set to 10 days and therefore λ set to 0.93.The figure below shows the annualized volatility for Bitcoin prices as estimated by the EWMA model. Bitcoin is fluctuating around an annualized volatility of 116%.To test the mean-reversion strategy we explored to quote buy and sell prices every day since the inception of Bitcoin through the end of September 2017.. All data is taken from Cryptocompare. Given a 116% average volatility, we chose the quoted spread as 1% between buy and sell prices. If returns would be normally distributed this spread would be hit with a probability of 99.6% over, for example, 10 days.Of course, Bitcoin returns do not follow a normal distribution. So what is the likelihood that a trader could both buy and sell Bitcoin over the course of 10 days and earn 1% each day?Based on our data, this strategy would have been successful in 2297 out of 2615 days, or 87.84% of the time.For this backtest, we calculated the buy and sell orders on +/- 0.5% of the last closing price and compared this price with the highs and lows over the course of the next 10 days. Of course, this strategy would result in some large long or short positions in Bitcoin. In fact, for 189 of the days, the strategy would have sold Bitcoin, but not bought. And for 129 of the days, the strategy bought Bitcoin, but did not sell it. The main reason for this is the large upward trend in Bitcoin prices.To account for the trend in Bitcoin prices, we use the moving average return as an estimate and arbitrarily chose the look-back as 60 days, based on a previously published strategy. We also tested other look-back periods which produced similar results, and the look-back of 60 days is in the range of general trend-following strategies.Adding the moving average to shift the spread increases the number of days the mean-reversion strategies buys Bitcoins and reduces the number of days that it only sells Bitcoins. Therefore the strategy ends up with a long position in Bitcoin rather than a short position.In total, this strategy would have made 1% profit on 2288 days out of 2615. On 327 days, the strategy either only sold Bitcoin or only bought Bitcoin. Adjusting the mid-price for trend resulted in more days that the strategy only bought Bitcoin and therefore accumulated Bitcoin over time. As an additional rule, the strategy could sell the additional Bitcoin at the end of each month or even keep them as a market position.A trader can improve this strategy by considering the volatility estimate and adjusting the spread. With higher volatility estimates, the strategy would aim to profit from a larger spread and vice versa.Other models use more sophisticated supervised learning algorithms to predict market movements. While some search for trading signals in order books, others use market news as an input to make directional predictions (Li et al., 2014; Kanagal et al., 2017).When trading a mean-reversion strategy, the liquidity of the market has to be considered. Here we did not consider any limitations to the ability to trade at the quoted prices. Obviously, that is not always the case and largely depends on the deployed capital.Trading a mean-reversion strategy also plays a crucial role to establish efficient market mechanisms. While efficiency has already improved dramatically over the recent years, cryptocurrency markets still face fundamental issues that are typical for any new market.Illiquidity, matching inefficiencies and unstable spreads are frequent symptoms that can be observed across all currently available exchanges. Mean-reversion strategies provide additional liquidity to the market and therefore resolve these frictions. They bridge the liquidity gap, for which they get paid.Market making strategies extend mean-reversion strategies, in that they trade on the spread many times a day with relatively large volumes on both sides of the trade. Market making strategies provide the liquidity that is essential for any well-functioning financial system. Abrupt spikes of demand or supply, like when traders either buy or sell large volumes, are absorbed by market makers.Any successful Bitcoin buy order requires a seller who is willing to take the opposite side and sell the particular volume of coins to the quoted price. The exchange (broker) matches both parties to make the trade happen.This frequently leads to order delays and varying fulfilment prices, at the cost of traders. By placing orders at each side of the trade, market makers have the capacity to make more trades happen and thereby eliminate fulfillment delays. Bitcoin markets still observe very unstable spreads, which are absorbed by the market makers.By fixing bid and ask prices for other traders, market makers profit from keeping spreads low and stable. The more liquidity they provide, the narrower and more stable the spread becomes.Mean-reversion strategies are very profitable in high volatility markets and can be adjusted for trends. This strategy can be easily applied to Bitcoin trading and improve the performance of a buy-and-hold strategy. The mean-reversion strategy would post buy and sell quotes around the current market level and earn the spread.Since the strategy is independent of the market level, it can add an independent performance to a buy-and-hold strategy. As an example, the strategy could use 1% of the portfolio assets and then aim to earn an additional 1% per day on this part of the portfolio. Historically, this strategy would have added 24% per year to the portfolio performance.Mean-reversion strategies are providing liquidity to the market. On the other hand, these strategies might end up long or short the asset, if the market does not revert to the mean. In that case they are taking a market position. On the other hand, providing liquidity should earn these strategies a potential profit that rewards the trader for his risk. Market making strategies extend mean-reversion strategies by quoting bid-ask spreads more frequently.Thanks to Bosse Rothe for his valuable contribution to this article.Dr. Philipp Kallerhoff is a Founder at Protos Cryptocurrency Asset Management.

However, negative news followed by a correction also had an impact on the leading cryptocurrency.During trading time on Wednesday, Bitcoin dropped to $5,100 after the US Commodity Futures Trading Commision announced that tokens were to be equated with stock goods. If this happens, cryptocurrencies risk being observed more closely and regulated more strictly. In addition to frightening prospects coming from the US, investors were greatly influenced by the congress of the Chinese Communist Party, which can lead to more regulatory decisions.Despite another attempt at influencing the cost of Bitcoin, we observe an increase back to $5,700 levels and a continuing uptrend before the upcoming fork.At 5:22 UTC, Ethereum planned technical hard fork updates to a set of protocols (EIP) to improve the platform. After the updates, ETH cost exceeded $350 in the momentum.However, Ethereum software, which supports Byzantium, was withdrawn from publication over the past few days due to some code errors. Developers made the necessary corrections in due time, but the Ethereum cost dropped to its recent minimums at the $300 level despite these events.Ethereum hit this week’s record high beyond $350 and is now trading at $310. Currently, there are some bearish tendencies for this crypto asset.Its resistance level is still at the $340 level, further increase in Ethereum cost is expected after it has breached this level. The nearest support level is between $285 and $290.All the expectations and forecasting of the situation ahead with regard to Ethereum depends on its success or problems arising from the network updates. Another attempt to decrease prices below $300 is likely. Then we are expecting a continuing price growth, with a potential $365 price target in case of a successful update. Should there be any problems, a drop to $275-$280 is to be expected.Along with the growing Bitcoin, Litecoin has also reached this week's high of $70, breaching $55 and $60 resistance levels. In the past, we predicted a $65 target in case it would leave the traded range.As of now, Litecoin is trading at $61. As far as LTC is concerned, there is a shift from “bearish” to “bullish” moods and purchases are slightly higher than sales. LTC quickly restored its positions after a local correction to the $52 level.A movement in flat within the $57 to $65 range is a highly probable scenario if there is no significant local correction for Bitcoin. The conservative area for sales following the speculative purchase of Litecoin is near the upper boundary. Sales within the $48 to $50 ranges are possible."

Yet these “experts” fail to consider one possibility that some in the Bitcoin community are beginning to suspect: mass adoption may be imminent.","First, let’s get something out of the way. Yes, with every bubble there are people who insist that it really isn’t a bubble. It’s “the new normal” or “a new paradigm.” Perhaps the most infamous such example is that of Yale economist Irving Fisher. At the height of the 1929 stock market bubble, just before the crash, a jubilant Fisher proclaimed:“Stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau.”He couldn’t have been more wrong.History is replete with examples of financial bubbles that popped disastrously. Britain’s South Sea bubble came about in the early 1700s, when investors became convinced that the South Sea Company, which was given a monopoly on trade with South America, would produce enormous profits. Their hopes were dashed, and the entire economy shaken, when the bubble popped and the value of South Sea Company stock bottomed out.The Mississippi bubble was caused when financier John Law convinced the French regent of a plan to pay off France’s massive debts. In 1716, Law’s Mississippi Company agreed to assume the entire French national debt in return for a complete monopoly on all trade and mineral wealth in France’s Louisiana territory.Seeing no way to lose, and spurred to a frenzy by Law’s marketing, investors drove the price of Mississippi Company stock sky high. When Law realized the bubble had gotten out of hand, he tried to gradually deflate his stock price. Unfortunately, this resulted in a complete collapse of the company and wrecked the French economy.Tulip mania is arguably the most famous bubble in history. In the 1630s, Dutch traders drove the price of tulip bulbs to absurd levels. As prices kept rising, retail investors got involved in futures trading, betting on the price continuing to rise. At the bubble’s peak, the price of a single tulip bulb was equal to the price of a riverfront home in Amsterdam.Eventually the price stopped going up, people began to sell, and the price of tulip bulbs dropped to near zero. The panic was so severe that the Dutch government offered to buy underwater futures contracts for 10% of the contracts’ value, but continued price declines forced the government to withdraw its promise.The two most famous bubbles of recent times are the dot-com bubble of the late-1990s/early-2000s and the housing bubble of the mid-2000s.In the case of the dot-com bubble, people were so drawn to the potential of the Internet that they invested in any company with a “.com” in its name. Venture capital and over-subscribed IPOs loaded these companies with so much cash that they didn’t have to turn a profit right away.Often with no business model at all, dot-com companies believed that if they attracted enough users, they would eventually find a way to profit. They were wrong, and the vast majority of them went bankrupt, tanking the value of the NASDAQ index.The recent housing bubble was triggered by government policies and loose credit, enabling people to buy houses that were far beyond their financial means. Seeing the demand, banks created derivatives which gave investors more ways to get exposure to the growing housing sector. These derivatives added more fuel to the housing boom, as banks saw they could make outsized profits so long as the market continued to rise.Lenders loosened credit restrictions even further, and anybody that said they wanted to buy a house was given a mortgage. Virtually no questions were asked and no documentation required. Such mortgages were labelled “NINJA” loans: no job, no income, no assets were required to borrow money.Eventually buyers began defaulting on their mortgages en masse, causing a massive drop in housing prices and bringing about the Great Recession.The adoption of new technologies over the last century has resembled an S-Curve. As the technology is introduced, it takes time for people to learn about it and realize its potential. Once public awareness reaches a critical mass and the technology is perfected, adoption occurs extremely rapidly, resulting in exponential growth. Finally, once everybody has adopted the technology, the curve flattens out again.Below is a picture of the Bitcoin market since late 2013. See how even the “massive” bubble of November/December 2013 is dwarfed by the current one?What happens if today’s Bitcoin bubble isn’t a bubble at all, in the traditional sense? What happens if we are actually on the cusp of that massive near-vertical adoption uptake? A look back at the dot-com bubble and the housing bubble might shed some light on current circumstances.On March 2, 2015, the NASDAQ index hit an all-time high, surging above the 5,000 mark as it finally surpassed its peak price, reached at the top of the dot-com bubble. Today, the index stands at 6,449. It took 15 years, but the markets fully recovered, eventually reaching new highs.Likewise the Case-Shiller index of housing prices is approaching its pre-bubble heights. The index stopped at 198 in 2006 and is now back to 194. As the economy continues to improve, it’s likely that home prices will continue to rise above their 2006 peak.Why did the South Sea bubble, Mississippi bubble, and Dutch tulip mania all eventually go to zero, never to rise again? Why did Internet companies enjoy a new resurgence and eclipse past bubble levels? Why do housing prices seem to be following the same path?More important, what does all this have to do with Bitcoin?It’s simple. The bubbles of old were driven by hype, with nothing of value actually backing them. A tulip bulb has zero intrinsic value, and absolutely no potential to become something more. The South Sea company was backed by a worthless monopoly, since South America was under Spanish control. The Mississippi company never could exploit the wealth of the new world, because unlike Spanish territories, Louisiana had no gold or silver to export.Internet companies like Amazon, Facebook, PayPal and the others are completely different. The Internet offers unmatched potential for growth, with world-changing consequences. Yes, things got overheated in the early 2000s, but prices recovered and the upward trajectory was renewed. Housing prices went out of control in the mid-2000s, but as the population grows, housing is always in demand. A house represents a real asset with real value that meets a real need.Bitcoin represents a sea change in the way business is conducted on the Internet. It is the world’s first decentralized, non state controlled, truly global currency. Bitcoin is a promising monetary technology that seems more apt to follow the path of an S-Curve than that of a boom-and-bust.Bitcoin could still be overpriced for this stage of its development. It could be in a bubble that deflates before rising again in a few years. But if Bitcoin is what I think it is, then at some point (maybe even now) we will rapidly shoot up that S-Curve to prices that are presently unimaginable."

And, what if you want to pay with digital currencies?","An online fundraising auction platform CharityStars plans to do so, by announcing that it started to accept Bitcoin as a method of payment.A few days ago, a bid of $36,000 worth of Bitcoin awarded the auction winner with the chance to meet the football champion, Cristiano Ronaldo. The proceeds from this auction will be donated to the Forever Dream Foundation, the association that gives unique experiences to disadvantaged children and families.Francesco Nazari Fusetti, Co-founder and CEO of CharityStars, explained:“CharityStars strives to be at the forefront of the fundraising industry; thus it was a natural move to integrate cryptocurrencies onto our platform, providing more transparency for donors and helping our 500 charities to raise more money.”Auctions are conducted through the CharityStars platform. They are not only for winning celebrities meet and greet but also other luxury experiences or products, whose proceeds will go to charity associations such as Amnesty International, Breast Cancer Now, Save the Children, Croce Rossa Italiana, Operation Smile, Make a Wish and many more.On the platform, one can find a bunch of VIPs to have a dinner or a meeting with Vivienne Westwood, Giuseppe Cipriani, Leo Messi and many more. The Italian MotoGP champion Valentino Rossi is also involved in a charity auction to give his motorbike replica to the auction winner.CharityStars plans to integrate Blockchain technology to have a more transparent system.This is not the first time a charity association decides to use the Blockchain to provide users a clearer process of the raised funds they receive.For example, the Italian Helperbit does similar work in the natural disaster donations sector. Back in 2016, Helperbit helped Legambiente, Italian environmental association, to raise funds for its campaign entitled The Rebirth has a Young Heart dedicated to young entrepreneurs in the Italian areas affected by the earthquakes.Another Bitcoin and Blockchain related charity association is called BitHope, a Bulgarian non-governmental organization (NGO) that uses only digital currency to accumulate funds for the campaigns that are hosted on their platform.As you can see on the Bitcoin Charity website, there are a lot of associations that accept Bitcoin as a method of payment.

factor that needs to be considered? 37121 Total views. 322 Total shares.","Dec 11, 2017","Bitcoin has become unavoidable in really the last few weeks. It has been bubbling under for a while now, in terms of mass appeal and understanding, but its recent wave of adoption has sent it spurting out into mainstreet.","However, despite the influx of individuals, the core of Bitcoin users, holders and influencers remains a small, tight-knit community. The early adopters, the technology fanatics and the bold entrepreneurs of a few years ago hold most of the sway.These are the Whales of the Bitcoin pond, and according to Bloomberg, as few as 1,000 people may own around 40 percent of all existing Bitcoin.In that respect, how much control do these 1,000 or so people have on moving the market? Either purposefully or not. What if they cash out simultaneously? And now, what about the new Whales joining the pond via futures?The latest dip, that came after a monster rally for Bitcoin pushing it towards $19,000 saw the digital currency cool down to a more reasonable $14,000-ish. That represented about a 15 percent drop - nothing in a normal day for Bitcoin - but the catalyzer for this dip was put down to stock taking and some cashing out for big profits.This form of minor market manipulation shows how someone with a few thousand coins can actively move the market should they make a big buy/sell. Also, this manipulation is all part of the process and not exactly a coordinated front. But what if there was one?Many people, of course, fear the dips and the ‘crashes’ that come almost like clockwork with Bitcoin. The market is volatile, but also predictable in that fact.There are those who welcome a dip though, seeing it as a discount sale on some more Bitcoins. Thus, a coordinated strike by an ost of Whales, selling off enough coins to cause a flood in the market, could lead to a manipulation to lower the price.“I think there are a few hundred guys,” says Kyle Samani, managing partner at Multicoin Capital. “They all probably can call each other, and they probably have.”The case of ‘Spoofy’ back in August, was an occurrence of this - seemingly. Rumors were swirling about a trader with nearly unlimited funds who was manipulating the Bitcoin markets.While there has been no evidence of a coordinated strike at the Bitcoin price from these Whales so far, there is danger entering the waters as of this week.The arrivals of Future trading through the CME and CBOE has allowed a different breed of Bitcoin investor to enter the market, a type that can dwarf many of the current Bitcoin Whales.These Wall Street-types can now with protection be a part of the Bitcoin wild ride, but can they also manipulate it?The manipulation that would be seen by the future traders is also different as, for the first time, there is a reason to be a shark; a killer whale; and drive the price down in order to profit.With Future trading, there is protection for a big price drop, and inadvertently, an opportunity to profit just as much from a drop as a rise. This means that there is incentive, for those who can, to manipulate Bitcoin’s relatively small market with some big money.This manipulation will also be downward facing meaning that there could be a wild ride in store."

However, a recent ...","Sep 17, 2017","On October 1st, Catalan nationalists plan to hold a referendum on leaving Spain, and to declare independence if they win. However, a recent article from BBC indicates that the “Gobierno de España” will seize Catalan finances in the next 48 hours if the ‘illegal’ referendum vote is not brought to a halt immediately. This situation has brought Bitcoin into the spotlight as a potential solution to the conflict. In this brief article, Cointelegraph will attempt to analyze how Bitcoin could free Catalonia from Spain’s mandate.","Cristóbal Montoro, Spain’s finance minister, said that a mechanism had been approved for the state to take control of Catalonia’s finances. The Spanish intend to take this step to prevent any public money being spent on the independence referendum.  The ministers also delivered an ultimatum for Mr Puigdemont - sign an agreement within 48 hours that public funds will not be redirected for the referendum. If the deadline is not met, then the Spanish government will seize control of the part of the Catalonian budget destined for public services and salaries.Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin right after central banks tanked the world economy and induced a year-long economic depression. The purpose of cryptocurrency is to serve as a tool for freedom, which is exactly what Catalonia is looking for right now.  In a decentralized financial system where every State/Autonomous community has full control over its finances through the use of cryptography and Blockchain, the central government wouldn’t be able to seize any funds. Catalonia‘s current situation is an interesting case study for how countries could adopt decentralized cryptocurrencies on a large scale.Countries like Venezuela have proven, on a smaller scale, that Bitcoin is a viable solution for politically unstable regions. Although the situation in Catalonia is of a slightly different nature, some similarities can definitely be found.According to Blockchain.info, there are currently 16.8 mln Bitcoin wallets in use. However, this number should be taken with a pinch of salt since a user can have as many wallets as he wants. Therefore, the actual number of people using Bitcoin is probably significantly lower than the total number of active wallets.The autonomous region of Catalonia currently has around 7.5 mln inhabitants. In the unlikely event that Bitcoin was implemented as an immediate method of payment, the Bitcoin Blockchain would probably suffer from significant congestion and elevated transaction fees. This could complicate the transition for Catalonia to a decentralized financial system. Potential solutions to Bitcoin’s scalability issues, like Lightning Network, would help Bitcoin to take on such a large influx of users."

It is a cyber-attack on a service provider that looks to disrupt its service, usually by flooding the server with too many requests to handle.By using multiple sources to attack a server, DDoS attacks can be difficult to stop because they are not started by a single source.Bitcoin’s mega bull run has seen the biggest ever demand for the virtual currency play havoc on exchanges around the world.As the various service providers did their best to upgrade systems to handle the increased traffic caused by frantic trading and news users as Bitcoin approached the $11,000 milestone a fortnight ago, two exchanges had to deal with cyber-attacks.Bitfinex scheduled server maintenance and were hit by a DDOS attack at the same time.Bitfinex is under DDoS attack. The DDoS attack started during earlier maintenance and has been ongoing since.Meanwhile, Bittrex also detected a DDOS attack on their system.DDOS attack was detected and being mitigated right now. Sorry for the inconvenience.These attacks are part and parcel of online life - as banking systems, online shopping platforms and other services providers are usual targets of DDoS attacks.They happen often as well - and almost always at the most inopportune time.Late in October, the third split from Bitcoin’s original Blockchain, Bitcoin Gold, was hit by a massive DDoS attack. Its launch was unceremoniously disrupted by over 10 mln requests a minute, rendering their site inaccessible.In May, Poloniex exchange was taken down - with users outraged that they could not trade their virtual currency. Luckily no assets were stolen during the attack - but the panic that ensues is no laughing matter.Ironically, Blockchain technology could be the very answer to stopping DDoS attacks.By renting out bandwidth on a Blockchain, these attacks can be mitigated by the increased capacity to handle website traffic."

With so many different payment methods available, from credit and debit cards, and now digital currencies, many would think that cash, as an outdated payment method, may be falling away.","A recent survey has shown that cash is only six percent down on debit cards as people’s prefered payment method. A lot of it has to do with its simplicity as well as security.According to a recent study by Cardtronics and Edelman Intelligence, which surveyed 1,000 people in May and June, cash was prefered by 27 percent of people, while debit cards were on top with 33 percent preferring them.Digital currencies fared quite well, with 15 percent of people saying it was their prefered method of payment. The survey also showed that there are payment methods that are nearly obsolete, as only three percent backed cheques.This survey was performed on an American audience, but it is not the only one of its kind. A similar survey was conducted in the Asian markets, where again it came out that cash still held a large majority for preferred payment methods.There has to be a reason why a payment system that is as old as cash is still around today, and still so popular. It is perhaps a lesson that digital currencies like Bitcoin should heed.The survey theorised that cash held such sway because it is the simplest form of payment, but it is also a very safe and practical form of payment. Digital currencies are still notoriously difficult to use, let alone understand for the average citizen, while they are also prone to hacks and scams.The company which conducted the survey said 84 percent of respondents are worried about data security, and two-thirds said they make payment decisions based on which form is considered the most secure, up six percent since 2016.It is not just digital currency security concerns that are keeping people clutching their dollar bills, credit and debit card fraud is still a huge problem, and a factor in many people’s thinking when choosing a payment method.The threat posed when using digital currencies is different to that of credit and debit fraud, but it also far more scary because there are no guarantees from a central authority.Harley J. Spiller, author of ""Keep the Change: A Collector's Tales of Lucky Pennies, Counterfeit C-Notes, and Other Curious Currency,"" likes paper money for another reason: It's simple.""My phone crashes, my computer dies, but my penny collection from when I was five is still here,"" he said quite simplistically, but quite rightly.

It doesn't change Bitcoin fundamentally, just makes coding it easier. ETH is Turing complete, which BTC cannot have without some sort of soft fork at a minimum. I don't see the ""smart contracting"" ability of ETH as a ""feature"", but more as a vulnerability. The attack surface on the ETH smart contracting platform is much greater. The fundamentals haven't changed, this is more like a nice tool for developers.”If developers do indeed use Ivy to write smart contracts for Bitcoin, the network has a long way to catch up with Ethereum’s current status as the go-to platform for writing smart contracts.On the other hand, Matej Michalko, the CEO of Decent, maintains a more positive outlook:“Ivy is an excellent example of the multifaceted development of blockchain products. Cross chain referencing is proliferating and it is on its way to dominate the ecosystem. Bitcoin can now be on par with Ethereum as a great smart contracts prototyping tool for a full range of Blockchain applications. Both platforms, however, remain fundamentally different in their architectures and market adoption. It remains to be seen what blockchain use cases and platforms are going to be adopted by masses. Scalability will be one of the decisive factors. 2018 is going to be a Blockchain year.”"

People are not using it to transact. People are using it as an investable asset. I personally am a believer in where digital currency can play a role in our society. Especially in, not only the front end of doing transactions but also in the back end of creating a much more efficient system and a much more verifiable system”.Despite some criticisms and doubts against Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies, there are technology luminaries like Yang who support and believe their potential.Among the believers is technology firm Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, who claimed that he considers Bitcoin as a digital currency that is “more genuine and real” than the US dollar and better than gold as a store of value.In an email interview with Cointelegraph, entrepreneur and investor Jonha Richman shares that she believes in the potential of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. In fact, like Yang, she believes that more and more traditional money will flow into Bitcoin in the coming months as cryptocurrencies are slowly starting to hit the much awaited mainstream adoption.With these positive pronouncements on virtual tokens, the number of individuals who are attracted to the cryptocurrency market continues to grow. In fact, Bitcoin recently toppled Visa’s market cap with its latest all-time high price."

However, there are a few things that can be done to protect yourself.It must be stated that the reasoning put forward, along with an apology, from The Pirate Bay was that they saw it as an alternative to banner advertising, which is tricky for what is essentially an illegal website.Many were happy with the idea of their processor being used, but not happy with the secret nature of it all.If however you are not happy with the idea of being mined, secretly or not, there are a few ways to check if you are indeed a victim of processor pirates.Simply by opening your resource manager on your computer, and looking at the CPU usage, it can quickly become clear if there is indeed something sucking your processing power.A noticeable spike when visiting a certain site that should not be taxing your CPU is an obvious sign of Javascript running that is using your processing power.Additionally, if you have everything closed but CPU usage is still super high, then you may have a crypto mining malware problem.Mining hijacking can occur simply by visiting certain sites, but there have been instances where infected adverts on sites have also led to this CPU pirating. Researchers at security software vendor ESET have explained this process.Thus, running an ad blocker can put a stop to this. Additionally, ad blocking software can also filter out known types of in-browser miners. One such mining script is called Coinhive, which isn’t necessarily malware.Coinhive is trying to approach this as legitimately as possible and condemned Showtime for using their Javascript without alerting users that they would be utilized for mining.Besides from legitimate pirate mining software, there are more sophisticated forms of malware which actively penetrates the system.

the stock market in general, according to stock market expert Laszlo ...","Dec 21, 2017","Stock market expert and Birinyi Associates founder Laszlo Birinyi thinks that the phenomenal rise of Bitcoin price, which has grown by 1,950 percent since January 2017, is serving as a catalyst for the global financial market overall and attracting more new investors to the stock market.","He added that the cryptocurrency mania is also providing a badly needed “shot in the arm” for the traders in the stock exchanges.In a phone interview with CNBC, Birinyi said that the Bitcoin mania is forcing more of the cash that has been kept idle on the sidelines back into the stock markets.""Bitcoin is a catalyst for a lot of interest. It's everybody. It's also giving the guy on the trading desk, sitting at a hedge fund, a shot in the arm…All of a sudden more and more people are aware there's a market going on, the stock market and there's a way to make money.”However, according to Birinyi, Bitcoin has been showing bubble-like features in the past few weeks. He added that if Bitcoin is indeed a cryptocurrency bubble, it is already bigger than some of the largest financial bubbles in history, including the Nasdaq bubble of the late 1990s.Birinyi also said that he is not willing to invest in Bitcoin long-term, but that he sees it as better suited for a trading instrument. As a matter of fact, he claimed that he successfully traded the cryptocurrency during the world’s second Bitcoin futures launch on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) December 18.""I made $3,000 in an hour. This is not investment money. This is the money you would spend on that new driver for your golf bag.""While the most well-known digital currency has its share of skeptics, more and more Wall Street investors are entering the crypto market. The renowned American investor Bill Miller recently told reporters that 50 percent of his hedge fund’s money is currently invested in Bitcoin.The recent explosion of Bitcoin coverage in mainstream media outlets is also paving the way for other cryptocurrencies to potentially see increased adoption."

It turns out there are a lot of these addresses. (Keep looking and you will easily find some.)  This is nothing new and has been known to the Bitcoin community for a while.”According to the Pastebin user, he used several pieces of publicly available data on the Blockchain to determine if they could have been used to create wallets. He utilized block hashes for every block since the Genesis Block, Merkle roots from every block, common words and phrases that have been hashed a number of times, and eventually started testing all the Bitcoin addresses.He also downloaded a complete index of all Bitcoin addresses that were listed publicly on Blockchain and began to discover keys that could have a few bits associated with them. In his experiments, he discovered more than 40 Bitcoin addresses that were used at certain points over the past seven years as of November 2017 to send Bitcoin.The Pastebin user has also suspected that some third-party wallet custodial service like gambling site, mining pool or a straight-up web wallet could have malicious code in their backend that can generate private keys based on public addresses.As of press time, the Blockchain.info user has confirmed that the funds have been returned:“The nine BTC have been returned, the person found my Reddit post & reached out to me this morning. He wants to remain anonymous however he has found an issue with Blockchain.info and is currently working with them to resolve the issue.”"

Exchanges have been shown to be weak links, as some have collapsed and disappeared, some have been hacked - often - and are under a lot of regulatory scrutiny.Many have felt the sting of things going bad with Bitcoin exchanges. There are stories of people playing the market badly and being burnt, but that is largely their own fault. But there are also stories of innocent victims.Moolah, an exchange that was one of the 45 percent that end up collapsing, has seen people get burned.Dan Wasyluk was using Moolah when it collapsed, taking with it 750 of his Bitcoins. Wasyluk says he doubts that he will see than money again, which was worth almost $4 mln.Bitcoin’s most famous hack was that of Mt. Gox which had such a profound effect on the Bitcoin ecosystem that it turned the market bearish for a prolonged period. Many people lost millions of dollars, and because of the decentralized nature of it, there was not much to be done.Many of those who suffered from the hack put in claims for their money, and those same people are still waiting. There is not much hope for many of their claims.Mt. Gox’s head, Mark Karpeles, is facing the music in a criminal trial, but he won't be paying back everyone any time soon.Mt Gox was not the end of the hacking saga, there are reports almost weekly of other exchanges being hacked, leaving many in the lurch when it comes to getting their stolen money back.Regulators and lawmakers are trying to protect citizens, but it is a difficult thing.In July, a US federal judge in Florida ordered Paul Vernon, the operator of a collapsed US exchange called Cryptsy, to pay $8.2 mln to customers after he failed to respond to a class-action lawsuit. The judge ruled that 11,325 Bitcoins had been stolen but did not identify the thief.David C. Silver, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys, said:""This is no different than bank robbers in the Old West. Cryptocurrency is just a new front.""Because cryptocurrencies are indeed the latest frontier, there is still a lot of loopholes in the law and a lot of policing going on. Lawmakers are slow to catch up.China was the latest country to crack down on exchanges when it declared that cryptocurrency exchanges would no longer be allowed to operate.Some of the Chinese exchanges implored their users to get their coins out of exchanges as quickly as possible due to the changing regulations in the country."

The funds were reportedly stolen by a person using the pseudonym “BADASS20” from the I&M Bank and a Safaricom Pay Bill account.","According to a report by regional media Kenyan Wall Street, the anonymous thief has stolen KEH 10.2 mln (around $100,000) from the financial establishments and used the money to purchase Bitcoins via the exchange LocalBitcoins.The local police were able to trace the stolen money to various bank accounts, including those owned by the arrested Bitcoin traders.During the police investigation, the traders claimed that they were not aware that the money used by the anonymous thief to buy Bitcoin was stolen and they were just doing what they claimed as a “normal” trading activity. Based on their chat history on the trading platform, they seem to be telling the truth.In spite of their seemingly valid defense, the Kenyan Banking Fraud Investigation Unit (BFIU) still arrested the traders and froze their bank accounts. The brokers, however, were able to post bails and were eventually released. They are scheduled to attend a preliminary hearing in December 2017 in advance of a full hearing in January 2018.The digital currency peer-to-peer (P2P) market in Kenya is flourishing despite the warning issued by the country’s central bank in 2015, advising citizens to refrain from transacting Bitcoin and other virtual currencies.This latest case of banking fraud involving the cryptocurrencies is expected to have a chilling effect on the local virtual currency market. It remains to be seen, however, if this incident will compel the government to introduce drastic measures to regulate the market or the industry players will just consider it as an isolated case and ignore it."

Roger Ver: I think there's a pretty good chance that Bitcoin price goes ...","Nov 28, 2017","On Nov. 30, back in 2011, Roger Ver made a bet to the world, that Bitcoin is going to outperform gold, silver and the dollar by 100 times. This Nov. 30 is going to be the sixth anniversary of his bet, and Ver is set to make another bet to the world – this time about Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.","Previously known as Bitcoin Jesus and now a vociferous advocate for Bitcoin Cash, Ver has recently advised NAGA Group, a German public fintech company who’s about to launch an ICO, to accept Bitcoin Cash and other cryptocurrencies alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum.A company shouldn’t limit itself to Bitcoin, which has a higher fee, Ver said. “As long as it’s good money they should accept it.” He said he also spent the past Friday with bankers demonstrating the different network fees of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.Leading up to his new bet, Ver had a Q & A with Cointelegraph. Wearing a blue shirt with a white Bitcoin insignia and “Too free to fail” printed on it, Ver joked that he’s going to get his Bitcoin Cash shirt soon.Cointelegraph: Where do you think Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash prices will be?Roger Ver: I think there’s a pretty good chance that Bitcoin price goes over $10,000 by the end of the year. It can very, very much happen, maybe on Monday, Bitcoin Core is going to be $10,000. Both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash will reach new all-time highs.CT: The cryptocurrency space has attracted large numbers of new, mainstream investors. Does the technical difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash make a difference to them?RV: In the short term, it doesn’t make that much of a difference. In the long term, the coin that’s the most useful becomes the one that’s used the most. The one that’s used the most will have the largest market cap, the most liquidity, and the biggest user base. And Bitcoin Cash is much, much more useful with Bitcoin Core.CT: Bitcoin Cash critics have said that its big block approach is unsustainable in the long term, what is your response to that?RV: Increasing the block size is a long-term, sustainable solution. If you remember your first modem, it’s probably a 24-hundred bite [2,400-bit/s] modem. And then they increased them to 14.4 K[bit/s] modem, that’s the big one that was coming. And then 28.8 kilobit (per second) modem, and then 56K modem, and then you have DSL lines, that are twice the speed, and then it went up, faster and faster, network and the company I did before Bitcoin was selling 100-gigabyte optical transceivers. It was about three mln times faster than the modems I was first selling. In 20 years they got three mln times faster.If a one megabyte block is easy to handle today, 20 years from now we are going to have three gigabyte blocks just as easy to handle.I don’t think that scaling on chain is not a practical solution. It very clearly is.CT: What about Lightning Network as a scaling solution for Bitcoin?RV: Lightning network is still just a science project at this point. Nobody’s having it in commerce, nobody’s having lighting network wallets, so it’s complete vaporware at this point.Maybe it will come together, maybe it will be fantastic someday, but they intentionally broke Bitcoin which was working incredibly well and grew into this worldwide phenomenon.CT: You got to meet cryptocurrency communities around the world. What did you notice?RV: When you go to a meetup, the majority of people are in favor of Bitcoin Cash, on chain scaling. It’s only on the Internet that there’s a lot of people who are not in favor of that. The vast majority of people who support Bitcoin Core don’t even use Bitcoin, whereas everybody who actually uses Bitcoin on a regular basis is in favor of Bitcoin Cash or in favor of on-chain scaling.It won’t take too many more months until Bitcoin Cash completely surpass Bitcoin Core in price number of users or market cap. It’s not a question of if, it’s just a question of when. I think it’s going to happen next year.CT: Jamie Dimon said he would fire any trader that trades Bitcoin. How would you respond to that?RV: I’m sure Jamie Dimon is a smart guy. I think he probably realizes that Bitcoin is going to cut into his business. It’s not going to be Bitcoin specifically though, but all cryptocurrencies.But the smart ones [bankers] are going to adopt, right?CT: Interest on ICOs has been spiking. What are your tips for new investors interested in ICO?RV: Responses have been edited for clarity."

making ...","Sep 26, 2017","Mike Novogratz, the macro manager who left  Fortress Investment Group in shame after two years of losses, is looking to start a $500 mln hedge fund to invest in cryptocurrencies, initial coin offerings and related companies.","The swaggering investor believes that Bitcoin is a huge opportunity, but probably a fleeting one, as he both believes in the opportunities, but also that this is all a big bubble.Novogratz is putting his money where his mouth is though, as he will invest $150 mln of his own money and then top up the remaining $350 mln from family offices, wealthy individuals and fellow hedge fund managers.If Novogratz is successful with his $500 mln fund, it will be the biggest of its kind. However, the investor, who took a self imposed exile from Wall Street, takes an interesting view of digital currencies.“This is going to be the largest bubble of our lifetimes,” Novogratz said.“Prices are going to get way ahead of where they should be. You can make a whole lot of money on the way up, and we plan on it.”Novogratz is renowned for being bold and brash, and it seems that the big swing and volatile digital currency space are exactly the kind of market he would thrive in.“I sold at $5,000 or $4,980,” he said. “Then three weeks later I’m trying to buy it in the low $3,000s. If you’re good at that and you’re a trading junkie, it’s a lot of fun.”There have been polar opposite views on Bitcoin and digital currencies recently, from those who are in the know when it comes to investing.People like Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan came out and slammed Bitcoin as a fraud, however, they were also seen to be looking in and exploring digital currencies and Blockchain technology.These non-believers have recently seen their arguments backed up as governments and other regulatory bodies have cracked down in some areas of the world, namely China.However, just like there are two sides to the Dimon coin, some even see the Bitcoin ban in China as an opportunity, and that is the way Novogratz is operating, despite calling it a massive bubble.“In a lot of ways, this is a market like any other market,” Novogratz said. “You see the psychology of fear and greed in the charts the same way you’d see it in charts of the Indonesian rupiah or dollar-yen or treasuries. They’re exaggerated because of less liquidity and because you can’t get short.”"

In an official statement, the Youbit team told its users that 75 percent of their holdings on the Youbit exchange will be accessible and ready for withdrawal. But, to claim the rest of the funds, the company stated that investors will have to wait until the final settlement of bankruptcy proceedings.In the case of the now-defunct Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, which once was the largest Bitcoin exchange within the global cryptocurrency market, the settlement of bankrupt proceedings have taken more than four years. Still, the creditors of Mt. Gox have not received their funds and the procedure is still ongoing.Unfortunately, for Youbit investors, it may take several months to years to receive the remaining 25 percent of their personal funds, as the settlement of bankruptcy proceedings will have to be finalized before the company can credit its customers.Upon the discovery of the hacking attack, the Youbit team told its clients that the company is working closely with local authorities and the South Korean law enforcement to evaluate and investigate the security breach. The Youbit team said:“Currently, we are cooperating with law enforcement and third-party investigators to evaluate the breach. We are trying everything in our capability to minimize the losses of our users and we are considering several ways to handle this situation. We would like to apologize again for disappointing our users.”According to the Wall Street Journal, sources familiar with the ongoing investigation into the Youbit security breach have discovered telltale signs and historical evidence that North Korean state-funded hackers likely engaged and initiated the hacking attack.In September 2017, security research firm FireEye revealed in a threat research paper that it has found evidence to link various cryptocurrency exchange hacking attacks to North Korea by analyzing the tools that were used to hack into South Korean cryptocurrency platforms.One of the methods used by the North Korean hacking group was Spear Phishing, the FireEye report stated, which targeted individual cryptocurrency users with highly sophisticated phishing attacks and malware. FireEye further emphasized that there is some evidence to link previous South Korean cryptocurrency exchange security breaches to North Korea.Specifically, the FireEye team wrote that the following activities were likely initiated by North Korean hackers:Given the imposition of harsh international sanctions against North Korea by the US government and the financial instability of the North Korean regime, FireEye researchers wrote that North Korean hackers have had many incentives to target South Korean exchanges. The report read:“While Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges may seem like odd targets for nation-state actors interested in funding state coffers, some of the other illicit endeavors North Korea pursues further demonstrate an interest in conducting financial crime on the regime’s behalf. North Korea's Office 39 is involved in activities such as gold smuggling, counterfeiting foreign currency, and even operating restaurants.”In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Troy Stangarone, a senior director at the Korea Economic Institute, shared a similar sentiment with FireEye and stated that North Korea is in an ideal position to target Bitcoin companies as it has to find ways to earn back money from the recently imposed sanctions. Stangarone said:“North Korea is an ideal country to use hacking and financial tools like Bitcoin. They’re experimenting with ways to earn back lost money from sanctions.”Throughout the upcoming weeks, the South Korean law enforcement and cybersecurity agencies are expected to focus on finding solid evidence to link the hacking attack targeted at Youbit to North Korean hackers."

There was Cointemprorary, a gallery that was the first of its kind to offer unique art pieces solely for Bitcoin.Then, more recently, a fine art gallery in Mayfair, London, opened its doors on Bitcoin, allowing art to be bought with the digital currency.Now, Sant'Agostino will allow patriots of its auction to settle up in Bitcoin, opening up a world of furniture, jewelry, watches, as well as paintings to those with a few extra Bitcoin to spare.The first sale that the auction house opens to Bitcoin bidders is expected to have 600 Italian and foreign design objects, mostly pieces of furniture.There has not been much fanfare made of the Auction house’s decision to embrace this new form of monetary technology, they simply said in a statement: “Bitcoins will be accepted as payment"" for the upcoming sale.While debate continues to rage as to what Bitcoin is - a store of value, or a functioning currency - it’s decisions like that of the Italian auction house that legitimizes the digital currency for its core use.As its value rockets, however, there’s more interest for investors rather than consumers in the likes of Bitcoin, as it continues to break new boundaries in its value.However, it is also this astronomical growth that would be fueling early adopter's wallets, and allowing them to enter into auctions for luxury goods.Depending on where people stand on Bitcoin's use will continue to shape how it is utilized, and also determine if there is a demand for more adoption from retailers and the like."

Atlanta is one of the most mature Bitcoin ATM markets in the country, so it’s exciting to provide our services to people already showing accelerated adoption of the technology. Our goal is to give everyone the equal ability to access Bitcoin, particularly in times of record demand, and participate in this soaring new economy. Part of making this marketplace accessible is making sure our fees are less than half that of any other operator, and customers will be given fee-free transactions for first-time use of any new machine.”Based on a survey by the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), seven percent or nine mln of the total households in the US are unbanked and another 19.9 percent or 24.5 mln of households are underbanked.The city of Atlanta is among those included in the top 10 most unbanked cities in the country. More than one in 10 households in the city were not involved with conventional banks, while about 30 percent of residents are underbanked.According to Clark, these unbanked and underbanked residents have to depend on other kinds of services such as pawn shops, check-cashing, and payday loan providers to secure cash and credit.“Around 30 percent of residents are underbanked, meaning they might have to check accounts, but have to rely on other kinds of services like pawn shops, check-cashing, and payday loan companies to get cash and credit.”"

One consistent theme in every complaint we’ve received is that users have attempted to open tickets and have even sought help on the exchange’s Slack, only to be ignored and banned, respectively.One user complained that he has six Bitcoin in his Bittrex account--over $30,000 at today’s values--and no longer has access to his funds and receives no answers to his support tickets.Another user comments:“My Bittrex account is disabled for more than 3 days without any warning or announcement. Their support do not answer anything.”Another wrote:“Although we submitted tickets about this issue to their support team, they with all obscenity and indecency, instead of responding to their users’ tickets, they just ignore us.”Still another user suggested the bans may be tied to users’ nationalities. He wrote:“In Iran, more than 3,000 accounts have been deactivated without reason.”Another Bittrex customer emailed us, saying:“I talked to many users in Telegram groups and the most affected countries are Syria, India, Iran, Russia, Pakistan and Turkey.”Many of those who emailed us pointed out that they are using verified accounts, suggesting that it isn’t a KYC/AML problem.At least two threads have been started on the Bitcointalk forum, here and here.The affected customers are all getting the same message when they attempt to log in to their account:Bittrex did not respond to our request for comment. Bittrex.com/news is blank. An attempt to sign up for their Slack channel failed, with the message “invite_limit_reached.” Bittrex’s Facebook page simply directs any users with problems to go to their support website and file a ticket.There is no announcement on Twitter, and only one official reply to the numerous tweets that have been directed at them:please contact https://t.co/d1UGFIFtWUIt’s extremely unusual for an exchange to suddenly disable thousands of accounts without any announcement or any replies to support tickets. It’s even more bizarre that Bittrex is apparently banning people for asking for help in their support Slack. But these aren’t the only weird goings-on at Bittrex lately.Blogger “The CryptoSyndicate” posted last week suggesting that an internal mistake at Bittrex caused an exchange-wide selloff of altcoins, triggering declines on all other major exchanges. The CryptoSyndicate writes:“Basically, every single cryptocurrency (alts) listed on Bittrex has fallen in a very similar pattern in relation to one another. Not every coin, but coins that are listed on Bittrex. Between the hours of 12:00 and 09:00 at UTC-4 on 8th October 2017, a large number of alts experienced a mass dump executed within minutes of each other. Coincidence?”He speculates that this could be the result of an error related to exchange fees; namely, that Bittrex may have accidentally dumped the fees it had collected on every trading pair all at once, converting them to Bitcoin and causing the price of each altcoin to fall. He continues:“No other exchange has experienced these patterns in their assets. Cryptocurrencies that were NOT listed on Bittrex were not affected in the same way. Every other exchange we looked at, Binance, Kraken, Bitstamp, Coinbase, GDAX, Coss, Cryptopia, Yobit – all experienced patterns that were indicative of market reaction stemming from a single source of flash sell-down: Bittrex.”Following the monumental collapse of Mt. Gox a few years ago, it’s no wonder people are easily alarmed when dealing with exchanges. Since you don’t actually control the private key to your funds--the exchange does--you don’t actually have custody of them. If anything goes wrong, be it a hack, theft, or simply a database error, you stand to lose everything. Mt. Gox customers learned this the hard way.When Mt. Gox collapsed in early 2014, users lost access to 850,000 Bitcoins that were held by the site, although 200,000 Bitcoins were later “found,” bringing the total loss to 650,000 Bitcoins. At today’s prices, that’s a staggering $3.5 bln.Even exchanges that remain solvent can sorely test their users’ patience. Cointelegraph has previously reported on the slow speed at which support tickets are resolved at Poloniex, with some users having waited over a month to have their tickets answered. Likewise, Poloniex’s sudden change to their Terms of Use resulted in alarm and consternation.Likewise, the Bitfinex exchange has been eyed recently due to its loss of banking, a certain trader (or traders) apparently manipulating the markets and the unusual situation surrounding their sister company’s Tether token. This is hardly a surprise, considering the exchange was hacked just last year. As the saying goes, “once bitten, twice shy.”Given these and other unfortunate events, it’s not surprising that users would become very worried when thousands of accounts are apparently frozen without notice and when Bittrex’s support team will not answer support tickets.The banning of users from Bittrex’s support Slack is perhaps the most alarming aspect of these reports.

Bitcoin. Autonomous cryptocurrency prediction market platforms on the ...","Oct 26, 2017","Broker-less trading markets for cryptos and other assets being launched on the Blockchain are emerging as a kinder, fairer and potentially more lucrative market for traders. Decentralized exchanges are not only eliminating broker fees but also solving the main challenge of cryptocurrency exchanges, a lack of liquidity. An alternative to crypto exchanges, prediction markets are like manna from heaven, with at least one Blockchain trading platform providing  deep liquidity pools.","What all Blockchain trading platforms have in common is the elimination of the broker. Traditionally, trading has been a zero sum game. When brokers match orders, they take the other side of the trade. If the trader wins, the broker loses, and vice versa. This model gives brokers an incentive to manipulate fees and trading outcomes, and delay payments. In the foreign exchange markets, 60–70 percent of retail traders lose money, and up to 80 percent abandon FX trading within a year.Eliminating the middleman reduces all forms of financial fraud, a multi-billion dollar problem in a range of trading verticals every year.  Both Blockchain exchanges and peer-to-peer prediction markets are designed to disintermediate the broker. Oto Suvary, Director of R&D at SPECTRE.ai (Speculative Tokenised Trading Exchange), writes:“Because we remove B-Book brokerages and replace them with immutable smart contracts, we are addressing a major need with our prediction market platform by preventing many forms of global financial fraud.”SPECTRE.ai has launched an alternative to the P2P prediction market model—an autonomous prediction market platform with a 24-hour liquidity pool, providing instant trade execution at the click of a mouse, similar to the $80 trillion foreign exchange market.The Blockchain fully enables this permissionless market, producing a provably fair market on which to make trading predictions and settle outcomes.  The use of smart contracts on the decentralized Blockchain means information cannot be manipulated or withheld by a central authority since those authorities no longer control the outcome. Immutable smart contacts make revisions, deletions and other forms of tampering impossible without the consent of all market participants.Many different Blockchain trading models are being introduced, offering opportunities to trade in real-time across crypto-fiat currencies or on what date central banks will lift interest rates. Which Blockchain financial trading model is best? All three Blockchain models discussed below provide a useful but different service to traders. In a prediction market, the investor bets on a future outcome but does not own the underlying assets. These bets are based on binary “all-or-nothing” outcomes, providing the broker with more incentive to ensure he does not lose all his money. Digital binary options have quickly grown into a $200–500 million market.They allow investors to forecast future price direction on fiat and, more recently, cryptocurrencies. With fees, you will need to win 55 percent or more of the time to make money. Also, remember the laws of statistical variance. Markets revert to the mean. The more times you bet, the more likely you will come out even, before fees.The migration of prediction markets to decentralized Blockchain platforms is offering traders much more than liberation from high fees. Some binary trading platforms are allowing traders to choose what to bet on, while others are making traders part owners and paying them dividends.The first models introduced by Auger and Gnosis operate similar to the sports betting markets but are not limited to any one market, taking bets on binary outcomes in sports, politics, financial markets, and many other areas. Both these prediction market platforms use the wisdom of crowds to decide on outcomes. They contend that individual investors are smarter than the billions of dollars in investment research produced each year, of which 90 percent is never read.Liquidity and time value are currently very low, although even long range forecasts can be useful to currency traders. On the Auger beta market, 50 percent of traders expect Bitcoin to reach 5,000 by January, while 70 percent expect the pound to fall to parity with the Euro by the New Year. Meanwhile, Gnosis and Wedbush Securities are developing a market on which crowds forecast stock fundamentals. These crowd forecasting tools could eventually be integrated with the more traditional crypto-fiat exchange.SPECTRE.ai is competing more directly with crypto exchanges with a prediction market providing the speed and liquidity of the FX markets. This prediction market platform allows traders to bet on price moves on a range of underlying financial assets, including cryptos, FX, equities, bonds, ETFs and commodities. The DApp store will allow other companies to create sports betting, working capital financing, ecommerce and other apps that interface with the SPECTRE.ai liquidity pool.The prediction market platform has its own embedded, decentralised, autonomous liquidity pool (DALP). SPECTRE.ai provides 24-hour liquidity whereas Augur and other Blockchain prediction markets in beta are currently settling peer-2-peer bets on the order of days and even months. The liquidity pool allows SPECTRE.ai to offer Smart Option and Smart CFD contracts on not only FX but any asset, including many cryptos.Currently, owing to low liquidity, crypto exchanges are primarily used for transactional purposes. If you own cryptocurrencies, you have likely visited one of the one hundred or so decentralized crypto exchanges directly matching buyers and sellers. Most trade the majors, Bitcoin, Ethereum, or both, and a handful of other cryptocurrencies. Traders take ownership of the underlying assets, although more exchanges are offering derivatives such as forwards, futures, options and swaps. These risk management instruments, which allow traders to hedge risk and significantly lower the cost of speculative trading, are fundamental to a more liquid market developing.Models are developing to allow traders to improve liquidity and trade in and out of currencies in milliseconds rather than minutes, in the same way they trade currencies on a fiat exchange. The market with the largest trading volume LocalBitcoins has a 5-minute average release time—not bad considering the trades are arranged over an onsite messaging system, but far from simulating an FX trading experience. The battle between P2P and decentralized exchanges is still being played out.Blockchain cryptocurrency trading platforms are developing unique models to build liquidity. One emerging solution is to develop hybrid exchanges with liquidity pools backed by fiat money to support liquidity. SPECTRE.ai has developed a tokenized exchange with perpetual liquidity.As in other prediction markets, traders do not take ownership of the underlying assets and no brokers are used to facilitate or settle trades. Instead oracilized smart options produce fair outcomes across peer-to-peer trades, which are settled via smart contracts. Oracles are small bots that exchange information between the real world and the Blockchain. SPECTRE.ai’s alpha version is live.On the SPECTRE.ai crypto currency market, traders trade against a liquidity pool funded by the proceeds of its initial coin offering (ICO). The DALP pool is owned by the masses, either via dividend tokens or utility tokens. The dual token structure is an industry first. DALP can be connected to a range of fintech apps, disrupting ‘adjacent’ industries which have middlemen and moral hazard issues.These include, but are not limited to, betting, working capital finance, e-commerce applications, and micro-lending apps. SPECTRE.ai has signed an MOU with a major U.S e-commerce group building a decentralised application on the SPECTRE.ai D-App store to connect to the DALP pool.The apps will be another source of liquidity, while the main liquidity stream will come from trading. When a trade is settled, irrespective of the trading outcome, two percent of the funds is divided between token holders, in the form of a monthly dividend, and the exchange platform, as a technology fee.If the trader loses, the remaining 96 percent goes toward expanding the liquidity pool. The winner receives a return on investment of 75–93 percent (net the four percent fee), linked to volumes in the liquidity pool. When the outcome is decided, the contract automatically releases funds to the winners’ crypto wallets. Direct deposits to the exchange are not required.As mentioned, SPECTRE.ai provides two tokens. The dividend token pays two percent of all trades on SPECTRE.ai and apps connected to its liquidity pool to investors. The dividend token pays out 2% on Smart Option contracts and a 2-20% spread on Smart CFDs. A special dividend will be paid out if the liquidity pool meets a predetermined threshold. The dividend token supply is fixed.The utility token provides trader privileges. Token users can  trade across all smart options and assets, including exotic contracts, receive payouts of 1–5 percent higher, and gain access to a special education platform. SPECTRE.ai, which states traders can improve their win rate from 35–50 percent to 60–70 percent through fundamental and technical education, uses education as another way of improving trading outcomes and volume, and thus liquidity. Like a central bank, SPECTRE.ai is authorized to buy back up to 15 percent of its token supply to increase token value. Three percent of platform fees are allocated to utility token repurchases.SPECTRE.ai’s goal is to establish a liquidity pool of $5 million or more from the proceeds of its initial coin offering (ICO). This liquidity pool could support 1,000 traders a day with $300 in trades for close to a year, based on average win rates of 59 percent, as estimated by SPECTRE.ai’s risk management team. Win rates in the FX market are closer to 50 percent. When the market reaches $30–50 million in size, the average trade size will increase from $50 to $5,000–$50,000.Investors participating in the SPECTRE.ai token sale will receive a fungible token that can be exchanged for the dividend or utility token.The pre-sale, which starts October 27th , provides a 33 percent discount to early birds. The ICO hard cap is $30 million. Twenty percent of the proceeds of the token sale will go towards capitalizing the liquidity pool.No market is a win-win but decentralized Blockchain markets can increase trader odds of winning and significantly cut their fees and losses.Disclaimer.

The arrests were made despite the absence of regulations covering the trading of cryptocurrencies in the country.,"Based on local press reports, the suspected traders were arrested by members of the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) in Kathmandu and Chitwan. Among those arrested were Prashant Pratap Shah of Kathmandu, Bida Dhakal of Nuwakot, and Mingmar Tamang of Sindhupalchok.According to the CIB’s DSP Jeevan Kumar Shrestha, this is the first time that cryptocurrency exchange operators were arrested in the country.“They have been kept at the police custody. The traded amount will be discovered after further investigation.”The arrests made by the CIB are expected to raise more questions than answers, as the trading of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is not considered illegal, because of the absence of regulations on the issue in the country. Due to the situation, it is still unclear what offenses will be filed against the arrested individuals.Meanwhile, the Nepalese government is already drafting regulatory guidelines covering digital currency trading. Among the possible regulations that will be imposed by authorities is a total ban on the trading of cryptocurrencies.Due to this possibility, digital currency exchange operator Bitsewa has already ceased its operation in early October. The exchange is considered as the Nepalese version of LocalBitcoins.Although digital currency activities in Nepal are not so big, any form of regulation against cryptocurrencies may set a dangerous precedent and hinder innovations in the sector. Due to these developments, it is very interesting to see how the virtual currency industry in the country will develop in the short term.The country has also previously notoriously seized all relief funds in bank accounts ‘to ensure all donations are not misused’."

It is believed that digital assets like Bitcoin are being used for tax evasion, money laundering, and online gambling.","In a Bloomberg interview at the BlackRock Fixed Income ETF conference held in New York, Fink claimed that he believes in the potential of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, despite the current speculative atmosphere regarding their use.“I am a big believer in the potential in what cryptocurrencies can do.”Meanwhile, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon has called Bitcoin a “fraud”, and said it’s worse than the seventeenth century asset bubble involving tulip bulbs, further adding that the leading cryptocurrency will “eventually blow up.”“It’s worse than tulip bulbs and won’t end well.”Bitcoin and the other virtual currencies currently have a combined market value of around $144 bln based on data from Coinmarketcap.com. Bitcoin accounts for about 50 percent of the total value.Fink expressed his optimistic view on the open-source, distributed ledger called Blockchain, which is the driver behind the digital currencies. He claimed that the Blockchain technology has the capability to expedite the “more flow-through of information.”Meanwhile, the leading virtual cryptocurrency Bitcoin posted a 2.6 percent decline to $4,288 in the latest trading.Bitcoin, however, already increased by around 350 percent in 2017. In comparison, the S&P 500 index (SPX) has risen by 13 percent during the year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has surged by 14.5 percent.Image: Science MagWhile Bitcoin transactions are not entirely anonymous - one’s cookies gathered through various web activities may still be tracked - cryptocurrencies allow for faster and global transactions, which is probably far more important for those who choose to conduct transactions over the dark web.

Most recently, Bitstamp formally listed Bitcoin Cash as Bcash on its trading platform, igniting controversy amongst the global cryptocurrency community.However, within hours after the statement of Bitstamp was released announcing the integration of Bitcoin Cash as Bcash, the Bitstamp development team reversed its decision and listed Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin Cash, not as Bcash.“More Bcash drama today. BitStamp launched Bitcoin Cash trading today, but in an unexpected turn of events, they named it Bcash to avoid confusion. Then they got a lot of backlash from Bitcoin Cash supporters, so they switched it back,” said Charlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin and former executive at $1.6 bln Bitcoin brokerage Coinbase.The official statement of Bitstamp, which has now been updated due to the outrage of the Bitcoin Cash community, read:“Full trading support for Bitcoin Cash is now available at Bitstamp. And to help avoid confusion between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, please note that we refer to Bitcoin Cash as “Bcash (BCH)” on our platform.”In response to the initial announcement of Bitstamp and the decision of the company to list Bitcoin Cash as Bcash, Cøbra wrote:“A large exchange like Bitstamp calling Bitcoin Cash “Bcash” screams unprofessional and petty. It’s funny when done by individuals to troll or tease BCH supporters, but businesses should be behaving more professionally.”In response to Bitcoin Reddit moderator BashCo’s statement on Bitcoin Cash subverting the Bitcoin brand, Cøbra noted that Bitstamp had the decision not to support Bitcoin Cash. If the exchange genuinely supported the cryptocurrency, it either should have had listed it as Bitcoin Cash, or not list the cryptocurrency at all.“They had the option to not support it at all. Why support it and call the coin a politically charged name? Seems very unprofessional. No exchange calls Ethereum Classic ‘Eclassic,’” Cøbra added.At this phase of development, the cryptocurrency community and industry must provide a unified name for Bitcoin Cash, whether that is Bcash or Bitcoin Cash, to prevent controversy and confusion."

bitcoin block size increase in the mid-term. 20730 Total views.","Nov 14, 2017","On Nov. 13 Blockstream CEO and HashCash inventor Adam Back, who remains as one of the few individuals cited in the original Bitcoin whitepaper released by Satoshi Nakamoto, explained Bitcoin block size increase in the mid-term is a possibility that has not been ruled out.","In response to a statement provided by Jihan Wu, the co-founder of Bitmain, the $3 bln Bitcoin mining equipment manufacturing company, regarding the necessity of a block size increase to reduce Bitcoin Blockchain congestion, Back stated:“Probably mid-term with enough testing yes. But in the meantime it would be nice if people would stop spamming. Thanks.”Bitcoin Core is not fundamentally opposed to on-chain scalingAs explained by Back, the Bitcoin Core development team has not been fundamentally opposed to on-chain Bitcoin scaling. In 2014 Back noted that a gradual block increase to 2MB, 4MB, and 8MB is a viable option in the mid-term, until second-layer payment channels are fully adopted by the industry, wallet platforms, and exchanges.But, Bitcoin Core and the majority of the Bitcoin community remain certain that block size increase is not a long-term scaling solution, in contrast to public viewpoints, because there is a limit to which the block size of any Blockchain network including Bitcoin can be increased to.One major reason Bitcoin block size increase is not a long-term scaling solution is because if the block size increases in proportion to the growth of the Blockchain network’s user base, inevitably the block size will achieve a point wherein individual node operators are left out and transactions are verified by a centralized group of nodes. Such is the level of centralization imposes danger to any Blockchain network apart from Bitcoin.For instance, if the block size of a Blockchain network is increased to 10MB, to 50MB, and eventually to 100MB, it will create an ecosystem wherein individual node operators are essentially non-existent.“If my block takes 11 minutes to validate, then I’m off the Blockchain, which means fewer people can validate independently, which means the system becomes centralized. With one of these increases, fewer people can participate in the validation process, fewer people can participate in storing the data, and fewer people can participate in being independent actors. We go from a system that is decentralized to a system that gradually gets more and more centralized,” explained Bitcoin and security expert Andreas Antonopoulos.Hence, Bitcoin block size should be planned ahead, undergo rigorous testing, be carefully thought out, and conducted only when absolutely necessary, during a period in which the transaction fees on the Bitcoin network become too high for the vast majority to settle a payment.Recently the transaction fees have been substantially high, most of them being above $1 to $2, but the increase in the size of the Bitcoin mempool was triggered by the migration of Bitcoin miners to the Bitcoin Cash network. The instability in hashing power led hundreds of thousands of transactions left unconfirmed, eventually increasing the size of the Bitcoin mempool to over 100 million bytes.As miners return to the Bitcoin network after the next difficult adjustment and more businesses adopt SegWit for around 35 percent reduction in fee,s according to Bitcoin hardware wallet development firm Ledger fees should be manageable in the short-term.In the mid-term, if transaction fees become too high, as Back stated, block size increase is certainly a possibility with rigorous and thorough testing."

But remember, trading goes both ways. 42895 Total views. 336 Total ...","Nov 14, 2017",One of the reasons that long-only investors have succeeded in the Bitcoin market is that there is no effective way to short large amounts of Bitcoin. All that could change in a month's time if CME launches its Bitcoin futures.,"CME's announcement that it would launch Bitcoin futures in December 2017 provided a boost to Bitcoin's price. The expectation is that Bitcoin futures would lend legitimacy to the asset class and you could see institutional investors entering the Bitcoin market. If Bitcoin futures were approved by the CTFC, then it would also be difficult for the SEC to block Bitcoin ETFs as the underlying would be a regulated asset.However, Bitcoin investors might be missing the point. The launch of Bitcoin futures would provide bears with a means to short large quantities of Bitcoin; something which they cannot effectively do today. Speaking to CNBC, Terry Duffy, the Chairman and CEO of CME said:Today you cannot short Bitcoin. So there's only one way it can go. You either buy it or sell it to somebody else. So you create a two-sided market, I think it's always much more efficient.While technically one can short Bitcoin today through margin trading at existing exchanges, the liquidity and volumes at these exchanges are not sufficient for large investors. Exchanges such as Bitfinex allow users to borrow digital tokens and sell them, subject to other users agreeing to lend the assets to the margin trader.However, such exchanges are few and far between and most exchanges allow only regular buying and selling, which favours traditional long-only investors. Also, many exchanges, such as Bitfinex, don’t allow US citizens to margin trade on their platform. Regulated futures create a whole new narrative, since these trades are cash-settled and short sellers do not have to actually borrow Bitcoins.Bitcoin futures may provide Bitcoin sceptics with a way to short Bitcoin, but that does not mean that it would be a successful trade strategy. Given Bitcoin's wide volatility and penchant for sudden bull runs, futures could easily turn into a bear trap instead of providing bears with teeth. Even Jamie Dimon, who has attacked Bitcoin as a fraud and a bubble, has said that he wouldn't short Bitcoin. In an interview in CNBC in September 2017, Dimon said:I am not saying go short. Bitcoin could go touch $100,000 before it goes down. So this is not (what you) advise somebody to do.Bears beware - if there is one thing which is tougher than identifying a bubble, it is identifying when a bubble will burst."

However, the nature of ICOs and the hype for anything Blockchain-related has seen some of these ridiculous coins rack up a fair amount of value.One of the more famous ‘pointless’ coins, Dogecoin is a meme coin based on doge, the Shiba Inu dog.It was originally conceived as a joke: combining digital memes and digital coins. However, enough people enjoyed the concept that it soared in value shortly after release, hitting a market cap of $130 mln. Dogecoin was created by Jackson Palmer, a group product manager at Adobe, and Billy Markus, a software engineer at IBM, “without much real thought.”WhopperCoin is a fairly recent release, and it was touted as proof that digital currencies were spreading into the mainstream as Burger King Russia decided to use the Blockchain for its loyalty program. Each time a customer spent one ruble, they would receive a WhopperCoin. Once 1,700 coins were accrued, they could be traded for a burger. Head of external communications at Burger King Russia, Ivan Shestov, opined:“Now Whopper is not only [a] burger that people in 90 different countries love — it’s an investment tool as well.”Potcoin had legitimate reasons for coming into existence, helping move the marijuana industry, which operates between being legal and illegal in different space, to a more global space.The idea was that PotCoin could be used to facilitate transactions within the cannabis industry.

According to the office of Joon H. Kim, the Acting US Attorney for Manhattan, it means the government now has rights to the proceeds.The reason for Ulbricht challenging the seizure came in part because of the corrupt secret service agents that were exposed in the investigation.Two agents were implicated in corruption, one from the Drug Enforcement Agency and the other from the Secret Service, who posed as criminals in order to steal Bitcoins.Despite the actions of the corrupt officials, there was still more than enough evidence to sink Ulbricht including detailed server and chat records that identified him as the ""Dread Pirate Roberts"" who built and controlled Silk Road."

The catch is that the company’s owners will only accept the digital currency Bitcoin as a form of payment, The Standard reports:","According to London Wall co-founder Lev Loginov, their aim in accepting only Bitcoin as payment is to pioneer Bitcoin transactions in Great Britain.“We want to shift all the perceptions on cryptocurrency. We think in future it is going to eliminate the need for solicitors and property title and is really going to change how real estate transactions are conducted. We would like to be the first company to transact in Bitcoin. It can be done quicker, more efficiently and it is much easier to deal with than using banks, which are putting in unnecessary over-regulation.”At the current exchange rate for Bitcoin, the price equivalent of the mansion is around 5,050 Bitcoins.According to Loginov, there will be issues that they need to resolve in consummating a sale, such as the question of how to pay commission to the estate agents and the stamp duty to the Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC). The property is expected to trigger a £1.95 million stamp duty bill.Loginov, however, said that he is confident that all issues will be successfully resolved based on his previous experiences.”I grew up in Siberia [after] the Soviet Union collapse in the Nineties. We had no money, and barter was a common thing. We were exchanging potato bags for TV sets and cars. I’m sure leading London agents can figure out how to take commissions for a £17 million property in cryptocurrency and I have full faith in HRMC to figure out how to tax it.”Such a move is part of the growing trend where cryptocurrency is the preferred form of payment for real estate deals. As the value of Bitcoin increases, we’ll continue seeing more and more real estate owners supporting Bitcoin payments instead of traditional payment methods."

The rumors appear to stem from a recent report on squawker.org, Some surveys have indicated that the company would have a financial reason to do so, but no official announcement has been made.  ","The squawker.org article references a mention in investor James Altucher’s newsletter. According to the source, Altucher is an experienced trader who many believe could have pre-announcement information. The article comments:“James Altucher has (co)founded more than 20 companies, authored 11 books, and has been a contributor to several major publications.He is a former hedge fund manager and venture capitalist turned activist blogger/podcaster and offers a subscription based mailing list – the source of the Amazon information.”Such an announcement is a long shot, but isn’t inconceivable. As online retailers begin to embrace Bitcoin, Amazon will likely respond in kind, in order to maintain its dominance. Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne said:“They have to follow suit. I’d be stunned if they don’t, because they can’t just cede that part of the market to us, if we’re the only main, large retail site accepting Bitcoin.”The move would also continue a trend that began with Overstock and has included other enterprise-level tech companies. A recent comment within a Google API tutorial has led many to believe that the online behemoth will also begin accepting Bitcoin within the Google Store, as PayPal and others already do.As recently as this summer, users were petitioning Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, to begin accepting the cryptocurrency. The move may occur as early as October 26th, during the next earnings conference call.It should be reiterated that this is likely only a rumor at this point, and could be swiftly put to rest. Nonetheless, it is interesting to speculate on the possibilities if Amazon does one day integrate Bitcoin. As the adoption of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies grow, retailers will need to join the progression toward acceptance in order to remain relevant."

While regulations are fast moving toward Bitcoin acceptance, the current SEC climate is not ready. According to the fund managers:","“Although digital currency market regulation continues to rapidly evolve, at this time Grayscale does not believe there have been enough regulatory developments to prompt the SEC to approve the application.”The move may be wise, given the current regulatory climate the SEC has instituted. Recent changes in leadership notwithstanding, the general SEC tone toward cryptocurrencies and ICOs has been cautious.The withdrawal from the exchange identifies one of the major hurdles to acceptance of Bitcoin, namely the seemingly technical nature of the cryptocurrency. GBTC has sought to bring Bitcoin into the mainstream by helping investors to purchase Bitcoin but through the vehicle of something far more familiar - stocks.Currently, GBTC is traded ‘over the counter’ - an insider term for trading on less formal exchange platforms. Nevertheless, fund shares trade at a dramatic premium to the Bitcoin the fund actually holds. GBTC closed at $739.50 per share yesterday, while each share holds approximately $375 in Bitcoin."

He also is a YouTube personality, crypto-expert and jawline enthusiast.","Ameer Rosic sat down with Stephen Chase, Cointelegraph's VP for Strategic Partnerships, after moderating this year’s BlockShow Asia to talk about his journey from getting kicked out of high school to becoming one of the most comprehensible voices in the world of cryptocurrency, the trials and tribulations of creating an education platform and the undeniable reality of Bitcoin.CT: How did you manage to find yourself here talking with us about such a new industry?AR: I stumbled upon this industry about three years ago. I had an underwear company in Hong Kong and I sold my shares for that. Then, my journey started off with the exact same questions like, where can I learn more about this stuff? I understand technology. I am not a developer, but I do understand technology and the most common answer I got was 'go to Reddit' and I forking hate forums, I'm not going to Reddit, I am not spending hours. I wanted someone to just tell me, right? Time is the most important thing to me. I want to conserve my time. So I realized, nothing exists and I've got to create my own and that is where BlockGeeks came from. And then, I love video; I love YouTubing. I've been doing that for about four-five years and I just do it for fun. People think that it's a professional thing, but it is far from it. I do it for fun. There is no business behind it. Whatever I think about, I do it.CT: Not monetarily, but deep in your heart what is the best thing that has happened to you personally since you started this series?AR: This dates before I started doing Blockchain. For me, I'm a big proponent of education. I never went to high school, I got kicked out. I started doing business when I was fifteen years old. I'm 32 right now, so I've had many.I love the fact that no matter where you are in the world, with Internet connection and a hand-held device you can get an education for free. For me, my biggest love and what illuminates my heart is the fact that people, out of their own volition, without any authority, without anybody telling them to learn, they willfully learn by themselves.CT: Have you and Vitalik thought about building a school or educational platform for cryptocurrency?AR: That's what BlockGeeks is about. I live in Toronto and we have a really robust Blockchain community in Toronto. We have a huge Bitcoin crew over here, we have hyper ledger, and I am lucky enough to know Vitalik (Buterin)'s father Dmitry who is my business partner at BlockGeeks. We are the world's largest online community for training developers. We have 3.5 mln visitors a month and 6,000 students right now. On BlockGeeks we have three full-time Blockchain engineers who are creating curriculum and we're just moving forward.CT: What is the biggest challenge you've come across with the online training?AR: I'll tell you exactly what that is. Number one, finding teachers that can teach. And number two, finding teachers that actually know about this space. That was mission impossible. We didn't find anybody. So, what we found was very-very smart engineers that have a love of teaching and we trained them in Blockchain. It's all video based, so we have videographers and they spend every single day making very high-quality courses; study at your own pace, bit by bit.CT: Have you thought about incorporating a coin or a token of sorts into this educational platform?AR: Not in BlockGeeks. We are launching a Bounty soon to incentivize students to put their knowledge to good use, but we don't plan to tokenize. For me, I see no need to tokenize BlockGeeks, I see no need to Blockchain it. It actually takes away from the benefit of my students. The reality of Blockchain is that it's slow, it's clunky. I need hundreds of transactions per second and if you're an ERC20 token, you can only do about 70 transactions per second. That's not to say that other platforms can't come around, but the reality is that the technology is not capable, yet. We have a couple of years for this reality to actually catch up with us.CT: Who would you ideally like to work with on your platform to better serve your consumer?AR: On our platform, ideally we're doing something right now like that. We're doing scholarships, so we are trying to work with the biggest companies in the Blockchain space like L4V or Venture Fund. We are launching a huge scholarship for people who can't afford to it. Even though we are trying to make it as affordable as possible--it's only fifty dollars a month for all access to our courses, full Q&A, support from our teachers. We try to make it as affordable as possible, so you tell us why you can't afford it and tell us what you want to learn and you're in.CT: What do you want the world to know about how they should look at cryptocurrency and how they should look at Blockchain?AR: My advice for people is that no matter who you are whether you're an entrepreneur, whether you're working nine to five, whether you're a mother, whether you're a father, whether you are somebody in the bureaucratic government. Take your time to just understand one aspect that you care about. Most people try to understand everything, they try to become an expert. I tell people 'try to understand one thing; understand that Bitcoin--if you could even just understand--that Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and a cryptocurrency has these features,' that is a huge step forward. Then with that knowledge, you can go down the rabbit hole.CT: How can we create a social cause pool, almost off of your scholarship idea, with all of these companies that are involved with Blockchain technology?AR: Funny you should say that what I want to do and I have to figure out the reputation system and we're working on this, we want to build our own LMS. At the end of the day, I'm a fintech company and I know many companies. Regardless of the Blockchain space; the biggest problem in the tech space is a lack of really good developers. A certification doesn't mean you're a good dev, nothing--I mean, congratulations you have a forking PDF. I want to see your GitHub portfolio, I want to see how many questions you answer on stack exchange. I actually want to see the work that you've put in. Just show me, show me you're a developer, show me the code.I was thinking of this a while ago. Companies need really good developers. Imagine we need to go to Africa, I am a firm believer that I don't need to be there. I shouldn't be there. I should just give you, who is there, the opportunity to do your best, that's it. You don't have the same opportunity as I do and I get that, but I should not forking be there. I don't want to be in your way, there is no reason for me to be in Africa. I just need to give you the opportunity. So, imagine we have a system where, let's say I'm in Kenya and I really want to do coding and I have very basic skills of coding. I can go to somewhere maybe like BlockGeeks where I put my portfolio, my profile saying 'listen, I want to learn about this, I don't have the financial means, and I'm willing to go through a process to get hired ‘cause that's what I want."

The agency, however, reiterated that the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin is still the preferred currency in cybercrime.","In its 2017 Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment (IOCTA) report, Europol stated that the darknet landscape is rapidly evolving. The agency concluded that Monero is fast gaining darkweb popularity because of its “additional security and privacy features” making it one of the easy cryptocurrency choices for criminals.Part of the report reads:“Cryptocurrencies continue to be exploited by cybercriminals, with Bitcoin being the currency of choice in criminal markets, and as payment for cyber-related extor on a empts, such as from ransomware or a DDoS attack. However, other cryptocurrencies such as Monero, Ethereum and Zcash are gaining popularity within the digital underground”.The report further detailed the main reason why cryptocurrencies are becoming a favorite among criminals:""Transactions cannot be attributed to any particular user/address, all coins used in a transaction are 'hidden' by default, and transaction histories are kept private.""In its report, Interpol focuses on the popularity of digital currencies on darknet marketplaces. As an example, it cites the case of a Monero-focused ransomware called Kirk that was launched in early 2017.In the case of Ethereum, the report claimed that smart contracts based on the cryptocurrency could be utilized to legalize payments between crime service providers. It also presented a case of a proposed decentralized darknet market that is designed to operate on the Ethereum Blockchain.Meanwhile, the document clarified that Zcash is yet to be the subject of a law enforcement investigation. However, the virtual currency is reportedly being eyed by darknet marketplaces due to its privacy features, which hide both the transaction recipient and the transaction amount.The biggest darknet market AlphaBay was shuttered by Europol in early 2017. The closure was part of a globally coordinated crackdown on underground markets. However, prior to its shutdown,  AlphaBay had already added Ethereum and Monero as payment options, and previously had plans to include Zcash.While any currency can be associated with any criminal activities, such security issues with cryptocurrencies provide an easy excuse for governing bodies to continually be skeptical about the possible value and security of digital currencies."

The Tokyo based Bitcoin exchange was the biggest in the world until $480 mln went missing and founder Mark Karpeles decided to cease operations back in 2014. He stood on trial for embezzlement and data manipulation.The FSA said it is reviewing a further 17 license applications from hopeful exchange operators seeking approval."

Byrne said:“Remember that a year-and-a-half ago, Jamie Dimon wrote a letter to shareholders saying ‘this is going to come eat our lunch.’ He was scared to death of it. I think what they thought was they could get in front of it and they are realizing they can’t get in front of it.” Byrne’s comments reflect a growing sentiment that traditional banking platforms are frightened by the explosive growth and stability of Bitcoin. Other banking institutions have responded in similar ways, while businessmen in other markets have embraced the cryptocurrency. The CEO also commented on the power of Blockchain technology for business, stating that Overstock has sought to be a front runner in adopting the disruptive technology.“What people are realizing about Blockchain is that you can take out about 90 percent of the back office costs of all kinds of mechanisms and banks and stock markets and such. That’s why Overstock has been sort of pioneering the application of Blockchain to Wall Street. You cannot only take out the cost, but you can also create a version of Wall Street where no one can cheat.” Overstock has been one of the first companies to allow users to buy merchandise online with Bitcoin, and the company has even disclosed that it keeps funds in reserve in Bitcoin."

It is almost contradictory, given that the founder of Standpoint Research has been giving fortune-making stock recommendations for the past 20 years.“I am not a billionaire, and I would not want to be seen in the same room as a billionaire. I am nauseated by the way they behave, I am nauseated by the amount of money they spend on themselves when we have people starving to death in this world.”“One needs to raise their voice, as speaking nicely to the people at the top of the vulture capitalist pyramid is not working very well.”It is not hard to understand Moas’ animosity towards opulent billionaires and the gross division between rich and poor, given that he has helped many people become wealthy. While some choose to hoard their wealth, he has taken it upon himself to give to those less fortunate.While his charitable endeavors are a passion, they are byproduct of his upbringing and Education.Born in New York, Moas grew up in the city. At 16-years- old, his family returned to his father’s birthplace in Israel where Moas finished school and started a degree, which he had to postpone to serve in the Israeli military.A self-proclaimed ‘wizard’ with numbers growing up, he eventually returned to New York in 1994 where he went on to complete a Masters of Business Administration degree at Baruch College, City University of New York. Coupled with an Honors undergraduate degree in Economics and Business, he began to pave his way to success.Cutting his teeth in the world of stock recommendations, he quickly became renowned for his accurate predictions. While he plugged away the hours, Moas developed his own 155-variable equity valuation model over a five-year period in the late 1990s and early 2000s.Moas attributes his success to a combination of the ideas generated by his model, as well as the insights he delivers in strategic reports.“First of all, I outworked most in my industry. The ideas are generated by the 155-variable computer model. I don’t just tell you I like a name because it scored well on my model, I apply heavy fundamental and subjective overlays and then I go out with a 20-40 page report to back it up.”“That is why I was able to separate myself from the pack. If you are doing the same thing as everyone else on Wall Street, you will end up with the same results. You have to be a сontrarian.”“The computer model is my ‘secret sauce’. It allows me to crunch numbers on thousands of names in a matter of minutes and then I can focus on the names that rise to the top.”Having spent the last 20 years providing the very best stock analysis to various clientele, Moas has rubbed shoulders with some of the richest people out there. Perhaps that is why he has taken it upon himself to give back to the poorest of the poor, Robin Hood-esque, having seen wealth and greed in the ugliest light.For the past decade, Moas has been closely involved with Food for the Poor, one of the largest, five-star rated charity organizations in the US. Moas has devoted a lot his personal time, energy and resources to the charity.Reflecting on a trip to Haiti earlier this year with Angel Aloma, the charity’s executive director, Moas described the abject poverty most Haitians are living in.“It is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and most people there live on less than four dollars a day. The government has no tax revenue and is not able to assist the starving and struggling population,” Moas said.“Had anyone seen what I saw with my own eyes, not only the conditions these people live in, but the work that Food for the Poor does there, they would understand why I would take the shirt off my back for this charity and the poor.”As a personal champion for the charity, Moas aims to raise $10 mln in funds for the organization - which is used to collect and distribute humanitarian aid, materials and supplies to the 18 Caribbean and Latin American countries supported by Food for the Poor.In 2017, the charity built 5,000 double-unit concrete homes; distributed 4,000 container loads of humanitarian aid and more than 400 mln meals. Administrative expenses were less than five percent.Highlighting the injustice of the modern world, Moas said wealthy individuals need to donate a fraction of their wealth to help others in need.“If you donate $100, it buys 400 pounds of rice and beans. That’s enough to feed two starving children for an entire year. Three mln children have starved to death worldwide in 2017.”To date, Moas has raised over $118,000 from more than 500 donations and says it is only a matter of time until he reaches his goal. You can provide donations here.You wouldn’t be wrong if you consider Moas a workaholic. For the past 10 years, he’s been consistently rated as one of the best stock pickers in the world. With the help of a small and trusted team at Standpoint Research, he delivers stock analysis on a daily basis.When he finds the time, travel and music are favorite pastimes. When he lived in Israel, he worked for Shuki Weiss Productions who has been bringing the biggest artists and bands in the World to Israel for the past 25 years.Moas says Tel Aviv has become a central point for bands to play, given the socio-political turmoil in surrounding countries. Guns N’ Roses and Aerosmith recently chose to end their respective European tours in Tel Aviv.With a collection of more than 1,500 CDs, Moas has a broad taste in music. Pushed for a list of favorites, he singles out legendary rock bands like Led Zeppelin, Motorhead, AC/DC, The Cult and Judas Priest.His love of music is matched by what can only be described as a wanderlust, having visited more than 70 countries. He will be departing this week on a 38-day trip which will include stops in Mexico City, Los Angeles, Fiji, New Zealand, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Oman and Amsterdam.The midpoint of his trip is eagerly anticipated for the cryptocurrency world, as Moas will be co-headlining at the Coinsbank Blockchain Cruise. The cruise around Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand includes the most influential people in the cryptocurrency space, from John McAfee to Tone Vays.Moas has quickly become a trusted voice in the cryptocurrency space, especially when it comes to valuations and price predictions. He has been spot on with a number of predictions in 2017 - which is extraordinary if you consider that he only started analyzing the cryptocurrency market this year.“It happened six months ago. I was in my stock market bubble and I wasn’t even looking at cryptocurrencies. I was like everyone else on Wall Street – we would hear the name Bitcoin in passing and it sounded like some far-fetched concept and I paid no attention to it whatsoever,” Moas said.“Someone told me to take a look at Ethereum and that weekend I ended up taking a look at Bitcoin as well and it only took me a few hours to realize what was going on there. I just pounced on it and since then I haven’t looked back.”The accuracy of his recommendations have led to a surge in business, and Moas says 90 percent of his clients are now looking for cryptocurrency recommendations.It’s hardly surprising that his name produces more than 1000 results on Google when searched alongside ‘Bitcoin,’ and his Twitter following shot up from 7,000 to more than 22,000 in the space of a few months.Voltaire coined the phrase ‘with great power comes great responsibility,’ and it is a concept Moas is well-aware of, given his influence over people’s decisions to invest in cryptocurrencies.“It’s flattering and rewarding from an emotional standpoint, but you have to understand that it’s a lot of responsibility I have on my shoulders right now. I have people from all over the world that are putting a big chunk of their life-savings behind my recommendations.”“I have people calling me from third world countries who have an eighth of a Bitcoin, worth $2,000, hoping that it will be worth $20,000 one day so that they can rescue their entire family from poverty.”And so it goes. Moas, the man who proverbially steals from the rich and gives to the poor, is fast becoming an insightful and trusted critic of cryptocurrencies and their future valuations. When Moas puts a number on something, you’d best sit up and take notice."

It covers everything from Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to ICO regulation and investment analysis.

However, the Bubble Generation isn’t accepted by traditional banks (even by neobanks). Various banks around the world are not happy about people buying Bitcoin. We have seen multiple banks close customer accounts because of this activity.South Korea banned its traditional banks from dealing in virtual currencies. The hyper-wired country has emerged as a hotbed for cryptocurrency trading, accounting for some 20 percent of global Bitcoin transactions. That’s about 10 times its share of the world economy. Roughly one mln South Koreans are estimated to own Bitcoins. South Korea’s government also will ban minors and foreigners from trading in virtual currency or creating bank accounts for them in the country.Banks have ""little or no appetite"" to get involved with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies due to fears of a bubble and illicit activity associated with it, the chief executive of Credit Suisse said. The chief financial officer of ING also weighed in on cryptocurrency worries, saying that although digital assets are an effective means of exchange, the bank was not advising clients to in invest in them. TD Bank is actually trying to block Bitcoin purchases as well, although the company is mainly performing routine checks by the looks of things.The PNC bank recently threatened one of their customers for purchasing Bitcoin. Barclays closed down a student’s account after his dealings in Bitcoin. British banks are shunning companies that handle cryptocurrencies, forcing many to open accounts in Gibraltar, Poland and Bulgaria. Anson Zeall, the head of Singapore’s Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Industry Association or Access, said his organization had heard from 10 companies which had encountered problems with their banking relationships in Singapore. Chia Hock Lai, president of the Singapore Fintech Association, said some of his organization’s members also experienced account closures.A few months ago, Visa announced it would suspend all crypto debit cards outside of the European Economic Area. It now turns out Mastercard will be doing the exact same thing. Josh Brown, the chief executive officer of Ritholtz Wealth Management, bought some crypto. Still, Brown, who helps manage half a billion dollars, isn’t really a convert quite yet.Let's call things by their own names - traditional banks hate crypto. But this hatred is stemming from the lack of understanding, fear of uncertainty and laziness rather than anger. Why are banks not willing to understand your issues? First, they already have a large and understandable business and they are not interested in a new and small one. Second, imagine a specialist in compliance. He/she is 40/50 years old, not highly paid, without any career perspectives.Their mindset is built on the past (instead of the future) and their decisions are conditioned on avoiding bad things instead of growing new ones. They see a lot of transactions daily and finally they see some odd transaction after the conversion of crypto, and … they block it. Why? Not because they are bad people. Simply because they don’t know anything about Blockchain, cryptocurrencies and ICOs. In their world, ""everything that is odd is forbidden” and if they make a mistake, they will be fired. Therefore, they send a page or two of dreary questions, and then simply block the account.Why can’t the existing 25 crypto-friendly cards and newborn eight ICO-backed crypto-friendly neobanks can’t solve this problem? Since these are half-hearted solutions (it's like gluing more and more plasters on the arm affected by gangrene). You depend on your partner bank. And if you reach some large amounts within its cash flows (in fact the business strategy of such partner banks that agree to such an additional risk is to ""drown"" your transactions in their core business so that they are not noticed, and receive additional income for the risk), the risks that this bank will be approached by senior bankers (regulators and correspondent banks) and asked to stop working with you are not eliminated but simply deferred to a later date. It is the reason why I am looking for a bank in the US to buy – to be focused only on this type of startup and this type of “source of funds.”Vladislav SolodkiyBio: Vladislav Solodkiy, managing partner at Life.SREDA, Singapore-based fintech-VC, author of The First Fintech Bank’s Arrival book."

are going to want to be able to talk the talk when it comes to Bitcoin.","Nov 22, 2017","With Thanksgiving in one day and cryptocurrencies being a hot topic, you are going to want to be able to talk the talk when it comes to Bitcoin. If not, you’ll at least want to understand what grandpa Rick is saying at the dinner table when he tells the family he is thankful he HODL’d .","There is a set of words that you can be confident will come up in a crypto-related conversation. Having a good understanding of these words will allow you to better navigate and understand cryptocurrencies and will provide you with a decent basis to grow your crypto-related knowledge upon.First, you will want to be aware of these four words associated with the Bitcoin Network. There are a lot of technicalities in cryptocurrency, but I believe knowing these four words will give you a strong understanding for all the tech that comes after.Blocks: Each transaction that occurs on the Bitcoin Network, is recorded into a 1MB file called a block. A block contains some of the most recent transactions that took place on the Bitcoin Network. A block can be thought of as a ledger.Blockchain: We know that a block is a ledger of the most recent transactions that occurred over the Bitcoin network, and we know that each block is limited to 1MB in size… but this means that the entire transaction history of Bitcoin will not fit into a single block.This is where the Blockchain comes into fruition; because the entire transaction history of Bitcoin cannot fit into a single block. Instead, the blocks build on top of each other, stacking new blocks (new information regarding the network's transaction history) on top of old blocks (the past record of the Bitcoin network’s transaction history), to create the Blockchain, the record of every transaction that has ever occurred over the Bitcoin network.Nodes: Any computer that is connected to the Bitcoin Network is considered a node. Every node keeps a copy of the Blockchain and verifies if the chain sequence is valid or not if a node finds that a block is not in consensus with a majority of the nodes on the network, it will reject that block.  Mining: Miners are the individuals who keep the bitcoin network afloat. Their duties include mining: verifying transactions (adding new blocks to the Blockchain) and releasing new Bitcoin into circulation (when they receive their reward for block discovery).Bitcoin Miners run protocols through powerful computers that attempt to solve the complex algorithms that verify blocks and release new Bitcoin into circulation. When a Miner discovers a new block, they are rewarded with freshly minted Bitcoin as the first transaction in the following block. Currently, the reward for discovering a block is 12.5 Bitcoin. Furthermore, if a miner discovers a block, they are paid the summation of the transaction fees in the block that they discover.Miners really don’t get enough credit. Bitcoin Miners should honestly have a national holiday.Alternative Coins (altcoins): Altcoins are cryptocurrencies that trade on exchanges. Bitcoin is often the headliner, and Ethereum is often its amuse bouche, but several other cryptocurrencies exist. CoinMarketCap lists information on 1,318 different cryptocurrencies on their website.Initial Coin Offering (ICO): Similar to an IPO, an ICO allows businesses to raise capital. In an ICO, Businesses sell virtual tokens to supporters that can be exchanged and traded for other currencies or used to buy goods or services from that business at a later date.HODL (Hold On for Dear Life):  HODLing or holding on for dear life viz. holding your Bitcoin for the long term, is the opposite of actively trading Bitcoin or holding Bitcoin for short periods of time.HODL originated in 2013 when a user on the Bitcointalk.org forum accidentally titled his post: “I AM HODLING,” when he meant to type “I AM HOLDING.” Since then, the crypto community has strongly embraced the new lexicon.HODL can be a verb, a noun, or an adjective. All that you need to know is that a true HODLer would not sell his or her coins until all 21 mln coins have been mined.FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt): when the crypto-community calls news FUD, they will often say that the news released is not objective or relevant to Bitcoin but rather rumorous talk in the industry that has the ability to affect price. For instance, many people referred to the news that China had banned Bitcoin mining as FUD. News that falls into the FUD category can be considered to be more of a rumor or scare tactic than news that provides relevant information relating to current events. FUD can arise when an entity takes a look at an event that allegedly took place and insinuates a certain future for Bitcoin or crypto because of the alleged event.Now that you have an understanding of a few words that are ubiquitous in the crypto-community, you will have a leg up on your peers when crypto pops up in conversation.   Now you can sit back and impress your family at the dinner table this Thanksgiving, or you can at least act like you know what you’re talking about when Bitcoin pops up in the conversation over Thanksgiving dinner. #CT_questions Will you be able to hold a #crypto-conversation at the dinner table this #Thanksgiving?"

May in a series of raids made by Bulgarian law enforcement are now worth ...","Dec 8, 2017",Yesterday afternoon several major banks in Bulgaria terminated accounts held by the country’s cryptocurrency exchanges. The banks are also blocking transfers to and from international Bitcoin exchanges. The country’s affected exchanges have temporarily suspended their services.,"Crypto exchanges that offer crypto to fiat transactions very much rely on traditional fiat banking. But the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency means that it is riskier to transact in, given that transactions are difficult to reverse.This week in Bulgaria major banks decided to do away with this risk by force. The swift move to block accounts held by Bulgarian crypto exchanges was evidently a coordinated decision made by Bulgaria’s top banks.The move was unrelated to any explicit government decision or regulation. Participating banks appear to be trying to mitigate risk by not transacting in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.According to a post from the administrator of the Bulgarian Bitcoin forum, the banks closed the accounts of all companies whose activities are related to the purchase or sale of Bitcoin. In addition to Fibank, affected companies mentioned the United Bulgarian Bank (UBB) as one of the banks blocking accounts.In a post in the same thread of the Bitcoin forum, the alleged managing director of an affected company, Neven Dilkov, wrote that though the UBB also blocked their accounts, not all banks in the country are taking this harsh stance:“I spoke with Societe Generale and Piraeus separately [and] both banks do not have a problem with companies working with cryptocurrencies.”Crypto exchanges affected by this week’s crackdown include Cix.bg, Crypto.bg, and Cryptobank.bg. According to their site, the latter is still open for trading but is accepting funds only via ePay.Plus, in addition to Bitcoin, the exchange has temporarily suspended trading in Ether due to overloads on the network caused by CryptoKitties.Bulgarians looking to purchase Bitcoin for fiat can still do so via Coinbase and LocalBitcoins.Separately, Bulgaria and Bitcoin recently made headlines because of a government raid made back in May. With the recent spike in Bitcoin’s price, the 200,000 Bitcoins seized in May in a series of raids made by Bulgarian law enforcement are now worth over $3 bln.This sum is a six-fold increase from the time of the raids when the entire seizure was worth just $500 mln. It remains unclear what the Bulgarian government is planning to do with the seized funds."

Party Congress. 38566 Total views. 402 ...","Sep 17, 2017","“Do not be afraid to slow down, be afraid to stop” - Chinese proverb.","Dmitry Khan, the strategic advisor of chatbot platform Miniapps.pro was going to Beijing to promote his forthcoming Miniapps token generation event at the “2017 Shape the Future” Blockchain summit when he received a sudden email. It was from the event’s organizers, saying that the event might have to be delayed and change venue.Dmitry said:“That’s okay. More surprising was how this was followed by the ban of ICOs in China. Anyway, we tried to get some meetings in Beijing. Then we came down here in Shanghai, and now they want to shut down Bitcoin trading. Interesting what will happen next week when I go to Hong Kong.”All these events evoke a sense of some uncertainty among the participants of the 3rd Global Blockchain Summit in Shanghai. The forum is organized by Wanxiang Blockchain Lab – a Blockchain research institution co-founded by Vitalik Buterin altogether with Wanxiang Holdings – the biggest manufacturer of auto spare parts in China, and the company behind the luxury sports sedan Karma Revero that is gearing up to challenge Tesla.After the latest Bitcoin news from China, the Summit organizers asked participants – startups, investors and crypto funds – to avoid mentioning the term 'ICO.' The main theme of the forum was shifted to a discussion of practical applications of Blockchain technology and its potential benefits and risks.However, the organizers couldn’t prevent entrepreneurs from chasing investors and making pitches to pre-ICO funds. All the restaurants, cafes and bars around the venue are filled with crowd talking just about that.  Running and participating in ICO is now prohibited for both Chinese companies and citizens. All Bitcoin exchanges are also preparing to suspend their services following instructions from the government.Perhaps the main goal of the decision to shut down Bitcoin trading was the Chinese government’s concern that increasing numbers of people were participating in ICOs. It is worth noting that only two years ago, in 2015, China proclaimed a Year of Blockchain, and included Blockchain in its National Five-Year Plan in 2016.People here are therefore quite informed about the technology and its applications for token generation and trading. That was fuelled by Chinese passion and increasing opportunities in the cryptocurrency market (the biggest Bitcoin miners are all located in China). In short, the Chinese government seemingly decided to avoid a bigger fuss and take the ‘sustainable development’ approach to ease people's worries about cryptocurrency volatility and possible losses.Besides that, Beijing still hasn’t found proper solutions to regulate the mobilization of capital via ICO and how to license the exchange of cryptocurrencies. Thus, the government merely took a time-out to create a regulative framework for crypto economy.  Nobody knows what comes next.Some people believe that such decisions have already been prepared and will be announced in the nearest weeks or months, allowing regulated exchanges and ICOs to become legal again. There are also sceptics, one of which – an expert at respectful Chinese economical journal – shared with us his belief that the current situation will stay until next year because of the Chinese Communist Party Congress, which is planned to take place on the 19th of October.The Congress is gathered every five years and will determine the main direction of the country’s development and internal and foreign policy. This will probably be followed be a reshuffle of government and party leaders.Only after that can any further development of the crypto economy and its attendant regulation become clear.   A Chinese proverb says: “Keep a peace of mind, time will come and the flowers will blossom.” When applied to the crypto economy, this means that before we fully enjoy its benefits we should see first how it survives and adapts to the condition of near total prohibition."

Similarly, Bitcoin users are a tremendously motivated community of early adopters. By creating connective tissue between these forward-thinking business models, I believe we're molding the future for consumer-first, experience-driven commerce.”Under the new scheme, Surf Air allows its members to pay a monthly fee for them to fly as many times as they want. The passengers enrolled in the service are already pre-screened through a government-licensed background check so they would not be required to wait in security.The regional carrier is partnering with digital currency platform Coinbase in the implementation of its new scheme with Coinbase handling the payments side of the program.Players in the airline industry, particularly the regional and smaller companies, have taken a positive approach on the virtual currencies.Before Surf Air, several regional airlines have already accepted Bitcoin as a form of payment over the years. Other companies have also explored other possible applications of the cryptocurrencies' underlying technology called Blockchain, including in ticket disbursement and maintenance tracking."

The swap is particularly important because it was made off chain, meaning that ownership of the coins changed hands, but there was no transaction recorded on either Blockchain. According to Litecoin founder Charlie Lee:","""Previous atomic swaps that I have done were on-chain, and had the on-chain limitations of slow [transactions] and high transaction fees. Off-chain atomic swaps are significantly better. They are instant, [have] low fees, and better protect one's privacy.”This system would allow users willing to connect between chains the opportunity to pass cryptocurrencies without having to wait for the on-chain confirmations, and with far lower fees. This connection would produce incredibly faster transactions for Bitcoin, as well as a simple but elegant solution to the ongoing scaling debate among enthusiasts.The other substantial benefit to such transactions is that they are effectively fully anonymous. Because they leave no trace on either chain but are complete, they are untraceable in any form. Such privacy is something that is being pursued by ZK options on the Ethereum chain.Cointelegraph has reached out to Konstantin Gladych, the CEO of Changelly for his opinion on the swap technology:""Changelly is a centralized exchange processing large transactions for the fairest rates on the market. We are keen on the idea of atomic off-chain swaps as a new evolution step providing risk-free p2p OTC deals. However, it cannot completely replace the existing ecosystem so far."" "

formal request for Bitcoin futures-tracking ETFs. 38910 Total views.","Dec 21, 2017",The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has become the latest to put forward a Bitcoin ETF-related proposal to the SEC. NYSE is planning on launching two funds to track Bitcoin futures. The ProShares Bitcoin ETF and the ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF will be the two exchange-traded funds that would allow traders to bet on how the volatile cryptocurrency futures contracts will perform.,"These funds would closely follow the movements of the current futures markets operating out of CME and CBOE. From there, the funds would invest their assets in benchmark futures contracts with the option of investing in contracts outside the benchmark. NYSE was quick to point out that the funds will not actually own Bitcoins, stopping just a step shy of an actual Bitcoin ETF:“By being long Bitcoin Futures Contracts, the Fund seeks to benefit from daily increases in the price of the Bitcoin Futures Contracts. The Fund will not be benchmarked to the current price of Bitcoin and will not invest directly in Bitcoin. When the price of Bitcoin Futures Contracts held by the Fund declines, the Fund will lose value.""ETFs have been filed many times before, and each time they have been stopped at the SEC’s door. However, a lot has happened since those failed attempts, and the fact that futures have been launched, and the popular digital currency ahs hit new levels of acceptance, means that time may indeed be ripe for Bitcoin ETFs.If NYSE successfully launches their futures-tracking ETFs, would be further legitimacy added to the unregulated and highly volatile asset. It could also lead to the currency hitting another rally as was seen in the run up to the launch of the Bitcoin futures.Win Thin, global head of emerging markets strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, the custodian of the proposed ETFs has said:""It's very hard for us, as currency analysts, to follow this. It represents further mainstreaming. Hopefully that what comes out of this: some more regulatory oversight. Beyond that, we don't have any calls on where it will go from here.""Barry Silbert, founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group, said:""I think it is going to enable finally the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, and other digital currency ETFs, which is game changing,""Though the Winklevoss Twins and others have failed to earn the regulators’ approval for an ETF in the past, everything is different now.  With the successful launch of Bitcoin futures on the CME and CBOE exchanges, the SEC can no longer complain about the lack of a regulated mechanism for price discovery. This was their key objection when rejected earlier ETF proposals. A Bitcoin ETF is seen as huge for the currency, as it would open up Bitcoin trading to traditional investors."

The mainstream appeal of Bitcoin has seen it spread across different demographics, from retired grandmothers to some of the world’s biggest rappers.","Celebrities have been used to market certain ICOs, as well as be the face of a host of different coins, but many celebrities have chosen to invest their immense wealth into digital currencies.In true Hollywood-style, we go through 10 of the more surprising celebrities Bitcoiners.Perhaps this comedy star and well-known ‘That 70s show’ actor is not too surprising as with Kutcher maturing in Hollywood, he has also become quite business savvy. The actor has appeared on Shark Tank a few times. He is the co-founder of BitPay investor A-Grade Investments. Moreover, he is a poster-boy for breaking with convention and the decentralized approach to life.It may seem a bit tired now, but Floyd Mayweather was the first big celebrity to be used to promote an ICO. He was utilized when he was at the peak of his fame in the build-up to his fight with Conor McGregor. It is quite interesting to see how many ICOs Mayweather is planning to shill in the coming months. So far, he has been involved with at least two projects people know of, although it doesn’t appear as if this will be the end of it either.Another one of America’s funnymen. The former host of ‘Whose Line is it Anyway’ was one of the earlier adopters of Bitcoin and spoke in promoting quite understatedly. He said a few times that he was a big believer in its potential for mass adoption; however, he has been a little more muted of late.Rapper, The Game, is another one who is endorsing a cryptocurrency, but probably a little more involved in it than that. The Game has been brought on by ParagonCoin, an ICO aimed at the marijuana ecosystem, as an advisor and for The Game, it is another venture into the marijuana market. The hip-hop star became an official partner in a dispensary, marketing his own strain of weed- Trees by Game.Many scoffed when the 70-year-old former West Ham United, Portsmouth, Tottenham Hotspur and Birmingham City manager tweeted that he was “proper excited” about ICO Electroneum.It was all the more surprising that Redknapp was entering the crypto market as he once stated, in a case about tax fraud, that he did not know what an email was and he was technologically inept. However, Electroneum responded saying the former manager had not been paid for his tweet.The actor of Community fame and rapper under the name of Childish Gambino is one celebrity endorsement that can be trusted as his promotion of digital currencies is not attached to an ICO. During one of his interviews, he mentioned how Bitcoin could become a big success in due time.An often-heard complaint is how there aren’t enough women involved in cryptocurrency. Mel B is one of the few musical artists to accept Bitcoin payments for her music. It is unclear if she will accept the digital currency for her future albums as well, but the chance is very real that this partnership will continue for quite some time to come.The Uruguayan footballer, playing in Spain, seemed to have been used in a similar manner as Floyd Mayweather, promotion the same prediction market ICO. However, Suarez used his Spanish influence to spread the news to the country he played his football in.More strong women in the cryptocurrency world can only be considered to be a good thing right now. Paltrow is a world-renowned actress as well as a cryptocurrency advisor. More specifically, Abra chose the actress as the startup’s advisor during a recent episode of Planet of the Apps on Apple TV.It is somewhat of an open secret that Snoop Dogg has been a fan of cryptocurrency for quite some time now. Although his initial plan to accept Bitcoin payments for a new album turned out to be a farce, Snoop Dogg never fully closed the door on the possibility."

However, there have been instances where the likes of the SEC have struck in certain instances.The SEC stepped in on Tuesday when it temporarily suspends trading in shares of The Crypto Co. on concerns about ""accuracy and adequacy"" of information about the company.”The stock has soared more than 2,700 percent this month, just as several other small names have surged on news of ties to cryptocurrencies and the Blockchain technology behind them.The commission cited concerns about:""Accuracy and adequacy of information in the marketplace about, among other things, the compensation paid for promotion of the company, and statements in Commission filings about the plans of the company's insiders to sell their shares of The Crypto Company's common stock.""The release said:""Questions have also arisen concerning potentially manipulative transactions in the company's stock in November 2017.""Meanwhile, one of those small companies, as mentioned above, has recently changed its name Future Fintech; however, it used to be known as SkyPeople Fruit Juice, the former fruit juice company changing its focus.In that change, the company saw its stocks soar more than 200 percent and has a market cap reach just about $12.5 mln. Traders linked between the company and the cryptocurrency mania that has gripped the globe but it was a false link.However, there was no mention of ""Blockchain,"" ""Bitcoin"" or anything crypto-related in the release or the company's November presentation to investors.The ongoing battle between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash raged as the original chain’s token fell from $17,929 to a low of $16,912.However, the hard fork Bitcoin Cash soared on the news that Coinbase would be trading the currency.After the announcement, Bitcoin Cash’s price almost immediate jumped to over $3,000 in huge volume."

function over a Blockchain. While tokens can represent money, as in the 
case ...","Sep 29, 2017",In the current era of Blockchain evolution a new concept has emerged: tokenization. Tokenization is an intrinsic part of the Blockchain technology that serves the purpose of platform identification and accessibility.,"Every Blockchain platform is powered by tokens, sometimes also referred to as “coins.” Bitcoin is a token, as is Litecoin, Dash, and other currencies that function over a Blockchain. While tokens can represent money, as in the case of the above, they can also represent other things.The demand for a particular Blockchain product is usually the main determinant of the value and eventual market price of its token. This is why there is a variation in the prices of different altcoins in the Blockchain environment. For example, Bitcoin is more readily accepted by merchants than Litecoin, and is consequently more valuable.Ethereum, despite coming after many older altcoins, remains the third most valuable cryptocurrency in existence behind only Bitcoin and the its recent fork, Bitcoin Cash.Ethereum’s value is largely determined by the demand for its platform by distributed application (dApp) developers. Many of these developers issue tokens to grant access to their services, essentially building their own Blockchains atop Ethereum’s platform. In many cases, developers pre-sale their tokens as part of an initial coin offering (ICO), and they usually accept Ethereum’s token “ether” as payment.In essence, the organic value of a given token or cryptocurrency is determined not just by the functionality, but the demand for its Blockchain product.There are numerous Blockchain products in existence claiming to offer different solutions to various problems. Many more are still in the development. Below are some examples of Blockchain products and what they do:Steemit is a social network that rewards users who participate in various ways. The Steemit token is called STEEM. It is used to reward content creators and curators of the best content on the site.Dash, which stands for “Digital Cash,” is a fork of Bitcoin that is fine-tuned for more privacy and instant transactions. The platform’s token is called DASH. Dash is also self-funded through its own Blockchain (a portion of mining rewards fund the currency’s development) and features a working governance model.The token for Zcash is called ZEC. ZCash is a cryptocurrency that grew out of the Zerocoin project which aims to improve anonymity for Bitcoin users. Zcash payments are published on a public Blockchain, but users are able to use an optional privacy features to conceal the sender, recipient, and amount being transacted.WishKnish is a network of social marketplace communities that allows its users to create storefronts for various kinds of services. The platform also permits individuals interested in discovering products, services and communities that fit their needs. Participation in activities is rewarded in the platform’s local token, Knish.LAToken is an asset tokenization platform that allows users to convert tangible assets such as real estate or precious art works into tokens, thereby making them sellable in fractions. The token that powers the LAToken platform is the LAT.The above mentioned are just a few of the numerous cryptocurrencies and the platforms that they represent. While the first three are well-established entities that are listed on major exchanges, the others are still in their developmental stages.The strength and identity of a Blockchain product is most often represented by the characteristics of its token.However, while these tokens stand as the identity of their respective Blockchains, offering access to the services or solutions provided by their resident platforms, they also double as digital assets and opportunities for investment depending on how much the community values their platforms"

Ltd., and Xtheta Corp.Of the four companies, only Xtheta Corp. was authorized to trade multiple cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ethereum Classic (ETC), NEM (XEM), and Monacoin (MONA), as well as counterparty tokens (XCP). The rest of the exchanges are only allowed to trade Bitcoin (BTC).According to the FSA, other applications are still undergoing evaluation. There were also 12 companies whose applications were rejected because they did not meet the agency’s registration requirements. The disapproved exchanges have already shut down their operations.Among the applications under review is from Coincheck, which is the second biggest Bitcoin exchange in Japan. In its statement that was released on Dec. 1, the exchange claimed that its application to become a “virtual currency exchange trader” was filed in mid-September and is still under scrutiny until now.Meanwhile, the FSA released a document detailing its administrative policies that include those covering virtual currencies and initial coin offerings (ICO) in November. The guideline clarifies how the agency will be monitoring the digital currency exchanges."

The watchdog based its decision on the fact that it does not consider digital currencies to be a substitute for money, as they are not legal tender in the country.","During a press conference on the issue, FSS Governor Choe Heung-sik claimed that the only role the regulator should play in the digital currency space is warning the public about potential risks:“All we can do is to warn people as we don’t see virtual currencies as actual types of currency, meaning that we cannot step up regulation for now.”He also added that the introduction of any cryptocurrency regulation in the country will only promote digital currency trading, as investors will think that the watchdog already recognizes cryptocurrency as “actual” currency.The remarks of the governor are similar to his previous statements. In November 2017, he announced that the FSS will not directly supervise the operations and activities of digital currency exchanges since the virtual currencies being traded are not legal tender in the country.Given its position, the government was content issuing several rules, rather than establishing regulations, to oversee the local Bitcoin and digital currency industry.In the past, major exchanges in the country braced themselves and were ready to undergo all sorts of regulatory and compliance steps should financial regulators in the country decide to take action.Apart from a number of rules that were already issued, the National Tax Service (NTS) is currently drafting a framework on how to effectively collect taxes on cryptocurrency trading transactions.The NTS will most likely introduce capital gains taxes on companies and individuals who trade digital currencies."

the common man. 16279 Total views. Cypherpunk Lopp - Crypto ...","Dec 6, 2017","Well-known Software Engineer Jameson Lopp believes that cryptocurrencies are placing power back in the hands of people - who have trusted banks and financial institutions to be responsible with their money, investments and transactions for far too long.","One only needs to look at mainstream media headlines as Bitcoin price continues to soar after a month long bull run.Heads of traditional financial institutions and banks have hit out at Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as they fight to keep hold of the status quo. Countries like China have gone as far as banning the use of cryptocurrencies.But as the current Bitcoin price would suggest, more and more people are putting their faith and money in cryptocurrencies as a superior transactional technology.Speaking to Max Keiser, host of RT’s Keiser Report, Lopp believes that the successful development of Bitcoin has turned conventional thinking about banking and money on its head:“At least from the monetary standpoint, we said let's turn this whole thing upside down. Instead of us trusting certain entities, instead we are going to track everything ourselves, validate our rules and not trust anybody.”“We will create protocols and use the technology developed over the last generation in order to automate our communication and trust with each other.”Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has slowly crept its way into mainstream consciousness and has risen to the fore in the second half of 2017. So much so that institutional investors are lining up to get in on the action, with their entry point the launch of Bitcoin futures on the CBOE and CME.It wasn’t always that way, as self-proclaimed cypherpunk Lopp reminds us that the development of cryptocurrencies has followed an incredible journey of trial and error over the past 30 years.“The origin of the cypherpunk goes back to the 1980s. A bunch of nerds who saw the promise of the internet and these new communication technologies but they also saw the dark side.”These cyber revolutionaries predicted the future threat of surveillance agencies and began developing technology that ensured private communication, which has culminated in encrypted peer-to-peer communication technology and eventually Blockchain. Lopp continues:“They wanted to bring privacy-enhancing technologies into the internet itself, on top of the internet protocols and it just so happens that digital money was one of those interesting things the cypherpunks thought was important for society to have. A number of cypherpunks worked on it for decades and it wasn’t until 2009 that Satoshi came along with an elegant solution.”“There were many, many attempts and failed solutions that happened before Bitcoin.”Fast-forward eight years and Bitcoin remains the father of cryptocurrencies - but it is undoubtedly entering uncharted waters with the introduction of futures and other Wall Street trading practices.Lopp doesn’t entertain the notion that futures will cause Bitcoin to crash - saying anyone who tries to do that will not get very far:“There are some people that think it's going to short Bitcoin into the ground. I think a more likely outcome is that shorting Bitcoin is a terrible idea and anyone who tries to do that is going wrecked pretty hard.”It’s going to be another interesting month for cryptocurrencies in general, as everyone waits to see how Bitcoin will react to the introduction of futures.Lopp, on the other hand, has his eyes on a different horizon. The very fact that Bitcoin’s value is referred to using fiat currencies shows that there is some way to go before it becomes a heavyweight in the world economy.Lopp says the end goal is for Bitcoin to be a unit of measurement for other currencies.“This is just a transitional period. We’re still using the dollar as the unit of account. We’re trying to get to the point where we’re using Bitcoin as the unit of account. I think it’s going to be a few more years until we get to that point of hyperbitcoinization that some people are dreaming about.”"

The story comes as a response to recent comments by Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), encouraging banks and governments to not short-change Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.","The news should not come as a surprise, after the recent announcement by the Dubai government regarding its intention to issue a state cryptocurrency. Further, recent news indicates a large number of banks anonymously supporting state-issued coins as the Blockchain hype continues.The difficulty with a global digital currency is the centralization factor. A major part of the appeal of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is the decentralized protocol, creating a truly free market where value is based purely on consensus without price fixing.A globalized digital currency, while providing decentralized security, would require the IMF to fix and regulate values in order to manage the flow of money in and out of different countries. Such a system would run contrary to the underlying principles behind Bitcoin.The dollar as the reserve currency for much of the world’s transactional volume means that some major global economies may want a new digital currency to function as the reserve. The IMF coin could potentially replace the dollar in that context, should it become widely accepted. In such a case, the dollar and other national currencies would be restricted to local markets.Some supporters of Bitcoin would argue that there is no need for such a currency from the IMF, since Bitcoin already exists, and without the centralization risks. The greatest hurdle would be Lagarde and other economists embracing and using Bitcoin globally, but the jury is still out."

It covers everything from Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to ICO regulation and investment analysis from industry leaders. If you want to become our guest author and get published on Cointelegraph, please send us an email at mike@cointelegraph.com.","The IRS says Bitcoin and other digital currencies are considered property for tax purposes. That may sound simple, but it really isn’t, and that complexity can have far-reaching effects. For example, if you use Bitcoin to pay for something worth $500, what does the IRS say? You just sold your Bitcoin. You have gain or loss on the sale, depending on how much you paid for the Bitcoin, and how much it is worth when you sold (presumably about $500).  Is that gain ordinary, or capital; short or long term? It all depends on the circumstances, so buying that $500 item with Bitcoin can get messy. Meanwhile, the IRS is trying to crack down on reporting, since very few people seem to be reporting their transactions. The IRS is using John Doe summonses to obtain data on Bitcoin and other digital currency users, as recently publicized by the Coinbase case.The IRS is even hunting Bitcoin user identities with software. This may make you worry that you could owe taxes, penalties and interest. In extreme cases, the IRS could pursue cases criminally. However, a bipartisan bill, “The Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act of 2017,” was introduced in the House by Rep. Jared Polis (D-Co) and Rep. David Schweikert (R-Az). It calls for a tax exemption for transactions under $600.If it passes, it would provide a world of tax relief for smaller, day-to-day transactions. Remember, the IRS announced in Notice 2014-21 that Bitcoin and other digital currency is property for tax purposes, not currency. Every time you use digital currency, a taxable event is occurring.A payment made using virtual currency is subject to Form 1099 reporting too. Wages paid to employees using virtual currency are taxable, must be reported on a Form W-2, and are subject to federal income tax withholding and payroll taxes. That can mean paying the employee some cash and some Bitcoin, and taking federal withholdings from the cash payment.Virtual currency payments to independent contractors are taxable, and payers must issue Form 1099. This form must be filled out using Bitcoin’s value in dollars at the time of payment, meaning that valuation swings can have brutal tax consequences. So, under the proposed tax bill, any transaction under $600 would be completely exempt.Passage of this legislation would mean not having to worry about keeping track of gains on small transactions. Plus, the proposed law calls for the Treasury Department to provide guidelines for reporting on profits and losses tied to digital currencies. As the IRS and Coinbase continue to spar over user records, it is worth remembering that the IRS used a John Doe summons to get names of Swiss bank account holders from UBS.As a result, offshore banking changed forever, with all other Swiss banks eventually having to release records. In the IRS offshore bank cases, the IRS ended up collecting over $10 billion. Some people are saying that IRS efforts on digital currency might end up following the same kind of pattern.In that sense, for digital currency users and investors, change is coming. The IRS claims that only 802 people declared a capital gain or loss related to Bitcoin in 2015.This suggests that the bulk of Bitcoin transaction are not reported. In 2017, there may be more transactions and more awareness, and more fear. The estimated value of the cryptocurrency economy is something on the order of $162 billion. With millions of transactions and the meteoric rise of Bitcoin from under $100 to over $6,000 in just a few years, the IRS is gearing up. Another IRS enforcement effort involves software. The IRS contracted with a company called Chainalysis to identify owners of digital wallets. From there, matching up transactions and tax returns is not that hard.Taxpayers who have hidden income from Bitcoin and other digital currency sales could face taxes, and potentially big civil penalties. A few cases could even end up as criminal tax cases. So, at a minimum, you want to start keeping track and reporting going forward.  You might want to amend returns for the past too. Any attempted fix after the IRS contacts you is rarely as good as one you do yourself.  Of course, some digital currency users have already been reporting their digital currency transactions on their tax returns.But how do you know if you are doing it correctly?The record keeping and gain and loss determinations can be dizzying. If this bill passes, many transactions would be in the clear. That would be welcome news for the digital currency community. Until then, here are a few more tips.What is the fair market value of digital currency? If it is listed on an exchange and the exchange rate is established by market supply and demand, convert it into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate.If you receive virtual currency as payment, must you include its fair market value in income? Yes, report the fair market value in U.S. dollars on the date you receive it.What is the basis of virtual currency received as payment for goods or services? The fair market value in U.S. dollars on receipt.If you “mine” virtual currency, do you have income from mining? Yes, when you mine it, the fair market value is income.Is mining virtual currency a trade or business that subjects you to self-employment tax? You bet.

centralized structure. Without Blockchain technology, there was no “ ...","Nov 2, 2017","Although it may be hard to imagine, cryptocurrencies are far older than Blockchain technology. Most of us look at Bitcoin as the first cryptocurrency, although it is only the first Blockchain-based currency. Cryptocurrencies like B-Money and BitGold existed prior to Bitcoin, however, these didn’t really go far, especially when judged against Bitcoin.","The problem with cryptocurrencies conceived before Bitcoin was their centralized structure. Without Blockchain technology, there was no “decentralized, immutable, transparent” ledger in which transactions could be recorded, leading to a centralization. Yet it looks like Blockchain may not be the be-all, end-all of digital currency technologies.Recently, a new form of crypto has emerged that leverages the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) organizational model for the structure of its decentralized ledger, allowing old problems to be solved and new features to be added.Today, we’re going to take a look at the technology that can potentially replace the Blockchain itself and some of its current implementations.Although the implementations that we are going to discuss today are new, the concept is not. In a 2013 paper dubbed “Accelerating Bitcoin’s Transaction Processing. Fast Money Grows on Trees, Not Chains,” the authors Yonatan Sompolinsky and Aviv Zohar introduce the GHOST protocol which proposes a change to Bitcoin’s structure from a Blockchain into a tree, reducing confirmation times and improving security. Although this change has not been implemented in Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies are using the DAG-based system successfully. Let’s meet them!Byteball is a DAG-based cryptocurrency. The first of its kind, Byteball is distributed through an airdrop process in which GBYTE, the native currency in the network, is distributed according to the user’s Bitcoin holdings. Recently GBYTE distribution has also begun to take place through cashback partnerships with participating merchants. Although it’s refreshing to see an ICO-less cryptocurrency, its distribution method is one of the least interesting aspects of Byteball.In Byteball, there are no blocks. Instead, transactions are linked directly to each other and each transaction contains one or more hashes of previous transactions. The set of links between the transactions forms what is known as the DAG, as opposed to the “Blockchain” system used in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.There is no Proof of Work or Proof of Stake mining in Byteball. Instead of having subsequent blocks confirm previous ones, transactions are confirmed by new transactions that come after them.  But this kind of “confirmation” is only a confirmation that the transaction exists, not that it is not a double spend.  So, how are double spends resolved?  In PoW currencies, the conflicts caused by double spends are resolved by selecting the version of block history that has the most work committed to it.  In Byteball, since it is DAG-based, there is already partial order among transactions. This allows most double spends to be caught and rejected immediately.What if the double spends are on parallel branches of the DAG and their ordering is not evident? Then, Byteball uses “Main Chain” - a chain on the DAG that goes through transactions posted by known trusted users called witnesses.  Of the two conflicting transactions, the one that appears earlier on the Main Chain is deemed valid.  Witnesses are selected by the users themselves, who list their preferred witnesses with each transaction they post.Although there is still much to explain regarding Byteball and its DAG-based system, one thing becomes clear: This system is a viable alternative to Blockchain technology and can even solve some of the most prominent problems found in the technology, such as such as speed, sustainability, scalability, security, privacy and legal compliance.If the system becomes widely used, transactions become frequent, ensuring that they can be confirmed in mere seconds, as opposed to the 10 minute wait in Bitcoin. As for sustainability, the witness system employed by Byteball offers a security model in which no Proof of Work mining is required, meaning that electricity is not mindlessly wasted in order to secure it. Since Byteball does not have blocks, there is no block size issue.When compared with Ethereum, Byteball smart contracts are not as powerful and not Turing complete, but they are simple, allowing them to be displayed in user-readable form. This means that regular users can see what is actually going to happen to their money for themselves. Prediction markets are already working based on these contracts, and a recently introduced manual oracle feature allows anyone without technical knowledge to run a prediction market.As for privacy, other altcoins like Zcash and Dash have already come up with efficient ways of protecting user’s privacy. Nevertheless, it’s good to know that you can keep this privacy in a network that does not require long confirmation times or wasteful Proof of Work mining. Byteball allows value to be transferred privately through an asset called “blackbytes.”Lastly, legal compliance is addressed by Byteball through its asset issuing system. The whitepaper reads:“Users can issue new assets and define rules that govern their transferability. The rules can include spending restrictions such as a requirement for each transfer to be cosigned by the issuer of the asset, which is one way for financial institutions to comply with existing regulations.”IOTA is a unique cryptocurrency. Although it also uses Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) organizational model under the name “Tangle,” its implementation and applications differ wildly from Byteball. Designed specifically for the IoT (Internet of Things) industry, IOTA held a successful ICO in 2015, gathering 1,337 BTC and launched on Bitfinex earlier this year.Apart from its distribution method, IOTA has several differences when compared to Byteball. For example, in IOTA, all transactions created must validate a minimum of two previous transactions. In order to do so, users (who create and validate transactions) must solve a cryptographic puzzle similar to those found in Proof of Work cryptocurrencies.Furthermore, IOTA has no fees. Unlike Byteball, where GBYTE transaction fees are the same as the GB size of a transactions, IOTA charges no fees at all, regardless of the transaction size or amount. Instead, nodes are incentivized to participate in the creation and confirmation of transactions by other nodes who will drop nodes if they do not make transactions regularly.The lack of fees solves two critical problems in the eyes of the IOTA developers. The whitepaper reads:“The importance of micropayments will increase in the rapidly developing IoT industry, and paying a fee that is larger than the amount of value being transferred is not logical. Furthermore, it is not easy to get rid of fees in the Blockchain infrastructure since they serve as an incentive for the creators of blocks. This leads to another issue with existing cryptocurrency technology, namely the heterogeneous nature of the system. There are two distinct types of participants in the system, those who issue transactions, and those who approve transactions. The design of this system creates unavoidable discrimination of some participants, which in turn creates conflicts that make all elements spend resources on conflict resolution. The aforementioned issues justify a search for solutions essentially different from Blockchain technology, the basis for Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies.”The lack of fees would normally create vectors for spam attacks on the network. In order to avoid this issue, IOTA employs a “weight” mechanism in which transactions are confirmed according to their weight. This weight is proportional to the amount of work that the issuing node invested into it. IOTA’s weight system ensures that spam is not feasible as no entity can generate an abundance of transactions with “acceptable” weights in a short period of time.Despite the several differences between these two implementations of DAG-based cryptos, IOTA sets itself apart by its unique focus, the Internet of Things (IoT) industry. If you’re not familiar with the IoT, the concept involves a global network where devices like home appliances, cars and so on are able to communicate and exchange data, allowing them to be remotely monitored and even controlled.IOTA’s goal is to allow value and data to be exchanged and transferred freely between these elements, allowing any IoT-enabled device, appliance, or vehicle to be used or rented in an efficient and trustless way. The data provided by devices can also be bought and sold through the IOTA network.This concept allows the distributed economy movement to evolve in such a way that anyone will be able to make the most out of their belongings. In short, IOTA acts as a backbone for the exchange of value on the IoT paradigm in which devices produce value for their owner and not the other way around.Will DAG-based cryptocurrencies replace Blockchain? It’s hard to tell. While there are evident advantages when it comes to these DAG systems, these are still far from being a popular alternative, and very few projects are working on it. Nevertheless, the projects that do seem to have earned their place in the cryptosphere, especially IOTA, a top-15 cryptocurrency by market capitalization."

So today, to show my disapproval, I'm adding [NO2X] to my name.”Initially, SegWit2x was proposed by Barry Silbert-led Digital Currency Group as a follow up solution to the Hong Kong agreement; to increase the Bitcoin block size by 2MB and in return, activate the Bitcoin Core development team’s scaling and transaction malleability solution Segregated Witness (SegWit2x).But, the majority of the Bitcoin community opposed the activation of SegWit2x, due to the lack of support from Bitcoin Core developers and users. Acknowledging the decline in the probability of the Bitcoin community agreeing to the SegWit2x proposal, the companies behind the movement proposed a hard fork execution in November, to create a separate Bitcoin-based Blockchain network, like Bitcoin Cash.One major issue with SegWit2x is the timing of the proposal. It is rather odd that a centralized group of businesses are trying to alter the Bitcoin protocol without the agreement of Bitcoin Core developers, the open-source development community, the industry, and users. More to that, SegWit is still at its early stage in adoption and it already has demonstrated significant impact on the Bitcoin network in terms of scalability. Although only five percent of transactions are SegWit-enabled as of now, the average block size has decreased from 1MB to 0.86 and the size of the Bitcoin mempool has decreased from 150 mln bytes to less than 10 mln bytes.The substantial decline in the size of the Bitcoin mempool is especially important to consider, because the mempool is the holding area for unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions. For the past month, the size of the Bitcoin mempool has remained below 15 mln bytes, less than 10 percent of where it was a month ago.Not all Bitcoin Core developers and experts in the Bitcoin sector are opposed to Bitcoin block size increase. In 2015, Bitcoin pioneer and Blockstream CEO Adam Back expressed his support towards increasing the Bitcoin block size.But, it is vital to increase the Bitcoin block size when necessary. SegWit has already scaled the Bitcoin network at a similar rate, as a 2MB block size increase and still at five percent capacity. If it reaches 50 percent and 100 percent in the upcoming months, the Bitcoin Blockchain will scale even further.Therefore, it is crucial to let SegWit play out, have Bitcoin companies adopt the solution, and when it is absolutely necessary, pursue the idea of increasing the Bitcoin block size. It is not logical to implement a major update on the Bitcoin protocol when SegWit, which was integrated just last month, is still in progress in terms of adoption and integration by wallets and exchanges."

However, the cryptocurrency market capitalization is still minuscule in comparison to other traditional markets. Such electricity consumption may soon become unsustainable if the adoption rate of digital currencies continues to grow at its current pace.","Bitcoin mining difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks to remain at roughly 10 minutes per block. As more mining capacity is brought online, the difficulty increases accordingly. Thus difficulty increases proportionally to the increase in computing power of the network.The mining difficulty of both Ether and Bitcoin has increased exponentially since their respective genesis blocks. This trend will likely continue as adoption keeps increasing. Therefore, digital currency  miners will have to constantly acquire more powerful mining equipment. The times where everyone could mine Bitcoin with his/her personal computer are long over.The rising mining difficulty has forced miners to keep buying new and more powerful mining equipment. The problem is that these super-computers are also very expensive, creating a significant barrier to entry that only those with deep pockets can overcome. Mining benefits greatly from economies of scale, which further limits the ability of small-time miners to be competitive.Because of this, mining has become heavily centralized. AntPool claims to be the largest cryptocurrency cloud mining company in the world, controlling 17.82 percent of the hashpower of the Bitcoin network. Most mining companies are located in China due to the low cost of electricity and labor.As the hashrate of Blockchain networks keeps increasing, the amount of mining hardware will continue to grow. These mining computers consume vast amounts of energy, and this is with the entire cryptocurrency market being relatively miniscule in size.One can only imagine how much electricity will be used for mining if digital currency becomes mainstream. Unfortunately, the electricity that powers these machines usually comes from non-renewable sources of energy, which contributes to climate change.Austrian company HydroMiner is one of the few mining companies that are planning to make mining more sustainable and profitable by using renewable energies. Nadine Damblon, CEO at HydroMiner, pointed out in an interview for CoinNoob that there already are companies using solar energy for mining, but that hydroelectric power is probably the better solution since it’s more consistent and because the water can then be used to cool down the mining equipment.In a proof of stake (PoS) network, every validator owns a portion of the network. This is much different from Proof of Work (PoW) where every validator needs to own expensive mining equipment. PoS also encourages greater decentralization of the network, since all the currency holders are involved in securing the network in proportion to the amount of currency they own. Additionally, PoS is extremely energy efficient, since there is no need to make computationally difficult calculations. It also enables much faster validations.Proof of stake does have a couple of drawbacks, with the most serious being the “nothing at stake” problem. Imagine that a network which uses PoS is under attack by a hostile actor who is trying to supplant the valid Blockchain with one of his own. It makes economic sense to “mine” on both Blockchains, since it costs you nothing to do so.In fact, that’s the smart thing to do, just in case the attacker succeeds. With Proof of Work, a miner must instead decide to mine on one chain or the other, since mining equipment can only be used on one network at a time, and burns expensive electricity doing it.Blocks on the Bitcoin Blockchain will always be verified through PoW. However, Ethereum is moving towards PoS with its new “Casper” protocol. If successful, this will enable Ether holders to stake their coins in a smart-contract in exchange for transaction fees. Many are eyeing Ethereum to see if they can in fact solve the heretofore intractable problems with Proof of Stake."

You get close to a zero percent interest rate on your deposits and you have to pay fees to do pretty much everything, all the while mortgage rates are at three to four percent in the US. Not only that, but credit card companies charge you a 20 percent interest rate if you don’t pay the full balance at the end of the month, and most people think it’s totally normal because it’s all they ever knew. This is about to change.The amazing thing about cryptocurrencies is that even though you still need to go through a centralized exchange - for now - to buy cryptocurrencies, you do not have to leave them there once you’ve bought them; you can withdraw them to your own wallet. Exchanges have always been the weakest link of the whole cryptocurrency ecosystem; they are notorious for being prone to hacks. The biggest was the Mt Gox hack in 2013 - 2014, when more than 750,000 of its customers' Bitcoins were stolen ($470 mln at the time, more than $5 bln at today's price).  Since then, more hacks happened although none quite as dramatic as the Mt. Gox one. These hacks are responsible for one of the greatest misunderstandings between Bitcoin - and cryptocurrencies in general - and the public: cryptocurrencies are not safe. So let's set the record straight: the Bitcoin Blockchain itself has never been hacked and no existing technology can do it for the foreseeable future (the main threat in the distant future is quantum computing). The issue for many people is that the mechanics of the banking system are so ingrained in their brain they don’t understand that with cryptocurrencies you do not need a third party to hold your funds, you can do it yourself.When you leave your coins on an exchange, you do not actually own them, you have an ""I owe you"" from the exchange for the number of coins you have there. The exchange owns them on your behalf. This means that once again you are back to the old system where you have to trust a third party with your money.The safest way to store your coins is actually to store them in your own wallet. It can take the form of a paper wallet you can generate here, where you will have your public key (to receive coins) and a private key (to send coins). There are also hardware wallets such as those made by Trezor or Ledger. When you send your coins to one of these types of wallets, you store them in ""cold storage,"" meaning that you store them offline.  You do not actually store any coin there - they are still on the Blockchain - but you store your private keys. The hardware wallet option is more secure as you never have to reveal your private keys; they are encrypted on the device and they are only used to sign transactions when required - when you want to send your coins. My personal preference goes to Ledger, not only because it is a French company (I’m biased here), but also because they have demonstrated an outstanding level of customer support. When the Bitcoin Cash hard fork happened on Aug. 1, they were among the very first to make the this new altcoin available to users.The beauty of controlling your own private keys is that while exchanges can be hacked or shut down by governments and your assets and bank accounts seized or frozen, nobody can touch your coins. There is just no way this can happen if you take the right precautions. I already hear some of you whispering “money laundering” or “bypass capital controls.” While this is possible with certain cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin is ill-suited for that as all transactions are traceable), they offer a level of protection of your wealth that was unimaginable until Blockchain technology was invented. Go ask the people waiting in line in Zimbabwe to get their deposits out of the banks what they would think about not having to rely on a bank to hold their wealth...Did you know that more than 2.5 billion people do not have a bank account? This is either because they are too poor to qualify, or because they do not have access to a local branch, or simply because they believe that they have no use for it. When you do not have the ability to save money, you are most likely forever trapped in poverty. Even if you manage to save a few bank notes every month, inflation destroys most of the value over time, especially if you live in a country that does not have a particularly strong currency. Look at the performance of fiat currencies in Africa and in South America over the past decades - it’s appalling.Now for the first time in history there is a way to store wealth without relying on any third party, to be shielded from corrupt or incompetent governments, catastrophic monetary policies, and that you can send in seconds across the globe. If you stop looking at cryptocurrencies through the lense of developed countries you quickly realize that even though cryptocurrencies may be very attractive in developed countries, it is nothing close to the potential for disruption in the developing world.While much of the talk is likely going to focus on Wall Street and investors in rich countries for the foreseeable future, make no mistake - people in developing countries will leapfrog to cryptocurrencies just like they leapfrogged to cell phones without going through the landline phase. This is yet another reason to be optimistic about cryptocurrencies.Vincent Launay is a finance specialist at the World Bank in Washington DC.

The digital currency is backed by the Blockchain technology, which has established itself as the driver and backbone in many fields.","Both Bitcoin and Blockchain technology have been around since 2009 when Bitcoin emerged on the world stage and have steadily impacted the financial services industry and how it delivers products and services. Recently The Hindu Business Line, an Indian newspaper, quoted Nicolas Cary, President of Blockchain, one of the world’s largest Bitcoin Software Company as saying:“Over the past 12 months, we’ve seen unprecedented activity and growth in India. We think India could be the most significant market in the world for digital financial services. Within the next five years, it can potentially be bigger than that of the US.”However, what will it take for India a country with 22 major languages, a billion plus people a geographic span of 3.2 mln kilometers to get onboard the Blockchain revolution?India needs specific solutions and BitIndia, a company that is promising to deliver a Blockchain wallet and decentralized crypto exchange “for the streets of India,” is emerging as an India centric platform that can act as a driver for the growth of both cryptocurrencies and Blockchain in the subcontinental country.The Indian market is so diverse and segmented that products and services that do not take an Indian hue and color often fail to impress the local populace. It is also important to understand that the rural population of the country is as high as 68 percent and constitutes a significant economic backbone of the country.Back in the 1990s when India was undergoing what the local media dubs as ‘liberalization’ of the economy, newly-launched MTV played English music and had only English speaking VJs. Fast forward to today -- MTV in India has completely taken a ‘regional’ hue. Businesstoday described the TV channel as neither ‘fish nor fowl.’Localization and understanding of the market is the key to success for any business in the country and BitIndia is well aware of that. In a whitepaper, they underscore their approach towards the Indian market:“BitIndia wants to create a user-friendly, secure, decentralized atmosphere for India so that people can carry everyday transactions through BitIndia wallet. BitIndia further envisions to reach out to every person in India, starting from urban areas to educate at least 20 percent of the population about Blockchain and cryptocurrency.”BitIndia is emerging as a total financial platform that provides users with a mobile wallet for their Apple and Android devices as well as their web browsers and allows them to store cryptocurrencies securely. They are also working on building an ‘instant exchange,’ which will allow people to transact between digital currencies and the local currencies -- this even as the user will have complete control over their private keys.An Alpha version of the product will be available for download by the end of 2017. The currencies that will be traded on the platform include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin. BitIndia wants to offer comprehensive services for users, who can buy, sell and save in digital currencies, allow merchants to accept payments with very reasonable and low transaction fees and help traders find opportunities to profit from cryptocurrencies.If BitIndia can reach 20 percent of the Indian population as is their stated aim they would be in a position to challenge established players like Paytm, who have already found a niche in the sprawling Indian market. Keep in mind only 0.5 percent of Indian population currently transacts in digital currencies according to BitIndia.Cointelegraph covered recently how BitIndia is supported by John McAfee, the founder of the famous McAfee Antivirus. McAfee’s confidence is not misplaced as BitIndia has built a strong team to deliver their platform to the Indian public. John McAfee acts as a partner and advisor in BitIndia.Sahil Kohli, the CEO of BitIndia knows cryptocurrencies and has a strong background in crypto trading. Kohli is also the co-founder of Applancer.co. Saumil Kohli, Founder of BitIndia, has co-founded two tech companies and also has a crypto trading background. The technology lead is Kunal Nandwani, the founder and CEO of uTrade Solutions, a company operating in the financial trading domain. BitIndia have found support in a strong advisory team which includes Reuben Godfrey, co-founder of the Blockchain Association of Ireland, Victor Wong, CEO of Sparkle Coin and others.BitIndia have recently concluded a token distribution and launched their ERC 20 compatible BitIndia token. They are planning to launch token trading by December 2017. Their roadmap indicates that they would like to create a future in which 25 percent of the global Blockchain trading will occur in India. Not an unlikely scenario if India is to surpass the US as the biggest digital financial services market in the world. The potential is there, the conditions are ripe, and we will all just have to wait and see if BitIndia can snag the opportunity and become the Paytm of digital money in India.Disclaimer.

With his 30-years’ experience in the investment business and knowledge about the culture of business across the Eurasian continents, he is fascinating company for a conversation.Nick commented on dynamics of crypto communities, narrated his own love story with the fintech market and applied the theory of the paradox of choice to Bitcoin.Cointelegraph: How do you find the venue here today in Singapore?Nick Cowan: It’s great! We have obviously been to a number of conferences so far, but this is fantastically well organized. It’s great and really good people, there’s a lot of familiar faces as well. There was a lot of interest when we were trying to get involved -- a lot of people we know were saying -- you gonna be at Blockshow? We are really pleased to be here, fantastic event!CT: I imagine that you travel a lot, how would you describe the differences between crypto communities on different continents?NC: It’s really interesting because you go from continent to continent and there is a mixture of regulated and unregulated, but also there is a real interest in terms of acceptance in terms of what’s happening.So, there are two dynamics that I see. The distributed ledger technology usage, so operators looking at the Blockchain, and how they can use that to transform their business, and then the cryptocurrencies themselves and what’s going on in that space with regards to traders, etc.I went to an Asian country this week and spoke to about 500 people, the average age I would say was 60; they were cryptocurrency traders.NC: Then you go to another jurisdiction, and it’s much more focused on crypto fund managers and more institutional. So, I have been surprised. A lot of it is driven by regulation, in terms of the acceptance of the technology and cryptocurrencies in general, but also the knowledge base from country to country has been incredible. But wherever we go, there is a consistent theme, and that is more people are getting more and more interested, more and more people are starting to look at this as possibly going mainstream. You are seeing more and more companies, fintechs that are looking to start their business or grow their business tapping into token sale space as a way of raising money. We have seen this is a consistent theme, and I had a graph in my presentation basically like that. You can see that business is absolutely on fire!We are off to San Francisco Saturday, then New York, then Ljubljana, Berlin and Zurich. So traveling more than ever!CT: What inspired you in the first place to enter the crypto world? Maybe it was your background, or some event or some people?NC: Well I run a stock exchange and we are a small jurisdiction in Gibraltar. We have the ability to be pretty innovative and flexible. We first got involved about two years ago, when we tied up with a partner who was interested in launching ‘the first Bitcoin asset-backed security approved by, regulated in the EU.’ It was the first product that basically got up and down with Bitcoin price. At that time Bitcoin price was about $300 when we first started that conversation, that’s how far it has moved!So in order to structure that, we have to dive in and really find out how does this work? How do you open a wallet? How do you buy Bitcoin? What is a hot wallet? What is cold storage? And how do we then structure something that basically is secure and will protect investors? And that’s really when we got involved!NC: At the same time, our government in Gibraltar in January of 2016 asked the community, globally as well as in Gibraltar: Should we look at regulating operators on the Blockchain in financial services? They asked the question! That then brought Gibraltar and us as the exchange really together with a similar objective. Those regulations start in January. So our interest, especially as we saw the ICO token sale space explode in 2017, that’s when our interest really started to get deeper and deeper. Because we thought we can take all the stuff we know about exchanges (what needs to happen in terms of governance, investor protection, disclosure and transparency), if we can take some of those rules and apply that to the token sale space and then apply for a license in January from our regulator. So we have had to throw an incredibly steep learning curve from about two years ago about how this whole space works.CT: Do you consider tokens assets?NC: No, I don’t technically think they are assets. I think one of the things we have to do is in our rules we have to make it really clear that as a token you have to have a legal opinion that they are a utility because it can’t be viewed as capital. In fact what you are doing is you are actually taking in money against future services, that’s effectively what a utility token is. Unlike a security token, which we will hopefully be putting next year on our main exchange, where obviously you are participating in the performance of the company itself, be it P&L, equity, dividends, etc.I think utility tokens need to be categorized very carefully as utility tokens, legally signed off as utility tokens in order that no securities or legislations are being breached globally. That’s also, by the way, a pretty grey area at the moment. Different jurisdictions are taking a very different approach to this space in terms of: is it a security, is it an asset, is it a liability, is it an equity? I think that’s going to be a pretty fluid situation for the next couple of years.CT: How do you follow the market, which resources do you use?NC: We have got a number of resources. The main thing what we found is since we launched our own token, and we figured if we go into the token sale space we should do our own find out to find everything about it, is the importance of social media. That’s been unbelievably important. We had to really get ahead of the curve in terms of Telegram, Twitter, and social media generally. Obviously, we look at you guys too; we use actually a lot of your stuff in terms of our presentations. Really making sure that we are tapped in because with traditional financial markets there is an existing space out there with traditional news channels, as you know, where you can get basically get R&S feeds. In our space, there is basically none of that! You have to go into a completely new method of media, understand what’s going on and stay current. In many ways that’s why we are launching our own token sale platform, we want to create a marketplace where ICO issuers and investors or token contributors can come to in as a center of reference.CT: Could you name a book that inspired you the most recently?NC: Actually it’s a great book, it might sound pretty boring but it’s a book called The Paradox of Choice, it is by a guy called Barry Schwartz. It’s a book that’s generally read by traders, but it’s not about trading, it’s about psychology. It’s really appropriate for the cryptocurrency space as this space will grow.NC: So, for example, if you are like me: I tend to go into a shop and buy a pair of jeans and walk out as quickly as possible. My daughter will go into 10 shops and try 10 different pairs on because she can’t decide and she will end up probably going back to the first shop to get the pair she tried on first because she had to eliminate all those other choices. I think the paradox of choice is the more choices you have in life, actually in some ways, the less satisfied you are. Which might sound really counter indicative but if you walk into Gap, (I’m using the jeans analogy) and there are 100 different jeans on the wall in front of you I just have to walk out because I just want a pair of jeans. So in terms of cryptocurrencies and that space, what I learned after 35 years as a trader, is you are better at trading a couple of things incredibly well and just shut everything out because you have analysis paralysis otherwise unless you are a certain type of personality. That is an amazing book that I would advise anybody to read. It has to do with that choice is not always a good thing unless you are a certain type of person that can handle choice.CT: That is interesting -- I read about a psychological experiment where there were two groups of people - where everybody could choose a picture from an album to take home. In the first group they couldn’t change their decision afterwards, while the second group had a day to think about it and if wanted choose another picture. So it was the second group that was completely not satisfied with their choice.NC: It has to do with satisfaction. If you are a perfectionist, it’s sometimes very hard to actually be satisfied. Look, I have one of my friends, like me, who has been aiming to be a great trader for years, so he scans 1,000 different securities every day and he never does any trades. I just look at two, two or three, that’s what you need to do because otherwise you end up…CT: So how do you limit yourself?NC: Because you don’t need to worry about…There’s a story I sometimes tell about a guy I met at a bank where I used to work. In the 40’s he went to war and he said to his broker ‘buy this new company called International Business Machines, I think it could be interesting. Just keep on buying it while I am away and if I lose all my money it’s fine because I will probably die anyway.’ Then he came back and IBM stopped. He had made 10,000 times his money. Then in 1959 he saw an airplane land in Frankfurt airport, a Boeing jet (first jet) and he thought that was the future, he has only ever traded IBM and Boeing. He said -- look there are amazing companies out there, but he said I don’t need to do anything else because I understand these two things and it’s better for me to do those two things better than anybody else than it is to do 5,000 things averagely. That’s what the book is all about. In terms of inspirational book, it’s a very good read because it actually addresses some of those psychological satisfaction and challenges and conflicts that so many individuals have. A lot of what’s happening here is about psychology right? It’s about choice. That’s my inspirational book and I am not getting any royalties for that.Another interview with Nick Cowan done by our colleagues at Blockshow Asia 2017:"

The decentralized virtual currency removed the need for an administrator or bank - through encrypted peer-to-peer transactions recorded on the public ledger known as the Blockchain.What was small then has completely changed in the space of 10 years. The past fortnight has witnessed the biggest bull run in Bitcoin history, with the price of the virtual currency hitting the $11,000 mark earlier this week.The increasing value of Bitcoin has not gone unnoticed by mainstream financial institutions. Opinions are widely divided, but the fact that Bitcoin futures are being considered by the likes of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the NASDAQ proves that big things are to come in the next few years.While financial institutions plan to enter the market, the man on the street still view cryptocurrencies as revolutionary technology. By investing and using Bitcoin, Ethereum and other virtual currencies, people are taking power away from banks by using anonymous transactional systems.However, as the herd comes running, the potential rise in the value of each respective digital currency will no doubt be welcomed.Speaking to Lee Camp on Redacted Tonight on RT, director of the Public Banking Institute Walter Mcree believes cryptocurrencies offer another avenue for people to invest and store their money, as an alternative to private banking institutions:“Categorically it’s very exciting because it suggests that there are options to the private capital control we’ve all been under. Bitcoin and the other Blockchain technologies that are emerging are like the complimentary or alt currencies in the past.”“They certainly represent a way for communities to have their own isolated economic strength.”Mcree also believes that mainstream interest in cryptocurrencies shows that there will be an adoption by big institutions in the future. However, he questioned the possibility of the likes of Bitcoin challenging the dollar in the years to come:“It’s exciting prospect, we’ll see how far they’ll get in terms integration into the money markets. I know big banks are certainly looking to have their version of it. I don't think it will be replacing the US Dollar at least right now. I think the Yuan and others things might along the way.”“By and large Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are emerging we are going to see all kinds of variations of it coming up.”"

back in 2011, which at one point was the third largest exchange in the ...","Sep 27, 2017","There has been a lot of activity in the cryptosphere regarding hotels and accomodation, with progress towards the creation of a new landscape of bookings and payments. Some commentators have suggested that hospitality could become crypto’s killer app. The $500 bln hospitality industry is an enticing prize for the many crypto projects looking to disrupt this space.","Among them a European Blockchain project endorsed by the former President of Bulgaria. It has an enticing customer value proposition for travelers and hoteliers ahead of its token pre-sale this week. Lockchain.co is aiming to decentralize the hospitality industry, completely cutting out the middleman by enabling customers and property owners to rely on the inherent benefits of Blockchain technology.Considering that the global hotel industry was worth $494 bln last year, this will for sure grab the attention of crypto investors given the sheer size of the market and the number of transactions involved. On top of that, the nature of renting accommodation is tailor-made for a Blockchain solution, and as a result, several promising Blockchain projects are capitalizing on this.The Lockchain team, headed by founders Nikola Alexandrov and Hristo Tenchev, reckon they have the innovative solution needed to really disrupt the hospitality space.There is a good reason why holidays cost big bucks; from credit card fees to booking commissions to currency exchange charges, the whole set of transactions can incur significant costs. These hassles have always affected traveling and were worse until very recently; the likes of Airbnb, Booking.com and Expedia have made billions of dollars from eliminating inefficiencies and making information more accessible for travelers.But Blockchain technology can take this a step further. Lockchain is one of the teams that want to make this a reality. Currently, customers and hoteliers can expect that anything up to 25 percent of the value of a transaction to go to middleman processors like search providers, booking platforms and financial service companies.This is a huge cost for the supplier and the customer - the annual money going to middlemen (anything up to $125 bln annually) is almost as much as the entire market of all cryptocurrencies combined (approx. $150 bln).Until now, this has been a necessary feature of the hotel industry. Centralized actors like banks and booking platforms provide security in a financial system where transactions are hard to securely verify in a timely manner, while information is scattered.But these challenges are exactly what Blockchain technology is designed to solve. So the current marketplace (that requires credit cards to verify payments, booking platforms to verify and present reviews, and a central currency for transactions) has problems that shouldn't exist in a Blockchain-powered world.The reality is that the existing hotel marketplace has never had access to the component of crypto and Blockchain technology like double-spend-proof transactions, smart contracts, information immutability and low transaction fees.Lockchain looks set to leverage these features of cryptocurrency in their solution. The way that the Lockchain team plans to deploy the possibilities of Blockchain technology is through a ledger that lists all available accommodation, as well as pricing and transactions, accessed from a marketplace which property owners list their rooms on and customers can browse.Their decentralized LOC ledger is the bookings engine and database which will hold all information about hotel listings, their availability and booking requirements. This ledger will operate solely with the LOC token.This ledger will be open-source and built on the Ethereum VM and will be free for the public to access and use. With all the listings transparently available through the ledger, users, property owners and developers will be able to develop a range of applications on the Lockchain ledger to help customers find the ideal room easily.Aside from the ledger, the Lockchain marketplace is built to provide the first functionality for the new ecosystem. The team has planned some interesting value-added features for the main marketplace, which should entice users.This includes instant currency conversion in order to make sure that users are not dissuaded by booking exclusively in a new cryptocurrency. Also, to insulate the ecosystem against price fluctuations, a hedging model as (used in the financial industry) will use Buy and Sell calls to balance the transaction (which is then liquidated when the hotel withdraws its money).And of course, the big draw of the marketplace will be the zero percent commission required to carry out the transaction. Lockchain will operate a freemium model, which means that the majority of users will be around 25 percent better off compared to the existing market channels.This is the core of the ecosystem, and it is ready to launch soon. As founder Nikola Alexandrov explained:""Our goal is to launch a decentralized engine in combination with a user-friendly marketplace which will be fully integrated to the engine as an immediate proof of concept. As of this moment, we have reached a preliminary agreement with travel industry hosts, that supply more than 7,000 properties worldwide.”To that statement Hristo Tenchev adds the next ambitious goal:“We aim to give users the opportunity to immediately use their tokens to book properties even during the pre-sale and the main event.""This should sit well with investors since a criticism of many ICOs is their lengthy wait times before any product actually launches. Also of note is the relatively straightforward problem they're solving: unlike other Blockchain projects there is less of a leap of faith involved since the online marketplace for hotels does not need to be created, it just needs to be moved to a new ecosystem.As mentioned, one of the more interesting aspects of the project is that it has the participation of the former President of Bulgaria, Rosen Plevneliev. Both he and the founders have a strong technical competence, being trained software engineers. The founders have experience and projects under their belts in the crypto world specifically, having founded one of the first Bitcoin exchanges, Bitcoin7.com, way back in 2011, which at one point was the third largest exchange in the world per trade volume.It is a pretty developed team outside these members, with over 150 contributors (including a Member of the European Parliament) and is fortuitously based in an EU capital (Sofia) that has developed as a tech hub in recent years. The team hopes that being based in an EU country (unlike many ICOs which have opted for offshore locations) will bolster investor trust.The team has stated their goal is to create a sustainable and realistic ICO, and 25 percent of the tokens will be allocated to the team as a whole, of which a quarter (6.25 percent) will go to the founders. Another 25 percent will be set aside for future development, meaning that investors have the opportunity to buy 50 percent of the token during the ICO. It will use Ethereum as the payment method, and the token presale starts on Sept. 29.Whoever gets user traction with a Blockchain-based solution stands to gain an immense initial market share considering the publicity that crypto is getting in the press now. Other industries like finance have already adopted Blockchain wholesale, but a winner-takes-all-effect is likely to be most present in other industries.

Whoever this winner is, they stand to make a lot of money.- Eoghan Gannon, Guest AuthorDisclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

This type of wallets usually allows to set daily withdrawal limits, vote for withdrawals, vote for ownership changes, etc.","With the big surge in crypto prices this year, many people are now holding significant amounts of crypto assets. It is worth taking security more seriously and putting your assets, or at least most of them, into a multisig wallet is a good step toward that. That enhances security for a process that moves lots of funds quite quickly. If you own a multisig wallet, you need multiple “signatures” to move funds out of the wallet. In fact, these signatures mean multiple private keys.This alternative to holding value in simple user accounts appeared in 2012. Multisig wallets are especially favored by cryptocurrency startups and other groups, as they are a safeguard against hacker attacks aimed at the asset holders. This is because they allow some of the owners' accounts to be compromised while retaining full control of the money. Of course, it also helps against sneaky employees who might want to run off with the money. For this reason, multisig wallets are also a popular way of storing cryptocurrency raised in ICO.Several years ago Gavin Wood, Ethereum cofounder and CTO established EthCore, a non-profit organization that develops software for Ethereum infrastructure, which later changed its name to Parity Technologies. One of its products is Parity, an Ethereum client that provides a web interface for the underlying Ethereum node software. It allows the user to access the basic Ether and token wallet functions, and also to interact with smart-contracts deployed on the Ethereum Blockchain. The Parity wallet is designed to integrate seamlessly with all standard tokens as well as manage Ether transfers. It is compatible with Ubuntu, OSX, Docker, and Windows. The vast array of options offered by Parity wallet made it extremely popular in the crypto community.Multisigs are distributed to users as smart-contract source code: whenever someone wants to get one, they take the current code from the repository, deploy the contract onto the Ethereum Blockchain, then set the owners, place the funds, etc. Each wallet is a separate instance of the code.In the case of Parity, some of the essential elements of contract logic, including the withdraw function that allows to take funds out, was placed in a library. A library is an already deployed smart-contract that is used by every Parity Multisig in existence (starting from a particular version). Such code separation can theoretically be a good thing: for instance, shaving off gas costs for users that have to deploy less code. Unfortunately, it also means that, should the library be broken in some way, it will affect every contract depending on it. And no contingencies were included.On November 6–8, it was discovered that it was possible to initialize the library itself as a wallet, claiming owner rights for it, including the right to kill it altogether. All the deployed dependent contracts would then become useless. After killing the library, the attacker probed several deployed multisigs in order to try and change the owner list and withdraw the funds, retracing the steps of the July exploit. Between that and the GitHub issue claiming incompetence, the question of the attacker’s motives remains unclear.According to crypto eli5, 151 wallets have been frozen, with their balances being 513,743 ETH or $152 million in total. Parity Technologies announce that 573 wallets have been affected and their total balance is unknown.Disbelief was the first and most common feeling experienced by members of the crypto community. Oh, they wished to unsee this amount of around $154 mln locked due to the allegedly random actions of some newbie! It has not only crushed Parity’s steady recovery after the notorious hack in July, but also made some users consider the limit of security fails and whether Parity has reached it.The first reaction to the funds being frozen was sheer panic – only six months past the July hack the repetition seemed impossible, although the most reasonable community members at least began to consider cryptocurrency safety as priority. As soon as Parity provided official explanations, the panic gave place to distrust, as affected users found themselves at a loss.UPDATE: A user exploited an issue and thus removed the library code, as it seems unaware of the consequences.Parity recently claimed that they treat safety and security issues seriously – so, how could such thing happen? One of the major concerns is that the bug had existed for some time before the crash. It affected the wallets created past 20 July 2017, i.e. after a hotfix driven by the hack.This froze funds in all Parity multi-sig wallets deployed after 20 July. We are analysing the situation and release further details shortly.A vulnerability in the then-current version of the Parity Multisig wallet was exploited, leading to $30 mln being stolen and another $180 mln rescued by a white hat hacker group, then subsequently returned to the rightful owners. Following the attack, Parity Tech deployed a new version of the wallet that, as it turns out, introduced another vulnerability. This led some users to complain on Parity’s insouciance regarding their funds and botched debugging process prior to the update release. The fact that the exploit was probably initiated by a clumsy newbie (as he himself has claimed), doesn’t give credit to the company either.Parity answers in the most careful way, avoiding any certainty. Who can blame them for trying to calm the tumult? However, a user seeing phrases like “to the best of our knowledge” believes that developers don’t control the situation at all.Update: To the best of our knowledge the funds are frozen & can't be moved anywhere. The total ETH circulating social media is speculative.As a result, we see a whipped-up buoyancy among Parity and Ethereum opponents, for example, from Charlie Lee, Litecoin creator.I was adamantly against the DAO hardfork for this moral hazard reason. Ethereum is no longer unstoppable code as advertised on their website. How much in $/% is enough to do a HF? And who gets to decide? No longer uncensorable payments. https://t.co/i3RyIPqo32The attackers split into two almost equal parts: those who blame the developers of the smart-contract and those who believe the whole company to be guilty. Not to mention some voices claiming that the Ethereum architecture (such as immutable smart-contracts) is to blame. They are usually met with the counter-claim that it's rather the coding practices and the maturity of development cycle are at fault.About $154 mln remains stuck in the wallets that were affected. Since smart-contracts in Ethereum are immutable, and no relief measures were included in the code, the only way to reclaim the funds seems to be a hard fork of Ethereum network. Otherwise, the Ether is going to remain in the affected contracts forever. This caused more discord in the Ethereum community. Unofficial twitter polls show approximately 50/50 division of supporters and opponents to the initiative, as the previous fork eventually broke Ethereum into two warring networks.There are several technical possibilities of how such a hard fork can work, including implementing EIP 156 or putting a fixed version of the library back in place. However, this is a controversial issue, bringing back everything that had been discussed in regards to the DAO Hack and subsequent bailout.Major players don’t rush in with “take it or leave it” propositions, waiting for more details from Parity. As the funds were actually frozen, not stolen, the developer is not pressed by time limits – though some will consider growing discontent of users to be the harder trial.However, most companies affected by the exploit have already published statements to comfort clients and assure that, one way or another, the issue will be solved.The multisig used by the Web3 Foundation to accept contributions for Polkadot, also established by Gavin Wood, was the biggest of those affected, putting the ETH in it beyond access. Luckily, the affected multisig wallet didn’t contain all the funds. Hence, the company claims that their original roadmap has not been affected. They are still in the process of evaluating loss and looking for possible solutions, but seem quite serene and confident about the future.The Iconomi platform and its storage system also claim to be secure. $35 m were stored using the affected Parity Multisig contract and will remain locked until the situation is resolved. But all users’ digital assets stored on the platform are completely safe, and the functioning of the platform is unaffected. The developers of the platform stay positive. They state that the Ethereum ecosystem has already proven itself able to rapidly respond and adapt to unexpected challenges.The Cappasity platform also assures the users that the platform and the content stored there are secure, and the functionality of the platform is unaffected. Although the funds raised so far during their crowdsale have been stored in an affected Parity multisig wallet, the company retains confidence. The crowdsale has been resumed in regular mode, having switched promptly to another multisig wallet after the attack. It looks like Cappasity was fully ready for the challenge: the existing partners of the company could compensate for the locked funds, if necessary. The team has also conducted their own research on the attack, arriving at a conclusion that there is a great probability of this being a deliberate hack (the evidence is provided at the end of the company’s first official statement).In general, we see that leading players were acting wisely, as they didn’t put all their eggs in one basket. This seems to be the best possible strategy, as Blockchain is still a nascent industry, and it has to pass through several ups and downs to elaborate the best and safest strategies.The article was written by Alex Bokhenek (@CollisAventinus), a Blockchain expert at ModernToken."

to tailor their own plans for inheritance. 18334 Total views.","Oct 28, 2017","Most seek out estate planning advice after major life events like marriage, childbirth and loss of a loved one...or increasing Bitcoin prices. According to Pamela Morgan, CEO of ThirdKey Solutions LLC, the number of clients seeking estate planning services has soared, following Bitcoin’s ever-rising price.","But digital currencies don’t have to comprise most of your net worth in order to benefit from estate planning. Since an originally small holding can be worth much more when the prices rise, “Every digital currency holder should care about this,” said Morgan in an interview.A dead man’s switch, in which cryptocurrencies are automatically transferred to the heir’s account upon death, has long been a popular solution for estate issues involving digital currency. However, Morgan says that in real life, this strategy doesn’t work as well as one might imagine.According to Morgan:“(Automated transfer) requires all the heirs to be able to manage their private key. You can’t generate their private keys and give that to them. It’s not good security practice.  But more importantly, they will need to hold those keys, for an indefinite period of time.”Morgan points out that cryptocurrency neophytes often lose keys. Not only that, but every time a person bought, sold, or moved their assets, they would have to continually update their heir’s keys.Morgan says:“And you’re talking about ‘Oh hi grandma, here are three new keys’, it just doesn’t work in the real world.”If everyone involved in the transfer is well-versed in cryptocurrency, the above wouldn’t be a problem, Morgan said, but most people who will be inheriting assets are not capable of managing them.Practicality aside, since activating a dead man’s switch requires the owner not to access the network for a certain period, it creates incentives for people to prevent the owner from accessing the network, Morgan wrote in her blog.Human factors notwithstanding, the smart contract technology that enables automatic transfer of funds today needs to be tested more thoroughly to be trusted the funds of estate planners, said Morgan.“A lot of people are looking at the Ethereum platform, probably it’s because it’s the oldest platform, at the ripe old age of three. It’s a child. We haven’t tested the tech at scale hard enough and long enough for me to trust my clients’ money, or for me to say ‘you know what, I’m going to put my money into this smart contract.”The Ethereum Blockchain was split into two following the hacking of “The DAO,” a decentralized company built upon the original Ethereum Blockchain.Morgan said a reliable technology should not only be one of many Blockchains, but a widely accepted protocol.“The reality is that, it usually takes at least a couple of years, before we see the protocol upgrade, before it’s available at consumer level. As an industry, we have been very impatient.”Bitcoin, the oldest Blockchain-based cryptocurrency, was created in 2009. It has only begun to be hailed as “going mainstream” by mass media in 2017.What about the old fashioned way, in which clients put their assets in the trust of a lawyer? Morgan’s advice is clear and simple: Whatever you do, don’t give away your private keys.Cryptocurrencies depart from traditional assets in the fact that lost funds cannot be retrieved. When a third party has access to the private keys, that individual can spend the currency. Since cryptocurrency transactions are non-reversible, funds, unlike funds in a bank, are impossible to recover.Giving private keys to a lawyer means that the private keys could end up in a legal document in a law firm’s database that’s easily accessed by other lawyers or could get hacked, Morgan warned.And writing private keys into the will can result in loss of funds when the will becomes public record, as happens in many jurisdictions, Morgan said.Morgan added:“A lot of people put off (cryptocurrency estate planning) because they think they would have to hire a lawyer. They think they have to trust a third party. And that’s false.”The key to cryptocurrency inheritance is to ensure two things, Morgan said, make sure that your heir knows what you have by giving them an updated inventory of your digital assets, and make sure that your heir knows how to access it.The process, detailed in Morgan’s blog, involves conducting a security self-check, and teaching your loved one ways to access your digital property.Morgan has also written a  Letter to Loved Ones to assist the process."

A quick buck is always on the cards but so is a total bust.","Many think that Bitcoin is volatile, yet it has nothing on some of the moves, both up and down of some of the altcoins out there. To this end, there is money to be made but it is a different ball game and a different tact is required.There are a few strategies that can be employed when it comes to altcoin investing that are very different to Bitcoin investing, but these can also help you see massive paydays.To really get an understanding of the difference in investing in Bitcoin and altcoins, it is useful to see a graph of the performances.From the graph below, it is quite clear to see firstly why Bitcoin is still the king of easy and seemingly guaranteed returns. And secondly, it also shows just how erratic and chaotic the altcoin market is.Image Credit: WoodbullThe orange line represents Bitcoin while the mass of blue and green is the altcoin market which is clearly a difficult mess to master. However, a few choice strategies can be helpful.Invest in an altcoin while it is still in its ICO phase. This will guarantee the cheapest possible coin. While ICOs are literally a dime a dozen, if you are venturing into the murky world of altcoin investing the ICO phase is the best start.Coins literally only have one way to go, and that is up, after the ICO but they can also tumble very quickly and fall to zero. As the coin hits the market though, it can spike and that is your cue to sell. In this way, you can easily profit between 100 and 300 percent.If there is no immediate spike, aim to get between 50 and 100 percent return before selling.This strategy works well if you hedge your bets and buy into a few ICOs, don't put all your money into one basket/ICO.You can also hold out for a coin to hit the market and avoid the ICOmania. Look for a coin that hits its first dip on the market and take aim at buying; this can even lead to a cheaper buy than the ICO sale price.The reason a lot of these coins dip when they hit exchanges is because presale buyers and those that received free coins for helping market the ICO are dumping coins on the market.Do be aware though because this dumping can skew the market cap of the company.Holding on a little longer can also be beneficial as you watch the new altcoin go through its first spike and dip. Analyze the charts and see how it starts to move against chart indicators such as MACD, Signal and basic technical charting.This is a more complicated and intensive strategy but also a lot less risky.Keep an eye on candle patterns, as well as the volume, to see if it is falling or rising. You can also continuously compare the market cap to other similar coins to see if it is over or undervalued.This method is much more of an intelligent feel strategy; you are assessing the conditions of an asset and determining its direction. It also goes hand in hand with the saying: “Buy the rumor, sell the news.”"

It covers everything from Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to ICO regulation and investment analysis. If you want to become our guest author and get published on Cointelegraph, please send us an email at mike@cointelegraph.com.","Broadly stated, a 1031 exchange (also called a like-kind exchange or a Starker) is a swap of one business or investment asset for another. Under US tax code, most swaps are taxable as sales. In fact, the IRS has actively gone after the barter community, trying to tax goods and services that are exchanged.Section 1031 is an exception to the rule that swaps are generally fully taxable. If you can manage to come within 1031, you’ll either have no tax, or limited tax due at the time of the exchange. In effect, you can change the form of your investment without (as the IRS sees it) cashing out or recognizing a capital gain. That way your investment continues to grow, tax-deferred. If you qualify, there’s no limit on how many times or how frequently you can do a 1031.Big commercial real estate developers do this all the time. Think Donald Trump.You can roll over the gain from one piece of investment real estate to another, to another and another. Although you may have a profit on each swap, you avoid tax until you actually sell for cash many years later. Then, you’ll hopefully pay only one tax, at a long-term capital gains rate.Since the IRS says cryptocurrency is property and not currency, swaps under 1031 should be fine, right? Not so fast - whether 1031 applies to cryptocurrency is debatable. But the debate may not be relevant for much longer, since both the House tax bill and the Senate tax bill propose to restrict 1031 exchanges to real estate only.The real estate industry is breathing a big sigh of relief that 1031 exchanges are being kept for them. In fact, the vast majority of 1031 exchanges are of real estate. However, some exchanges of personal property (say a painting) can qualify. But exchanges of corporate stock or partnership interests don’t qualify. On the other hand, interests as a tenant in common (sometimes called TICs) in real estate do.Most exchanges must merely be of “like-kind”—an enigmatic phrase that doesn’t mean what you think it means. You can exchange an apartment building for raw land, or a ranch for a strip mall. Classically, an exchange involves a simple swap of one property for another between two people.But the odds of finding someone with the exact property you want who wants the exact property you have are slim. For that reason, the vast majority of exchanges are delayed or “Starker” exchanges (named for the tax case that allowed them). In a delayed exchange, you need a middleman who holds the cash after you “sell” your property and uses it to “buy” the replacement property for you.This three-party exchange is treated as a swap. The intermediary must meet a number of requirements. That’s one reason delayed exchanges of cryptocurrency may not qualify. There are also two timing rules you must observe in a delayed exchange.Once the sale of your property occurs, the intermediary will receive the cash. Then, within 45 days of the sale of your property, you must designate replacement property in writing to the intermediary, specifying the property you want to acquire. The second timing rule in a delayed exchange relates to closing.You must close on the new property within 180 days of the sale of the old. Note that the two time periods run concurrently. That means you start counting when the sale of your property closes. If you designate replacement property exactly 45 days later, you’ll have 135 days left to close on the replacement property.You may have cash left over after the intermediary acquires the replacement property. If so, the intermediary will pay it to you at the end of the 180 days. That cash–known as “boot”—will be taxed as partial sales proceeds from the sale of your property.You must consider mortgage loans or other debt on the property you relinquish, and any debt on the replacement property. If you don’t receive cash back but your liability goes down, that too will be treated just like cash. There are many traps that can derail tax-free treatment.Until the law changes, what about 1031 exchanges of cryptocurrency? The IRS has been asked about this, but has so far remained mum. Some holders of cryptocurrency probably can say they are holding their cryptocurrency for use in their business or for investment. In fact, the investment use qualifier seems easy.But the far tougher hurdle is whether they are swapping for property of like-kind. A direct Bitcoin for Bitcoin swap might be fine. But a Bitcoin for Ripple or Ethereum trade might not qualify. Section 1031 does not apply to trades of stocks or bonds, and the IRS could rely on this to nix any cross-species trade of cryptocurrency.On the other hand, one might argue that different types of cryptocurrency are a little like different types of gold coins. If a swap of one type of gold coin for another qualifies, why not swaps of cryptocurrency? However, one likely IRS answer might be that if you swap, say, Ripple for Bitcoin, that is really more like swapping silver for gold, or vice versa.Silver for gold would be taxable, so the IRS may say that a cross-species swap of cryptocurrency should be too. Many observers think this is how the IRS would come out. But the IRS hasn’t said this so far. So, some of this question turns on risk.How big are the gains you are hoping to shield, and how much of a chance are you willing to take? On top of those questions, there are tax reporting rules to address. You need to claim Section 1031 treatment on your tax return to be able to say that you met the rules.It might seem tempting not to report swaps of cryptocurrency and try to fly under the radar. But for those trying to use 1031, failing to report would be a mistake, in my view. You can’t qualify for 1031 unless you claim it. If you want to see what you have to report to the IRS on your tax return, check out IRS Form 8824.  Both the House and Senate tax bills call for cutting back Section 1031 to cover only real estate. The two tax bills are filled with controversy, but not over this point. In that sense, the debates over 1031 exchanges of cryptocurrency may not be relevant too much longer.Bio: Robert W.

216,https://cointelegraph.com,"Oct 18, 2017",Why We Need ‘Trustless’ Cryptocurrency Exchanges,https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-we-need-trustless-cryptocurrency-exchanges,"In fact, funds raised through ICOs have reached nearly four times the 
amount of money Bitcoin companies have raised in venture capital dollars ...","Oct 18, 2017","The emergence of cryptocurrency exchange platforms and websites where you can buy, sell, or exchange cryptocurrencies has absolutely everything to do with the recent phenomenon of initial coin offerings (ICOs). Through ICOs, companies and organizations are introducing their crypto-assets, also known as tokens, to the public and in the process are creating a new form of tradable digital asset, only made possible by Blockchain technology.","By conducting a fundraising event based on token sales, startups are able to further finance the development of their projects without relying on traditional venture capital. In fact, funds raised through ICOs have reached nearly four times the amount of money Bitcoin companies have raised in venture capital dollars just this year. According to PitchBook, ICO investments rose from $26 mln in 2014 to almost $1.3 bln in 2017, while traditional Blockchain companies saw only $358 mln in VC money over the same period of time.As more and more projects raise funds through the launches of platform tokens (ICOs), the number of tokens in the market is increasing, and investors in Blockchain companies and contributors to the various projects are acquiring a variety of tokens as part of their investment strategies. Unfortunately, limited options to liquidate all of these tokens in the market makes convertibility of one token to another a real challenge for both investors and operators alike. One of the reasons behind this comes from the fact that most of the popular centralized exchanges require reserves of the tokens that they are trading. If a person wants to buy or sell a token that isn’t common, that person would have a hard time doing so because a token of this type is usually not supported by major centralized exchanges.Finally, most existing centralized exchanges tend to require users to wait for several minutes before a trade can be confirmed, or before they are allowed to withdraw their proceeds from an exchange. As a result, the selling price many centralized exchange users see when they initiate a transaction might not necessarily be the price they see when a transaction is complete.While the daily trade volumes between notable cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ether, may very well be in the tens of millions – the daily trades between all of the other crypto-assets entering the market, most of which are less than two years old, are also approaching these large trade volumes. The problem is, despite the decentralized and trustless nature of cryptocurrencies, the majority of this trading takes place on centralized exchanges, which are subject to fraud and hacking. It seems as though there are monthly reports in the media about hacking attempts on major cryptocurrency exchanges. Looking deeper into the cause, one feature that many of these attacks have in common is that they are directed at centralized exchanges, which keep all of their user’s information including their private keys to access their Blockchain currency stored in a data ‘silo.’ This means that a hacker would only have to get into the system once to access every user’s information.As notable investor Arif Akhtar emphasizes, by using a centralized exchange you are trusting that the exchange will not lose your money (whether from a hardware failure or other negligence), will keep your funds secure against theft or hacking, will not steal your funds internally, and will not go out of business. In short, centralized exchanges require you as the user to put a lot of trust into something that is currently unregulated and may not even be operating in the same country as you.A decentralized exchange can provide an alternative solution when it comes to dealing with diverse digital assets and offer an alternative way to trade all cryptocurrencies. One of the primary reasons why a decentralized exchange offers a superior alternative is because it can leverage the underlying technology behind the currencies that it’s trading -- the Blockchain.  An exchange built on the Blockchain would be ‘trustless’ – meaning there would be no need to trust a single party to handle transactions because those transactions would be transparent. Because of this, it would be nearly impossible to ‘fake’ a transaction on a decentralized exchange running on the Blockchain. The underlying transparency and security of the Blockchain technology behind a decentralized exchange would inherently ensure that the system is secure and operates with integrity to protect its user’s transactions.Using blockchain technology a decentralized exchange can also be designed to not hold any customer funds. Instead, peer-to-peer transactions are possible through an automated process. Instead of a central “site” holding a user's funds, their money can be kept in an account until a trade is initiated. When a trade is initiated, it is between only the buyer and seller – so there’s no need to “trust” a central site to make the trade.Moreover, the ideal decentralized exchange does not hold any user's’ tokens – thus preventing any theft or loss of tokens – and could perform trade requests instantly if there is enough liquidity in the system. This is in sharp contrast with current exchanges that not only require several minutes for a transaction to complete but can also malfunction during that time period – resulting in severe consequences, such as a loss of funds.In addition, they can be created within a sound legal framework to protect a user's’ privacy by not requiring them to disclose their personal details, except if the exchange method involves bank transfers. This could prevent hacking of sensitive personal user information – which is all too common today with any system on a centralized server, let alone a currency exchange.These are just a few of the reasons why we need decentralized exchanges - not only to trade currencies safely and securely but to address a number of other issues that will continue cropping up as the cryptocurrency space grows. The basic idea of a decentralized exchange is one that never holds users’ money. Instead, users know that their funds are safe in their accounts until they initiate a trade.So why hasn’t everyone made the switch to decentralized exchanges yet? The answer is that decentralized exchanges are still relatively unknown, mostly because their interfaces are not as user-friendly as platforms like Coinbase.In addition, most existing decentralized exchanges are not friendly to mainstream users who have limited knowledge about the Blockchain and cryptocurrency technology. However, as the general public's perception of cryptocurrencies continues to change, and exchange malfunctions and hacking headlines continue to grace our news feeds, there’s no doubt that decentralized exchanges will continue to rise as one of, if not the most, powerful ways to trade a diverse portfolio of cryptocurrencies safely and securely.Loi Luu is a researcher working on cryptocurrencies, smart contract security and distributed consensus algorithms.

The exchange explained that the decision to halt trading was made “to ensure a fair and orderly market.”Update on #BCH trading on GDAXhttps://t.co/p3cEx0ryh7 pic.twitter.com/NyGUTVFL91Based on data from data provider CoinMarketCap, the last quoted price of Bitcoin Cash before trading was disabled was at almost $9,000 which is an increase of over $6,000 from the current market price of $3,300.On their own Twitter, Coinbase informed users last night that they will enable buy/sell functionality for BCH in their app and web version as soon as “there is sufficient liquidity on GDAX,” estimating that would happen sometime today.Update on #BCH trading on GDAXhttps://t.co/p3cEx0ryh7 pic.twitter.com/NyGUTVFL91In addition to GDAX’s official explanation for the halt in trading, one of the possible reasons behind the abrupt pause is the sudden influx of users to the exchange, which likely put a strain on the platform.This may be due to the fact that Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork of Bitcoin -- Coinbase users who held Bitcoin when the hard fork took place in August were automatically given the equivalent in Bitcoin Cash when the platform started supporting it.As soon as Coinbase added BCH, eager users with new capital entered the exchange’s trading platform, causing a possible strain that has forced the exchange to stop trading.Coinbase’s decision to allow the trading of Bitcoin Cash on its platform was made after months of studies and monitoring of the cryptocurrency’s market performance and other developments. Since it forked from Bitcoin in August, it has become the third-largest digital currency in terms of market capitalization."

When you lend money, you get no tax deduction or other taxable event. You just changed your money into a promise that the borrower will pay you back. So, to the IRS not much has happened.Sure, there may be interest paid or interest received. Plus, if you are relieved of the obligation to pay back a loan, that is income in the amount of the debt forgiven. Mostly, though, loans can be neutral from a tax viewpoint. How about loans in Bitcoin or other digital currency?That’s not so clear. With loans in dollars, money is fungible. When you receive a loan in cash, the lender usually knows that you will invest or spend the money. Everyone understands that you will pay the lender back with other money. But the IRS says cryptocurrency is property.Say you lend your car to another person. If the borrower returns a different car, that transaction could be viewed as the sale of the original vehicle, rather than a loan of the vehicle for tax purposes. If you end up with a different car, the IRS might say that was a sale of the car, followed by the purchase of another car.The IRS likes finding more chances to tax something! That can mean gain or loss, even if the deal ends up netting you a different car with the same value. Except for certain special tax provisions such as Section 1031 exchanges that allow tax-free swaps of property under certain conditions, just about everything you trade is taxed.In 2014, the IRS issued a Notice saying that digital currency like Bitcoin is property, not currency. Most property is not fungible for tax purposes. With loans of cryptocurrency, the parties probably intend the cryptocurrency lent to be treated as fungible currency, rather than like property. For example, a borrower may receive Bitcoins and then sell them.He may repay the lender with different, newly acquired Bitcoins. The Bitcoins are intended to operate as fungible currency so that the repaid Bitcoins are considered a continuation of the Bitcoins that were lent (with the same tax basis and the same acquisition date). But will the IRS agree? No one seems to know the answer to this question.Despite the parties’ intentions, the IRS may not agree that this is just a loan. Think about the fluctuating value of cryptocurrency and these tax issues could be big. There is a risk that the IRS will view Bitcoins received in repayment of a loan as different Bitcoins than the Bitcoins lent. So a loan could end up as a sale to the IRS.Moreover, even if the IRS agrees that loan treatment is appropriate, it is not clear how interest payments will be treated. It might be wise to emphasize in any documents that the transaction is intended to be a loan, not a sale or disposition. You could also document clearly that both parties will report the loan in this manner for tax and accounting purposes.  If the transaction has any profit sharing or equity provisions, that could complicate the argument for loan treatment. Another concern is fungibility. The loan documentation could emphasize that repayment should be made in digital currency that is identical in value and denomination (i.e., Bitcoins for Bitcoins, Ripples for Ripples, etc.) to the digital currency lent. Perhaps the document could even require that repayment be made with the exact same cryptocurrency lent.In practice, this may not be possible, of course. Still, a requirement that the loan repayments be made from the same wallet to which it was lent (and ideally one segregated from other funds) might help strengthen the argument that the very same property has been repaid.It isn’t clear what is the best strategy. Some parties may want to emphasize in loan documentation that the cryptocurrency is a fungible asset. Perhaps they want to state that the cryptocurrency received in repayment will be considered identical to the cryptocurrency lent (that will use the same acquisition date and tax basis).Loan documentation might also distinguish between transfers made in repayment of loan principal and transfers as payments of interest. The IRS may have a stronger hand to argue against loan treatment if the transaction history is muddled, such as where it is not clear which payments are for interest and which are for principal. The loan documentation could spell this out.But making sure that principal and interest payments are made according to the procedures in the loan documentation may help too. A loan transaction that began with Bitcoin might become even more problematic when the lent funds are now represented by both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Parties should anticipate what to do in these circumstances, and consider how to emphasize in the loan documentation that repayment is still being made from the same source and property.  Taking steps of this sort may not prevent the IRS from successfully challenging an intended loan. Even so, it may help put you in a better position in case the loans are examined.#CT_questions How about loans in #Bitcoin or other digital currency??

If you want to become our guest author and get published on Cointelegraph, please send us an email at mike@cointelegraph.com.","In the aftermath of Satoshi Nakamoto’s groundbreaking paper in 2009, money began travelling via a new financial route - virtual currencies. The first Bitcoin exchange was established on February 6, 2010 where Bitcoin traded for the first time for 0.3 cents.Last June, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) asked the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for more guidance on virtual currency beyond Notice 2014-21 to provide clarification to taxpayers and practitioners and to boost compliance with federal tax laws. At that time, Bitcoin’s value was a mere $600, less than a tenth of its current price.In response, last November 2016, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) published a paper titled “As the Use of Virtual Currencies in Taxable Transactions Becomes More Common, Additional Actions Are Needed to Ensure Taxpayer Compliance” which addressed the deficiencies in taxpayer noncompliance issues for transactions involving virtual currencies.Following TIGTA’s report, on November 30, 2016, the IRS began issuing broad based ""John Doe Summonses"" seeking information on the US headquartered $10 billion Bitcoin exchange Coinbase’s US customers. The summons’ sought to track unreported virtual currency gains allegedly transmitted between the years 2013 and 2015, since trading in Bitcoin is a taxable event. Jonathan Levin, co-founder of Chainalysis, explained that his company:“Provides software to IRS, DOJ, DEA, FBI, Europol and several other law enforcement officials and government agencies around the world to help identify the owners of virtual currency.”Findings from multi-jurisdictional Bitcoin exchange and market investigations showed millions of Bitcoin transactions belonging to US taxpayers. However, the IRS stated that, “only 800 US taxpayers had reported their Bitcoin gains from 2013 through 2015.”With the US as one of the world’s major financial hubs and a hotspot for Bitcoin activity, the IRS may have their hands full scrutinizing $150 billion in virtual currency transactions for US tax evasion purposes. This is because a federal judge, US Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley in San Francisco, is poised to allow an IRS audit of Coinbase Inc. to proceed over the company’s objection.Here are some of the US tax reporting requirements applicable to US taxpayers involved in virtual currency transactions:Virtual currency is a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and/or a store of value. A virtual currency, such as Bitcoin, that has an equivalent value in real currency or that acts as a substitute for real currency is called “convertible” virtual currency. Convertible virtual currency is treated as property for tax purposes.A US taxpayer who successfully “mines” convertible virtual currency realizes gross income in the amount of the fair market value (FMV) as of the date of receipt of the virtual currency. This would apply, for example, to a taxpayer who uses computer resources to validate Bitcoin transactions and maintain the public Bitcoin transaction ledger.Gain or loss on the sale of virtual currency is gain or loss from the sale or exchange of property, treated in a manner similar to the sale or exchange of securities. If held as investment property, the gain or loss on sale will be capital gain or capital loss.Form 8949 Individual taxpayers report Bitcoin capital losses and capital gains.Penalties: Failure to timely file or correctly report virtual currency transactions, may be subject taxpayer to information reporting penalties under Code Sec. 6721, 6722 and tax underpayments attributable to virtual currency transactions, may be subject to accuracy-related penalties under Code Sec. 6662.FinCEN Form 114: A US person that has a financial interest in or signature authority over foreign financial accounts must file a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) if the aggregate value of the foreign financial accounts exceeds $10,000 at any time during the calendar year. FBAR requires reporting of all foreign financial accounts. The types of “accounts” which must be reported are defined very broadly and include traditional checking, savings, money market funds, CDs, life insurance plans, and even online Bitcoin based poker accounts. A US taxpayer’s Bitcoin denominated foreign bank account or an account in a foreign virtual currency exchange, which convert Bitcoins in and out of other fiat currencies, that function similarly to brokerages, and offer a variety of financial services similar to banks or other financial institutions in exchange for fees would be reportable on an FBAR as a foreign financial account.Penalties: US Bitcoin denominated foreign account holders who did not file FinCEN Form 114 could face steep civil and criminal penalties. Each non-willful failure to file violation can carry a civil penalty of $10,000, while penalties for willful violations could be the greater of $100,000 or 50 percent of the amount in the account for each violation.Enacted as part of the HIRE Act of 2010, FATCA imposes extensive reporting obligations on US taxpayers, foreign entities and withholding agents. FATCA imposes a 30% US withholding tax to payments of certain US source income (e.g., dividends, interest, insurance premiums) made to non-US financial institutions (FFIs).Foreign assets that are subject to FATCA reporting requirements include accounts with any FFI. For these purposes, virtual currency denominated foreign bank accounts, deposit accounts at foreign Bitcoin exchanges may be considered FFI, although the law on this subject is undeveloped at this time. It should be noted that interest from an interest bearing Internet based foreign Bitcoin account could be 50% US sourced under international communications income sourcing rules and subject to 30% U.S WHT.Form 8938: US individual taxpayers report foreign financial assets valued at $50,000 or more.Penalties: Noncompliance with FATCA subject’s taxpayer to, taxes, severe penalties in excess of the unreported foreign assets and exclusion from access to US markets.This year for the first time, US headquartered Bitcoin exchanges like Coinbase, Inc., with annual revenues of at least $850 million (Multinational Enterprises or MNE) were obligated to file US CbCR on form 8975 on Oct 16, 2017.Form 8975: MNE disclosed to tax authorities information regarding Bitcoin transactions, on a country-by-country basis as follows:Tax jurisdiction and residence of the entity;The main business activity or activities of entity;Financial and employee information for each tax jurisdiction in which the US MNE does business (including revenues, profits, income taxes paid and accrued, stated capital, accumulated earnings);Total net book value of tangible assets, which may include virtual currencies because they are classified as property and not a currency for US tax purposes (cash or cash equivalents, intangibles, or financial assets were not declared).The IRS will automatically exchange filed CbCR with other governments via tax treaties and Tax Information Exchange Agreements. On July 4, 2017 the EU parliament approved making CbCRs publicly available.Penalties: MNEs that failed to file a CbCR could be subject to penalties under US federal tax rules, and to penalties under rules imposed by the 57 other countries that have agreed to exchange CbCR. The US Supreme Court said in Pasquantino v. US (No. 03-725, 4/26/05) that federal wire fraud charges could be brought against violators of foreign tax laws.Bitcoins, with their unprecedented investment returns, are attracting the IRS’s attention. Given recent actions by US law enforcement, government agencies, and regulators, holders and dealers in virtual currencies should beware that:The IRS appears determined to audit virtual currency businesses — whether it be virtual currency exchanges, wallets, hedge funds, asset management companies, or binary Bitcoin markets;The IRS, by using the long arm of US law, may claim jurisdiction over foreign virtual currency businesses that lack any physical presence in the United States, so long as they do substantial business in the United States based on a facts-and-circumstances-driven analysis.The many taxpayers who neglected to report their Bitcoin related taxable gains, or withholding taxes to the IRS and Treasury - under the erroneous assumption that virtual currencies are independent from any government or regulation - are advised to report them, as the IRS has indicated that these transactions give rise to US tax obligations and US tax reporting requirements.Disclaimer: this article is reproduced with permission from Tax Analysts.

These cash transactions create far more cost in the financial world than digital transactions.The J-Coin is intended to function in tandem with the Yen, rather than replacing it. The coin would be exchanged at a one-to-one ratio. The service for the coin would be offered freely but would be a means of tracking transactions that is far more complex in a cash-based society.The coin will likely see release in the coming years, though the infrastructure of the system is not yet clear. It may be based on Blockchain technology, but the specifics are as yet unreleased. Recent reports from the Bank of Japan indicate that it does not consider Blockchain technology ‘mature’ enough to handle transactions.The suggestion of a government cryptocurrency falls in line with the idea that governments around the world are seeking to start their own proprietary cryptocurrencies."

The value of increase in ...","Nov 18, 2017","Tether has always been a controversial token - claimed to be redeemable for fiat currencies but shunned by the fiat banking system. However, the rapid expansion in Tether supply has raised concerns about whether this could be one of the reasons for the overall cryptocurrency boom.","According to the Company's website, Tether is a cryptocurrency whose value is anchored or 'tethered' to the value of national currencies like the US dollar. Tether.to claims to have combined the best of both worlds - a stable currency value and benefits of Blockchain technology. Each tether in circulation is supposed to be backed by a dollar held by the Company in reserve.The overall supply of tether has rapidly increased in 2017. Since the price of each tether is pegged to fiat (dollar or euro), the overall market capitalization reflects the underlying supply of tethers. The total market cap of tether has shot up from $6.9 mln in November 2016 to $645 mln currently. That is 100x increase in supply in the last year.A significant portion of the increase has occurred in the 15 days of November 2017 - the supply / market cap has increased by $200 mln in that time. Since each tether is supposed to be backed by a reserve of fiat currency, questions are being raised about how Tether (the company) has managed to expand its balance sheet so much in the last year.Tether.to has a transparency page which it claims represents the balance sheet of the Company in near real time. It also claims that the Company's reserves are subject to regular audits. After lots of criticism, Tether.to published a memo from Friedman LLP, who were hired as consultants to make limited findings (not audit) of the cash held by the Company as of 15-Sep-17. However, since the supply of tethers has increased substantially post Sep-17, concerns have again been raised on the assets held by Tether.to.Using non-existent money to trade can result in the price skyrocketing. It is alleged that the rapid bull run in 2013 was caused by 2 bots - Willy and Markus who bought Bitcoins at regular intervals, without spending real money. The resultant collapse of Mt. Gox and crash in Bitcoin's price took years to overcome. Helicopter money has a documented effect of fuelling inflation.The value of increase in Tether's supply ($200 mln) in the last month pales in comparison to Bitcoin's trading volume ($5 bln), but any fear about the currency pegs of tether would affect the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. It could lead to people trying to redeem their tethers or dump them on exchanges. Social media is abuzz with doubts about the stability of Tether, with one user going so far as to offer a bounty if somebody could prove that Tether held sufficient cash in its bank accounts.What Tether.to needs to do is reassure the cryptocurrency community about the soundness of their balance sheet. This can be established through a full audit done by a reputed agency. They also need to be transparent about their assets - where exactly are their cash balances held and who are their bankers. Lastly, the Company's legal terms and conditions must not disown all responsibility for redeeming tethersThere is no contractual right or other right or legal claim against us to redeem or exchange your Tethers for money.People believe that one tether can be redeemed for one dollar, and that is what gives it value. The Company would do well to affirm that, especially if its customers are able to demonstrate compliance with all know your customer / anti money laundering regulations."

Further, the post makes clear that investors should expect trading delays over time, as the platform continues to experience growing pains.The email concludes with a rather stiff warning to investors about the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies and an encouragement to invest responsibly. The company states:“We also wanted to remind customers of some of the risks associated with trading digital currency. Digital currencies are volatile and the prices can go up and down. Due to the rapidly changing price of digital currencies, some customers may not have sell limits that are sufficient relative to the value of total digital currency they are storing on Coinbase. Sell limits are one of the many measures Coinbase takes to protect client accounts and assets.” While the statement does not speak to Coinbase’s assessment of the cryptocurrency market, the company is clearly seeking to inform investors about the potential for loss in such a volatile market.

ICO accepted both Bitcoin and Ether for contributions, and the ...","Nov 3, 2017","ICOs are experiencing a tremendous popularity boom right now, and many participants might think that the concept is a new one, when in fact it isn’t. Long before Ethereum-based ERC20 tokens began to be offered for sale, Ethereum itself was launched using an ICO. Many don’t realize that the history of ICOs goes even further back than this, though.","Imagine that somebody tells you that a new cryptocurrency is about to be created that will enable the use of smart contracts and will allow people to create their own digital currencies. Sounds familiar? No, we’re not talking about Ethereum, but something called Mastercoin.Mastercoin was launched, via ICO, on July 31, 2013. Investors could send Bitcoins to a certain address and would be rewarded with a proportional number of Mastercoins. The new protocol would do much of what Ethereum now does, but it would actually use the Bitcoin Blockchain rather than creating its own.Much like Ethereum, Mastercoin would create an easy way for individuals or companies to create their own cryptocurrencies and offer them for sale via an ICO. One of the first projects to take advantage of this feature was Maidsafe, a distributed file storage platform. The crowdsale of Maidsafe tokens was supposed to last 30 days, but the entire allocation of tokens was sold in just five hours.Such huge demand sounds incredibly promising, right? Maidsafe nominally raised $7 mln from the sale, which may be small potatoes in this era of $100 m;n ICOs, but was a vast amount of money for such an untested fundraising method back in 2014. Maidsafe determined they would accept Bitcoins and Mastercoins as a source of funding. Unfortunately, that created a serious problem.Maidsafe announced that a certain number of tokens would be awarded per Mastercoin and a certain number would be awarded per Bitcoin. However, what Maidsafe didn’t realize was that at the ratios they fixed, people could buy far more Maidsafecoin tokens if they paid with Mastercoin than if they paid with Bitcoin.Because of this, the price of Mastercoin soared in the days leading up to the Maidsafe ICO. As soon as the ICO was over, a major source of demand for Mastercoin was suddenly gone, and the price of Mastercoin collapsed. Thus Maidsafe raised about $3 mln in Bitcoins and $4 mln in Mastercoins, but the value of the Mastercoins they received drop rapidly. Maidsafe couldn’t liquidate $4 mln in Mastercoins quickly without tanking the price, causing them to hold a currency (Mastercoin) which continued to diminish in value over time.Once it was all said and done, Maidsafe raised only about half the money they had intended to raise, and the market was on fire with speculation about backroom deals and market manipulation. Part of the problem was that Maidsafe had worked out a terrifically complicated deal with a Bitcoin-based VC firm called BitAngels. The arrangement was so complex as to be nearly incomprehensible, involving Mastercoins changing hands multiple times between the entities.Maidsafe is still around and still working on their project, but the critical lack of funding allowed them to be eclipsed by a number of competitors in the space.Tezos is a project begun by spouses Arthur and Kathleen Breitman to combine smart contract functionality with a formal on-chain governance structure. The ICO was based in Switzerland, and in accordance with Swiss law, is overseen by the Tezos Foundation. A total of $232 mln was raised during Tezos’ uncapped fundraiser in July. The ICO accepted both Bitcoin and Ether for contributions, and the proceeds are held in the custody of the Tezos Foundation. At today’s prices, the foundation controls nearly half a billion dollars.According to Reuters, the Breitmans control Tezos’ source code, but the Foundation controls all the ICO funds. Now the Breitmans are seeking to oust the head of the Tezos Foundation, Johann Gevers. The Breitmans accused Gevers, in a blog post:“In early September we became aware that the president of the Tezos Foundation, Johann Gevers, an attempt at self-dealing, misrepresenting to the council the value of a bonus he attempted to grant himself. We have been working with the Tezos foundation to resolve the matter and have advocated for his removal from the foundation council. We are confident in the council’s ability to handle this sensitive matter with care and diligence. In the meantime, Johann’s operational role in the foundation has been suspended, pending an investigation by the council’s auditor.”Gevers responded that the Breitmans are essentially trying to sidestep Swiss law and exercise direct control over the Foundation “as if it were their own private entity.” Gevers points out that the dispute between the Breitmans and himself is causing significant delays in the project. The Breitmans acknowledge that, saying:“The momentum we had prior to the fundraiser has slowed despite the resources now available for supporting the project. Some development has continued and we have personally been working to create strong relationships with successful entrepreneurs looking to build with Tezos. Unfortunately, other aspects have fallen behind, such as:Creating online resources for contributors and developers to learn more about Tezos.Scaling up the development team.Articulating our vision for the project more clearly through a series of explanatory blog posts, as we used to produce.Engaging with the community of Tezos contributors and makers, and helping them in their endeavors.”The ICO was designed in such a way that the Breitmans’ company, which owns the right to the Tezos code, would be purchased by the Tezos Foundation. In light of the current dispute, that hasn’t happened yet. If it never happens, then investors may end up owning a fractional interest in a worthless foundation. In the meantime, without funds from the foundation, the Breitmans’ may find themselves owning the source code to something whose development may never be completed due to lack of funding. In other words, everybody loses.At least one law firm is considering filing a class action lawsuit against either the Breitmans, or the Tezos Foundation, or both, in order to ensure a full return of all funds back to investors. Such an action, called full rescission, could be ordered if the SEC determines that the Tezos ICO was in fact an unregistered securities sale.Cointelegraph’s London Correspondent Nick Ayton recently published a thorough accounting of the Tezos debacle, and pointed to another source of controversy. Billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper publically invested in Tezos in a special pre-ICO deal, and the Breitmans unquestionably used his support to promote the ICO. After all, if billionaire Draper thinks Tezos is promising, surely the project could be a good deal, right?However, Ayton pointed out that Draper actually received a special deal; in return for his early support, Draper would apparently receive the option to cash out at double his initial investment, regardless of how the project was doing. Not long after Ayton’s piece was published, Cointelegraph received a demand from Draper that the story be retracted.Draper wrote:“Please get your facts straight. My fund is a long-term investor and holder of tokens. I back promising entrepreneurs with the prospect of transforming society for the good of the customer. There was nothing secretive about our purchase of Tezos. Most ICO founders earn tokens over time. All tokens we hope to receive that we didn’t buy in the Pre-sale (alongside with all the other investors who participated) will vest over time with the founders’ tokens. I have no intention of selling these tokens because I am a true believer in the Tezos mission. Arthur and Cathleen [sic] are dedicated, honest and brilliant founders. They made it clear to me and the other purchasers that the token would require time to develop. If they are successful, they might just transform society, and we will all be better off as a result, and then, maybe five or ten years down the road, my investors and I might get rich. I expect a full retraction. And I think you should send Arthur and Cathleen [sic] some flowers and an apology.”Based on lessons from Maidsafe and Tezos, there are some obvious things that should be avoided by future ICOs:Don’t accept illiquid currencies. Accepting funds in illiquid currencies, and especially setting the token price in such currencies, should be avoided at any cost. It hamstrung Maidsafe’s development.Avoid complicated deals. Maidsafe’s deal with BitAngels and Tezos’ deal with Tim Draper caused a great deal of complexity and controversy. At best, such deals look bad. At worst, they could represent actual corruption.Avoid complicated structures. A foundation promising to buy a company’s intellectual property upon completion of an ICO is simply too complex of a structure to really work. By creating two power centers--the owner of the IP and the holder of the ICO funds--too much complexity (and room for dispute) was injected into the post-ICO period.Dispute management. The structure of the Tezos ICO created two essentially equal entities: the Breitmans who controlled the actual source code, and the Foundation that controlled all the funds which would be necessary to further software development. There was no protocol for dispute management, however, and the Foundation’s promised purchase of the company that owns Tezos source code never came to pass.How will this all end up? Much remains to be seen. At the very least, the Tezos project has been significantly delayed, with its scheduled Q4 2017 release now being pushed to early 2018. At worse, the project may never be finished and investors could end up with nothing. It’s likely that the legal battle will grow more complex (and expensive) and that regulators could even get involved in the dispute. Investors could see a full return of all their funds, or they could lose everything.There’s also a third option: a delayed but ultimately successful Tezos could end up being launched, possibly generating significant profit for ICO participants. At this point it doesn’t look likely, but stranger things have happened."

Bitcoin, and the rest of the ...","Nov 9, 2017","Tim Draper has every reason to be bullish on Bitcoin as he has seen his $20 mln investment in the digital currency grow by over 1,000 percent in just three years. Draper is now predicting that in five years fiat will be so obsolete, it will be laughable.","The tech investor has made a fortune backing companies like Skype, Tesla and Twitter. He first got involved in Bitcoin after he bought 30,000 of them in 2014 in a government auction of assets seized from Silk Road.While Draper may be on the defensive after his ICO baby Tezos became embroiled in scandal, leading to a class action lawsuit, he is still highly bullish about the future of the grand-daddy of digital currencies. Draper told Forbes:""In five years, if you try to use fiat currency, they will laugh at you. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be so relevant ... there will be no reason to have the fiat currencies.""Bitcoin, and the rest of the cryptocurrency market, recently made it over $200 bln in a rally that saw Wall Street again add fuel to the fire by announcing trading in Bitcoin futures. This pales in comparison to the trillions of dollars in global fiat currency supply. Nonetheless, the fact that Bitcoin has appreciated over 600 percent this year is reason enough to believe it is on a rocketing trajectory, aiming at the fiat market.Draper goes on to explain how fiat has its limitations, the same limitations that are really starting to bug a progressive and forward thinking global population.Crossing the border for any currency is never a pleasing or easy exercise. The Nigerian Naira drops 30% when you cross the border. Outside Argentina, the country's peso is currency nearly worthless, and there are other countries where this is true as well.In Zimbabwe and Venezuela, their currencies have either disappeared totally, or are on the brink of total collapse, and already Bitcoin is doing its bit to pick up the pieces.Draper may have been stung by Tezos, however, he still sees a future for altcoins and ICOs. The billionaire sees a future with hundreds, if not thousands, of different digital coins. Draper added:“They’re all going to interrelate … and there will be exchange rates for all of them. My guess is that it will centralize around a wallet that you have, and when you pay for that Starbucks, your wallet will optimize to whichever currency has most value."""

classifying them as securities, regulator considers Bitcoin “viable.”.","Nov 25, 2017",The Philippines’ Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced that it is considering steps to legalize the use of digital currencies in the country by classifying them as securities. The move comes following the financial regulator’s issuance of regulations for the cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin earlier in 2017.,"The Manila Times reported that SEC Commissioner Emilio Aquino stated in a news conference in late November 2017 that the agency plans to consider virtual currencies as securities so that they can be regulated under the country’s regulatory code.“The direction is for us to consider this so-called virtual currencies offerings as possible securities in which case we will apply the Securities Regulation Code.  The heightened frenzy and increasing popularity surrounding initial coin offerings has pushed authorities to lay down new rules to protect consumers.”The commissioner also stated that the agency is basing its directives on existing regulations that are implemented by its counterparts in the USA, Malaysia, Thailand and Hong Kong.According to Aquino, the SEC is also discussing the approval and licensing of digital currency exchanges in the country, which will be overseen by the country’s central bank Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). He added that the central bank has already registered and endorsed five or six companies that will operate as cryptocurrency exchanges. The exchanges’ services are limited to the processing of inward remittances from overseas Filipino workers (OFW).Meanwhile, BSP Governor Nestor Espenilla Jr. claimed that the central bank is adopting an “open-minded approach” in tackling issues involving financial technologies (fintech) such as digital currencies.Moreover, BSP deputy director Melchor Plabasan stated that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are both monetary and investment instruments that are very viable and whose risks are manageable.“If you want something that is fast, near real-time and convenient, then there’s the benefit of using virtual currencies like Bitcoin.”"

Although the Bitcoin Blockchain is basically a decentralized database 
for ...","Sep 24, 2017","The Blockchain has become much more than a simple piece of technology. It has become a symbol for freedom, transparency and fairness. With this being said, it’s no wonder we see projects leveraging Blockchain tech as a “one-size-fits-all” tool to solve all sorts of problems, many of which could not be further from the original purpose of the Blockchain.","Nowadays, the words “Blockchain technology” are thrown around alot and sometimes the use of the technology itself is unnecessary. Tim Swanson, Director of Market Research at R3CEV has even coined the term ""chain washing"" to describe companies/startups that are using or trying to use Blockchain technology in certain areas when in fact, they could be using more advanced technology for the purpose at hand.This becomes especially evident when it comes to file and data storage. Although the Bitcoin Blockchain is basically a decentralized database for transactions, accounts and balances, keeping that information on a decentralized ledger is already proving to be a challenge due to capacity issues. Nevertheless, several projects and companies insist on looking at Blockchain-based solutions for storage and, while there are clear cases of misguided enthusiasm when it comes to the use of Blockchain technology, there are some projects out there that are worth taking a look at.When it comes to a mutualistic relation between Decentralized Ledger Technology (DLT) and data storage, the most common use case for the Blockchain is as an incentive layer. This means that data isn’t stored on the Blockchain itself, but the network at hand is able to leverage the Blockchain as a ledger for automatic payments and/or for value exchange, enabling users to pay for storage or access to files.In this case, the advantages for using the Blockchain over any other technology are clear. These include faster settling times, lower transaction fees (which enable microtransactions), higher privacy and the ability for transparent and immutable record keeping. While the Blockchain isn’t being used for data storage, it is providing the foundation on which the decentralized network is built, allowing it to run with no central authority whatsoever.There are several projects leveraging the Blockchain in such a way. Storj, one of the first and most successful decentralized storage networks on the cryptosphere, comes to mind. The project started out using a Bitcoin-based asset but later moved to an ERC20 token on the  Ethereum Blockchain. This token, the Storj Coin (SCJX), is used by clients to pay for storage and acts as an incentive for nodes that keep part of the client’s files. These files have been previously shredded, encrypted, and distributed to multiple nodes in order to ensure their safety and availability.Another popular example is Filecoin, a project developed by Protocol Labs, the creators of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). In case you aren’t familiar with IPFS, it is an alternative p2p hypermedia protocol that allows files to be stored in a permanent and decentralized fashion. This provides historic versioning for files, removes duplicates and even allows users to save on bandwidth since files are downloaded from multiple computers and not from a single server.While IPFS provides a basis for the storage of files, Protocol Labs took this one step further with the development of Filecoin which, according to the whitepaper, “works as an incentive layer on top of IPFS.” The system is different from the one used by Storj on many levels.In Filecoin, miners are paid to store and retrieve files, while also receiving mining rewards from their “useful Proof of Work."" There is also no set price for file storage. Instead, users and miners place buy and sell orders in a decentralized storage exchange, making Filecoin a competitive marketplace in which prices can adapt to outside conditions.While Filecoin and Storj focus on providing affordable cloud storage services, a project named Decent is currently working on a decentralized content sharing platform which allows users to upload and monetize/share their work (videos, music, ebooks, etc) without the need to rely on a centralized third party. Users can access content in a much more affordable way by skipping these intermediaries while the nodes that host the content are rewarded with fees. Much like Storj, the files stored by the nodes on the Decent network are shredded and encrypted.Storing data on a Blockchain like Bitcoin would be doable, in theory. However, Bitcoin’s current blocksize limit only allows for 1MB of data to be stored every 10 minutes. Even if you remove that limit, nodes will eventually stop being able to maintain a copy of the Blockchain due to its size, resulting in a centralized and easily-disruptable network. Of course, the scalability problem hasn’t deterred developers from trying to use the Blockchain as a storage solution and a project called Archain may just have found a solution.Archain is a cryptocurrency project that wants to address online censorship by creating a decentralized archive for the internet. To do so, Archain will leverage a new Blockchain-derivative data structure, the ""blockweave"" which according to the whitepaper, allows the network scale to an “arbitrary size.""Once a user submits a page for archiving on the Archain system, it is stored on the blockweave with the fees paid by the user being allocated to the miner that finds the block at hand. Since the  Archain requires miners to store both the current block and a previous block that has been randomly picked from the blockweave, miners have an incentive to store as much as the data as they can without being forced to store the entire blockweave.As such, Archain is able to ensure that content requested by users is always available without the need for it to be stored by every single node on the network. Archain is also able to address download speeds by incentivising users to propagate poorly-mirrored blocks.You cannot talk about chain washing for too long without talking about private Blockchains. The concept of a private Blockchain is, to a degree, paradoxical as there is really no use for a Blockchain if the network is closed. To put it simply: If a Blockchain network is not immutable, open or transparent, then a regular database will usually be far more efficient than a Blockchain.Yet there is a little known project leveraging a private Blockchain in combination with the public Waves Blockchain to provide clients with the “best of two worlds."" We are talking about Sigwo Technologies LLC, a company that focuses on providing dApps and consulting services for legacy businesses that want to integrate Blockchain technology for data storage and disaster recovery.Although Sigwo Technologies LLC provides a wide range of services, its use of the Jupiter Blockchain, the Mercury token and the Waves Platform caught my attention. Jupiter is a private Blockchain built specifically for encrypted information storage. Different networks are created for different companies, allowing authorized nodes to join in and download the data on the chain. So far, Jupiter is not much different from any other private Blockchain. What makes it stand out is how Jupiter is able to ensure transparency and immutability despite being a private Blockchain.Once data is stored on Jupiter, the block hashes from the private Blockchain are stored permanently on the Waves Blockchain. This is done by adding the block hash to a Waves transaction. Since Waves transaction can be paid for with a custom token, the Mercury token is used which makes the process affordable.  Since block hashes are stored on the Waves Blockchain, any change made to the private Blockchain will be publically detected. This happens because the hash from a certain block will always vary according to the information contained in the block. What we’re left with is a Blockchain in which large amounts of data can be stored by specialized nodes (unlike public Blockchains) while remaining publicly verifiable.As we have seen, there are no shortage of projects that are using Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to make decentralized storage possible. However, it is also worth noting that DLT is still in its early stages and it is possible that other, more advanced technologies can replace it with respect to specific use cases. In other words, Blockchain may not be the answer for everything."

a ...","Oct 15, 2017",The views expressed here are the author’s own and do not necessarily represent the views of Cointelgraph.com,"Proof of Stake (PoS) was first introduced in a paper by Sunny King and Scott Nadal in 2012 and intended to solve the problem of Bitcoin mining’s high energy consumption. At that time, it cost an average of $150,000 a day to maintain the Bitcoin network. Today, this figure is at a staggering $6.7 million (if we assume a $0.12/watt cost and multiply that with the estimated 56,209,833 KWh of electricity that the Bitcoin network consumed on Oct. 13, 2017).Rather than relying on the energy-dependent work of miners to add blocks, Sunny and Scott suggested an alternative method called “staking” where a deterministic algorithm would choose nodes based on the number of coins an individual had. In other words, stakers would have more chances of being selected to add a block to the chain and reap the reward if they “staked” more coins in their wallet.  They hoped this would avoid the ever increasing energy costs and hashrate difficulty of mining. However, their new consensus mechanism was not without its own issues.  There are four main challenges in designing a Proof of Stake system:In light of this, the evolution of PoS can be understood by each coin attempting to solve these issues in their own way.  We will now look at Peercoin.Sunny King created Peercoin (PPC) in 2013 to become the first cryptocurrency to implement Proof of Stake while still keeping Proof of Work (PoW). It addressed the 4 issues of PoS in the following ways:This next phase of PoS history is called considered a pure proof of stake protocol without any mining and was first implemented by NXT on November 24, 2013. However, let’s consider another coin, Blackcoin, that was also a pure proof of stake that was released shortly thereafter as it has a simpler protocol and had a fairer initial distribution phase.Blackcoin was created by Pavel Vasin (a.k.a. Rat4) and was released in February 2014.  When Rat4 decided to create BLK, he set out to remove coin age and PoW.  He believed coin age would increase the chance of a 51% stake attack as older aged coins would need less than 51% of staking coins to cause a fork. He also believed that coin age disincentivized users from staking consistently. Rather, stakers were incentivized to remain offline for 90 days to maximize their chances of getting a stake thereby making the network less secure. Rat4’s implementation of PoS v.2 protocol addresses the four issues of PoS in the following ways:Since Blackcoin, there have been several iterations of the PoS protocol. For example, Bitshares was the first to implement Delegated Proof of Stake.  But the newest iteration of PoS is Ethereum's (ETH) attempt at PoS.  The motivation for ETH to switch is primarily a desire to move towards a more eco-friendly and decentralized system.  If the Ethereum Virtual Machine is truly to be adopted world-wide, Bitcoin’s current $6.7 million daily electricity cost would quickly be surpassed.Ethereum’s PoS system will implement a Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)-style PoS. Validators will be randomly assigned block rewards, however consensus is formed through a multi-round process where every validator votes for a chain. Ethereum is NOT utilizing Proof of Stake at the moment and there have been some doubts as to whether or not it will actually be implemented. With that being said, here’s how Ethereum hopes to solve the four ssues involved with PoS:There have been many fully functional and secure iterations of PoS over the history of cryptocurrency from the Hybrid PoS-PoW to pure PoS to Delegated PoS.  The BFT-style PoS is the newest attempt to address the four main issues surrounding the protocol initially proposed by Sunny and Mark. Each coin reflects a different approach and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. However, the move to PoS reflects a larger philosophical move in the world of cryptocurrency towards a more eco-friendly and decentralized system.*It is important to note that that PoW has its own security concerns, the topic is beyond the scope of this article.  Also, a special thanks to the Nagalim from PPC and mindphuck from to BLK for their insight.  Also thanks to Michael Gubik for his write up on Github.**The article is written by ecurrency holder, a Cryptoeducator and Community Organizer for the masses."

However, with that threat buried in history, Ice Rock Mining is looking to utilize the historic space for new-age technologies.Seeing as the cave sits at a constant temperature of around 12 degrees celsius, and maintains its own ecosystem, Ice Rock believe that it is the perfect space to build a cryptocurrency mining farm.They claim there is space for over 4,600 ASIC rigs in the 1,200 square metres of subterranean tunnels, and because they are supplied by a nearby hydroelectric power source, their price per kilowatt is low. Ice Rock claim they are only paying three cents per/KWH.Overall, the choice of location for the farm means lower costs for mining, which Ice Rock says they can convert into bigger earning margins for their investors.Through its ICO Ice Rock is trying to offer options to purchase mining capacity to people through standard and tailored packages. This project is aiming to offer ‘turn-key’ mining services through their cloud mining service.It is because their mining set up is so low that Ice Rock believes clients can benefit with the cloud mining industry. However, there is also an option for investors to simply buy into the ROCK token and hold onto them until the buyback period starts.Ice Rock Mining is looking to provide a niche in the mining market, as the industry is difficult for many keen individual miners to break into. Home mining, especially of Bitcoin, is expensive and difficult, and setting up an individual farm is a full time, large investment.Ice Rock aim to use the power of Ethereum’s smart contract on the ERC-20 token in order to effect an investment option for its users, as, with their investment through the ICO, the user is essentially buying into a mining operation.Dividends and growth can be paid out along the Ethereum Blockchain as a ROCK token, with the mining farm churning out supposedly some of the lowest cost returns on a mining investment.Using the ROCK token, Ice Rock allows users to buy certain packages, and the packages can allow users a part of the mining operation which has the benefit of no rent, no cost of cooling, and apparently cheap electricity.What Ice Rock is accomplishing is seemingly taking the costs of mining, and mitigating them through the use of an ideal underground space. Electricity, cooling, even rent is negated in their farm, and by allowing the investor to be a part of that, the margins naturally have to be bigger.By turning the mining farm into an ICO, there’s the added crypto-investment of cashing in on Blockchain tokenization. Investors can buy into ROCK tokens and use them like any other, selling when they see fit, or they have a secondary option to grow their capital by getting involved in different mining packages with Ice Rock. Disclaimer.

It was the first Ethereum meetup to host over a thousand attendees.On Sep. 29, the South Korean government and its financial regulator the Financial Services Commission (FSC) revealed its plans to ban domestic initial coin offerings (ICOs). Since the ICO industry is a major market for Ethereum, many traders panic sold Ether, which eventually led Ether price to decline by over eight percent.But, Ethereum price swiftly recovered, increasing back to around $300 within seven hours since the announcement of the South Korean government was released. Although the market share of the South Korean Ethereum exchange market fell from 33 percent to 23 percent, South Korea still secured its position as the second largest market for Ethereum.The majority of traders in the South Korean Ethereum market are speculative investors and tend to be largely influenced by any movement in the industry that could lead to a decline in Ethereum price. However, a fairly large portion of investors are avid supporters of Ethereum as a technology and an infrastructure for decentralized applications.At the moment, ICOs seem like the largest market for Ethereum. In the upcoming years, it is likely that the performance of decentralized applications will evolve as a major factor for the market cap of Ethereum. In an interview with JoongAng, a leading finance news publication in South Korea, Buterin emphasized that it could take two to five years for Ethereum to scale to a point in which decentralized applications with millions of users can be launched and sustained.There are many multi-billion dollar conglomerates and financial institutions in the Ethereum industry developing decentralized applications and platforms on top of the Ethereum protocol. The emergence of efficient and innovative scaling solutions will create a better environment for decentralized applications and will allow highly anticipated projects such as decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges and marketplaces to evolve.If support and enthusiasm toward Ethereum in South Korea are sustained in the mid-term, it is highly likely that the South Korean Ethereum exchange market could evolve into an Ethereum powerhouse. As Buterin noted in the interview with JoongAng in the upcoming years, applications of Ethereum in a variety of industries will be tested and implemented.Buterin explains:“I would say that Ethereum’s main benefits are in its generality and in its utility to many kinds of industries. There are applications in finance, identity, supply chain tracking, health care, energy and many other areas. This is a result of Ethereum deliberately being designed as a general-purpose programming platform.”"

So you probably remember the learning curve of figuring out what wallets, addresses, miner’s fees and public and private keys mean. Even as you get used to using cryptocurrencies, the hassles of inputting information, slow transaction times and worst of all fraud and theft persist.","For a complete newcomer, especially one with less interest in financial technology these problems are a big hurdle. You might have the hang of Bitcoin, but your grandmother would probably have less aptitude for it. But the persistent media attention given to cryptocurrencies is fueling a constant stream of new, curious users.All this pressure to increase the usability of crypto is leading many to look for new ways to leverage technology to make the whole process easier. A new era of computing has dawned with the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which enables the automation of functions that previously only a human could do.One such project is TeleX AI, who want to use a chatbot to make the entire investing and trading process much easier.It is kind of amazing how underdeveloped the user experience of trading and transacting cryptocurrencies is relative to the amount of interest the wider public has on the topic. Recent all-time highs in Bitcoin price has the public queuing up to get involved.However, consider the difficulty in onboarding a new user. There is first the information gap: most people have never heard of exchanges, don’t know what an appropriate miner’s fee is, and have no clue how to trade currencies for each other or convert to and from fiat.Add to this the extra security measures that some platforms require, like ID verification, and you have a recipe for a clunky onboarding experience at the best of times.Furthermore, transaction times and fees are usually a fact of life even for experienced users. So any solutions that make this whole set of processes more straightforward will be able to cash in and also provide a real benefit to users.These concerns are widely known in the crypto community. User experience and convenience are the impetus behind the Bitcoin fork attempt and the lightning networks of Bitcoin and Ethereum.So when taken together, you really get an idea of how much manual hassles are involved in cryptocurrencies, and also that there is a real demand for solutions.Telex AI intend to address these problems with a type of innovation that seems impressively simple when you see it functioning, yet only works thanks to complex and cutting-edge innovations in computer science. Artificial Intelligence and machine learning allow programs to iteratively change their own processes each time they're executed, getting better and smarter as they are used. Coupled with the ability to process vast quantities of data and you have a solution that quickly learns how to deal with complex and nuanced inputs to give the right answer or carry out the right command.In essence, this makes robo advisors and reps able to act as your personal assistant with a variety of tasks. Imagine having a personal assistant walk you through your first Bitcoin transaction and then be available to process all your transactions thereafter on demand. Perhaps the most impressive aspect of TeleX AI is that is all done via Telegram, an extra-secure Whatsapp rival that is particularly popular with the crypto community. The TeleX AI is, therefore, a wallet and chatbot in one. The TeleX AI team explained its functioning further in their whitepaper:“Users interact with the chatbot through the Telegram interface; the conversations are interpreted and processed by the chatbot backend, which is connected to the liquidity engine. The liquidity engine tracks the user balances and routes the deposits to several altcoin exchanges to provide liquidity.

What if there was a scaling solution that already surpasses all the others? Bitcore is that solution and it is able to comfortably scale into the future while also implementing all of the latest innovations of the industry.Bitcore was initially created on April 28th as an experimental scaling solution by the Bitsend development team that has continually provided their community with innovative and transparent development. Bitcore was started without an ICO but instead with a pre-mine that allows the development team to fairly and widely distribute coins to a rapidly growing community. The pre-mine was done in the form of a Bitcoin snapshot at block 463619. All Bitcoin holders, at the time of the snapshot, can currently claim their requisite Bitcore through the official website at a 1 to 1 ratio until October 30th. The claiming process is done without exposing a user’s private key so the claiming is far more security conscious than most other projects with snapshot claiming. In addition to the claiming, every Monday there are 3 percent weekly airdrops on all address balances greater than 10 BTX. The snapshot for the weekly airdrop is taken at midnight by CEST time. It is absolutely necessary to get your BTX into your QT wallet before this time to receive your weekly airdrop. The airdrop provides investors and users alike with an extra incentive to test and also hold Bitcore for the long term.Bitcore has a maximum total supply of 21 million coins and is mined through the ASIC resistant timetravel10 algorithm. Bitcore also has a 2.5 minute block time and the current mining reward is 3.125 BTX that matches the Bitcoin halving schedule. The real difference maker is that Bitcore has 10 MB blocks with Segwit enabled which allows for the network to handle about 17.6 billion transactions per year. To put this in perspective, the Bitcore network can handle an entire years worth of Bitcoin transactions, at the current rate, in only three days. To do another comparison, Bitcore nearly matches Paypal in transactions per second which is vastly superior to any other currency at the moment. The large transaction cap is further augmented by the speed at which transaction take place. Bitcore transactions are completed within seconds and that easily makes it as fast as or even faster than all of the top currencies on the market. The rapid speed and unrivaled scaling easily positions Bitcore to be able to act as an everyday currency in the future. If that was not enough innovation, Bitcore also has a unique difficulty algorithm called Bitcore 64_15. This algorithm ensures that there is no more than a 15 percent change in difficulty within a 64 block period. This innovative difficulty adjustment method prevents the block time issues that have plagued Bitcoin Cash. The last major selling point is that the Bitcore blockchain currently is only 150 MB which means running the blockchain requires very little storage space and can even be run on cell phones.On October 30th there will be a onetime 25 percent airdrop to all addresses that have 10 BTX or more in their personal wallets. On the same day, there will be an additional Bitcoin snapshot taken for the continuation of the Bitcore claiming. Bitcoin holders, at the time of the new snapshot, will be able to claim Bitcore for 40 percent of their Bitcoin balance by using the official website claiming service. There will also be a continuation of the 3 percent weekly airdrops until all of the remaining coins are distributed by roughly October of 2018. Additionally, the Bitcore development team will keep 10 percent of all unclaimed coins at the time of the snapshot for future development.The development team is almost finished with a Bitcore electrum wallet and the next task at hand will be to potentially work on integrating into coinomi’s multi-asset wallet. The team is also experimenting with cross chain atomic swaps, lightning network, Schnorr’s Signature, and even more initiatives to stay on the cutting edge of technology.

However, the team has yet to disclose the location, nor has indicated what entry standards would be required. Roger Ver and Maria Jones of CointelegraphThe locations being evaluated include areas with safe, conflict-free areas, proximity to economic centers in the US, Europe, and Asia, and accessibility by water. The team is hoping to offer a stable government with substantial national debt a way to eliminate some of that debt with a land lease to FreeSociety.Roger Ver, in his announcement, did indicate that the country is ‘not an ICO!’, though he was quick to point out that participants could join. Legally, the country will have a constitution, but only after final negotiations are complete. The team hopes to establish a precedent for future sovereign nations, stating:“It is important to establish a proper rule of law, as our project will set an example for the industry and create an important precedent with governments and the world. We want to make sure the constitution is solid but avoid the inefficiencies of existing government structures.”Soon Cointelegraph will publish an interview with Roger Ver."

It covers everything from Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to ICO regulation and investment analysis. If you want to become our guest author and get published on Cointelegraph, please send us an email at mike@cointelegraph.com.","There is a positive correlation between the value, or market capitalization, of a cryptocurrency and the number of exchanges that it is listed on. For the top 1,000 cryptocurrencies, the correlation is over 50 percent. Rudimentary data analysis indicates that the market capitalization of the coin or token crudely increases with exchange listings. However, correlation is not causation and it is not wise to conclude that simply listing a cryptocurrency on more exchanges always adds more value to the cryptocurrency.Correlation explains how much two variables are related. A correlation of 100 percent would mean that the positive change in one variable is perfectly related to the positive change in the other variable. If the correlation between cryptocurrency value and exchange listings was 100 percent, then it would possible to observe an exactly proportional increase in market capitalization with an increase in the number of exchange listings.Since the correlation is over 50 percent, it might be tempting to list on as many exchanges as possible to maximize token value. Do not be tempted. Even though market capitalization and the exchange listings are somewhat linearly correlated, it does not mean that listing on more exchanges definitely results in an increase in market capitalization. Especially when a little more analysis reveals the presence of major outliers.Thanks to the Coin Market Cap API it is easy to observe outliers in the top 1,000 cryptocurrencies. Dumping the market capitalization and exchange listing data into Google Sheets or an RStudio dataset helps to explain a lot. Plotting value against listings shows that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are not normal in comparison to the majority of other cryptocurrencies.Plotting the log of market capitalization against exchanges listed reveals roughly three different clusters of value in the cryptocurrency world.The first cluster includes Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash. This group of cryptocurrencies are all listed on over 75 exchanges. The second cluster of cryptocurrencies are scattered between 15 and 55 exchange listings. The second includes DASH, Ripple, ZCash, and popular cryptocurrencies. Finally, the vast majority (~98%) of cryptocurrencies have 15 or fewer exchange listings.Statistical summaries show that median cryptocurrency is listed on just two exchanges and the average is listed on just under four exchanges. Using a box plot to graphically describe the data shows the large number of outliers in relation to the majority of cryptocurrencies.Box Plot of Exchange Listings. Data obtained from http://www.coinmaketcap.com on Dec. 10th 2017.In general, the major outliers widely function as mediums of exchange and stores of value. To be globally valuable as intermediary instruments used to facilitate buying, selling or trading goods and services, these cryptocurrencies should be listed on many exchanges as possible. Currencies generally have more legitimacy the more widely they are used, and listing on many exchanges advances those network effects.Not all of the outliers present in the dataset serve as money. Ethereum is an exception. Though it was designed with a different purpose in mind, the market decided that it too should function as a medium of exchange and store of value.There are other exceptions in the first and second cluster of cryptocurrencies. Qtum and TenX were also not purposed as mediums of exchange, yet they are listed on over 15 exchanges.In spite of these outliers, analyzing the relationship between value and exchange listings has implications for cryptocurrency strategy. Further dividing cryptocurrencies into subsets and rerunning the analysis provides more meaningful information to can reinforce or redirect the intuition of a cryptocurrency strategist.Knowing that the outliers are primarily used as stores of value or mediums of exchange, it only makes sense to list widely if planning to compete with cryptocurrencies used as money. There are always exceptions. However, if the purpose of a cryptocurrency is to be a better form of money, then it may need to be widely listed to in order to compete with the other widely listed currencies.For example, cryptocurrencies competing to be a medium of exchange in Venezuela may increase their market capitalization through listing on a Venezuelan cryptocurrency exchange. With each new geographical market entered, it might experience additional increases in value.This might not be the case with tokens. Since tokens usually represent an asset, the economics of valuation with respect to exchange listings may be different. Being listed on a Venezuelan exchange may add no value at all.Security tokens may observe increased market capitalization with exchange listings, as investors will appreciate more trading options in the case there are problems at one of the major centralized exchanges. However, there will most likely be diminishing returns to increasing exchange listings.Focusing on cryptocurrencies with fewer than 15 listings makes sense for getting a rough idea of the relationship between value and exchange listings for average tokens. This subset is the third cluster of cryptocurrencies. They represent over 97 percent of the top 1,000 cryptocurrencies. This cluster also includes cryptocurrencies, like IOTA and NEM, which are not tokens but are highly valued and listed on fewer exchanges than their peers.Top 1000 Cryptocurrency [Data Source: http://www.coinmarketcap.com]Graphically, with the aid of a histogram, it is possible to observe the concentration of cryptocurrencies. The chart exposes the first and second clusters as the long tail cryptocurrency exchange listings.Focusing third cluster makes it possible to notice that the linear correlation between market capitalization and exchange listings drops to 20 percent. That means that it might not really matter that much how many exchanges the average token is listed on. The correlation between the average token’s value and exchange listings is not very significant.The ICO is becoming an increasingly popular fundraising vehicle. Traditional businesses are starting to look to this crowdfunding mechanism and bypassing other traditional forms of financing.Nonetheless, planning an initial coin offering requires a lot of thought and thorough research. Even deciding which exchanges to list on and how many exchanges to list on requires careful research. Fortunately, there are already hundreds of cryptocurrencies out there that can help to determine if it is worth the time and effort to pursue a certain strategy.There is a correlation between market capitalization, but it is not very strong. Be guided by that. Whenever in doubt about correlation and causation, just look at Litecoin and Bitcoin. Litecoin is listed on 94 exchanges compared to Bitcoin’s 88, yet Bitcoin is a magnitude larger in market capitalization. Munair Simpson is a business strategist and the principal researcher at Useful Coin Research.

For now, the feds haven’t said much. In 2014, the IRS declared only that Bitcoin is “property” and Congress has said almost nothing.But with Bitcoin surpassing $8,000, the feds will surely be looking for more tax revenue from cryptocurrencies. But how to tax Bitcoin? One ancient approach, which could ironically get a closer look, is the Land Value Tax.The Land Value Tax (LVT) is essentially what it sounds like, a tax on the value of land. It’s quite popular among economists, although not frequently used in practice. Adam Smith said nothing could “be more reasonable” than the LVT. Milton Friedman famously called it the “least bad tax.” Well put.One reason economists like the LVT is because it arguably distorts economic activity less than other taxes. Corporate taxes reduce incentive to invest, income taxes can distort incentives to earn income, and so forth.But in theory, if there was a one percent LVT introduced today, there would still be as much land next year as there is today. The supply of land doesn’t (and can’t) change. All that changes is price, as LVT becomes factored into the price of land.Now, there are certainly some problems with this reasoning, and especially as it relates to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. For one, cryptocurrencies aren’t exactly like land and an LVT on cryptocurrencies could affect future supply. While the supply of Bitcoin is fixed in a sense, the incentives to invest in creating additional cryptocurrency through forks or ICO’s could be muted by an LVT.Also, enforcement and collection could be tricky. How would tax authorities know if the holder of a Bitcoin is a tax resident of any particular jurisdiction? How would they impose and collect the tax? Perhaps the tax could be collected on the Blockchain itself, although with current technology it’s hard to see how this would work. Enforcement could require intrusive -- and exceedingly unpopular -- measures.However, assuming these and other problems could be worked out (a big if), there are some possible advantages to imposing an LVT on cryptocurrencies. One of the criticisms usually leveled at LVTs is that it is difficult to value land separately from what is built upon it. This might explain why LVTs are not very common, even though economists praise them.But generally speaking, there’s nothing “built” on any particular Bitcoin, and one Bitcoin has the same value as the next. The value is therefore readily ascertainable for tax purposes, and imposing an LVT could (again, a big “if”) impose less distortion than taxes on trading gains, mining, and other economic activity connected to the Blockchain. When Congress eventually sets its sights on the Bitcoin economy, it may look to some form of an LVT.In addition to praising the LVT, Milton Friedman may also have predicted the rise of Bitcoin almost 20 years ago. In a 1999 interview conducted by NTU/F:""The one thing that's missing, but that will soon be developed, it's a reliable e-cash. A method where buying on the internet you can transfer funds from A to B, without A knowing B or B knowing A. The way in which I can take a 20 dollar bill and hand it over to you and there's no record of where it came from. And you may get that without knowing who I am. That kind of thing will develop on the Internet.""Milton Friedman may have been thinking of something quite similar to Bitcoin when he made these remarks. His remarks seem downright prophetical now. The question of how to tax Bitcoin may be a new one, but the policy questions have been around for some time.Maybe Milton Friedman was even thinking of assets like Bitcoin when he praised the LVT. But was Adam Smith, when he said nothing could be “more reasonable” than an LVT? Probably not…Still, when Congress turns its sights to cryptocurrencies as a potential source of revenue, it will be interesting to see what ancient method of taxation they try to fit onto this modern technology.Dashiell ShapiroDashiell Shapiro is a Tax Partner at Wood LLP in San Francisco, CA, and a former DOJ Tax Attorney.

Blockchain News · Business News · Technology News · Policy & ...","Nov 2, 2017","The Blockchain phenomenon is gradually settling into people’s lives, making it imperative to understand its applications and limitations. Today, we’re going to discuss how Blockchain can make the food industry better.","Our current food system offers a fertile opportunity to explore how the Blockchain technology can interact with our ecosystems — both human and ecological — to add value to our lives. Fortunately, a number of startups are already hard at work in this area.After the introduction of Ethereum, altcoins became a popular way to showcase ideas for new cryptocurrencies. We are currently in a period of hype, where many developers are proposing crazy ideas to solve either nonexistent or trivial problems. It’s vital that society and developers focus on applying Blockchain to relevant and important projects, rather than assuming Blockchain technology is a one-size-fits-all panacea.Food quality is clearly related to chronic illnesses such as heart disease, liver damage, stroke, diabetes and cancer, to name a few. We can significantly reduce chronic illnesses by improving the quality of food available. That requires an answer to the following question: Why do we eat poor quality food?This large problem can be divided in three parts: production, delivery and sale.Food production starts at the farm. Farming always implies high risks — natural disaster, harvest failure, accidents, etc. — that directly affect what a farm can offer. Market conditions and large agricultural corporations can also make the lives of small farmers challenging. The companies often abuse their positions by using expensive fertilizers and patented GMO-seeds to gain competitive advantages over smaller operations.Another problem is in the logistics of food delivery. Modern agriculture is under the siege of large chains’ producer-distributor-consumer model. Large-scale food producers often organize industrial food production in developing countries. They then create large-scale distribution networks to sell the food globally.Producers are often unable to sell their products directly to consumers, having to appeal to traders or distributors who buy their product cheaply. Large companies are able to cheaply mass-produce food and fill the distribution channels, but this food is never completely consumed. The result is the creation of a new problem: food waste and disposal. Resources like fuel and fertilizers are used to produce and distribute food that will never be consumed, creating waste.Fortunately, health, eating, farming, agriculture and logistics are interconnected, and we can solve these challenges through modern technologies, utilizing experts who understand the systems.We spoke with Liz Reitzig, founder of NourishingLiberty, who has spent 15 years working on food systems from every angle. She is a consumer advocate who has worked in retail, policy, agriculture and farmer support.Blockchain as a Financial ToolBlockchain technologies offer good financial instruments to provide farmers a timely and complete payment for their efforts. Using these technologies will help to avoid risk and make the farmer’s life easier. According to Reitzig:
 “Blockchain...offers [a] means for farmers to contract with sellers to grow what is needed. Full or partial payment can go into escrow immediately...to guarantee payment to the farmer without breach of contract and coercion by marketers. Getting paid for labor is a big challenge in the farming world, and Blockchain can alleviate part of that.”Thanks to smart contracts, farmers can get paid all year long, not only in summer and fall. Using a calculation system based on smart contracts, it is much safer to work with pre-orders, food baskets and buying clubs.“Some farms produce something called a community supported agriculture (CSA) share. This is a growing model where the consumers prepay a farm for the whole season. We might pay $500 at the beginning of spring, and we'll get a box of veggies every week for 30 weeks. Blockchain can handle that entire transaction.”One of the first farmers who implemented Blockchain as a financial instrument to develop his economy was Mikhail Shlyapnikov, a farmer from Russia. He introduced his own cryptocurrency for his farm.“A farmer has different tools: Shovels, tractors. Blockchain is also a tool, and it’s up to you if you use it or not.”Smart contracts can include any conditions and any parties without involving lawyers. For example, using a smart contract, the owner of a small café can purchase coffee seeds directly from a Kenyan farmer.All at once, he or she can order delivery to Europe, pay for work of the customs broker and for certification according to the laws of the country of delivery. Smart contracts will free farmers from the long chains of intermediaries and thus lower the final price of the product for the consumer.Implementing Blockchain into the production, certification and food processing steps creates transparency in an otherwise non-transparent system and allows consumers to support suppliers they choose. It is particularly relevant for organic and certified origin products.Liz Reitzig emphasizes the importance of determining the origin of organic products:“If a farm is certified organic, or they want to emphasize a different kind of certification, they can use Blockchain to track products. Consumers want to know what they are buying, and Blockchain can offer that.”Marcel Blankenstein, owner of Naked Organics, believes that origin information may be interesting for the user as long as it’s usable:“Blockchain in agriculture allows the consumer to scan the barcode of a product in the supermarket and instantly view the entire supply chain from supermarket to farmer. In terms of consumer orientated transparency. From a regulatory perspective, agricultural contamination can be very quickly isolated.”Reitzig believes that the most difficult obstacles for Blockchain implementation in are complicated work principles and terminology. She says:“The biggest challenge for farmers in using Blockchain is in overcoming the technical understanding of it. Farmers are focused on farming. They are not on the cutting edge of technology.”This means Blockchain technologies must be simple to understand and use. A number of startups have been working in this space. One such company has developed an entire platform to make Blockchain use simpler for farmers. They have united all the Blockchain functions related to food, farming and agriculture.This system includes smart contract libraries, remote identification systems, a digital currency payment processor, a smart cryptocurrency wallet, and their own digital currency token. Gregory Arzumanian, co-founder of 1000Ecofarms, says:“We learned all the opportunities that Blockchain technologies can help with. When the Blockchain technologies are tangible and understandable, we can apply them even to the basic human need for food. [A] key objective is to create a global, comprehensible and safe ecosystem for agriculture and food businesses that would allow them to significantly reduce the expenses related to the production, sales and logistics of the consumable goods.”Blockchain technologies can alleviate technical difficulties and simplify the farmer’s life, and make our food — and thus our health — much better. There remain problems that only consumers can help them solve, however.Marcel Blankenstein is sure that the main challenge every modern farmer faces is consumers’ ignorance, which must be resolved before Blockchain can reach its full potential:“Unless consumers are taught to understand that conventional farming is “bad,” Blockchain will have very little “good” purpose, from a sustainability perspective. It is important to remember that traceability does not equal good farming techniques and quality food does not equal healthy food.”Fortunately, we see modern farming moving quickly towards sustainability. Healthy and organic food is becoming ever-increasingly popular and affordable thanks to Blockchain technologies, which means that direct transactions with consumers can be profitable for small farms.Blockchain is a valuable technology, but people must create the rest of the ecosystem. If we display the origin of food while making an open and informed marketplace, we are creating a level playing field where small and medium producers can reach their customers.In turn, when consumers can find products and farmers who meet their needs, and can pay them full value for their product, farmers can make a viable living, which empowers them to remain on the farm and continue the work they love.Ann Maslova is a freelance writer and journalist from Russia living in Spain, interested in modern technologies, social problems and possibilities to live a healthy life among them. After the boost of cryptocurrencies and Blockchain in past few years, she got very interested in this subject and wishes to contribute in this sphere."

which was then written directly to the Bitcoin Blockchain. The oath of ...","Oct 31, 2017","Smart contracts have brought the Blockchain closer to real life. After the smart contract is signed, it's submitted for permanent storage as a secure record. This permanence has led to the development of a number of services that allow marriage and marriage contract on the Blockchain.","The first marriage was registered in the public registry of Blockchain on Oct. 5, 2014. The wedding of David Mondrus and Joyce Bayo took place at a private Bitcoin conference at Disney World in Orlando, Florida. To legalize the marriage, the couple had to scan and confirm the QR code, which was then written directly to the Bitcoin Blockchain. The oath of the newlyweds was:""Life is not eternal and death can separate us, but the Blockchain is forever.""Another example of a wedding on registered on Blockchain is Bitcoin activist Oles Slobodenyuk and Irina Dukhnovskaya on Jul. 17, 2016. At the celebration, the presenter recorded a marriage certificate in the Weddingbook.io platform on a Blockchain.The site uses the capabilities of Cryptograffiti, a web service that allows people to encode hidden messages into the Bitcoin Blockchain using a special online interface. It is possible not only to record the wedding certificate permanently but also to keep a list of witnesses and wedding vows on a Blockchain.Despite the fact that not all marriages are successful, developers foresee a growing number of unions being registered on Blockchains. Some platforms help couples not only register a marriage but also prescribe the conditions of family life in the marriage contract.IT-developers Gaurang Torvekar and Sayalee Kaluskar signed the first and most famous marriage contract on the Blockchain in 2016. The couple downloaded the marriage contract template to the cloud-based File System solution and digitally signed using the Ethereum-based Attores platform.The agreement of Prenup With Love spells out the conditions for cohabitation. For example, the frequency of shopping, the amount of chores done at home, how much time should be spent on night dating, what series they will watch and so on.The contract was activated after both parties sent a coded message from their IP addresses, which was reflected in the smart contract. This contract has an open code and all newlyweds can use it. It should be noted that such contracts do not have legal force yet. The newlyweds commented on their decision as follows:""Speaking about the Blockchain and its endless possibilities, we decided to use it to solve family problems. We believe that to contract a marriage on Blockchain is a smart decision.""The first marriage in Russia contracted with the help of Blockchain system was registered in October 2017.  Vasily Lifanovsky and Alla TkachenkoVasily Lifanovsky and Alla Tkachenko combined their crypto-savings into a single family budget. This procedure was carried out on MyWish Platform, aimed at managing cryptocurrency assets in various life situations, including during marriage.The idea and implementation of this agreement are significantly different from the Prenup With Love agreement. The essence of the marriage contract on MyWish is that the couple's savings will be combined by a smart contract, where they can transfer funds in the future. In case of termination of the contract, all funds stored on the wallet will be divided in half. To cancel the termination of the contract will be allocated three months, in case of an unwise decision. In case of the death of one party, the funds will be transferred to the account of the heir or the spouse. The husband explains:""When I first learned about the Blockchain, I was struck by the thought that a certain network was created over the existing economic institutions, which we ourselves are influencing. The system inspired me so much that I decided not just to become part of the impending future, but also to influence it. Creating my family I want to make sure that our finances are protected from various circumstances.""Aside from the existing platforms that allow contracting a marriage now, also new projects for married couples are expected to appear. For instance, in June 2017 on Hackathon forum in Skolkovo, the Moscow team Evolve Team has presented a new project for marriage contracts on Blockchain, the Wedding Chain. This project formula consists of a registry office, marriage contracts and management of the family budget. The financial component of Wedding Chain will allow keeping funds on a smart contract, to manage it by mutual consent and divide the accumulated funds during the divorce. Now this project is under construction.Apart from the romantic motives for eternal marriage on the Blockchain, smart contracts have a completely pragmatic function. Unfortunately, the statistics show that the divorce rate ranges from 40 to 50 percent of the marriages. Smart contracts will help to minimize energy demands regarding divorce.Certain conditions can be prescribed that allow divorce proceedings to be accomplished automatically. Such contracts do not require the participation of a notary by making the entire procedure more cost-effective and simplified. Smart contracts can also facilitate the process of a divorce settlement.It is entirely possible that law will adopt the contact of marriages on the Blockchain. It could reduce the costs of divorcees, as well as reduce the burden on the courts and registry offices. It's becoming clear that smart contracts are the most convenient form for marriage contracts. In that context, it can be assumed that following the listed platforms there will be a whole series of projects devoted to this topic."

restrict access to Bitcoin to ordinary or “non-qualified” investors.","Oct 2, 2017",The founder of Russian bank Tinkoff Oleg Tinkov has said he wants to create his own cryptocurrency because he fears “losing pole position.”,"In a post on his Facebook page over the weekend, Tinkov, whose bank has claimed huge numbers of customers through its more relaxed card terms, said the “time was right” to release the dedicated ‘TinCoin.’“I have a feeling pole position technologically is slipping away from us right before our eyes,” he wrote.“Time to release TinCoin… What do you think? We’re almost ready.” Tinkov gave no further details as to the nature or function of TinCoin, but a release would be the first of its kind for a Russian bank as the state continues to develop the so-called ‘BitRuble’ together with the central bank.Commenting in response to users on Facebook, Tinkov said in a typically ironic style that his institution “out of principle does not compete with state banks.”Nonetheless, Tinkoff is a firm participant in the cross-sector Russian FinTech Association, which aims to explore and further the use of disruptive technologies such as Blockchain.Other members include major state players Bank of Russia, Sberbank and VTB, along with periphery providers such as the QIWI electronic wallet platform.Meanwhile, Russia’s official stance towards cryptocurrencies beyond the BitRuble remains contradictory. Various ministers continue to give contrasting information about how authorities wish to restrict access to Bitcoin to ordinary or “non-qualified” investors. The difference in opinion between cryptocurrency and Blockchain meanwhile continues to widen. One of the largest mobile telecoms providers in Russia, Megafon, announced today it had used the technology to distribute bonds worth 500 mln rubles ($8.6 mln)."
241,https://cointelegraph.com,"Sep 23, 2017","Good, Bad and Ugly Side of ICOs",https://cointelegraph.com/news/good-bad-and-ugly-side-of-icos,"Why Bitcoin is the best Use Case there is… We have a very successful peer 
to peer cryptocurrency called Bitcoin that is working as a payment rail ...","Sep 23, 2017","Our London correspondent Nick Ayton explores the darker and lighter sides of cryptocurrencies, the Blockchain and the emerging world of Initial Coin Offerings, “ICOs.”","Why are so many ICOs structured poorly with little or no chance of delivering anything for those who have invested? Or maybe it is the core ICO proposition that doesn’t really improve on what is currently available in the market, naively thinking that by adding decentralisation you immediately improve on things. Or maybe the project team creates the marketing hype that reaches out to investors and masks the reality of what is actually going on...I have spoken to literally hundreds of ICO project owners and read through an equal amount of White Papers. So why are there so few genuinely good ICOs are coming forward… Or is it because this new means of raising capital is attracting a greater number of inexperienced, first time entrepreneurs that think they can raise the odd $10m on the strength of a ‘White Paper’…?We have a very successful peer to peer cryptocurrency called Bitcoin that is working as a payment rail, the use case is very clear and it works with high availability and uptime. It is a censorship resistant solution and it has proven to be robust despite the nest efforts of China and Jamie Dimon to damage it. The trend continues, the believers believe and the doubters sell and lose out.We have a Blockchain, a decentralised computing breakthrough that supports Bitcoin which is the only smart contract operating at scale that really functions in a live production environment at scale thus far. Yes, Bitcoin is a smart contract…Then we have Ethereum that started with a crash and bump of the DAO and then Parity Multi-Sig got hacked, and this wallet software was used by the bulk of ICOs, proving they are not so safe. The reality of Ethereum is it remains bug ridden and the network often falls over. Ether is pumped by ICOs and they keep coming and accelerating, I predict there will be 5000 to 10000 of them and regulation will not stop them, albeit the second wave is approaching.The inevitability of the regulation has to be accepted. Is it a good thing or bad? But then think of it this way. Raising capital is part of a Capital Market activity, much of which falls within various banking laws and regulations. Whilst these are generally old and crappy and seek to protect the banks not the customer, they are there and the law is behind it. As a Libertarian I don’t have to agree, but I do accept we have to navigate with what is before us. And avoiding regulation, dodging the law and denying your token is a security is not the answer.Embracing regulation and working within in its framework, and much of it is a framework to interpretation will enable your ICO to be considered by institutional investors, sitting on trillions of dollars looking for decent returns. Any returns.""Are we seeing blissful ignorance on all sides, the entrepreneur and investors of what is really going on?""Although it is still in the early days for the new capital markets world of ICO fund raising, and yes there are some great projects, the issue I have is there are too many really bad ones that are getting funded and will end up hurting us all.It is in our collective interest to make sure we find the scammers and stop them. It is time to stop the poor ideas and weak concepts where the basic utility of the token doesn’t work for investor or the user. We have to stop people buying ‘crap coins’ and support great projects for you to put your crypto behind…Simply put, when it delivers for investors, when it delivers good for the people, for those less fortunate and the technology improves on what is already there, when it creates an entirely new ways of doing things and can open up new opportunities for social impact...In the past few weeks I have been exposed to some really Ugly ICO projects, where entrepreneurs are indeed deluded and focus on the money. While other projects are just Bad, where the team behind it thinks they have solved a business problem when in fact they have added complexity and haven’t improved or solved the underlying business problem. But there are the genuine Good ones where the genius design of the concept of the token shines through delivering a truly outstanding project that has the potential to be the next big thing, the crypto-unicorn, that can change business and human behaviour for all time…When I say UGLY I mean UGLY. So what are the signs the ICO might not be what it seems, Ugly means…when the project owners are putting Lipstick on the Pig…that’s when…Look, when the marketing is so slick, when everything looks amazing, you have to ask what are they hiding…?  As with a publicly traded company’s Annual Report, the first rule of thumb is always the thicker the report the more lies, and the more issues they are hiding. The more pictures, facts and charts and complex diagrams, suggesting the possibility of a cover up, or when the entire board are fat balding 50+ white men smiling into the camera, then it is often time to sell, before the whole thing comes crashing down.When you read the ICO project White Paper what is your first impression? Do you immediately think this is exciting I have to invest? Or are you not sure if you have understood it, even after reading it three or four times. Like where the tokenomics part suggests investors get a great deal but they can;t quite put their finger on what they are to get….  Is there that nagging thought that plays over in your head, and yet the pre sale seems to be selling like hot cakes…  Do you ask is it me, have I missed something, am I stupid, what have others understood that I have not…or do you think that everyone has forgotten their senses and bought the hype, fallen for the flashy marketing and you want no part of it.Remember crypto investors are mostly spending their gains and may not relate fiat value to the token they are buying….It is always worthwhile to dig a little deeper if it all seems too good to be true, and you know what this means. Over the top marketing can be a warning sign. Is the use of funds part vague and management seem to be receiving a disproportionate amount of tokens for themselves?  Are there provisions for investors, any protection whatsoever and how are the proceeds of the ICO to be handled? And don’t fall for Multi Sig argument because this is also not a strong solution and creates another set of issues.And then there are those investors that fall for the fake news and the fake people. Is someone pumping it? A famous Boxer maybe or girl that fellated her boyfriend on video. Ask yourself has the project been mentioned on TV (CNBC), or mentioned by a billionaire.Is it only popular because it is being pumped?  Then there are just Bad concepts where often a few geeks try to build something from scratch, to reinvent money, build a competitor to Bitcoin, tokenise everything of value, build a new economy and do all this from scratch… Really?  Just take a breath and consider this. A few twenty something guys who have never run a business before are going to build something that has never been done before!Not saying some won’t succeed but the odds are in my favour not yours or theirs. Most of these projects will remain vapourware projects and an endless journey of software releases until they simply run out of money or do another ICO…  Blockchain is about computer science and the application of this technology to create new business structures, but nothing is guaranteed.Projects are worse than Bad when the entrepreneurs are clueless, haven’t bothered to educate themselves on the basics of Cryptoland and think an ICO will deliver riches very quickly. A weak idea to start with is followed by a false belief they can launch a token with absolutely no money, no planning and limited knowledge of business on the basis of a White Paper that makes no sense. But they do exist and the real issue I have is some ICOs platforms will help them no matter what… They won't call them out, say no because they themselves will make money even on a poor concept.Not only are these clueless people dangerous, they need to be exited from the market. These projects often spend a large chunk of the White Paper and website trying to convince themselves and investors their token is not a security. They have statements in their documentation under “terms” that declare their profit/dividend sharing token isn’t a security because we say it isn’t. It is written in the terms and we are explaining our profit paying token isn’t a financial product and they are not launching any kind of investment fund, it’s a special token and its OK for all investors to buy.Other founders turn up with a concept of a product or service they have decided to put on the Blockchain, despite the fact it doesn’t need it, or benefit from having any decentralised ledger or data store. The token is invented to do something, but they can’t say what exactly. An Apps token, where investors get nothing? Oh cool, I will buy lots of them thanks?Others concepts want to create new platforms that instead of delivering transparency and fairness, end up building another centralised authority or actually add extra layers of bureaucracy, naively introducing a single point of failure.  Look, if you want to launch a token explain why? Explain how? I had one set of entrepreneurs say they were going to mine a new token, but hadn’t described or understood they needed to have an underlying Blockchain?And then there are the ones that are going to create a new cryptocurrency, reinvent Blockchain and create the first Blockchain unicorn, and do all this without a decent CTO or management team that has actually built something similar…They want to issue tokens to create their project, but have no concept of transactions or the need to store information that will pass across the Ethereum or another network, or that they will be required to fork the code and build out their own version of the truth. It is utter madness what some are claiming. The delusion and derision is scary, the ignorance worrying and then they argue with you…But then the average crypto investor doesn’t know or understand the tech, crypto or Blockchain and these entrepreneurs are reliant on this fact…and I don’t like it.But then I find the great projects, the ones that make me smile, and where I can’t stop thinking about them. And the real Good News is there are an increasingly larger number of great projects emerging that will start to drive out crap projects, where these projects are not only stronger in their concept, design and execution, but deliver extra aspects that include social impact, support for the people and create extraordinary consequences. And above all they have a chance to deliver for Investors!A great project is one that when you read the White Paper it is immediately clear what you get, what they are trying to achieve and more often than not they have a proof of concept, an existing business model they are tokenising and can show real substance. A strong management team, great advisors, a solid understanding of the underlying technology and yes, they are structuring an ICO properly – requiring a degree of investor disclosure, based in a sensible jurisdiction.Good projects are very clear of the tokens utility. They explain how you as an investor/holder can buy and sell, and where many have more than one token. A token that is a ramp for investors to join the project and a project or app token that is used (spent) to consume the product or services.If you’re going to invest or buy a coin, at least explain how it will (may) outperform holding BTC and ETH which I doubt many will ever do. So why would someone invest? What do you they get? What benefit will be delivered, to whom?The big problem on the horizon and not to many years away will be when lots of early ICOs don’t deliver and publically fail. What will happen to the price of Ether? The big ones who have raised $50m or $200m plus…with many who have the money have yet to deliver anything working.ETH is pumped by the single biggest Use Case, ICOs….Will some of these projects ever deliver?  Taking years to build software…they have no real customers, no income and keep building… Will it work… What are they hiding… When can we see something…In 2018 there is likely to be a massive spike in ICO activity, 5000 or 10000 new ICOs are expected and so the overall quality will matter hugely. There will be so much to choose from, projects where there are real customers and real revenues… It is time for the good money to follow good projects…I feel very uncomfortable that some ICO platforms take any project regardless… Other ICO platforms have an ICO to raise money for their ICO platform…?   I struggle with this and cannot understand why?  What are the motives of the ICO platform providers…? Yes we want to make money that goes without saying, and why some like Chainstarter, TokenHub, CoinList make it difficult for projects to get their ICO away, unless it is done properly…It concerns me there are now ICO platforms emerging weekly it seems…launched by teams that have no track record in Blockchain, let alone working on their own ICOs… This is another case for Good, Bad and Ugly as the first generation platforms that created the market will struggle in a new world of regulation, extra security and an Ethereum only approach that denies investors the chance to use other crypto currencies…and where a single receiving address and the use of multi sig creates many downstream issues and complexities for the ICO project…Don’t invest in stuff you don’t understand…and this is where the crowd generally sits.This stuff is computer science and it is complex…tokenomics don’t always work, and you don’t know until the concept is built and launched…Do your research…focus on the utility of the token. What you get, how it works, how price/value is maintained, how liquid will it become, are there platform inflation issues, is there an on/off ramp to fiat…Look at the ICO provider platform that support the project. Is it secure? Does it use a single address to receive funds (if so it can be hacked and you lose before things get going), does it pass compliance tests, can it handle AML/KYC and does it allow investors, the crowd and institutional.  Remember, remember, smart contracts are not smart, nor are they contracts an investor or the project owner can read."

The loss was discovered when the tokens were sent to an unauthorized Bitcoin address. According to the post, Tether is taking all possible action to prevent further disruption, saying:","“Yesterday, we discovered that funds were improperly removed from the Tether treasury wallet through malicious action by an external attacker. Tether integrators must take immediate action, as discussed below, to prevent further ecosystem disruption.”The site also says that all Tether wallet services have been suspended pending a thorough investigation of the cause of the hack. Further, Tether is releasing a new version of Omni Core via hard fork in order to prevent the attacker from moving funds into any other wallet. Tether is encouraging all users to immediately upgrade their Omni Core to the new, protected version. Tether will continue pursuing ways to reclaim the coins stranded by the hack.The team of Tether has reached out to major exchanges to ask them to blacklist the addresses involved in the attack, as indicated by this comment issued by Konstantin Gladych, the CEO of Changelly:""Tether team has warned Changelly, so we’ve immediately halted all USDT deposits and withdrawals. Currently, we are working with the largest crypto exchanges for thorough investigation of the hack issues. We’ve blacklisted the wallet address of frauds and now are waiting for the official update of the OMNI/Tether client.""The company assured its users that Tether issuances have not been impacted by the hack and that all functionality and tokens are backed by assets as normal. According to the post:“…all Tether tokens remain fully backed by assets in the Tether reserve. The only tokens that will not be redeemed are the ones that were stolen from Tether treasury yesterday. Those tokens will be returned to treasury once the Omni Layer protocol enhancements are in place.”These events come at a difficult time for Tether, as it has recently been under fire by some community members for its transparency policies.  Twitter has already provided a series of analyses, many of which are not positive. For example: (thread) So tracing the #Tether hack:

This was the Tether ""treasury"" *multi-sig* wallet that was hacked: https://t.co/MUm7QmKTwO

243,https://cointelegraph.com,"Dec 19, 2017","Digital Currency Dash Surges Past $1,000 Barrier to New High of $1,250",https://cointelegraph.com/news/digital-currency-dash-surges-past-1000-barrier-to-new-high-of-1250,"Dash breaks the four-digit barrier, becoming the second altcoin to do so, 
after Bitcoin Cash. 33904 Total views. 529 ...","Dec 19, 2017","This past weekend, Dash became the first digital currency without the word “Bitcoin” in its name to breach the $1,000 barrier. Dash began the year at $11.26, while its price at press time has now reached $1206, a 107-fold increase in just less than a year. In fact, even Ethereum’s tremendous surge is less than Dash’s gains, with Ethereum having seen 99-fold growth in 2017.","Governance has become a hot topic in the digital currency world following Bitcoin’s notorious blocksize debate. Dash allows owners of 1,000 DASH to create a special node called a masternode, and owners of masternodes receive a vote on the future direction of the currency. Masternode owners also get to vote on the allocation of Dash’s monthly budget.Ten percent of each block reward is reserved to fund projects that are approved by the masternode network. Such projects can take many forms, so long as they advance the Dash ecosystem in some way. Dash can therefore afford to hire a large team of developers while simultaneously undertaking projects like Alt36’s point-of-sale integration.At current values, Dash has a monthly budget of $8 mln (implying an annual budget of almost $100 mln). While Ethereum and several ICO projects have large warchests, no other cryptocurrency project has such a large recurring budget.Dash has also made news with its recent activation of 2 MB blocks. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dash is pursuing an on-chain scaling solution. While the two largest digital currencies are pursuing off-chain scaling solutions, Lightning Network and Raiden Network, respectively, Dash is endeavoring to keep all transaction data on its Blockchain.This is made possible because Dash’s masternodes - 4600 in total - each carry a full copy of the Blockchain and perform other services for the network. In compensation, each masternode is paid 45% of Dash’s block reward. At current Dash prices, this comes out to about $8,300 per month. Since masternodes receive such large rewards, masternode owners can afford quality VPS servers with high bandwidth and storage capacity.Eventually, founder Evan Duffield sees Dash moving to super-large blocks, possibly as large as 1 GB each. Such massive blocks would require masternodes to run on expensive, custom hardware and allow the network to support millions - or tens of millions - of users.Duffield writes:“Even Satoshi Nakamoto, founder of Bitcoin, seems to have simply assumed that advances in hardware and networking would solve the scalability problem for him. Dash is the first digital currency to come up with an answer to scalability that’s not based on technology that doesn’t yet, and might never, exist. Dash will be able to rival the likes of PayPal and VISA simply by using its existing infrastructure.”About a year ago, Duffield handed over leadership of the Core development team to current CEO Ryan Taylor. Duffield has since used his own Dash holdings to fund a new organization called Dash Labs, which is currently researching scaling and custom hardware solutions. Arizona State University is also doing research on how to improve the Dash network. Earlier this year the masternodes funded a large endowment to fund the university’s research.Despite calls from the community to use budget funds for something splashy like a Superbowl ad, the Core development team has been reluctant to over-promote the project. The team is currently working on the next iteration of Dash, called Dash Evolution. This new software is intended to make digital currency so easy that “your grandmother could use it.” Dash’s developers are aiming for a PayPal-like experience, something that’s simple and intuitive.Dash’s current roadmap calls for an early version of Evolution to be launched in the summer of 2018."
244,https://cointelegraph.com,"Sep 28, 2017",Why Ticketing Industry Needs Blockchain,https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-ticketing-industry-needs-blockchain,"TKT distribution. The tokens can be purchased with Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin 
Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum (ETH).","Sep 28, 2017","Time and again we keep experiencing one problem or the other with the current ticketing systems. At times, several people are sold the same tickets, other times bots buy all the tickets and nothing is left for actual attendees.","Not to forget the usual tickets touts and their markups. It’s getting more and more difficult for an everyday Joe to buy tickets online.The worst one is when you do manage to get the tickets, but for some reason, the event gets canceled, you never get your refund or have to write multiple emails in order to get your money back.To top it off, despite countless efforts to clean up ticket market, powerful software is available online to bypass the security systems of major ticketing companies. According to Ticketmaster, about 60 percent of the hottest tickets are bought by bots.A single broker, using a bot, purchased 1,012 tickets to a 2014 U2 concert at Madison Square Garden in under a minute, despite the venue limiting sales to four tickets per customer. By the end of the day, that same broker purchased 15,000 tickets.Even tickets for free events, like Pope Francis’s visit to New York in 2015, were gobbled up by bots and sold for thousands of dollars on secondary sites.Global sales of sports, concerts and theatre tickets online in 2016 alone were close to a whopping $30 bln. This market is expected to increase by 13 percent by 2021. But, as unfortunate as it is, the process of buying tickets to such events is everything but smooth.Crypto.tickets is here to revolutionize the way event ticketing ecosystem works by using Blockchain.Even though online ticketing systems have been around for years, a number of unsolved problems remain.Issues such as - tickets duplication, tickets to fake events, counterfeit tickets - are not unheard of in this industry. There is no way to validate the authenticity of a ticket, which allows rogues to sell same tickets to multiple customers.When this happens, only the first customer to arrive at the venue gets in; others are left unable to attend the event. It’s not just the consumers who suffer, but the organizer as well, who could have sold the tickets to people that ended up with fake tickets.Crypto.tickets makes sure the ticket you’re purchasing is unique and valid and safe from any fraud with the help of Blockchain - even if you buy them from the secondary market. They have a transparent history on issue, resale, and redemption on the entrance for all market players.Crypto.tickets allows users to purchase tickets through both TKT tokens and fiat money. However all the transactions within the platform are made in tokens. This is how all the tickets are protected from any fraud and scam. The architecture of the platform is such that it guarantees one ticket goes to one person (one wallet) only.As soon as the tickets are issued for sale, ticket touts and ‘bots’ buy all the tickets available in bulk from non-secure sellers in the first minutes and resell them exorbitant prices.This is one of the major problems in today’s ticketing market - many customers can’t afford overpriced tickets in secondary market, and as a result, organizers lose profits and valuable customers.Furthermore, Crypto.tickets allows organizers to set clear rules on dealing with the secondary market through the use of smart contracts. Such rules include whether or not tickets can go to secondary markets at all, what are the secondary sales commissions, and so on.It’s important to note that event organizers receive commission for the upsell, so smart contract is needed to make sure one ticket goes to one wallet.This process can be compared to how Olympic games ticketing system works. In order to buy any Olympic game ticket, you need to submit in your ID. In Crypto.tickets’ case, role of ID is played by personal wallet associated to the user. So in a nutshell, a ticket is equal to a token. The ticket can’t be cut into pieces or divided for anyone to fake it.To buy an event ticket, a spectator must check numerous websites, study ratings and availability, in order to get the best prices. There is no central database where the all the information can be checked in a simple and transparent manner. Tickets are still easy to forge, inconvenient to store and resell.Crypto.tickets is a backend platform, while Tickets.wallet - developed by the Crypto.tickets team - is the app or user interface that allows managing purchased tickets easily; from storing to transferring and reselling. It can also be used for selling tickets to secondary markets with sales rules decided by the seller - either fixed price or auction.The app helps buyers see all the ticket details at one place, as well as get access to unique content from various artists. When a ticket is purchased, a smart contract is sent by Crypto.tickets to a unique wallet, which can be accessed via ticket.wallet app itself.Ticket.wallet is also responsible for storing and sending TKT tokens, storage of Crypto.tickets, conversion of fiat currency into tokens, and vice-versa with the use of exchange gateway.Crypto.tickets is looking to raise $23 mln by issuing its own cryptocurrency (TKT) through Initial Coin Offering, corresponding to a widely accepted standard, ERC20. No coins are issued after the ICO.All operations within the Crypto.tickets ecosystem are executed with TKT token, from purchases to returning to voting. This ensures a high-security level and prevents any unauthorized human intervention in the processes.The tokens can be purchased with Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum (ETH).If $23 mln mark is reached, 914.869.281 TKT tokens will be issued. On the first two days of the ICO, the investors will get a 20 percent bonus to their tokens, 10 percent bonus on the third and fourth days, and five percent bonus on the next three days. On the rest of the days, the tokens will be sold with no bonuses.Here’s how TKT distribution will be:ICO investors: 68.86 percent, Private offer investors: 7.64 percent, Tickets Chain Growth Fund: three percent, Bounty: two percent, Tickets Cloud Team: 15 percent and Advisors: 3.5 percent.To learn more about the team behind Crypto.tickets and their roadmap, please read the white paper.Disclaimer.

interview from Speculative.Capital. #Cryptocurrencies · #Altcoin · 
#Bitcoin ...","Dec 25, 2017",Is it truly possible to harness energy from the human body to power cryptocurrency mining rigs?,"A Netherlands-based technology company, Speculative.Capital has pioneered a project that explores the possibility of harnessing energy from idle human subjects.To do so, the company created body suits that turn body heat into electricity from human subjects to power computers that are mining cryptocurrency.According to their website, 37 people were involved in the project. The concept is pretty simple, a subject lies down for a few hours while the body suit harnesses energy from their body heat.The technology is pretty nifty, as small thermoelectric generators harvest the temperature differential between the subject’s body temperature and the surrounding ambient temperature of the room. The electricity generated is then used to power mining rigs, that mined recently created cryptocurrencies that promised to create good future growth in value.In total, the subjects provided enough power for the computers to mine for 212 hours, that’s just over eight days, and they claim to have unlocked 16,594 coins during that time.The chosen cryptocurrencies were Vertcoin, StartCOIN, Dash, Lisk, Litecoin and Ethereum. Vertcoin and StartCOIN accounted for the majority of coins unlocked, while comparative crypto heavyweights Litecoin and Ethereum were the least mined coins - given the now-scaled difficulty to mine them.During that 212 hour period, the 37 subjects produced 127,210 milliwatts of power.If you have a Nvidia 1060 six GB graphics card in your computer, you can expect to get a hashrate of 19 MH/s at 80 watts when mining Ethereum - going with data from 1stminingrig.com.Going with CryptoCompare’s current calculations - you would only be able to mine 0.002487 of Ethereum a day and that is using all 127,210 milliwatts, which equals 127 watts, of the power harnessed by the bodysuits.While the idea is admirable, quirky and exciting, it seems like far too much effort for too little reward.However, projects such as these push the boundaries of technology and expand the limits of what the human body is capable of, and how we view and explore the way we harness and produce energy in the future.Whenever projects like these are undertaken and results are published, people are quick to debunk and belittle the work that has been done. While the project may not have produced nearly enough energy to mine extraordinary amounts of cryptocurrency, it is an alternative and green way of looking to power the miners needed to maintain the Blockchain.Speculative.Capital does make one wonder what other alternatives there are to power up mining rigs - especially for hobby miners at home.The easiest, and probably most accessible option is solar power - if you live somewhere sunny.Solar panels are easy to obtain and setup, although you will need an inverter and batteries to store their power. But given a steady a supply of sunlight, and you could easily produce enough energy to power a home-built mining rig.Going by these calculations on solarpowerrocks.com, an average solar panel will produce 250 watts in an hour. If you get four hours of full sun, your panel will generate 1,000 watts of energy - eight times as much produced by our friends in the Netherlands.At the end of the day, the efficiency of their chosen method matters not. What is imperative is that we look for cheaper and cleaner energy sources to power the power-hungry mining industry that continually verifies the Blockchain of cryptocurrencies.As it stands, the cumulative power consumption of mining operations worldwide use more power than a number of individual African countries,Blockchain and cryptocurrencies promise decentralized and anonymous transactional services to the common man - but we need to be conscious of the effect it has on power grids worldwide. If we can find better solutions - we should be using them.The likes of Speculative.Capital and other technology companies are blazing a new trail for the cryptocurrency space, and it will be a massive triumph if more miners look to alternative power sources in the future.At the time of publishing, Cointelegraph had not received a reply for an interview from Speculative.Capital."

Blockchain News · Business News · Technology News · Policy & ...","Oct 13, 2017","The post-ICO success of many tokens is dependent on whether, and how quickly, they can be added to exchanges. Tokens that previously traded only on informal over-the-counter markets can see big surges in price when listed on an exchange. Therefore, there is a great deal of pressure on the founders of ICO-funded projects to list their tokens on digital currency exchanges so as to increase the tokens’ value and provide investors with a potential exit. Yet there are a number of complexities in the process.","There are far too many tokens seeking to be listed, and there’s no way that any exchange can keep up with every new ICO. Exchanges must be somewhat selective in order to keep from being overwhelmed. They often have to do some work to successfully integrate a new token, and due diligence may also be required to ensure the tokens they list aren’t scams.To date, exchanges haven’t been very forthcoming about their criteria for listing new tokens. There are even rumors that some exchanges demand money in order to list a new token. Other exchanges are interested in factors like the token's daily volume, its market potential and its community.A project's community is one of the major factors that determine how successful its token will be in the marketplace. A number of exchanges have realized this and use it as part of the selection criteria for new tokens. The representative of one such exchange said:""Many people said ‘please add XXX’ but it's difficult to decide. So, we thought if a coin has lots of users, it might be a good one. [We] started a campaign…’'vote for your coin on Slack and we will consider this coin listing.'""She continues:""After that, one member on Slack suggested we should do a formal one on our official website. Every project we chose worked hard on the promotion for voting. We also got lots of fake vote reports on our social channels and emails. We have to prevent the fake votes as much as we can.”In order to deter fake votes, the exchange began charging a small fee per vote.As business entities, exchanges are clearly motivated by profit. But they can only make profit when they seek high quality coins to list. There needs to be a better coordination of the symbiotic relationship between exchanges and the cryptocurrencies they list.This could start by ensuring more openness in the coin listing selection process. The communication process also has to improve. There have been instances where project teams claim they have been warned by exchanges not to share ongoing listing discussions with their investors.The success of this relationship is crucial to aspects of the crypto economy. It is even more important now as more decentralized exchanges emerge. Also, the recent atomic swap experimentation between Litecoin and Decred hints at what is to come, and it’s likely not good for traditional exchanges. Such exchanges should liaise with the communities of the tokens they list in order to ensure their own long-term profitability."

These scammers create exclusive groups, in which they share information and organize attacks to make a profit off the losses suffered by unaware traders.","The phenomenon of pump-and-dump is not uncommon in other trading venues either, particularly stocks and equities markets. However, the strict regulations imposed on those markets make this sort of price manipulation illegal, as opposed to the unregulated crypto world. In fact, the recent pump and dump plans in the crypto sphere may be being coordinated by outside forces.The Russian app, Telegram, appears to be the main venue where the pump and dump schemes are being perpetrated. According to Business Insider, a number of channels within Telegram are designed specifically for just this sort of market manipulation. With names like PumpKing Community, Crypto4Pumps and We Pump, these communities provide a venue for scammers to attract participants who then help the price move.These channels offer information on specific coin pumps to those who subscribe and then encourage subscribers to buy in quickly. After the glut of buying and the resultant price increase, members reach out in other social media, encouraging further buying from unsuspecting victims. As the price continues to rise, the pumpers begin to sell, causing panic selling, and collapsing the price - the ‘dump.’- A message distributed in Telegram to advertise one of the pump and dump groupsThe victims are left holding the bag, and the coin value often ends lower than it did before the scam. The entire process is a scam from start to finish. With the SEC and other international regulating bodies coming on board, this phenomenon may be curtailed. However, for now, buyers should avoid such jumps unless underlying fundamentals provide reasons for the change."

Federico Pistono",https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-blockchain-revolution-is-going-to-make-global-economy-more-fair-federico-pistono,"I started programming when I was 12 or 13 and got into Blockchain around 
2011 when I read the Bitcoin whitepaper written by Satoshi.","Nov 16, 2017","Federico Pistono is a charismatic writer, entrepreneur, researcher, angel investor, TV presenter and public speaker who routinely tours around the world, lecturing on exponential technologies and their economic impact on society.","In 2012 Pistono wrote the book ""Robots Will Steal Your Job, But That's OK: How to Survive the Economic Collapse and be Happy,"" which became an international success. Recently he published another book, Startup Zero, to help his compatriots Italians get a better understanding of the startup culture.In addition, Federico has more than a decade of professional experience in different fields that vary from IT Management and human machine interaction to screenwriting and directing.We speak with Federico Pistono about his views on how Blockchain could really change the current global economic model that is unfair, how close we came to the AI ruling the world, and how could we find our place in the emerging paradigm.CG:  How did you get involved in the fintech industry?FP: Computers always fascinated me, and systems in general and just learning new things.I have a background in mathematics and computer science, so that was double spending and operating research, data structures, algorithms. Those were things that really interested me at the mathematical level. To then think that those principles could be applied for social change, it was kind of a love at first sight of blending these things together.I started programming when I was 12 or 13 and got into Blockchain around 2011 when I read the Bitcoin whitepaper written by Satoshi. At the time, I was very interested in the Byzantine general’s problem.  Then I was one of the first people to get into Ethereum and from then on it just grew more and more. Now I am leading the Blockchain theme at Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, which is this new tech that’s essentially a supersonic speed travel on a train.So you have an evacuated tube, you got a tube you suck out the air, you put a capsule inside with about 30 people, and then you have got magnetic levitation-passive magnetic levitation, it’s called Indutrack. And you can just move this thing at super high speed- supersonic so more than 1,200 km/h.CG:  What would you say about the relationship between AI and Blockchain?FP: Regarding AI and Blockchain, I would say one of the biggest issues probably is how we decide to structure the algorithm and the incentive mechanisms that we put into the system because, in the end, you get your reward.AI’s today and probably for the foreseeable future, are not really intelligent in any sort. They perform narrow tasks, and they optimize for specific things that we tell them to do, and so we don’t know really know how to give them the right constraints.If we just say ‘hey make profit,’ and ‘do this,’ they may find all sorts of ways around to perform that task very well to optimize for that factor.Now we have a system where there is a huge centralization of power, centralization of capital, centralization of risk, and in particular, the big players are de-risking everything by hedging the risk on the small guys particularly in developing countries.I think every time that you have a shift in technology or dramatic shift, you have the ability to change things by creating a new incentive structure, by changing the rules of the game. Right now that is that moment that seismic event that can change the incentive structure and the mechanisms underneath.The Blockchain is a way to do it distributively, securely and I think we can do great things, but they don’t come by themselves we have to actively pursue a specific goal and to agree on how to design these new systems.CG:  Are we ready for above-mentioned inventions or do we have to evolve further?FP: I think currently we are not ready for this change.Well, first of all, the technology isn’t ready. We haven’t figured out still so many things about Blockchain systems. We are still in the very very early stage of the protocols and of the mechanisms that we are building.I mean we don’t know how to scale, we don’t know how to do it securely, we don’t know how to do it fast enough. We really don’t have the game theory behind it; we don’t know how all these things are going to be put together.We don’t have the social infrastructure and the technological infrastructure.But it’s a feedback loop - it’s a system of systems, so by interacting with the system by allowing ourselves to make mistakes and to do it faster and faster we create resilience in the network. Where a single entity might die or go bust, the overall network captures some of that value, and then you can increase the value again, again and again.Hopefully, we can find something that’s not just resilient, but it’s anti-fragile so that by stressing the system it becomes stronger- something like your body.When you go to the gym, and you do exercise you actually stress your muscles and you break them apart and because you break them apart, they become stronger afterwards - so that’s an anti-fragile system.We should do that for the economic system, and also for decision-making and everything. Since we know that we are going to make mistakes- we should design a system that gets better as we make more mistakes because we learn from them, instead of just repeating the same shit over and over and not learning from it, which is mostly what has been happening recently.CG:  Tell us about your books...FP: I wrote a few books. First, one is called Robots Will Steal Your Job, But That’s OK. I wrote it six years ago. Kind of unsuspected time - I was told ‘I was a charlatan, I didn’t have a PhD in economics, I wasn’t a professor from MIT or Oxford, I should just stick to my computer science and not talk about these things, how little do you know.’Then, two to three years later, professors from MIT and Oxford have written the papers that say exactly the same things with exactly the same numbers, but using different methodologies, so they were kind of validating everything that I was saying.Thus I went from a charlatan to an oracle. It was kind of weird, but you know, same stuff just has caused different reactions from people.Then I wrote another book, a fiction book this time called “Tale of Two Futures.” It’s a short sci-fi. It shows two different paths we can take. One where things have taken the decentralized, open source model and a more sensible approach on how to use technology to better society and the other is this hyper-capitalistic narrowly focused, mindless, repetitive work that leads to a dystopian society.The third book I wrote was a book for Italians about how to build startups because in Italy no one knows how to build startups. Very few people know and the few people who do they leave the country and go elsewhere and they never tell anyone back in town.Now, they call startups everything, like if a pizzeria were a startup. No that’s not a startup- a startup is something else!So I wrote this most recent book that’s called Startup Zero.0. To kind of give the idea that we are not even step one we are at step zero, we should get the basics first and understand them. So I have been doing that a lot of that.I also have a TV show in Italy on national TV it’s called Codice, La vita è digitale, it means Code Life is Digital.We have had about two or three mln people watching it every week. First, it was just about Blockchain and Bitcoin. We went to BitFury, China, Japan, we interviewed Roger Ver; we had a bunch of people there. I think it was very well done the episode on Blockchain. We did one on IoT, smart cities, the cognitive revolution, artificial intelligence, robotics, synthetic biology, genetic engineering. We are bringing these emerging technologies to the wider audience.Also I am an angel investor. I invest in about 20 companies so far- mostly in Blockchain but also I am moving to the medical sector, things that I think will help humanity in one way or another.  I try to give my contribution in some way. Now I am spending most of my time doing Hyperloop.CG:  What does that mean “Blockchain Revolution?” How will it change the globe?FP: I think one of the biggest opportunities we have is to use autonomous agents to automate all things that should be automated, particularly in bureaucracy and in how systems interoperate.There is no reason why I should go ask a person to verify my identity or to stamp something and wait for months for a paper to come back or fax it somewhere, I mean some places still need a fax machine.A lot of this stuff is because you don’t trust the computer to verify that transaction or that information that is being conveyed. Now the Blockchain can solve that. Not only can it solve it, but it can solve it systematically, securely and for anybody.Also its censorship resistant - not just the government censoring information but also a company not releasing some of the data that maybe you should own. For example, from all the social networks the only one that gives you the contacts is LinkedIn.Everyone else doesn’t allow you to export the contacts. They are your contacts! Why shouldn’t you be allowed to have your own contacts and information about them? It’s crazy, but this happens!Think about all the corruption that happens throughout the world- trillions of dollar worth of value and hundreds of millions of people in distress who can be forced into doing things because they have no legal recourse. The Blockchain can help all these people.Before it helps the First World, it can help the long tail of the supply chain that’s now being held hostage by the owners of capital who have an unfair advantage in that game.They can be less efficient than them but still win just because they have access to cheap capital. That is really unfair. All the risk is on these people who have no power, no legal recourse and their lives are miserable because the game is tilted.The game is unfair. Blockchain can allow for that to change, but we need to actively pursue that goal because it will not come automatically by itself. I think that’s a moral responsibility that we have. I think we have to step up and take that responsibility."

It covers everything from Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to ICO regulation and investment analysis from industry leaders. Want to become our guest author and get published on Cointelegraph, please send us an email at mike@cointelegraph.com.","Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, recently attacked Bitcoin, going as far as calling it a ""fraud"" that will be ""shut down."" A lot has been written about his comments, so I will not go down this road. But it is true that cryptocurrencies, in general, suffer from a bad reputation from the public. This is mostly due to a lack of understanding of the mechanics of cryptocurrencies and the confusion between exchange hacks, which happened, and the robustness of the Blockchain itself, which cannot be hacked with existing technologies. But what if we looked at the world's most powerful currency with the same critical angle as that of the cryptocurrency opponents? What would the white paper of the US Dollar look like? Let's have a look.The US Dollar is the most widely accepted form of payment in the world. Its role as a reserve currency for central banks around the world has made it the undisputed #1 currency since World War II. You can travel to any place in the world and exchange your US Dollars for local currency. It is a great medium of exchange.Ever since the US abandoned the gold standard in 1971, the US Dollar has lost more than 80 percent of its value as measured by the loss of purchasing power caused by inflation. In the short term the US Dollar is very stable with a two to three percent annual inflation rate, but in the long term, it is guaranteed to lose most of its value.Image: Federal Reserve Bank of St. LouisUnlike for cryptocurrencies, no algorithm determines the pace at which new tokens, US Dollars, are created either electronically or by printing dollar bills. The creation of new tokens is at the sole discretion of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve. Since 2008, in response to the financial crisis, the Fed created $4,500 bln out of thin air with only one objective: buy US Government debt and other mortgage-backed securities. Since 2008, the M2 money supply of US Dollars--which comprises cash and deposits-- increased from $7,500 bln to $13,500 bln or a 92 percent increase.Just like any fiat currency, the US Dollar is not convertible into a fixed amount of gold like it used to be. It is backed by the ""faith and credit of the US Government,"" which has no meaning in monetary terms. It means the US Government will give you one US Dollar if you want to exchange one US Dollar. It is an ""I Owe You"" issued by the Federal Reserve that does not pay any interest, that never matures and whose value keeps being diluted by the creation of more and more US Dollars. The International Monetary Fund summarized it very well in a report published in January 2016.Image: Virtual Currencies and Beyond:Initial Considerations, IMF, January 2016Not everyone can have a US Dollar bank account. You either have to be an American or have the means to have a US Dollar bank account in your home country. In addition, all US Dollar transactions have to be cleared in the US. This way the US Government decides who is allowed to use US Dollars and who is not. BNP Paribas - France's largest bank - learned it the hard way when it was fined $8.9 bln in 2014 by the US Department of Justice for doing business with Sudan, Cuba and Iran in US Dollar while these countries were under US sanctions. Had the transactions been done in any other currency, BNP Paribas would have been fine, or at least with the US Department of Justice.For small transactions, merchants have to use an intermediary such as Visa or MasterCard that charge three to five percent of the transaction value. Wire transfers take days to clear unless you are ready to pay extra, in this case, it can take ""only"" one day.You only control the paper money that is in your physical wallet or under your mattress. The funds in your bank account are under the control of the banks. All you have is an ""I Owe You"" from the bank to you. You have to trust that the bank will give you your money back when you need it. If the bank goes bust, you lose your money. The US Government guarantees up to $250,000 of deposits per person per bank, but this mechanism is unfunded, so nobody knows if it would really work in the event of the collapse of a large commercial bank.There are more than 100 other fiat currencies in the world - Euro, Yen, Yuan but also Venezuelan Bolivar, Nigerian Naira, etc. Most of them have a horrendous track record, high to hyperinflation, and most have been replaced time after time when the previous currencies failed. Fiat currencies usually fail or lose more than 90 percent of their value within a generation or two. The US Dollar is an outlier as it has been around for more than a century and has lost only 82 percent of its value since 1971, which makes it one of the best performers among the rest of fiat currencies.If this was the white paper of a brand-new cryptocurrency, would you invest in it?*The views and interpretations in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of the World Bank and Cointelegraph."

The QASH Token Sale had 4,988 participants from 98 countries around the world. At the end of the sale on November 8th at 23:59PM SGT, the allocation of 350 million QASH (the equivalent of 350,000 ETH or USD105 million) was oversubscribed, making it one of the most successful blockchain fintech ICOs globally.","Given the ICO hype, it seems as if anyone with a white paper, a good idea and a team of advisors can launch an ICO. Many ICOs are funded at the very first stage of their life cycles which represents significant product development risk for token holders. As a result, studies show that most ICOs fail. This leads to overall fatigue from hyped-up ICOs that have seen the value of their tokens depressed post-listing.The outstanding success of the QASH Token Sale poses the question of what it would take for a company to win the trust of public investors and hold a successful ICO.QUOINE’s success in raising 350 million QASH with an oversubscribed placing over 3 days can be attributed to the following factors:1. The team at QUOINE is comprised of banking and finance veterans from global top tier investment banks.CEO and Co-founder Mike Kayamori has more than 20 years’ experience in investments, business management, IT and venture capital. Both CEO Mike Kayamori and Chief Financial Officer Katsuya Konno were from Softbank. Chief Technology Officer and Co-founder Mario Lozada came from Credit Suisse and Merrill Lynch. Chief Compliance Officer Ken Mazzio came from Merrill Lynch and Barclays. Chief Strategy Officer Ray Hennessey is a Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch veteran. Head of Operations Seth Melamed was also at Goldman Sachs for more than 10 years. Chief Trading Officer Andre Pemmelaar has experience in automated trading systems for more than 15 years.The combined financial and technical expertise of QUOINE team members stand behind the quality and security of QUOINE’s trading platforms and exchanges, which include QUOINEX, QRYPTOS and now QUOINE LIQUID. QUOINE LIQUID will be a revolutionary platform to solve one of the most crucial problems in the global utilization of cryptocurrencies, which is the lack of market liquidity in the crypto economy.2. QUOINE is the First Global Cryptocurrency FinTech Company to Receive A License from Japan Financial Services Agency As a leading global fintech company, QUOINE provides trading, exchange, and next generation financial services powered by blockchain technology. The company has been in existence for 3 and a half years with offices in 3 locations: Tokyo, Singapore and Vietnam. QUOINE  adopts a pro-regulation stance, as the team believes that regulatory compliance will help foster a safe, secure environment for cryptocurrencies to help shape the future of the financial services.3. The QUOINE LIQUID platform is the driving force behind the QASH Token Sale and leverages QUOINE’s international network of trusted fintech partners.The funds raised from the QASH Token Sale will strengthen the development of QUOINE LIQUID platform. The QUOINE LIQUID platform is a solution that will transform the crypto economy by providing liquidity, a much needed element across crypto markets. QUOINE’s mission to unite all major exchanges to one single QUOINE LIQUID platform attracted great interest from the crypto and traditional finance communities, that acknowledge the importance and urgency of liquidity in the crypto space. More powerful than any existing platform in the marketplace, QUOINE LIQUID features the World Book, a globally sourced trading platform and Prime Brokerage, a suite offering direct market access, fiat management, crypto/fiat credit facilities and real-time reporting.QUOINE has strong relationships with many of the world’s top financial institutions, Asia regulators, cryptocurrencies, exchanges, and fintech startups. Among these major partners include: Bitfinex, Dash, Binance, Blockwave, ZB.com, BW.com,EXX.com, and CEX.IO.With a proven team, proven platforms, and a pro-regulatory practice, QUOINE is partnering with cryptocurrency exchanges around the world to build a Global Liquidity Alliance, as part of the QUOINE LIQUID platform. By proactively developing long term partnerships with all major cryptocurrency exchanges and industry players, QUOINE is perfectly poised to bring about global liquidity for the crypto economy.The QASH Token Sale is only the beginning. After sufficient funds are raised, the QUOINE team will be working hard to develop the QUOINE LIQUID platform to meet the huge demand for liquidity in the crypto markets.Tentatively, QASH will be listed on QUOINEX, QRYPTOS and partnered exchanges by December 1st.Regarding the huge success of the QASH Token Sale, CEO and Co-founder Mike Kayamori commented: “I would like to thank everyone who participated in our QASH Token Sale. Our responsibilities are bigger now. We have a clear fiduciary responsibility now to our token holders. First, from the product development perspective, we have to deliver our product as promised. QUOINE LIQUID already has the core development, and now we are moving into refining the user experience. Second, we have to provide liquidity by making sure that besides QUOINEX, QRYPTOS and QUOINE LIQUID platforms, other exchanges will be listing our QASH tokens, that there will be price stability, and there is an upward appreciation to all token holders.

Now, after much anticipation, it is announcing the details of its ICO sale, which will begin on November 27th.","Bankera is building a revolutionary bank for the blockchain era, which will eventually become a one-stop store for all financial services. It is an operational fork of SpectroCoin, a cryptocurrency solution service with an existing base of 460,000 clients and has issued more than 64,000 cards. Since it has already developed a core infrastructure equivalent to traditional banks, a natural extension of the company is to leverage the existing technology to build Bankera.Bankera has built a team of over 50 talented professionals with diverse fields of expertise. Audrius Ziugzda, an expert banker, is the latest addition to company’s advisory board. He brings with him over 20 years of experience in the banking sector, mainly in the M&A, banking operations and strategic fields. He joins names such Lon Wong, president of the NEM.io foundation and Antanas Guoga, a member of the European Parliament.In order to operate in a spectrum of different fiat currencies and to facilitate cross-border transactions, Bankera will seek banking licenses in several key jurisdictions. This will help to lower the number of counterparties, resulting in reduced costs for the end consumer. It will also offer core banking services such as savings and loans accounts, as well as low-cost investment products such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and crypto funds etc. Through Bankera’s MVP, SpectroCoin, contributors and clients can already use its services including fiat and cryptocurrency wallets, exchange and payment processing services. They can also order cryptocurrency debit cards, which can be linked to Bitcoin, DASH or Ethereum wallets. Bankera’s business development strategy, led by Craig Grant, who formerly worked at the Paysafe Group and Currencycloud, continues to deliver innovative and unique results; The latest with release of the demo version of Bankera’s exchange platform and the ability for its users to claim International bank account numbers (IBAN).As the world of blockchain technology continues to grow and diversify, Bankera realised that they needed a viable product that would address the needs of all of its users. SpectroCoin’s focus has been on giving its users a platform to purchase, sell and trade Cryptocurrency. However, its main focus has been on Cryptocurrency as a payment option, which has therefore led to a solution tailored for that in regards of user experience, interface and cost structure. As trading becomes more widespread, Bankera continues to adapt to the always-changing market. As such, they have developed an in house, cost-effective exchange platform that will give its users the ability to trade at a most lower cost. Bankera’s exchange will support most of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, DASH, Ethereum, NEM, Litecoin to name but a few as well as ERC20 and NEM mosaic tokens. The company will be working closely with ICO contributors and cryptocurrency users throughout the project development, since it aims to develop a product that fits the needs of the community.Bankera recently completed a fundraising round which offered Banker (BNK) tokens in order to raise funds for the project. Its successful pre-ICO sold 2.5 billion tokens (worth over 25 million Euros) in just three works, which has determined the ICO initial token price, which will start at 0.017 EUR per BNK. During the ICO, 30% of the tokens will be available to the public on SpectroCoin. ICO contributors will be able to choose from more than 20 payment methods when to purchase their BNK tokens. These include a variety of cryptocurrencies, such as ETH, BTC, DASH and XEM, and fiat currencies like EUR, GBP, and USD.During the ICO, Bankera will continue to offer a weekly net transactional revenue share for all token holders. After the ICO, the company aims to obtain a banking license and transition to a fully operational banking service for both, fiat and cryptocurrencies.Company name: BankeraCompany site: https://bankera.com/Company contacts: Sv.

Adoption. Related News. Is US Environmental Tax Policy Hindering ...","Oct 28, 2017","Ethereum Name Service (ENS) launched on mainnet on May 4, 2017. At launch, ENS featured an automated registrar process allowing anyone to easily and cheaply register names ending in "".eth"" using an auction process.","The auction system enabled anyone to purchase a .eth addresses of at least seven characters in length. Since its launch over 618,000 auctions have been started, and 3,298,707 ETH have been deposited for bids. The ENS is evolving, and within the next two years, a planned upgrade will allow for auctions of shorter names less than seven characters.The Ethereum Name Service brings readable Ether addresses to the public. This is a key step towards cryptocurrency mass adoption. Normal Ether addresses are 42 digits long and can be very confusing for beginners. ENS enables anyone to create a much more user friendly address like for example JohnDoe.eth.Since many Ethereum names are being purchased at ENS auction, new owners of .eth names have been seeking efficient tools enabling them to transfer ownership of their newly acquired .eth names to second hand purchasers.As some Ethereum names are very valuable, an escrow service for transfer of title to these names has been important, but no such service has existed. Buyers and sellers seeking to transfer ownership have been required to rely on trust, custom smart contracts, or legal contracts provided by attorneys.  Over the past six months since the launch of the ENS, individual .eth names have auctioned for astronomical sums. Some of the more expensive .eth names have included exchange.eth claimed for 6,660 ETH ($609,000), foundation.eth went for 300 ETH ($27,000), and weather.eth was auctioned for 101 ETH ($9,000).Many of the .eth address purchases are made with the intent to resell or squat the name in order to seek profit from its resale at a much higher price to subsequent purchasers in what many speculators anticipate will be a thriving second hand market for .eth addresses. Furthermore, there’s been some criticism raised that the ENS system in its current form encourages .eth address name squatting.In any event, there has been no shortage in speculators seeking to profit from what many see as a modern version of the pets.com domain name controversy from the early 2000’s during the initial Internet bubble boom.Name Bazaar, the first public ENS marketplace, recently launched its service. This platform provides an alternative way to transfer ownership of .eth addresses, enabling Ethereum address holders to easily transfer ownership of Ethereum names using a completely trustless smart contract based interface.This allows for a much more streamlined way for .eth address buyers and sellers to decrease transaction costs involved in the sale and transfer of ownership of .eth addresses. All that’s required to transfer ownership is an Ethereum address through the MetaMask or Parity browser extensions.Alternatively, ENS domains can also be traded at the /r/ENSMarket subreddit. At the time of writing, it has over 300 subscribers and several hundred posts of people aiming to sell ENS domains.Currently there are over 2900 DNS domain registrars all around the globe, which is the protocol for standard web addresses we use in our daily life.As the Ethereum adoption rate keeps increasing, there’ll soon probably also exist a much greater pool of ENS domain registrars."

More than 13 000 transactions were made. It’s a tremendous result, that highlights the level of interest and confidence in the concept and suggests a bright future for the project.","BitClave aims to totally change the way people use search engines and deal with advertisements. Its decentralized network allows users to decide who gets access to their personal data, and receive tokens as payment for sharing it. This way, the only advertisements users see are from companies they want to hear from, and the advertisers themselves benefit from an audience that is already interested in buying.It’s a shift away from the traditional method of simply gathering huge pools of user data from social media sites and search engines and using this to influence more general ads – an arrangement that’s been annoying for users and inefficient for advertisers.In the pre-sale BitClave had already raised an impressive $22 million of the $25.5 million hard cap, with over 64,000 registered users. In the sale itself, BitClave distributed 550,842,000 CAT tokens, out of a total supply of 2 billion. The remaining unsold tokens will be allocated to a special account and will be locked long term.BitClave’s success is just the latest story in a long sequence of exciting ICO launches recently.“This is a spectacular result would not have been possible without the support we’ve had from our community and followers. We’re incredibly grateful for this network we have. The token sale is only the beginning of the journey. For the next step, we are going to hit the market with a first mass solution and clearly demonstrate the usefulness of the system. You can expect announcements such as open source SDK releases, commercial partnership, and community grants all aimed at bootstrapping and growing the network. Stay tuned!”, - said BitClave's founder and CEO Alex Bessonov.BitClave uses blockchain to eliminate ad service middleman. The company’s objective is to create a direct connection between businesses and customers. BitClave is building a decentralized search engine that helps users search for items without losing control of their own personal information. Users also get compensated every time they click on search results for products and services from their favorite brands. The process makes third-party advertising networks unnecessary.

more ...","Oct 21, 2017","Digital currencies may solve some the legal cannabis industry’s woes by becoming an alternative to cash payments. Despite recent state-level ballot initiatives across the US that legalizes marijuana in one form or another, the drug still remains illegal at the federal level. While it’s unlikely the feds are going to go after legal cannabis dispensaries any time soon, the legal murkiness does create one serious problem.","Banks won’t deal with cannabis dispensaries.Consider the ramifications. No banking means no payment processing, which means customers can’t use credit or debit cards to make purchases. According to a 2016 survey, 75 percent of customers prefer to pay with credit or debit cards, with only 11 percent preferring to pay with cash.Unfortunately, dispensaries can’t give customers what they want - payment methods other than cash - because banks won’t do business with them. Consequently, the customer is inconvenienced and the merchant loses potential sales.A lack of banking causes even more serious problems. Since the industry is forced to accept only cash for payments, marijuana dispensaries are an excellent target for robbers and thieves due to the large amount of cash they keep on premises.There’s still a larger problem than that, which is perhaps the biggest of all: dispensaries have great difficulty paying their expenses. Utilities, tax assessors and vendors would much rather not be paid in cash, and some vendors may not even accept cash payments.The cost of protecting large sums of cash is prohibitive. The need for armored cars, safes and guards depletes the bottom line. It’s been estimated that cash handling expenses can amount to 10-15 percent of sales.Seeing an opportunity to gain access to a $6.7 bln market, the digital currency Dash partnered with Alt Thirty Six in April 2017. The Dash network, through its decentralized self-funding mechanism, is paying the company $496,000 to integrate Dash as a payment option in the cannabis industry’s point of sale (POS) systems. The vendor also has skin in the game, having spent nearly $700,000 of their own money developing the POS platform.As part of this arrangement, Dash will be the only digital currency offered by the point of sale platform. According to the budget proposal submitted to the Dash network:“We have three major verticals identified and solidified reseller partnerships that will adopt the Alt Thirty Six + Dash payment solutions:The vendor has been making monthly progress reports to the Dash community and work continues apace. The platform’s initial release is scheduled for December of this year.The road to mainstream adoption of digital currency has to begin somewhere, and perhaps no other industry needs cryptocurrency as much as this one. Many have suggested that digital currencies could gain adoption by saving vendors money on credit card fees, and this is certainly possible. But such fees usually amount to no more than three percent.With the legal marijuana industry, Dash has the potential to save merchants up to 15 percent, which would be a massive boon to their bottom line. Dash is suitable for point of sale use because of its InstantSend feature. Transactions sent via InstantSend are fully confirmed and irreversible in four seconds. Bitcoin transactions, by comparison, usually aren’t considered fully “settled” until six confirmations are received, which can take an hour or more."

Perhaps you’ve tried to withdraw money someone has sent to you, only to find that you’ve been blocked from that service. Or maybe you’ve tried to receive money, only to discover that the fees can be pretty steep once you start using other services. And, the greatest sin of all - PayPal doesn’t accept cryptocurrencies.","UTRUST, the first-of-its-kind Blockchain based payment platform, intends to bring the best parts of PayPal-type services and the best parts of the cryptocurrency world together into a single, seamless platform.The cryptocurrency world has virtually exploded in the past six months. Just ask someone who purchased Bitcoin in January at $800, only to find their investment worth a stunning $6,000 just last month. And yet the growth of the industry has outstripped the functionality.For example, payments between individuals are still quite simple, but the reality of making real-time business to consumer (B2C) transactions has been extremely difficult.A number of problems lie at the root of the dysfunctionality. First, the daily price for the majority of cryptocurrencies is extremely volatile. The volatility frightens would-be merchant users who find themselves unable to cope with the potential for a huge and sudden loss right after a transaction completes.What’s more, the sheer number of cryptocurrencies available for use has left most merchants scratching their heads at the level of tech needed to really enter the market. And to top it all off, transactions are irreversible, making all sales final and returns hugely risky for both parties. Buyer protection is moot, and seller protection is as well.Of course, these two opposite systems (crypto and traditional) refuse to work together, and so only serve to highlight the inherent weaknesses in both.  However, UTRUST, a Blockchain-based startup, has conceived of a system that would unite these two systems into a single protective platform.On the buyer side, UTRUST is offering complete buyer protection, not unlike the PayPal marketplace. By providing protection, buyers can purchase without the customary crypto-risk, bringing more buyers into the crypto world. And by accepting a wide swath of various cryptocurrencies, UTRUST has taken the guesswork out of wallet and coin swaps letting buyers focus on what they do best - buying.Likewise for sellers, UTRUST has created a platform that eliminates volatility issues by moving the crypto payment into fiat currency at the moment of the transaction. Merchants can be completely shielded from volatility and because UTRUST is truly peer-to-peer, fees are substantially reduced. Per Nuno Correia, the company CEO:‘’UTRUST is the first cryptocurrency payment solution in the world that provides buyers with a purchase protection. The next-gen version of PayPal is Blockchain-based and designed to make online payments safer, faster and cheaper.’’As Hamlet made clear so many times, the very thing that makes you successful becomes your undoing. This will likely be the case with PayPal. While their functionality was unique in the early days the changing economic world has moved toward new and better platforms.By thoroughly eliminating risk factors for both buyer and seller while still opening the door for cryptocurrency payment structures, UTRUST aims to solve the issues that plague both platforms. A comprehensive explanation of their platform can be found here.The UTRUST token ICO starts Nov. 2 at 2 p.m. (UTC). The ingenious platform has brought investors to the table already and UTRUST has completely sold out the private investor and pre-ICO sales, raising $3.5 mln. The coming public sale represents 70 percent of the token supply.Disclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

While this is an enormous amount of money to raise in an incredibly short period of time, it’s somewhat unsurprising considering demand. The company asserts that the issue was massively oversubscribed, with 20,000 people registered to participate, seeking to buy $361 mln worth of tokens.","The company reduced the number to a more manageable level, according to its press release, by:“[Screening] all applicants using layers of algorithms, in addition to manual review, to comply with global KYC/AML regulations. This reduced the pool of contributors to 5,000, but also set a new standard for fundraising via Blockchain with respect to global legislation.” SingularityNET aims to create a decentralized marketplace of AIs, where each AI can interact with one another (and pay one another) as needed to solve customers’ problems. Founder Ben Goertzel gave an example:“If you need a document summarized, as a user you can put a request into SingularityNet...You may get bids from twenty different document summary nodes...and you may choose one with the right balance of reputation and price.But now that document summary node if it hits something in the document it can’t deal with, it can outsource that...if the document summary node that you’re paying...hits an embedded video it can outsource that to a video summarizing node and it can then pay it some fraction of the money it was paid. Or, if it sees a quote in Russian...it can outsource that ...to a Russian to English translation node that can do that translation, then send it back to the document summary node.”Artificial intelligence and machine learning are hot trends in computing these days, but are largely controlled by massive corporations. These corporate titans develop their own proprietary systems and software and keep it in-house. SingularityNET intends to decentralize this heavily centralized field, allowing developers of AI tools to monetize them and non-corporate users to benefit from them.As with any new venture, it remains to be seen whether this is even possible, or whether behemoths like Google will forever dominate the field of AI. One thing is certain - there is plenty of interest in decentralized AI systems. SingularityNET’s token sale could not make that any more clear. Just like the Nicholas Cage movie, these tokens were “gone in sixty seconds.”"
