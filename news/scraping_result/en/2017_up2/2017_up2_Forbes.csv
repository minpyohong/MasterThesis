In fact if you had invested just $1,000 in Bitcoin the year it was first publicly available, you would now be richer to the tune of £36.7 million.Photo by Chesnot/Getty ImagesThose who don’t learn from history are doomed to repeat its mistakes – so here is a brief history of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.1998 – 2009 The pre-Bitcoin yearsAlthough Bitcoin was the first established cryptocurrency, there had been previous attempts at creating online currencies with ledgers secured by encryption. Two examples of these were B-Money and Bit Gold, which were formulated but never fully developed.2008 – The Mysterious Mr NakamotoA paper called Bitcoin – A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System was posted to a mailing list discussion on cryptography. It was posted by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, whose real identity remains a mystery to this day.2009 – Bitcoin beginsThe Bitcoin software is made available to the public for the first time and mining – the process through which new Bitcoins are created and transactions are recorded and verified on the blockchain – begins.2010 – Bitcoin is valued for the first timeAs it had never been traded, only mined, it was impossible to assign a monetary value to the units of the emerging cryptocurrency. In 2010, someone decided to sell theirs for the first time – swapping 10,000 of them for two pizzas. If the buyer had hung onto those Bitcoins, at today’s prices they would be worth more than $100 million.2011 – Rival cryptocurrencies emergeAs Bitcoin increases in popularity and the idea of decentralized and encrypted currencies catch on, the first alternative cryptocurrencies appear. These are sometimes known as altcoin and generally try to improve on the original Bitcoin design by offering greater speed, anonymity or some other advantage. Among the first to emerge were Namecoin and Litecoin. Currently there are over 1,000 cryptocurrencies in circulation with new ones frequently appearing.2013 – Bitcoin price crashes. Shortly after the price of one Bitcoin reaches $1,000 for the first time, the price quickly begins to decline. Many who invested money at this point will have suffered losses as the price plummeted to around $300 – it would be more than two years before it reached $1,000 again.2014 – Scams and theftPerhaps unsurprisingly for a currency designed with anonymity and lack of control in mind, Bitcoin has proven to be an attractive and lucrative target for criminals. In January 2014, the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox went offline, and the owners of 850,000Bitcoins never saw them again. Investigations are still trying to get to the bottom of exactly what happened but whatever the story, someone dishonestly got their hands on a haul which at the time was valued at $450 million dollars. At today’s prices, those missing coins would be worth $4.4 billion.2016 – Ethereum and ICOs. One cryptocurrency came close to stealing Bitcoin’s thunder this year, as enthusiasm grew around the Ethereum platform. This platform uses cryptocurrency known as Ether to facilitate blockchain-based smart contracts and apps.  Ethereum’s arrival was marked by the emergence of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). These are fundraising platforms which offer investors the chance to trade what are often essentially stocks or shares in startup ventures, in the same manner that they can invest and trade cryptocurrencies. In the US the SEC warned investors that due to the lack of oversight ICOs could easily be scams or ponzi schemes disguised as legitimate investments. The Chinese government went one further, by banning them outright.2017 –Bitcoin reaches $10,000 and continues to growA gradual increase in the places where Bitcoin could be spent contributed to its continued growth in popularity, during a period where it’s value remained below previous peaks. Gradually as more and more uses emerged, it became clear that more money was flowing into the Bitcoin and cryptocoin ecosystem. During this period the market cap of all cryptocoins rose from $11bn to its current height of over $300bn. Banks including Barclays, Citi Bank, Deutsche Bankand BNP Paribas have said they are investigating ways they might be able to work with Bitcoin. Meanwhile the technology behind Bitcoin – blockchain – has sparked a revolution in the fintech industry (and beyond) which is only just getting started.Whatever your opinion on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency – and educated commenters have described them as everything from the future of money to an outright scam – it seems they are here to stay. Will it succeed in doing what many early adopters and evangelists claim it is destined to – replace government-controlled, centralised money with a distributed and decentralized alternative, controlled by nothing besides market forces? Well, 2018 may yield some clues but we are unlikely to know the answer for some time yet."

[+] October 23, 2017 in London, England. Cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Lightcoin have seen unprecedented growth in 2017, despite remaining extremely volatile. While digital currencies across the board have divided opinion between financial institutions, and now have a market cap of around 175 Billion USD, the crypto sector coninues to grow, as it sees wider mainstreem adoption. (Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)","For a digital asset that began its life in 2009 and began the year trading around $1,000, the fact that Bitcoin is set to break the $10,000 ceiling is certainly impressive. Other than the many celebrations that will surely follow this milestone, interspersed with a mix of investor remorse or Casandra’s calling this the digital twin of Tulip Mania, many questions remain about the advantages and disadvantages of digital assets. Crypto numismatists who have been collecting Bitcoins are surely happy these days.Investors and early adopters like these assets because they are untethered from the regular economy where fiat currencies, more traditional forms of exchange and value transfer reign the day. It is not without a sense of irony that part of Bitcoin’s rapid ascent this year is owed to the fact that traditional economy players are now paying close attention to this asset class. While some of this attention remains negative, profoundly confused or ambivalent, such as China and South Korea banning initial coin offerings (ICOs), along with ongoing attempts to regulate a fundamentally decentralized platform. Add to these negative views Jamie Dimon’s full-throated attack on Bitcoin including the threat of terminating any JP Morgan employee caught trading in the digital asset, and the unwelcome news levied against digital assets continues to mount. With each puff of hot air, however, as if in open revolt to traditional economic order, Bitcoin continues to defy the odds taking investors to stratospheric heights where the air begins to thin and bubbles traditionally deflate.And yet the appreciation in Bitcoin’s value is buoyed in no small measure by serious institutions, like the CME Group, which is going long on the digital asset class. CME’s announcement that they will soon offer futures trading on Bitcoin marks a serious development and coming of age for digital assets. Herein lies the irony for an asset that is completely untethered and ungoverned by traditionally centralized structures. The fact that Bitcoin is gaining its greatest appreciation the more it plugs into the traditional economy, says a lot about its strengths, weaknesses and limitations. Against this backdrop, questions remain as to whether Bitcoin is an asset, currency or a collectible. Perhaps more permanently, 2017 may very well mark the year when digital assets, in the otherwise fleeting world of investor interest, gained their permanence.One of the principal advantages of digital assets is the fact that they are largely uncorrelated to the market. This creates an interesting opportunity for investment diversification, with the caveat that these instruments are not readily liquid, and their convertibility is far from universal. An additional advantage is the high volatility, which counterintuitively results in more aggressive risk-reward trade-offs in investment portfolios.  Bitcoin’s implied volatility, higher than any other asset class, is the stuff roller coaster rides are made of and may make even seasoned high-speed traders flinch. Similarly, the relatively low barrier to entry, when compared to more sophisticated asset classes, which require heavier purchasing power because they are much harder to fractionalize, makes digital assets compelling for their ability to democratize asset ownership and wealth creation. All of this, however, presupposes that they are tethered to the real economy and transferable in many more ways than they are currently. For example, an announcement that Amazon will accept Bitcoin as a form of payment (which requires more stable valuation) would go a long way in legitimizing this asset as a currency. The fact that it needs legitimacy at all in the eyes of its staunchest proponents is something of an insult to the genius that underpins this innovation, which is its scarcity by design with no more than 21 million Bitcoins to be digitally minted.The disadvantages of this asset class are the fact that they are all digitally correlated and subject to high degrees of individual and group social engineering. For example, a great deal of the theft or loss of digital assets typically results from people locking themselves out of their digital wallets, losing their encrypted keys (or access) or people gaining unwanted access, after which point the assets are easily transferred and hard to track down. In short, like so many cyber threats, the loss or theft of digital assets often lies between the keyboard and the chair. This type of theft or mysterious disappearance and the fact that no regulatory regime or risk transfer mechanism currently exists to systemically offset this risk is one of the principal deterrents to broadening the adoption of digital currencies. A digital equivalent of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which universally protects depositors and shores up the banking system from 1930-style bank runs, would help build trust in digital assets. For this reason, many established financial institutions and a growing number of insurers are turning their attention to Blockchain, the distributed ledger that underpins Bitcoin’s rise to prominence. For many, Blockchain is the killer app and Bitcoin is the first major use case of this foundational technology. Neither Blockchain nor Bitcoin are free of negative externalities or limitations.While it appears Bitcoin is winning the standards war on which digital asset will rule the day, this despite internecine fighting, a standards war continues to rage on digital assets and their utility. Herein lies the domain of a great deal of experimentation and value creation, where CME’s move to offer futures trading is but one example of how virtual assets are meeting the real world. The more traditional players and crypto enthusiasts push the bounds of interoperability, the more it seems Bitcoin’s implied value will rise. Contrary to popular belief that Bitcoin and its users thrive in the shadows, some entrepreneurs in this space, like Gabriel Abed, a Barbadian tech entrepreneur and co-founder of Bitt, are rushing to work with central banks. This move will help bridge the technological divide and the need for legitimacy, oversight and, perhaps most importantly, interoperability between digital assets and the real world. As these enduring linkages are formed, it is reasonable to expect the world of low-friction value transfer will create a new economic order while minting a few Blockchain Billionaires along the way."

Shutterstock,"While Bitc0in investing can be intimidating for those just getting their feet wet, there are several tips that newcomers can use to maximize their chances of success.By following the top five tips listed below, investors can boost their chances of meeting their goals.1) Do Your HomeworkFirst and foremost, investors just getting started with Bitcoin need to do their homework.""The more you understand the better off will be,"" stated Pawel Kuskowski, CEO & co-founder of Coinfirm, a blockchain and regulatory technology firm.He emphasized that ""bitcoin offers a unique and rare opportunity, but needs to be treated accordingly."" As a result, more than one expert encouraged newcomers to dive into Bitcoin's underlying technology.""If you have any technical bent whatsoever, take 10 minutes to leaf through the original 2008 Satoshi white paper,"" stated crypto fund manager Jacob Eliosoff. ""It's only 8 pages, legible and an inspiring work of genius!"" [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]Lucas Geiger, founder and CEO of Wireline, offered similar guidance, stating that investors should be sure to have a strong grasp of the blockchain, the distributed ledger system that underlies all digital currencies. ""This may seem obvious, but I think the first thing is take time to understand the blockchain,"" said Geiger. ""I say this strongly, because few people will do this."" ""If you don't have a high level understanding of how a blockchain stores secure data (such as coins), then you are investing in the equivalent of tulip bulbs,"" he added. Since learning about Bitcoin can take time, newer investors might benefit significantly from working with a mentor, emphasized Adam Nestler, CEO of Kudos, a decentralized protocol for building a fair service economy. ""Find a trusted person or resource that you can engage with to ask questions in order to understand the nuances of your investment in a safe environment,"" he said. Be careful when investing in digital currencies. Shutterstock2) Proceed With CautionRisk is inherent to investment, and investors should keep in mind that digital currency is in a very early stage of development when compared to similar asset markets like the stock or bond markets.""This is still an extremely high-risk space,"" emphasized Eliosoff. ""Don't invest money you can't afford to lose!"" While these considerations can be quite helpful, some experts provided more specific guidance.""Start small, and invest a small portion of your capital,"" suggested Marshall Swatt, a serial entrepreneur. Tim Enneking, managing director of Crypto Asset Management, offered tips for entering positions. ""Don’t chase Bitcoin prices. Decide on a entry point and stick with it,"" he said. ""With Bitcoin, you’re almost always right in terms of foreseeable price action – it’s your timing that might be off. So, be patient, and let the Bitcoin price come to you."" Once Bitcoin has reached the right price, Enneking suggested that investors refrain from buying their Bitcoin all at once. Instead, they should ""stage in and stage out,"" meaning they should invest a little at a time, wait for a bit, and then invest some more.Effective diversification can prove highly beneficial. Shutterstock3) Diversify EffectivelyOver the last several years, Bitcoin has produced some very impressive gains, and media outlets have developed a steady stream of stories about ""Bitcoin millionaires.""While these stories might tempt an investor to put all their money in Bitcoin, keep in mind that no investment professional would advise an individual to put all their eggs in one basket.When creating a diversified portfolio, investors could consider altcoins, more traditional assets such as stocks and bonds, or both.The basic idea behind diversification is creating a portfolio where a decline in one component will correspond with an equal gain in another.For example, let's say an investor has a simple portfolio, consisting of equal amounts of Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, Ripple and Bitcoin Cash.If one digital currency falls 10%, then ideally, another digital asset will rise by the same amount.Oliver Isaacs, a tech entrepreneur, emphasized that if an investor set up a diversified crypto portfolio and Bitcoin's price suddenly fell to $0, they would still be able to invest because their altcoins would still have value.""Hedge Against Volatility and don’t put all of your eggs in one basket,"" he stated. ""Much like investing in  the stock market or FX, you should diversify your funds as a risk management technique."" When picking out altcoins to incorporate into portfolios, investors need to be careful, emphasized Robin Bloor, senior VP of strategy & communications for software provider Algebraix Data.""There are a vast number of other active cryptocurrencies (hundreds),"" he noted. ""Remember that most of them can be thought of as start-ups and most start-ups fail.As a result, conducting thorough due diligence is crucial, stressed Bloor.""You need to research the business model in detail for any coin or token you are considering and then carry out due diligence - in terms of current funding, pedigree of the leadership team, original technology, marketing plans, product plans, product maturity and so on,"" he stated.Wallets can be a very safe place to hold your digital tokens. Shutterstock4) Keep Your Coins In WalletsWhile exchanges are a great place to purchase digital currencies, they may not be the best place to hold such assets.""Don't store coins on an exchange,"" emphasized Eliosoff. ""In Bitcoin's short history many, many exchanges have gotten hacked,"" he noted. ""It's fine to buy on an exchange like  Coinbase, but then move your coins into an online wallet like https://blockchain.info/wallet/, a mobile wallet like Jaxx or Coinomi, or create a paper wallet - all free and pretty easy,"" said Eliosoff. Investors can take further action to manage risk by using both hot wallets (online) and cold wallets (offline), emphasized Matthew Unger, founder and CEO of iComply Investor Services inc.""Just like you keep some cash in your wallet, some in your bank account and perhaps the really valuable stuff in a safe, you need to manage digital currencies in the same way,"" he stated.Volatility is very common in the crypto markets. Shutterstock5) Prepare For VolatilityThe digital currency markets are notoriously volatile, and there are several strategies that investors can use to manage the inevitable price fluctuations.One strategy, diversification, is covered earlier in the article.Another strategy, buy and hold, has been advocated by a great many financial gurus, including legendary investor Warren Buffett.""Buy-&-forget is the right strategy for most investors,"" stated Eliosoff. ""Resist the temptation to make short-term bets, to 'sell at the top', to get in at the cheapest price,"" he said. ""Most people who try this stuff underperform simple buy-&-hold."" Gavin Yeung, founder and CEO of digital asset management firm Cryptomover, offered a similar point of view.""We at Cryptomover believes that a passive investment style will outperform active strategies in the long term,"" he stated. ""Not only is passive investing inexpensive and simple, it also lowers trading fees leading to much lower operating expenses.""Disclosure: I own some Bitcoin and Ether."

(Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images)It's here that I'm reminded of something Warren Buffett's often said. Price is what you pay, value is what you get.So what value does a Bitcoin buyer get in exchange for $10,790.58 of his or her hard earned U.S. dollars? That's what I'm going to attempt to answer in this article.Before we can attempt to value Bitcoin, we first must agree on what it is. That turns out not to be so easy.Is Bitcoin a currency?Describing Bitcoin as a currency seems like a natural place to begin. After all, I'm told some retailers accept Bitcoin as a method of payment. On closer inspection, however, comparing Bitcoin to a currency is like comparing lightening to a lightening bug (apologies to Mr. Clemens).As the WSJ has noted, Bitcoin is the hottest currency that nobody is using. As Jeffrey Dorfman here at Forbes pointed out, there are two problems with Bitcoin as a currency.First, it's too unstable. Who wants to accept something for payment that could drop in value by 25% before you have time to pour a cup of coffee? Put another way, would you accept Bitcoin as payment for a car you were selling if you had to wait 60 days to convert it to dollars? I doubt it.Second, it's too slow. It can take days to complete a single transaction. By then, the cup of coffee you're trying to purchase is stone cold.Bitcoin is not a currency in any meaningful sense of the word.Is Bitcoin a store of value?Gold apologists love to describe the precious metal as a store of value. It somehow gives the ""investment"" an air of sophistication. Some Bitcoin acolytes have borrowed from the same playbook to call Bitcoin a store of value.The idea is appealing at first. They note that the U.S. dollar and other currencies are ""fiat"" money. In other words, there's nothing backing the value of currencies today, like gold once did. While that's also true of digital currencies, they are limited in number. The number of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million. A government can't step in and start ""printing"" more Bitcoin.It reminds me of the argument people made to justify the meteoric rise in real estate values ten years ago. After all, they aren't making more land. That argument didn't turn out so well.All of that said, one can certainly see a use for digital currencies in some parts of the world. In the U.S. we have a stable currency and banking system. That's not the case in many parts of the world, where a digital currency free from government intervention and corrupt bankers could prove very useful.The problem, however, is that Bitcoin and other digital currencies are still not widely accepted as a medium of exchange. That they may be useful in limited circumstances and geographies doesn't, at present, make them a store of valueSo what is Bitcoin?Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can best be described as potential currencies. As noted above, they are not widely accepted today as a medium of exchange. And they have significant limitations holding them back from developing into full-fledged currencies. But it's possible, though I think unlikely, that they could become more widely used in the future as a medium of exchange.Bitcoin fanatics will take issue with all of the above. They will point to the devaluation of fiat currencies. They will hype the blockchain. They will argue that cryptocurrencies are the future. They may even try to sell you an online course, for four easy payments of $199 (U.S. dollars, not Bitcoin, thank you very much) on how to make millions in digital currency.It still doesn't change the fact that Bitcoin has not been adopted as a useful, stable currency.How do you value a potential currency?The short answer is that you can't. It's impossible to assess the value of Bitcoin with any degree of reasonableness. And this is a critical limitation to understand.It's not uncommon to pass on a potential investment because you can't determine its value. I love Amazon as a company. I have no idea what its intrinsic value is. Same goes for Tesla. So I've passed on both potential investments.Bitcoin is far more difficult to value. It has no intrinsic value. It has a short history with wild price swings. And as of yet, it has limited usefulness.Is Bitcoin a bubble?The meteoric rise in its price shouldn't be confused with its true value.In this sense Bitcoin is experiencing a classic bubble. The rise in price has motivated more buying, which in turn raises the price. The rise in price motivates more buying, and this cycle continues for a time.Eventually the process will reverse. The price will eventually reach a peak that motivates Bitcoin owners to sell. When enough sell, the price will start to drop. The drop in price will motivate more selling, which will lower the price further.Pain and anguish for many will be the result.It's now 4:59 a.m. on December 7, 2017. The price of Bitcoin stands at $14,980.00. It's risen nearly 40% in the week since I started this article.I hope you're not betting the rent money on Bitcoin.And if you are still bullish on Bitcoin, here are 5 ways to invest in the digital currency."

Photographer: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg","2017 has been bitcoin’s biggest year yet, with the digital asset reaching another new all-time high above $8,000 over the weekend. In addition to the exploding price, the total value transacted on the network per day has also seen substantial gains this year; however, the actual number of transactions processed by the network per day has been rather stagnant in 2017.The Value Being Transacted Has ExplodedLet’s take a look at the numbers provided by Blockchain.info.Estimated USD transaction value per day on the Bitcoin network (Blockchain.info).For most of January, roughly $200 million worth of bitcoin was being sent around the Bitcoin network per day. Things didn’t really take off until May where there was a steady rise in the total value of the transactions processed by the network. Near the end of that month, days where more than $700 million was transacted on the network were common.After declining over the next couple of months, the value being transacted on the Bitcoin network spiked in the runup to the release of Bitcoin Cash, which forked off from the Bitcoin ledger on August 1st. The lock-in of the much-anticipated Segregated Witness (SegWit) improvement for Bitcoin also occurred around this time.Roughly a billion dollars of value was sent around the Bitcoin network per day in early August. This number declined down to $600 million by late September before exploding to $1.5 billion by late October.November 16th set a new all-time high for value transacted over the Bitcoin network in a single day at $2,803,405,660.The Number of Transactions Per Day Has Been StagnantWhile this explosion in value transferred per day has taken place, the actual number of transactions on the Bitcoin network per day has been rather steady. In fact, the peak for the highest rolling seven-day average of Bitcoin transactions for this year (so far) was in May. The number of transactions happening on the network each day in November is pretty much the same as what was seen in February.Transactions confirmed on the Bitcoin network per day (Blockchain.info).As has been widely publicized, Bitcoin neared its effective capacity of transactions per block earlier this year. Capacity has increased somewhat with the activation of SegWit, but only around 10% of the transactions on the network currently take advantage of this change.At peak usage, SegWit should lead to an effective doubling of capacity on the network.With a stagnant number of transactions per day and an exploding amount of value being transferred, it would appear that the Bitcoin network has become more of a settlement network than a simple payment system over the course of 2017.Although the number of transactions taking place on the Bitcoin network per day has remained roughly the same all year, off-chain Bitcoin payments have been on the rise. For example, Xapo founder Wences Casares recently revealed that the company is processing more than 1 million internal, off-chain bitcoin transactions per day due to the increased fees on the network. This is up from 500,000 per day in November 2016.Looking AheadLooking ahead, it will be interesting to watch the relationship between the Bitcoin’s transactional capacity and the total value being routed on the network. The failure of the SegWit2x proposal that came out of the New York Agreement may indicate that the base Bitcoin blockchain will act as a conduit for the digital gold use case, but additional layers for payments are also emerging.The first such layer-two solution, RSK, is expected to launch in December.Capacity on the main Bitcoin blockchain should also open up as more wallet providers enabled SegWit support for their users.It’s possible that alternative digital assets, such as ether, could be used for smaller payments until these layer-two networks come online. According to BitInfoCharts, Ethereum network has seen a tenfold increase in transactions per day over the course of 2017. While Ethereum passed Bitcoin in terms of transactions per day over the summer, ether is also down 70% against bitcoin since the summer’s peak."

So what are the assumptions that bitcoin market participants have? Many, I believe, are buying because they think prices are going to continue to skyrocket, making this a ""good investment."" I conducted a Twitter poll of Bitcoin buyers, and 72% of of the 79 respondents are purchasing because they want to profit from rising prices.Let's dig into this assumption a bit. Why might Bitcoin continue to rise in price? It can't be because people simply view it as a good investment because it rises in price. This is a Ponzi scheme, and the number of people who think Bitcoin is a good investment simply because prices are rising is limited. I don't know how much longer that can go on for, but it must end eventually. And once prices stop rising rapidly, all the buyers who were purchasing based on the assumption of rapidly rising prices will no longer have a use for it and will exit the market.Another reason prices might continue to rise is that Bitcoin will be useful as a medium of exchange for a growing number of people. However, it's important to recognize that these two assumptions run contrary to each other. Rapidly rising prices are not a desirable feature of a currency. And yet I think some market participants hold these contradictory assumptions in there head: I'm going to make a ton of money off of Bitcoin because prices will continue to grow exponentially AND Bitcoin will expand as a currency.Anecdotally, I think a non-trivial share of market participants actually believe Bitcoin will replace the dollar and the Fed. But if Bitcoin's prices are growing exponentially under the minor demand boom we are seeing, what would they do if everyone tried to use it instead of dollars? Let's take a look at some numbers.The monetary base, which includes cash held in vaults and at the Federal Reserve, is $3.9 trillion.  If you look at M2, which is a wider definition of money that includes checkable deposits and savings accounts then this goes up to $13.8 trillion.So if everyone decided to behave collectively delusionally and replace dollars with Bitcoins, this would mean Bitcoin needs to rise to $13.8 trillion in market cap up from around $300 billion. So prices would have to grow to 4,600% from current levels. So a single Bitcoin would have to cost $871,056 instead of the $18,936 it is worth as of writing this. To get to these levels would completely undermine it's usefulness as a currency.Consider that in an environment where Bitcoin continued to appreciate like this, credit is essentially impossible. Even if the 4,600% phases in over a decade, it means that if you buy a car for 1 BTC this year, you will only be able to sell the car for something like 0.2 BTC the next year. Who would buy any real assets in this environment? Who would take out a loan that is going to be 5x as expensive to pay off in the next year? You use 10 BTC to buy your house today, and that seems affordable because that's like $180,000 right now. But next year your loan of 10 BTC is impossible for you pay off, because it's worth more than $1 million.There will be no lending or borrowing in the Bitcoin world, not even for short terms like 30 days. Nobody will embrace a currency that you cannot borrow or lend in. All of this means that for Bitcoin to achieve the one big assumption that investors have -- to continue growing rapidly in price -- it must fail at the other goal: to become a widely adopted currency. Note that the inability to lend and borrow means BTC needs to rise to the full $13.8 trillion M2 value instead of the monetary base value because fractional reserve banking -- where you put money in the bank and they loan it out -- will be impossible.Take a step back and think about what the fundamental value of Bitcoin is. It doesn't pay a dividend, and contrary to Tyler Cowen's comparisons, you can't hang it on the wall and ogle it like a piece of art. The fundamental value of Bitcoin is based on its usefulness as a currency, as a medium of exchange. And I believe there is real value for some cryptocurrency there. But a good cryptocurrency will increase the money supply to match money demand better than Bitcoin does. It will not be an exponentially appreciating asset that people buy like a penny stock.The market is filled with people who think Bitcoin is going to grow very rapidly and give them lots of returns, and it's filled with people who think it's going to become a widely used currency. It can't be both. Eventually one of these groups is going to exit the market. Perhaps when all the speculators exit the market, more who value it's practical use as a currency will enter to replace them. But this will leave prices much lower in the transition, and even then this whole boom bust cycle illustrates the problem with an inflexible money supply that does not adjust to market conditions.I 100% believe there is a fundamental value to cryptocurrencies. It's a very cool and potentially very important technology. But this is not how a good and useful currency behaves."

Bitcoin has intensified global attention on the cybercurrency.","Dec 9, 2017,11:00am EST","The recent extraordinary runup and commensurate volatility in the price of Bitcoin has intensified global attention on the cybercurrency. For good or ill, Bitcoin is now a topic of interest to the mainstream press, as Bitcoin newbies near and far take notice.","Such newbies and reporters alike have nowhere to turn for information on Bitcoin than the established cadre of Bitcoin fans (some would say fanatics) who helped to drive its price to the stratosphere in the first place.Just one problem: many of these fans are spouting misinformation – and worse, they believe their own nonsense.For you fanatics (you know who you are) as well as the broader newbie audience suddenly interested in Bitcoin, here are some of the lies Bitcoin fans tell themselves – and how to avoid getting snookered yourself.Bitcoin: Not What It Appears?Lie #1: Bitcoin is Like Something ElseThis fallacy is so prevalent, frankly, because Bitcoin really isn’t much like anything else. There are some similarities between Bitcoin and, say, the US dollar or gold or even tulips, but the differences far outweigh the similarities.Drawing a false comparison between dissimilar things is an example of the false analogy, false comparison, or false equivalence fallacy, and there’s even a Wikipedia page that explains it.Here is a common example: when I say that criminals use Bitcoin for illicit transactions, a common response is ‘well, criminals use US currency for illicit transactions as well, so you shouldn’t single out Bitcoin.’ This line of reasoning is fallacious, because Bitcoin and US currency are too dissimilar to draw such a conclusion.Lie #2: Bitcoin is SecureBitcoin is a cryptocurrency and ‘crypto’ means secure, right? Not so fast. Bitcoin has proven appallingly easy to steal, and even easier to lose.Security, after all, is like a game of whack-a-mole. Hit one vulnerability on the head and another pops up. There are still far too many moles all too happy to stick their heads through holes in the Bitcoin threat surface for my liking.Lie #3: Bitcoin is MoneyTake a $20 bill and put it under your mattress. Wait ten years and retrieve it. What is it worth? $20, of course. Sure, inflation will have likely reduced its value somewhat, but $20 will always be $20. Such is the nature of money.Not so with Bitcoin. It’s more of a commodity that acts as a speculative vehicle, while exhibiting few of the properties of money.At this point, Bitcoin fans are likely to point to the handful of merchants around the globe who accept Bitcoin as though it were money. My response: refer to Lie #1. The differences between Bitcoin and money far outweigh the similarities, so any equivalence is a false one.Lie #4: Bitcoin has Intrinsic Value Outside of its MinabilityI analyzed the question of Bitcoin’s intrinsic value in a previous article, concluding that its only intrinsic value (that is, value outside of its market value) is due to the fact that people have to mine it.From the crickets I heard in response to that article, I surmised that people either didn’t understand my argument or didn’t want to believe it. So here’s a simple way of explaining this point.Figures vary widely due to shifting hardware and electricity costs as well as economies of scale, but the cost of mining one Bitcoin is somewhere in the neighborhood of $800 to $1,500. Furthermore, all the Bitcoins now or in the future exist because someone mined them.So when you buy a Bitcoin from a miner, you are essentially paying them to mine it – and it’s only worth the trouble for them if you’ll pay them more than it cost them.Now, let’s say you want to sell that Bitcoin. Your asking price is what someone is willing to pay, which is what we call the market value. But even if no one wanted to buy your Bitcoin, it would still cost the original miner so much to mine it. That’s its intrinsic value.Note that mining Bitcoin is very different from mining gold, say. Gold’s intrinsic value goes well beyond its minability, as it is desirable for many other reasons outside of its market value. Comparing Bitcoin mining to gold mining is, you guessed it, an example of Lie #1.Lie #5: Bitcoin is Not in a BubbleA Bitcoin’s intrinsic value is around $1,000 while its market value bounces around between $15,000 and $20,000 (or some other crazy number depending on when you’re reading this). The difference is pure speculation – one fool’s bet that a greater fool will be willing to buy that Bitcoin for more than the first fool paid for it.Every move to the upside is more evidence of the bubble. Every profit-taking dip to the downside is yet more evidence there’s a bubble. Comparing the Bitcoin bubble to the dot-com bubble or the tulip bubble to draw conclusions about the behavior of bubbles is – once more – an example of Lie #1.Lie #6: You’ve Made Money on the Bitcoin You’re HoldingNever lose sight of the difference between ‘paper profits’ and real profits. You have to sell your Bitcoin to get real money in order to realize a profit.If Bitcoin were money itself then perhaps this wouldn’t be the case. Refer to Lie #3 in case you’re unclear on this point.The more people decide to take their profits, the lower the price will drop. Since Bitcoin is in a bubble, it’s only a matter of time until its market value resets to a number closer to its intrinsic value. Unless, of course, you believe Lie #5.Lie #7: I’m Full of Crap.Not just me, of course, but any Bitcoin naysayer. Rest assured, whenever I poke my stick at Bitcoin, I get my share of flamers – people with no better argument than a personal attack on myself.Such reasoning is itself fallacious, of course. It’s known as an ad hominem attack, and this fallacy also has its own Wikipedia page.You might think I’d be upset with such ad hominem attacks. In reality, I welcome them, so bring them on.The reason is simple: people mount ad hominem attacks because they have no better argument. Every time I get a flame, I say to myself, ‘here’s someone who cares deeply about their own point of view, but could not come up with a single non-fallacious argument to justify their perspective.’In other words, they’re lying to themselves.

Another is the astronomical rise in the prices of the two investment vehicles, which helped early investors amass fortunes in short periods of time. Bitcoin has gained 30% in seven days only—see table.**As of Saturday October 14, 2017, at 10.30 amSource: Coinranking.comBut tulips and Bitcoins differ in one respect.The supply of tulips isn't fixed. Tulips can be farmed quickly, and that makes their supply responsive to prices. The higher that prices climb, the larger the quantity of bulbs farmed and brought to the market. Eventually, there comes a time when supply outstrips demand, setting the stage for a market crash.That’s what happened, for tulips, back in February of 1637.The supply of Bitcoins, by contrast, is fixed. Bitcoins can be mined, too, but their supply isn’t responsive to pieces. It’s already set at 21 million, perhaps even less, as some Bitcoins may have already been “lost.” That makes it less likely for the Bitcoin market to collapse the way tulips didback in 1637.To be fair, there’s plenty of supply of other cryptocurrencies that are competing with Bitcoin, but they are insignificant, as evidenced by the market capitalization of them—see table.*As of Saturday October 14, 2017, at 10.30 amSource: Coinranking.comA fixed supply makes Bitcoin prices demand driven.

Shutterstock","Bitcoin has enjoyed some astronomical gains this year, climbing to nearly $20,000 earlier this month on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).Even after its recent pullback (and subsequent recovery), the world's largest digital currency by market capitalization (market cap) has risen more than 1,300% year-to-date, additional BPI figures show.While analysts identified several factors as pushing Bitcoin prices higher in 2017, here is a short list of the top causes:1) Growing VisibilityBitcoin's visibility has skyrocketed this year, according to data for Google searches and also Social Media activity.Online searches for the term Bitcoin reached an all-time high this month, according to Google Trends data.While the Google Trends score for this term hit 100 earlier in December, this score was as low as five during several weeks earlier this year.The number of Social Media posts involving Bitcoin also hit a record high this month, according to data provided by social analytics company Crimson Hexagon.Several analysts weighed in on the growing appreciation of the world's largest digital currency by market capitalization.""The top driving factor behind bitcoin’s price increase, especially in the last few months has been wider mainstream awareness and acceptance,"" said Oliver Isaacs, cryptocurrency investor and influencer. ""Many well-known businesses have begun accepting bitcoins as a means of transaction,"" he noted. In addition, the cryptocurrency has benefited from ""increased media coverage,"" said Sheila Warren, head of the blockchain project at the World Economic Forum’s Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. ""Public figures and celebrities ranging from movie stars to heads of banks debated, discussed, and/or promoted bitcoin,"" she stated. Bitcoin's substantial visibility has been a long time coming, said Trevor Gerszt, CEO of CoinIRA, a company that specializes in digital currency IRAs.Cryptocurrencies were always going to take a while to gain mainstream acceptance. As the Bitcoin ecosystem began to mature and develop more customer-friendly ways to purchase, trade, and use Bitcoin, it gradually began to build the network effects that would be needed to establish it as a viable cryptocurrency. It just needed to hit that critical mass to really take off, and this year seems to be the year that that happened.Investor interest in Bitcoin has risen significantly. Shutterstock2) Surging Investor InterestInvestor interest in Bitcoin has grown sharply, a development that is illustrated by the digital currency's meteoric price increase.Angus Champion de Crespigny, EY's blockchain leader in financial services, weighed in on this matter: ""Firstly, we’re seeing greater institutional interest,"" he stated. ""Announcements such as the release of bitcoin futures are leading long term cryptocurrency industry players to anticipate greater institutional adoption such as providing it to their clients or even purchasing themselves."" Sean Walsh, partner at venture capital firm Redwood City Ventures, offered similar sentiment.""Institutional money from around the world, particularly North America, has finally begun to flow into the ecosystem,"" he emphasized. ""Over two months ago, I was told there were over 120 active crypto-only hedge funds, and another 70 in various formation stages."" Retail investors have also been flocking to the space, and their interest is illustrated by the surging number of user accounts at exchanges like Coinbase, which had more than 13 million accounts at the end of last month, CNBC reported.Digital currencies have experienced some regulatory progress this year. Shutterstock3) Regulatory ProgressSeveral market observers cited the latest progress in Bitcoin regulations as another major factor helping to drive the digital currency's price higher.Walsh, as well as eToro senior market analyst Mati Greenspan, both highlighted Japan's decision to legalize Bitcoin as legal currency.U.S. law enforcement agencies also provided guidance on digital currencies, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) offering their two cents.The SEC announced in July that the digital tokens issued by initial coin offerings (ICOs) could potentially be considered securities, depending on the circumstances of the sale. If these tokens are securities, they are subject to U.S. federal securities law.The CFTC also chimed in, stating that digital tokens distributed in this manner could potentially be considered commodities, or even derivatives contracts.Several exchanges have started offering Bitcoin Futures. Shutterstock4) Bitcoin FuturesThis year, both the The Cboe Futures Exchange (CFE) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) started offering Bitcoin futures.Isaacs lauded this development, stating that:""The introduction of futures via CME and CFE will bring an air of legitimacy to the cryptocurrency space, bringing on institutional investors in this more regulated environment."" Marouane Garcon, managing director of Amulet, a crypto-to-crypto derivatives platform that focuses on customer success and usability, also offered a positive slant on the situation.The launch of institutional derivatives played a ""key role"" in ""Bitcoin's rapid rise,"" he stated.""When the 'old boys club' and blue-blooded firms like J.P. Morgan talk about offering Bitcoin to their clients, it only creates more believers – who are wealthy and influential,"" added Garcon. Pawel Kuskowski, CEO & co-founder of Coinfirm, a blockchain and regulatory technology firm, provided similar commentary, stating that offering derivatives trading will make Bitcoin ""even more popular."" Bitcoin has benefited from robust momentum. Shutterstock5) Strong MomentumThis year, Bitcoin has benefited from tailwinds such as rising visibility, growing interest and regulatory progress.""However, none of these underlying fundamental sources can adequately explain even a fraction of the eye-popping returns seen by Bitcoin investors this year,"" said David Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Investment Managers.""As a result, we can only conclude that most of these astronomical returns were generated by raw unfettered speculation and momentum,"" he stated. Jacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager, and Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of Seychelles-based exchange BitMEX, both emphasized the efficacy of positive feedback loops.Eliosoff mentioned ""The unsustainable but powerful bubble/momentum feedback loop,"" in which prices move higher, fueling media coverage and attention, which in turn attracts buyers to cause new price increases. Hayes emphasized that ""The positive feedback loop drives the price higher and higher, until it doesn’t."" Disclosure: I own some Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ether."

We’ve got $5,000!”","On Saturday, the price surged to yet another all-time high, $6,194.88, according to Coinmarketcap.com, and the market capitalization briefly exceeded $100 billion.The reasons for the jumps are unclear, but unless there's negative news, every day, at minimum, the price is likely to rise because of new money coming into the system. Every day on Coinbase alone, about 35,000 new accounts open -- a figure that sometimes reaches 50,000 -- and thousands of people in South Korea and Japan, two countries where Bitcoin has taken off, are also bringing new fiat money into the system.But the market’s rosy outlook is in stark contrast to the prognosis many insiders give to Bitcoin right now: The almost nine-year-old cryptocurrency is facing its gravest test yet. Whether or not it will survive, or in what form, is anyone’s guess.ShutterstockOn or around November 16, Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency created by a novel technology called blockchain — a masterpiece of game theory, cryptography and, of all things, the age-old ledger — will split into two chains, each with its own set of coins. Hodlers should be happy about suddenly owning double the number of Bitcoins except for the fact that the question of which of these will be called the true Bitcoin is, for now, up in the air — and that could create turmoil in the market. Anyone willing to bet their money by selling one set of coins for another stands to take a financial hit — either because they’ve picked the wrong side, or, for technical reasons, because selling one set may actually cause a sale on both sides of the chain. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment. Disclosure: I own some Bitcoin.]To be sure, Bitcoin has undergone such an event before. In August, a group split the chain to create a new form of Bitcoin that they called Bitcoin Cash. The two blockchains shared a transaction history up until the time of the split, giving anyone who held any number of Bitcoins until the so-called hard fork the equivalent number of Bitcoin Cash on the new fork. (A hard fork is a software change that runs the risk of splitting the blockchain into two, particularly if the community disagrees about it. If you follow Ethereum or cryptocurrency, you may have heard that Ethereum split into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic after a contentious hard fork.) However, many people who didn’t support Bitcoin Cash dumped their coins quickly, and, after initially spiking up to $900, the price has now deflated to about $300. But because Bitcoin itself didn’t suffer much from the split, many people believe that hard forks are no big deal. This one is different.“At the last fork, it was very clear which fork was the minority chain,” says Olaf Carlson-Wee, founder and CEO of Polychain Capital, a $250 million crypto hedge fund. “With this fork, there is a battle over Bitcoin — the name and brand and which chain is the true Bitcoin. And no one is backing down.”Since it became clear this hard fork would occur, Bitcoin Twitter has been a toxic stew of name-calling, trolling, bullying, blocking and threats, with some altercations spanning months with replies numbering in the hundreds. No tweet or Bitcoin Talk comment made by anyone is too old to dredge up and hold against them, no quote from Satoshi Nakamoto too out of context (or fictional) to be used to bolster one’s argument. The two Bitcoin subreddits — “hard forked” politically and ideologically long ago by censorship — espouse such different views, switching between them is like passing through the looking glass. In one forum, one side of the hard fork will certainly triumph, and the backers of the other side are vilified; in the other subreddit, the opposite chain will come out on top, and the first subreddit’s villains are heroes. Each side is so convinced it will win that a few insiders made a $4 million bet — though, being denominated in Bitcoin, the amount on the line now is $6 million.How the first cryptocurrency reached this cliffhanger in its journey is a story that has been many years in the making and finally pits against each other what were strange bedfellows anyway: the cypherpunks who, years before Bitcoin even existed, developed the various technologies that finally resulted in the first true digital asset and the Silicon Valley types who popularized the cryptocurrency that now has at least tens of millions of users and a $100 billion market cap. Whether one side will prevail or their death match will destroy Bitcoin is anyone’s guess.What Are They Fighting About?At its most basic level, the question that divides the community is a seemingly trivial one: how to upgrade the network to accommodate more transactions at any given time. It has produced a contentious divide because the various ways to go about it all result in tradeoffs — and which compromises the different sides are willing to make reflect deep philosophical differences. Throw in accusations of censorship, racism, hypocrisy, corporate takeovers and deal-making behind closed doors, and the three-year-long battle has become a geek’s version of a soap opera — if soap operas were mostly about and watched by men.Bitcoin transactions are grouped into blocks that get processed every 10 minutes. The amount of data that can be included in any given block is limited to 1MB — an arbitrary cap instituted early on to prevent spam on the network. However, transaction volume has been growing, making blocks full, pushing up transaction fees as people compete to ensure that their transaction makes it into the next block or one soon after. While everyone agrees the number of transactions that can be processed at any given time needs to be increased, there is no consensus around how.If you’re newer to Bitcoin (like if you came here because of Scott Disick’s tweets or you’re a Wall Streeter newly interested in Bitcoin), you can think of the two most-discussed ways to increase the network capacity as two different proposals for enabling more stuff to fit in a house. One side says: Let’s organize the items in it more efficiently. Not every single thing in this house needs to be here. We can put some of it outside in the shed and better organize the objects that need to remain inside. (For future reference, in Bitcoin terms, this proposal is called SegWit.) The other side says: Let’s just make the house bigger. (This solution has gone by different names in the past depending on the size of the increase being suggested, but broadly, it’s known as bigger blocks, and is now most commonly denominated by the block size currently on the table: 2MB or 2x.) Both sides agree that eventually they need to build other, more technically challenging solutions, such as enabling people that want to use the house to whip up and close down temporary shelters for less important items but putting the most important ones in the house. (These are called second-layer or layer 2 solutions, with Lightning Network being one example, that use the Bitcoin blockchain as a settlement layer for transactions.) But these other solutions are still in development.However, the two proposals presented above aren’t the exact ones the community faces now. The first is the same as the first description above (SegWit), but the second is a compromise solution. That plan says, sure, we can organize things better but that’s only going to help us for so long. So, let’s better organize it and make the house twice as big. That will buy us the time we need to build the second-layer solutions. This plan is SegWit plus a 2MB block; hence, SegWit2x.But because we’re talking about Bitcoin, we’re not just building one house. We’re making one house roughly every 10 minutes. And it’s not the same person or organization producing each house. The constructors can be anyone who buys the right equipment (in Bitcoin, these are called miners and are the people who own the equipment designed to solve the math problems that enable someone to add a new block to the blockchain) — and they can be located anywhere in the world, because after all, these “houses” (blocks of Bitcoin transactions) are virtual and live in the cloud.The Philosophical Divide: Cypherpunk Vs. Silicon ValleyHere's where the philosophical differences start to come in: The first group says, actually, if we make the houses bigger, then it’s going to be a bit harder for the many people who make them. We might end up with fewer builders overall, which would be dangerous, because then the power of constructing these houses will become more centralized into the hands of fewer players. And if that happened, not only would they have too much power, but then a government or other hostile actor could target them in order to stop us from building houses altogether.The second group says, but to go from a minuscule-sized house to a tiny one isn’t going to make it that much more difficult for the builders. Plus, organizing better will only give us more space gradually over time, while doubling the size of the house will give us space we really need overnight.This is the debate that’s gone back and forth for at least three years. The efficient organizer side includes the cypherpunks who envision a world in which the barriers to anyone running their own Bitcoin node (like running your own email server instead of using Gmail) are low, keeping the network as decentralized as possible and therefore further beyond the reach of any government or control by any entity or group of entities. One of the people aligned with this group is Dr. Adam Back, CEO of blockchain-focused technologies company Blockstream. Back in the 1997, he created a precursor to Bitcoin called Hash Cash that employed an algorithm called proof of work (also used by Bitcoin) to help prevent spam on early versions of Internet discussion forums. Back became interested in subsequent versions of digital money that were released, including Digicash, which was programmed to only have one million units. Soon, he saw users “bootstrapping” a value onto it by selling T-shirts and other items whose prices were denominated in Digicash. However, it was dispensed by a central server and when the company went out of business, Back’s Digicash became useless. When Bitcoin came around, he wondered if people would again ascribe a value to it. And they have — a big one.He says he chooses to align with the so-called small blockers or 1x side because Bitcoin’s “differentiating value is the payments that you can only make with Bitcoin” — transactions in which you don’t have permission to send money, where you’re concerned about transacting for privacy reasons or where the receiver doesn’t have a bank account. “These payments are differentiating payments. Those are the ones that are unique and some of those scenarios banks cannot compete with. So you have the space to yourself in a business setting — for regulatory reasons or because of the difficulty of obtaining bank accounts or because it’s used for programming an online service and it’s very complicated to get permission from a bank.” He pooh-poohed a 2014 headline-making wave of big retailers such as Overstock, Expedia and Dell accepting Bitcoin. “If you’re ordering a computer from Dell and live in the U.S, and give your street address, what’s the benefit? What’s unique and different? I’d argue there isn’t one.”While he agrees the community should try to scale Bitcoin so everyone on the planet can use it, he says that will happen with so-called second-layer solutions such as the Lightning Network and the product his company is working on, side chains, in which transactions don’t occur directly on the Bitcoin blockchain but are settled on it. (Blockstream plans to sell side chains to enterprises, charging a fixed monthly fee, taking transaction fees and even selling hardware — a fact that has caused the big blockers to protest that Blockstream and the engineers it employs who are also Bitcoin core developers want to keep the block size small so Blockstream can profit. Back says this isn’t true because, beyond a certain point, side chains won’t really solve scaling.) Back says the community shouldn’t remove Bitcoin’s unique features in order to scale the network. Drawing out the other side's position to an extreme, he says, “If we’re going to get centralized into a big data center somewhere, as in the PayPal case, it’s basically guaranteed the company running it will get national security layers and black lists and all the things banks do and regulations will apply to them.""Back’s (and the cypherpunks’) vision for the future of Bitcoin is one in which users can run their own nodes and control their own private keys rather than entrusting a company. Right now, a number of startups manage users’ private keys for them, with the biggest being Coinbase — a Silicon Valley unicorn with backing from the New York Stock Exchange, Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures and Institutional Venture Partners, among others. “Using smart contracts, there are ways to get the security features of something like a custodian while having control yourself,” Back says before launching into the technical features of how it works.The bigger block side includes several venture-backed startups who have brought millions of people to Bitcoin such as the two biggest wallets, Coinbase and Blockchain who have an estimated 30 million crypto users altogether. Other popular companies on this side include Xapo, which is one of the top five Bitcoin storage companies globally and whose CEO Wences Casares may be the entrepreneur most responsible for getting Silicon Valley excited about Bitcoin; Shapeshift, which CEO Erik Voorhees says sees 2-3% of the daily global Bitcoin transactions; Circle, which has backing from Goldman Sachs; Blockchain, whose investors include Lightspeed Venture Partners and Richard Branson; and the biggest investor in the space itself, Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group.Their vision for Bitcoin is of a new form of money not dictated by any government or central bank but created and used by the people — lots of people, including traditional Wall Street financiers investing in Bitcoin, people in developing countries making $5 transactions, people in developed ones paying for $5 for a cup of coffee.One of the largest Bitcoin holders, Roger Ver, who is a proponent of big blocks, says the small blockers “think it’s just an interesting science experiment, and they can have everybody running Bitcoin on their Raspberry Pi at home. For me, I want to build a currency that’s going to replace the euro, the dollar and the yen, and every other government-issued currency around the world, and in order to do that Bitcoin needs to scale massively.”Vinny Lingham, a serial entrepreneur, shark on South Africa’s Shark Tank and current CEO and cofounder of blockchain identity startup Civic, also supports big blocks. (Civic uses the Bitcoin blockchain.) “If you want Bitcoin to stay with the cypherpunk mentality, you have a much smaller market for Bitcoin than if it goes mainstream,” he says. “Most people buying Bitcoin today don’t even know what the hell cypherpunk is. They don’t care. They don’t know what SegWit is. They don’t care.” He says Bitcoin companies have made everyday consumers aware of the cryptocurrency and driven the adoption that has pushed up the price — mostly to the benefit of the cypherpunks who got in early.Shapeshift’s Voorhees says his interest in Bitcoin grew out of a realization he had during the financial crisis: how central banks debase fiat currencies, “stealing several percent of everyone’s money every year” — which he calls the biggest financial fraud ever perpetrated in the world. “I saw Bitcoin as the world’s first free-market form of finance, a way to have money and everything else built upon finance from the bottom up without banks or government money involved at all.” Like other big blockers, he is pragmatic about what he sees as a need for larger blocks. Because the second-layer solutions are not yet available, “blocks have been full and fees have been rising drastically. It’s now silly and stupid to send a bitcoin transaction less than $10 or $20 because the fee is $0.50 to $10 and that makes that prohibitive. When I got involved in Bitcoin, it was amazing to send Bitcoin anywhere in the world at almost no cost, like fractions of a penny.” He says high transaction fees have made Bitcoin uncompetitive and pointed to the examples of Counterparty and Omni, two protocols that, early on, enabled developers to launch tokens on Bitcoin. “Those became completely unusable when fees got so high on Bitcoin. What it meant was, instead of people creating tokens on the Bitcoin platform, now they just create tokens on the Ethereum platform. For someone who is dedicated to making Bitcoin a success, when I see that happening unnecessarily, I think it’s a problem — especially when you can solve it relatively easily by creating more space in the blocks while the layer two technologies get built. Those who are just working on the protocol or who work in areas where they don’t have actual customers or users, where they don’t see the software being used at scale, they don’t appreciate these issues. They don’t see them. They see things academically as opposed to how it’s actually used in the real world. Shapeshift itself is 2-3% of all the Bitcoin transactions in the world. We have a good idea of how this technology gets used by real people in the real world and, if you’ll notice, the companies that have the most users are all nearly unanimously in favor of a larger block and Segwit2x generally.”Carlson-Wee, summarizing the divide between the cypherpunks and startups, says the 2x supporters want lower transactions fees for users. “The question is what’s the timeline and the urgency and how do you balance the need for that vs. the need to make it cheap to run a fully validating node. There is no technically right answer,” he says. “It just becomes an ideological battle about would you rather have transaction fees lower or would you rather have a fully validating node cost less, because there’s a sliding scale. When one goes up, the other goes down to some extent. People have different values and visions and so what is ultimately in my mind a pretty small technical debate about 1MB or 2 has become very politicized and ideological.”How Bitcoin Politics Created The World’s Most Expensive Game Of ChickenIf cypherpunks vs. entrepreneurs represents the philosophical divide, SegWit vs. SegWit2x is the political one — and it’s intensely political. Bitcoin’s four main stakeholders are the tech-focused core developers, the profit-driven miners, the business-oriented startups and the users, who range from immigrants sending remittances back home to the 1% wanting in on this new digital gold rush.The Bitcoin core developers have been in charge of the protocol, making technical upgrades to the network. (They’re the designers of the homes.) They have the support of a very vocal contingent of Bitcoin fans who often espouse their views on the block size debate via, say, Twitter profile pics of them wearing camo hats emblazoned with acronyms only hard core Bitcoiners would know like “UASF,” or by changing their Twitter handles to include their stance on the Bitcoin block size to @name [NO2X].The Bitcoin miners are the people who run the computers that power and secure the Bitcoin network and ensure transactions get put into blocks. (They are the house builders.) They have, for a long time, been supporters of bigger blocks. However, in 2015 and 2016, they were also loath to ditch the Bitcoin core team. During those years, Coinbase and some pro-big block developers tried to get miner support for various efforts to increase the block size, but the miners decided to stick with the core developers and get them to institute bigger blocks. For a long time, the developers and miners were the main parties in the scaling debate, while businesses attempted to intervene to little avail.In February 2016, at a meeting in Hong Kong, a group of miners and devs did agree to compromise on both SegWit and a 2MB block (yes, exactly the SegWit2x solution of today) — an accord that later came to be known as the Hong Kong agreement. However, the developers there didn’t represent all the core team, and they ultimately worked only on SegWit. Once Core had completed its code in fall 2016, because they didn’t want to appear to be in control of this decentralized network, they declared that SegWit would be adopted only if 95% of miners signaled their intention to adopt it. However, six months in, less than 30% of them had. (A miner can signal an intention by including an informal text note in any block they add to the chain.) The miners felt betrayed by the developers for reneging on the 2MB hard fork promised; Back says that later, at least one miner promised to back SegWit without a hard fork but did not follow through.Some Bitcoin core supporters who had been excited about SegWit became so frustrated that the miners were holding it hostage that they threatened a grassroots change called a user-activated soft fork (UASF) that would, on August 1, force adoption of SegWit on the network — and possibly split Bitcoin into two chains. (Perhaps fearing that, miner support for SegWit increased to 45%.)That’s when the third political group, the businesses, stepped off the sidelines. In late May, at Consensus, the largest blockchain conference, held at the New York Marriott and put on by a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has invested in almost 100 crypto-blockchain startups, many of the venture-backed businesses that represent millions of users brokered a deal with the miners — SegWit2x, same as the Hong Kong agreement. (While some developers had been invited to this meeting, whose accord is now called the New York agreement, none had gone.) The group, which at the time of signing comprised 58 companies and 83% of the computer power on the Bitcoin network, declared they would adopt SegWit, along with a 2MB block, if 80% of miners signaled support for it. Miner signaling hit that threshold in two weeks. Suddenly, a plan to change the network was in the works — but the Bitcoin core developer team that had so far been in control of the protocol did not put it through, let alone support it. They and their supporters have called the New York Agreement a corporate takeover of Bitcoin and decried the notion that Bitcoin can be controlled by “back room deal-making.” Mike Belshe, the CEO of cryptocurrency security company BitGo, who is one of the SegWit2x developers, responds, ""I’d argue the New York Agreement team is bigger than the core team. Go looked at who checked in material code to Bitcoin core and see if it’s greater than 60 people. It’s not."" (DCG’s Barry Silbert and the lead developer on SegWit2x, Jeff Garzik, declined to comment.)Though it managed to break through the years-long deadlock, the SegWit2x plan may have had one fatal flaw. It triggered the upgrade to SegWit in August and planned to raise the block size to 2MB 90 days later. That means, for the interval between the two parts of the plan, Bitcoin has been a 1MB coin featuring SegWit — the coin that the developers wanted but the miners did not allow. So now the developers and their supporters — the cypherpunks — are doing their best to prevent the upgrade to 2MB, or at least to ensure that the 1MB coin with SegWit survives and is labeled the real Bitcoin.What Will Happen Come NovemberThe plan by the SegWit2x developers is to execute the fork in such a way that the legacy chain does not survive. In their view, they are upgrading the network according to the definition of Bitcoin in the Bitcoin white paper, which consistently describes Bitcoin as being the longest chain and that being the longest is “proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power.” If all goes according to their plan, such a large amount of hash power will go to mining the 2x chain that the 1x chain will basically become dysfunctional — blocks could take hours to get added to the chain, fees could become prohibitively high as people compete to get their transactions included in the next block, and because most parties require a transaction to be six blocks deep in the chain to consider it confirmed, confirmation times will become excessively long. Miners compete to get the new Bitcoins mined on the network and how easy it is to obtain that award is determined by something called the difficulty algorithm that adjusts every 2,016 blocks, which turns out to be every two weeks as long as a block is processed on average every 10 minutes. But if, say, 90% of miners are no longer mining on that chain, it will take 100 minutes to find a block, 10 hours to get a confirmation, and 140 days for the difficulty to readjust.Additionally, the developers of the SegWit2x plan are not instituting a technical measure called replay protection that would entirely separate the transactions on the two blockchains. Without replay protection, if both chains survive, any transactions that occur on the 2x chain will also be replicated on the 1x chain and vice versa. However, this will cause more problems on the chain with less mining power because blocks will be mined more slowly. Let’s assume the chain with less mining power is the 1x chain. That means that if you are a 1x supporter and dump your 2x coins, you will also lose your 1x coins. (According to core developer Eric Lombrozo, some people plan to offer special services that enable people to separate their coins so they can transact in them without replaying the transaction on the other chain.) Belshe says they aren’t instituting replay protection because their intention is that there will only be one chain, not two, after the fork.In general, a chain with little hash power will be vulnerable to attack. If only 5% of current hash power remains on that chain, then any miner with enough power can turn 5.1% of current hash power on to the first chain and double spend to their heart’s content in what's called a 51% attack. A miner could also conduct what’s called a wipeout attack in which they use their greater hash power to mine blocks faster than the rest of the network in secret, without broadcasting each new block to the network. Then, when they’re many blocks ahead of the chain, they broadcast all the blocks at once, wiping out all the transactions that had been added by the other miners in the interim. Then, even transactions not just six but 60 blocks deep could become invalid.The above scenarios assume the vast majority of miners turn all or nearly all their hash power onto the 2x chain. But will they? Answers from miners, including the ones who are signaling SegWit2x and who signed the New York agreement, are inconclusive. Forbes contacted all the known miners. Fifty-six percent of the network hash power — AntPool, BTC.com, BTCC Pool, Bixin, BitFury, BW.com, 1Hash, GBMiners and KanoPool, as well as the 3.3% of hash rate that is unknown — declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment, with the exception of KanoPool (which is 0.8% of hash power), which pointed to a Bitcoin Talk post stating that it hasn’t decided. The only miners that said they will definitely turn all their hash power onto the 2x chain were Ver's Bitcoin.com (1.5%) and BTC.top, which accounts for 14.1% of the hash power. BTC.top CEO Jiang Zhuoer, wrote via WeChat, “I will do my best to support 2x, even if the mining is not profit[able].” However, he also said if the 1x chain is more profitable for a “long time,” such as one or two weeks, he will let miners in his pool who want to mine on the 1x chain do so. ViaBTC and BitClub, which respectively have 9% and 3.5% of the hash rate, say they plan to let their individual miners choose which chain to mine. Wang Chun, the CEO of F2Pool, who made waves for signing the New York agreement and then later backing out, says F2Pool will mine the most profitable chain but will always pay its miners in 1x coins. Slush Pool, which did not sign the New York agreement, will mine the 1x chain due to the lack of replay protection, though it said in a written statement, “We might consider switching over only if there is a strong community consensus validating S2X as Bitcoin, which is in our opinion highly improbable.""So, while it is technically unknown which chain 76.8% of hash power will support right after the hard fork, it is reasonable to believe most of it will mine the 2x chain, as about 85% of blocks being mined now are by miners signaling SegWit2x (down from 95% a couple weeks ago). Of the known plans, 15.6% of miners will definitely mine 2x, 12.5% will let their miners choose at will, 8.4% of the hash power will mine the most profitable chain but pay the miners in 1x coins, and 7.4% will mine the 1x chain.It’s certainly possible that the vast majority of hashing power goes to the 2x chain. However, it’s also possible that enough hash power remains on the 1x chain that it survives. In that case, what happens on the exchanges will be key. It will also be most true to the game theory of Bitcoin, which, in contrast to the Bitcoin white paper, says it’s not hash power over time that determines the real Bitcoin, but the users who decide; the only problem with this is that there’s been no way to see, by way of price, which coin users would find more valuable without actually presenting them with different versions of Bitcoin — until now.So far, a number of exchanges and wallets have indicated that they expect to support both chains, at least initially. Coinbase, the single biggest holder of Bitcoins on the planet, has announced it will give users access to coins on both chains and, a few hours after this article was initially published, stated that it would name the original chain BTC and the new chain B2X. Kraken, Bitfinex and Xapo, all the next biggest holders, with roughly the same amounts, have different stances. Kraken, which did not sign the New York agreement, has not issued a statement. Bitfinex has announced trading for “chain split tokens,” in which customers can ascribe a certain percentage of the value of a current whole Bitcoin to the 1x and 2x chains as long as the two add up to 100. The 1x chain split token is called BT1 and the 2x chain split token is called BT2, and after the hard fork, BT1 will convert into BTC and BT2 will convert into B2X. (SegWit2x supporters are crying foul over the naming favoritism being shown the 1x chain, but Bitfinex said that for an exchange like itself that offers leveraged trading, it needs to offer continuous markets, and because tickers are the primary keys in all its databases, changing tickers would break system functions for market data, trading records, etc. However, it could much more easily move the descriptor Bitcoin to another ticker such as B2X.) So far, the legacy chain split tokens are trading at about 87% the price of a current Bitcoin, and the SegWit2x chain split tokens are trading at about 13%. (Another exchange, OKCoin, which didn't specify its naming policy, shows the same price differential; Huobi, which may rename BT2 BTC, shows a similar spread.) Xapo, which isn’t an exchange and does not need to offer continuous trading, has announced it will make the new coin available to customers but it will follow the chain with the “most accumulated difficulty” — the most hash power since the inception of the chains in January 2009, when Bitcoin first launched, following the definition of Bitcoin in the Bitcoin white paper — and name that one BTC. If the legacy chain is the minority chain, it will name that BC1 and if the SegWit2x chain is the minority chain, it will name that BC2. (All the exchanges/wallets above declined to comment or pointed to their public statements regarding the hard fork.) Currently, more than half of all Bitcoin trading volume takes place in Japan, and after the 27% of trading volume that takes place in the United States, another 11% occurs in South Korea, so exchanges in those countries will also certainly play a role.Given that 85-90% of miners are signaling that they support SegWit2x, let’s assume that that’s how much hash power goes to that chain. Meanwhile, if 85-90% of users really do support the 1x chain as the chain split tokens indicate, to the point where they are willing to give up coins on the 2x chain to buy more 1x coins (and assuming that they’re not foiled in their attempt to do so by a replay attack), then it really does become a game of chicken. However, who blinks first is highly dependent on price.The key to the 2x side winning is for the miners to act in concert and hold on, even if the other chain is more profitable, until the 1x chain becomes unusable and users flee to the 2x chain. How long they can do so depends on whether mining the 2x chain will simply be less profitable than mining the 1x chain or actually unprofitable. Part of the miners’ motivation to push for bigger blocks has to do with the fact that transactions on the blockchain itself pay miner fees. The more of those that are shifted to layer 2, the less they make in such fees. So, while mining the 2x chain may be less profitable or even unprofitable for some time period, they may be willing to make that tradeoff for their long-term goal. If the 2x chain prevails, 1xers who tried to boost the chance of their coin winning by selling the 2x coins in droves may end up losing money. Even more significantly, the core developers will have at least temporarily lost control of the protocol, and some may abandon Bitcoin altogether. It’s possible that losing the power struggle could prompt the core developers to do a hard fork to what’s called a proof of work change that would render the miners’ equipment useless for mining the legacy coin, but Lombrozo says that’s unlikely for now: “For that to happen, there would really have to be a strongly adversarial scenario where miners are actually attacking the chain” (such as the wipeout and 51% attacks described above).However, while the SegWit2x side could win in a number of scenarios, the opposite could happen too. The 1x chain could be more profitable not only because of the current chain split token spread, but also because users on the 1x chain may pay high fees to try to get their transactions pushed through the infrequent blocks. These factors could entice miners to mine that chain. Blocks then wouldn’t be as slow and the chain could have fewer problems, which would boost the confidence of 1xers and push the price up, which would draw more miners, and so on, in an upward spiral until the SegWit2x chain is unprofitable for so long that almost all the miners defect from it back to the 1x chain.Placing BetsIt could go either way. Both sides are highly confident their chain will win.Tuur Demeester, editor in chief of Adamant Research, believes the current prices on the chain split tokens will likely reflect the prices of the two coins, so if miners mine the 2x chain, they will be leaving money on the table. “We see very clearly in the alt-coin space that miners eventually always follow the price,” he says. However, he says if the miners do mine the less profitable chain, causing problems on the 1x chain, “I would expect both prices would drop — both the price of B2X and the legacy chain — but I don’t really see that the ratio would change necessarily.”The momentum the 1x side has going into the fork based on the price may also indicate how things will go after it. Spencer Bogart, head of research at crypto venture firm Blockchain Capital, says, “There’s a level of commitment from diehards within the 1x side that is ideological, and would go further than somebody that’s just being pragmatic. … I think a substantial portion of people will immediately sell all their 2x coins and re-up on what you can get on the original chain…. and then you’ll have some people who will tentatively wade into the other side but not commit to it. There’s a little asymmetry there that favors the status quo.”However, the miners may also have some momentum of their own. The recent rise in price could mean that mining on the 2x chain isn’t unprofitable — merely less profitable than the 1x chain. Paul Sztorc, an economist at Bloq, rounding up the 13% price for chain split tokens on the exchanges, notes that 15% of a $6,000 coin is $900, which was the price of Bitcoin as recently as March of this year. Since miners invest in equipment based on conservative estimates for price, many of them may have invested an amount that would make mining profitable at a Bitcoin price as low as $900. So the recent jump in price makes it possible for them to hold out longer in pursuit of their ultimate goal of having bigger blocks. “It is likely that many miners believe that they can cause that 15% figure [the price of the SegWit2x chain split tokens] to rise to 100% if they starve the 1x chain of hashpower. Which they can now do much more easily. They are probably more likely to take the risk, the larger their profitability cushion is,” he wrote in an email. Some Bitcoin insiders surmise that the 1x supporters buying chain split tokens are only a small but extremely vocal minority and that the vast majority of users don’t care about small blocks and are happy to let businesses decide for them. After all, the vast majority of the millions of users who have bought Bitcoin on Coinbase keep their coins there rather than taking control of them in their own wallets.Kyle Samani, managing partner of crypto hedge fund Multicoin Capital, says he doesn’t understand the contention by 1x supporters that the 2x side represents a corporate takeover of Bitcoin. “You, as a user in Bitcoin, because it’s permissionless, have the right to run your own node, and be totally autonomous and independent. Great for you. But that’s a minority of users, and it’s absolutely a minority of dollars. The vast majority of people and money that interact with Bitcoin today interact through Coinbase, Xapo Bitpay, all these companies around the space — that has been true and will become more true, so when you say the evil CEOs are overtaking Bitcoin, I would say, no, the users interact with Bitcoin through these companies.”On the flip side, many on the 1x/cypherpunk side have said that 1x-supporting customers of companies who signed the New York Agreement could have grounds to sue them — on what grounds exactly remains to be seen as many of the company statements issued so far are giving users access to their coins on both chains. However, the threat itself is rich in irony given how Bitcoin’s rise was fueled in part by libertarians’ love for it.The last wild card is how Bitcoin Cash could affect this fork. It has 8MB blocks, no SegWit, and two of the most notorious big blockers, Ver, one of the richest Bitcoin hodlers, and Jihan Wu, the CEO of mining manufacturer Bitmain and pool operator Antpool, already promoting it. Ver has also claimed that it is true to the original vision of Bitcoin, since the white paper is titled, “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,” which implies many transactions per second.Polychain’s Carlson-Wee, noting that the ideologically minded big blockers have already thrown in their lot with Bitcoin Cash, says, “The people who opted into Bitcoin Cash knew they were losing. Let’s say SegWit2x loses. Will the SegWit2x chain have the same kind of staying power of Bitcoin Cash if it’s the minority? In a way, I think the loser might lose even bigger this time, especially if it’s SegWit2x, since I think those ideologically driven folks are on Bitcoin Cash now. If the core chain loses, that chain will stay around, I’m confident.”If the 2x side wins and unseats the core developers from their power over the protocol, it would be a stunning upset. But if the cypherpunks prevail, it remains to be seen how much effort the businesses will continue to put into Bitcoin. Already, Coinbase and Blockchain have adopted Ethereum, and Coinbase's newest product Toshi is focused solely on Ethereum, and a contingent of cryptocurrency enthusiasts, worn out by the stalemate in Bitcoin, have moved on to other crypto tokens. So the question may not be which side wins, but whether, in the long run, anyone will care about this battle at all.[Update, October 25, 9:20 a.m.: This story originally reported that second-layer solutions were years off but at least one is in testing.]"

This comes just after China's Internet Finance Association stated on Wednesday that Bitcoin lacks a legal foundation.China’s withdrawal from Bitcoin trading will have a negative impact on the cryptocurrency, since 10% of Bitcoin trading activity happens in China. Some experts believe that Bitcoin exchanges will re-open once additional regulations are in place, although at this point there is a great deal of uncertainty.China’s crackdown on Bitcoin trading has also revealed divisions in beliefs surrounding the cryptocurrency. Some believe Bitcoin is truly a legitimate currency, although others assume it is a ""fraud"" as Jamie Dimon asserted on Tuesday.Is Bitcoin legitimate?While the idea of Bitcoin seems like something out of a science fiction novel, the idea of having a stateless currency is actually rooted in the past. The idea first originated with John Maynard Keynes in 1940, who proposed an international currency as a unit of account in order to combat trade imbalances. Today, a stateless currency like Bitcoin can simplify transactions between individuals and firms and remove the role of governments and banks in controlling money.Some criminals have certainly used the cryptocurrency to engage in fraud. One of the most notorious cases was that of the Silk Road website, which illegally sold drugs, and relied on Bitcoin for exchange transactions. The online black market was shut down, and its founder, Ross William Ulbricht, was arrested in 2013. He was sentenced to life in prison, convicted on crimes including drug trafficking and money laundering.Illegal activity has plagued all currencies, however. This is why there are laws in place to prevent money laundering and fraud. In fact, Japan has recognized Bitcoin as a legal currency after applying anti-money laundering rules and capital requirements to the cryptocurrency. The latter will help to buffer Bitcoin exchanges against speculative activity. Accounting standards are also being developed for reporting of Bitcoin transactions.More commonly, Bitcoin has become an important conduit for investment by tech-savvy investors and a means of exchange by forward-thinking businesses. Younger investors view Bitcoin as a store of value that will continue to rise in dollar or RMB terms in the long run. Consumers also use Bitcoin to make everyday purchases. While many companies accepting Bitcoin are smaller and tech-oriented, mainstream businesses have also jumped on the bandwagon. For example, Microsoft, Overstock and Expedia are some big firms that accept Bitcoin. Helping or hindering China’s financial system?The Chinese government has a different perspective, however. China’s regulators have worked hard to crack down on money laundering and fraud over the years, and the idea of maintaining another means of perpetuating these criminal activities via Bitcoin is unwelcome.Even worse than money laundering may be the prospect of keeping open a market often used for speculation, which intermittently plagues Chinese financial markets. For example, speculation in the stock market led to the creation of a large bubble and a corresponding crash in the summer of 2015. China’s rapid financial development, most recently in the realm of shadow banking, has posed an ongoing challenge to regulators, who have striven to quash unapproved practices before major losses can be made.In other words, China’s reported shutdown of Bitcoin exchanges may be an easy way of coping with financial regulators’ very full agendas.Future unclearThe move also comes on the heels of a ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs) by blockchain-based technology companies. The People’s Bank of China reportedly views most ICOs to be associated with fraud or illegal fund-raising (link in Chinese), and this is intimately tied to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are used to raise funds for ICOs.China’s many Bitcoin investors will certainly suffer. Shutting down cryptocurrency exchanges means that investors will have to trade Bitcoin over-the-counter, which is more time consuming and not immediate. In addition, the price of Bitcoin has fallen as China’s Bitcoin outlook dims, moving from close to $5,000 on September 1 to about $3,226 on Thursday, September 14.Although Bitcoin use could have been legitimized and expanded in China, helping expand investment options in the country, its future is now unclear.Update: This article was updated to reflect the correct percentage of Bitcoin traded in China, which is 10%."

Who knows what it will be worth tomorrow? A couple days ago, it was over $17,000.Regardless of the hyper-hype of bitcoin, Brosens doesn't think it dies a slow death. But he does believe that bitcoin hits five snags next year, and possibly beyond. Here's a brief overview of the five impediments to further adoption of bitcoin, not in any particular order.A woman accesses a bitcoin ATM machine in Hong Kong on December 18, 2017.

(BCH) from the UAHF blockchain. As an entrepreneur looking into ...","Nov 27, 2017,07:04am EST","Bitcoin has been caught up in a protracted scaling debate since early 2015, when the first solutions were proposed by Jeff Garzik, Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn, all well known and respected bitcoin core developers at the time. Each of these proposed changes revolved around a quick increase to the blocksize, the individual blocks that make up the blockchain, and a corresponding non-backwards compatible upgrade of the protocol known as a hard fork.","A significant number of the other respected developers, who have since evolved to be the leading voices of the current Bitcoin developer community, disagreed with the need to scale via the blocksize and a hard fork. This group would later propose Segregated Witness, typically shortened to SegWit, an upgrade that would enable more sophisticated scalability methods that have been proposed but have yet to be implemented. Segwit was memorialized as Bitcoin Improvement Proposal #141 in late December of 2015.There has been a two year controversy over which type of scaling solution would succeed. During this time, original core contributor Mike Hearn, tired of the stalemate, publicly declared Bitcoin dead and moved on.User Activated Soft Fork Hat Users Wear In SupportIn 2017 users banded together to activate a soft fork, which is a backwards compatible upgrade, known as UASF, activating SegWit. The mining community, which was the main force blocking the upgrade to BIP 141, responded with their own user activated hard fork, or UAHF, to enable a blocksize increase as the main scaling method. Thus, we now have Bitcoin (BTC) from the UASF blockchain and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) from the UAHF blockchain. As an entrepreneur looking into the industry, here is what you need to know about the two technologies before choosing which you're going to use.We need to understand some of Bitcoin's inner workings in order to assess what is happening here. There are five types of stakeholder in any Proof of Work blockchain cryptocurrency. Developers create the blockchain software, Miners handle the double spending verification of transactions, Nodes store the blockchain and process transactions on the network, and those transactions can be initiated by either Users or Applications. While the users and applications drive the value of a particular distributed network, the distributed, trustless infrastructure of Bitcoin relies on a delicate balance of power between Developers, Miners, and Nodes.Failure to agree can get messy. While anyone can become a Miner, Node, or Developer, Miners and Nodes can reject code built by Developers, Nodes can reject types of transactions Miners attempt to process, and Miners provide security to the network in exchange for the chance to profit by the collection of processing fees and new coins. If any one component misbehaves, the process of upgrading the system breaks down.Every 10 minutes, Miners create blocks of transactions and add this block to the previous transactions held in the public ledger maintained on the Nodes, which will hold those blocks in perpetuity. Each block had a blocksize of one megabyte, which works out to approximately seven transactions per second. Once the transaction limit was reached, the rates shot up. Instead of a few cents, transactions are now $5 or even $10 if you need them done quickly. More patient users can set a low fee, but they may have to wait seventy two hours for a transaction to clear. So the question was, how to best fix this problem? The easy answer was to change just a bit of code by increasing the blocksize, which is the amount of transaction data that can be entered into a block. In just one day, you could solve all the congestion issues. But many developers were quick to point out that this was not a good solution because increasing the blocksize would put more cost onto nodes, who are not financially incentivized and may turn off their systems.  Unlike the Bitcoin Network, which hits max capacity at seven transactions per second with a one megabyte blocksize, the VISA network, one of many networks that Bitcoin seeks to supplant, can handle 24,000 transactions per second. The storage, server and internet quality requirements of Nodes would be several orders of magnitudes greater, thus limiting the ability for everyday users to run Nodes and have a vote in the ecosystem. The idea of fewer Nodes creates the fear that there would be too much trust required of Miners as power would become increasingly centralized around that type of stakeholder.Naturally, most of the Miner community rallied around the blocksize increase, whereas most of the developers and technically minded Users rallied around second layer solutions that would be enabled by SegWit. There was a stalemate; many Users and Applications who just wanted a solution to be implemented were left unsatisfied. This was the situation that led to the split into Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).Giacomo ZuccoTo understand the difference between the two technologies, I spoke with Giacomo Zucco, a theoretical physicist, who previously worked as an IT consultant at Accenture for 5 years and now runs BHB Network, a non-profit Bitcoin R&D lab that funds several core Bitcoin Developers, such as Peter Todd. He mentioned 4 main differences between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash:ContinuityThe most relevant difference between the two technologies is the continuity of consensus with the original blockchain without any kind of contentious hard fork on the specific timeline of Bitcoin. The rules on the Bitcoin blockchain are in continuity with the software. If you were running software that was available the moment that Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto left the project, this software will still recognize non-SegWit and SegWit transactions as valid (even if without full understanding of the SegWit ones). Bitcoin does not change the consensus rules without having an overwhelming majority of the ecosystem, such as developers and investors, in consensus.When Zucco talks about “software”, he is referred to software being run by Nodes. Nodes are the keepers of the blockchain's data, they define the rules of system, ensuring Miners follow those rules. Having software that is compatible with Node software releases from the time Satoshi Nakamoto left the project maximizes the number of Nodes participating in the blockchain, which enhances the security and trustlessness of the project.Zucco goes on to explain Bitcoin Cash in terms of continuity,BCash is a new altcoin. It is different from other altcoins like Ethereum because it shares a part of it’s history with Bitcoin, which is why I call this subset of altcoins, forkcoins. However, it is still an altcoin in the same way BiGold and Byteball are altcoins, but with an airdrop to Bitcoin holders. While many in the BCash ecosystem say that there is an ideological continuity that Bitcoin does not have, the software is in technical discontinuity. Style of DevelopmentDevelopment of BCH is controlled by a very small group of people. In Bitcoin, the number of contributors to GitHub history includes old and new individual contributors, company contributors and anonymous contributors. Development in Bitcoin mirrors a Free Open Source Software (FOSS) style, which includes strict peer review before release. However, the fork coins like BCH and Bitgold have small developer ecosystems that are not strict and have little to no peer review.The Bitcoin infrastructure, which manages $160 billion in value, is developed openly and cautiously, while being supported by a deep ecosystem of exchanges, wallets, and Developers. Bitcoin Cash, which is relatively new, is developed by a small set of Developers. When it comes to managing billions of dollars of user funds on top of delicate decentralized cryptographic infrastructure, the need for peer review is very important. A lack of sufficient peer review can end with millions of dollars lost or stuck due to a single incorrect line of code (e.g. parity multi-signature hack). Lack of Segregated WitnessBCH does not have Segregated Witness. This upgrade, which solves transaction malleability and various other technological issues, is required to allow for advanced smart contracts on Bitcoin. Now that transaction malleability is fixed, upgrades like efficient payment channels, Lightning Network, TumbleBit, Complex coinjoins and other smart contract systems will be possible. These upgrades are important for privacy and off-chain scalability solutions. BCH has large blocksBitcoin now has a theoretical maximum of approximately four megabyte blocks, one meg of transaction data and three meg witness data. BCH has double the size, 8mb blocks.Given all of the benefits of the Bitcoin blockchain, such as higher security through many Nodes, heavily peer reviewed upgrade process, and the future potential for smart contracts and privacy, why would someone be interested in Bitcoin Cash?Ryan X CharlesThe simple answer is that users want scaling to happen now. I spoke with Ryan X Charles, the CEO of yours.org, a new micropayments social media platform, to discuss how the scalability debate was hurting their platform,Yours is a social network with a built-in payment system, where people get paid for creating and discovering good content. There are three payment models in the app. The first is a voting model, where you pay 0.10 for an upvote and that 0.10 is split with all the people who upvoted previously. The second is a paywall that has options for paying between .01, .10, .25 and $1. The highest paid articles use paywalls. The last is a paid comments feature, where authors can set a price to comment on an article, which dramatically reduces the amount of post trolling.For us, the only thing that matter is that we have a system that enables low fees and are non-custodial [meaning we don’t hold the funds]. Using PayPal or stripe for micropayments around $.05 to $0.10 just doesn’t work. Because of the rising fees on Bitcoin and the lack of clarity around the launch of SegWit and Lightning, we spent a year to a year and a half building our own payment channel system. The fees on Bitcoin were so high, that we had to switch to leveraging our payment channel infrastructure on top of Litecoin.There were some issues working with our payment channels, for instance, you could not send arbitrarily low amounts of value until half the channel was spent. The first payment in the channel had to be higher than on-chain fees, otherwise you cannot close a channel. Funding payment channels would take a long while.To clarify, payment channels are second layer protocols that can help scale bitcoin. They are the technology behind the Lightning network, which is the most popular solution within the Bitcoin community for scaling. Charles goes on to explain how Bitcoin Cash helped their business,When Bitcoin Cash came out, the fees were so low that we could use the infrastructure without the need of payment channels. So we did and we removed about 10,000 lines of code associated with the payment channels to launch our beta on August 25th. BCH completely solved the problems we had. The on-chain scalability approach was much better for usability.  Users can cash in, immediately start making payments, then cash out. No need to wait for confirmations since the micropayments were small and not very high risk of double spend.When we made the switch to BCH, the payment system became radically more reliable and the users felt it. We had over twenty fold growth increase, from ninety users a day to over two thousand after the switch.Roger VerThis is not the only case of a company switching over from Bitcoin to Bitcoin cash. I spoke with Roger Ver, an early bitcoin investor who invested in companies such as blockchain.info, Kraken and purse.io, the CEO of bitcoin.com and one of the top thought leaders around Bitcoin Cash, who explained, Some of the most popular sites in the history of Bitcoin like Satoshi Dice have switched completely over to BCH because it provides a much better user experience than BTC. Bitcoin.com’s wallet now offers full support for BCH. We will see many more in the coming days. BTC has been morphed into a settlement layer with high fees and unreliable confirmations. BCH allows anyone to send or receive any amount of money with anyone in the world, instantly, and basically for free.So if you are running a company that is relying on microtransactions and needs a solution today, Bitcoin Cash just might be that. But is that really the killer use case that everyone is looking for? People often speak of how Bitcoin can help underserved populations.Foxbit FrontpageTo learn more, I spoke with Felipe Trovao, one of the founders and the head of compliance of Foxbit, the exchange that handles 50% of Brazil's Bitcoin.In many countries in Latin America, including Brazil, there are many problems with the government. Specifically, the governments often does not take very good care of the local currency, typically inflating the currency a lot. The government is too close with the banks, so the people do not trust neither the government nor the banking institutions. People see Bitcoin as an alternative to the traditional banks and people are discovering it because it is easy to trade and convert to local currency.In Brazil, bitcoin users are looking to the technology as a store of value to protect their net worth against inflation. Trovao goes on to explain,Most clients are looking for Bitcoin instead of Bitcoin Cash. My clients all sold their BCH for BTC, which is why we are seeing the recent jump in price in BTC. While some very few people like the BCH technology, the community in brazil doesn't want Bitcoin Cash.Unlike the case of yours.org, Brazil's underserved, who don’t trust their banks or their government, are currently looking for a store of value in Bitcoin instead of microtransactions. If a cryptocurrency is to be a good store of value, it must be censorship and corruption resistant through decentralization, so that banking institutions or corrupt governments are unable to influence or control the network. Nodes are required to maintain strong decentralization as a check against the trend of Miners towards monopolization, so Bitcoin meets this need of Brazilians.Zucco further explains that the decentralization advantage of Bitcoin goes beyond the blocksize,The centralization risk of Bitcoin Cash is not [just] because of the eight megabyte block, but because it started outside of global consensus of Bitcoin, with a small group of developers controlled by ASIC producers and corporations instead of a free, open source project.Charles agrees that Bitcoin Cash is a payment mechanism and not a store of value, We really like Bitcoin, we wanted to use it, which is why we created payment channels, but there was no way for us to us it economically, which is why we switched to Bitcoin Cash. We don’t expect Bitcoin Cash to be a store of value, but as a micropayment platform. In the future, our users will be using the platform and not even realizing that they are using cryptocurrency at all. Everything will be denominated in dollars, with credit card on-boarding. The system will be absolutely seamless. If at some point, there become scaling issues on Bitcoin Cash, which we don’t anticipate, we would definitely use a better technology if something came along.So while Bitcoin Cash seems to be the technology of choice for those looking for micropayments today, Bitcoin is the long term choice for a store of value. Although Bitcoin Cash solves the short term problems for many entrepreneurs looking into the micropayments industries, there are strong long term prospects for Bitcoin smart contracts, privacy and microtransactions on top of second layer protocols like the lightning network.  In terms of regular sized transactions, my company, Bitwage, leverages Bitcoin for paying wages to international workers all around the world in places like Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Philippines and India. Our transactions are not micro and Bitcoin's technology is doing just fine for our purposes.Correction: A previous version of this article misquoted Giacomo Zucco saying that Mimblewimble is a smart contract that could be enabled by Segwit.  This is not the case and has since been removed from his quote."

We're exploring how Square can make this experience faster and easier, and have rolled out this feature to a small number of Cash App customers. We believe cryptocurrency can greatly impact the ability of individuals to participate in the global financial system and we're excited to learn more here.”Square Cash is piloting a Bitcoin buy and sell featureFor now, the app only allows these users to buy, sell and hold Bitcoins, but not to make payments to friends with the cryptocurrency, which is the app's primary function with dollars.Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency and has soared in value this year to seven times what it was worth on January 1. It also has the highest market capitalization -- $113 billion -- out of the thousands of other crypto assets that exist today. And its value could be poised to increase further, as Bitcoin futures launch soon, bringing more institutional money into the market. Though, as any seasoned Bitcoiner will tell you, the market is highly unpredictable.[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment. Disclosure: I own Bitcoin.]In recent months, CEO Jack Dorsey has not been shy about his admiration for blockchain technology, calling it ""the next big unlock"" in an interview with The Verge's Lauren Goode.In that same discussion, he perhaps gave a hint as to why Square's Cash is testing this out. He recounted going home to St. Louis over the holidays and being asked by multiple people how to buy Bitcoin. ""I said why do you want to buy Bitcoin, and they said, I heard it was a fast, easy way to make money. So I said, you want to treat it like an investment, and they said yes, someone said it's like digital gold... It was just amazing how mainstream the brand is,"" he said.He also noted that a digital currency could be especially appealing to a younger generation -- one that overlaps nicely with those that also pay friends with smartphone apps -- and recounted someone telling him, ""Gold is a stupid rock.""In the interview, he may have even expressed openness to the potential for Bitcoin to be just another tool Square offers its merchants. When asked if he followed Bitcoin, he said: ""One of the principles at Square was we're going to help the seller make the sale. That means whatever form of payment comes across the counter, be it physical or digital, we're going to enable them to accept.""While competitor Venmo has strong brand recognition, in late October, The New York Times reported, ""In recent months, though, Square Cash has quietly bypassed Venmo to become the most frequently downloaded financial app of any kind on both Apple and Android phones, according to Apptopia.""Given the massive crypto craze, maybe such an offering could make the app just that much hotter."

Although I believe the idea of alternative currencies is a good concept, we need far more oversight before they are legitimate.Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/BloombergLet's start with the harshest criticisms:-- Fraud is Rampant. We have no way of telling what's going on since Bitcoin and its sister cryptocurrencies aren't on exchanges and are completely unregulated.Since transactions are encrypted, it's said that bitcoins are used for illicit exchanges, although I have no good way of proving that.Although Jamie Dimon, JP Morgan Chase CEO, said ""bitcoin is a fraud"" last week, his bank is apparently investing in the cryptocurrency, so they're hedging their bets.Big banks, we should note, have a vested interest in the old money system. Their business is highly regulated and they bet on currencies, stocks, bonds and commodities every day. Those are all regulated and traded for their massive portfolios.Can you game any of those markets? Of course. Lot at the massive swindle of betting for and against mortgage securities during the credit bubble of 2006-2009.That's all the more reason you should be wary of any virtual currency. If you don't think it can be manipulated, you're not paying attention to history.-- The sky's the limit on price.  Bitcoin hit $4,000, then receded after Chinese officials said they were going to shut down some Bitcoin offerings (along with Dimon's comments).But it's not hard to find pundits who have declared Bitcoin could rise to $5,000, even $25,000.Do the people making price predictions have a financial interest in seeing Bitcoin climb in value? Absolutely, but whenever anyone says a price could rise infinitely higher, I worry about a bubble. It's happened frequently in the past.-- The Valuation Dilemma.  How do you value something? With stocks, you can look at past and future earnings, dividends and sales. With currencies, it's what they are worth relative to other currencies. With bonds, it's the ability of an issuer to pay back investors.What about cryptocurrencies? What is the benchmark to value them? They have no earnings. There is no regulated exchange gathering market bids on daily valuation. There are no price/earnings ratios.That doesn't mean that linked computers and users across the world can't create their own market. But no legitimate market works without price discovery and transparency.As thestreet.com noted in a commentary:""Outside of some limited use as a means to buy goods and services, Bitcoin's $61 billion market cap is linked to the perception of value.That is, Bitcoin is bid up out of a belief that others think it's worth something, too, or will do so in the future, even if (unlike traditional currencies) there isn't much demand for using it to buy things.""-- Bitcoin is the next world currency.  I couldn't agree more than we need some form of universal currency. Maybe Bitcoin is that vehicle, maybe not.John Maynard Keynes, the great economist, advocated for a world currency back in the 1940s.But in order to get banks and governments out of the currency business, there has to be global agreement on the rules of how that currency is valued and traded. Bitcoin has a long ways to go on that accord."

Gox was a Tokyo based bitcoin exchange which boasted 70% of the global turnover of Bitcoin trading. However, in February of 2014 Mt. Gox suddenly closed its website and shut down its exchange when it was discovered that it had been hacked. Approximately 850,000 bitcoins worth about $450 million at the time was missing and presumed to be stolen. The CEO Mark Karpeles was eventually arrested in Japan and charged with fraud and embezzlement, and the saga was widely broadcast throughout Japan. The true nature of the incident is still a mystery and due to the widely publicized saga, the word “Bitcoin” in Japan continued to have a strong association with fraud, theft, and ponzi schemes for many years to come.A Mt. Gox customer holds a placard while protesting outside the company's headquarters in Tokyo,... [+] Japan (Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg)Moving past Mt. GoxRight around the same time, however, there were some new developments in Japan. Bitflyer was a bitcoin exchange that was started by a group led by an ex-Goldman Sachs trader. QUOINE was another Singapore based company that opened an exchange in Japan. As these exchanges slowly gained a quiet following, some homegrown Japanese cryptocurrencies also emerged. One of them is Monacoin, a popular virtual currency among online gamers that can also be used to buy goods online. Currently Monacoin is ranked the world's 35th largest crypto currency in terms of market cap. First mover advantage2017 was a watershed year for “virtual currencies,” as the Japanese by now liked to call them. Early in the year China and Korea had cracked down on cryptocurrency exchanges and shut them down. All cryptocurrency related funding activities, called ICOs (initial coin offerings) were also prohibited. It was precisely these events, combined with a very important law amendment, that led to the explosive growth of crypto trading in Japan. On April 1st of this year, the Payment Services Act (which is a part of the Banking Act) was amended to allow “virtual currencies” as a legal form of payment.More on Forbes: Bitcoin's $6,400 Price Tag Explained By Initial Coin Offering CrazeThe combination of the official stamp of approval from the Japanese government and restrictive policies in neighboring countries helped catapult the price of Bitcoin to $7000.

ICOs are a form of fundraising activity where the new company issues new “coins” in the form of a new cryptocurrency in exchange for a payment in Ether or Bitcoin. Compared to IPOs, these are extremely easy to do and this year alone we have seen $3 billion raised already. This is a huge increase from just a few hundred million dollars last year.The current price of bitcoin against Japanese yen is displayed outside the Coin Trader bitcoin... [+] retail store in Tokyo, Japan. Photographer: Tomohiro Ohsumi/BloombergInterpretation of financial securitiesThe contentious issue is whether a jurisdiction considers these ICOs as financial securities being issued. The approach varies depending on the country. If the coin was used as a token only to transact goods, for example, they would be considered to be a “virtual currency”. If, however, there were some profit sharing schemes like dividends, then they would be considered to be financial instruments as they resemble equity. In the case of Japan, there are no clear regulations in place. The rules are still grey.Drawing the lineA token that “looks and smells” like a financial security that is sold in an ICO would be considered a “collective funding scheme,” thereby falling under the FSA’s Financial Instruments Exchange Act. The catch is, if the payment is not paid in fiat currency (for example in Ether or Bitcoin), the rule does not apply. At this time, the FSA is said to be working closely with the blockchain industry in Japan to make sure the proper framework is put in place quickly, so as to prevent problematic ICOs and ensure healthy growth of this new funding scheme. Tokyo may have lost its status as Asia’s financial hub, but it appears regulatory framework is being built so as to not lose its place in the cryptocurrency space. We hope this trend will continue, and Japan regains its stature as a leader in technological and financial innovation. "

Many of them will undoubtedly be wondering if they have missed the boat. However, if you believe the many “Bitcoin evangelists” out there, Bitcoin is only just getting started. An investment, they say, even at this stage, could prove hugely profitable in years to come. And to be fair, they have been right so far.ShutterstockFull disclosure from the outset – as I am not a financial advisor I will stop short of answering yes or no to the question I asked in the title. Instead I would like to give you information which I hope you will find useful when making your own decision.What do experts say?If you ask established authority figures within the financial system – for example Deutsche Bank chief strategist Ulrich Stephan – “should we invest in Bitcoin?” then the answer is generally an emphatic “no”. It’s high volatility, lack of obvious use other than as a vehicle for investment, and the bubble-like behaviour of its value are usually cited as flashing red “danger” signs. And logically, one would expect these people to know what they are talking about.However, another line of thought goes that if you had taken their advice to give Bitcoin investments a wide berth seven years ago, they have literally cost you millions of dollars in missed opportunity. So why should you listen to them? The performance of Bitcoin as an investment speaks for itself – this year it has far outperformed any other asset or stock index you might have chosen to invest money in.In fact, hardcore Bitcoin aficionados will take things a step further and claim that financial establishment figures have deeply vested interests in talking down Bitcoin. After all, the very existence of the underlying technology – blockchain–represents an, at the best, highly disruptive, and at worst, existential, threat to their business model, according to many.Essentially this is because blockchain offers the promise of at some stage making it possible to automate many of their core activities as financial “middle men”, through distributed, encrypted systems.There are other reasons you might choose not to get involved, besides the opinions of potentially biased or self-interested experts. For a start, one very reasonable one would be environmental concerns. If you are an ethically-minded investor you will have to square the apparently huge ecological cost of its energy consumption with your conscience.Unique threatsBeyond that, you might just think it’s a bad bet due to the unique threats it faces. As a challenge to the sovereignty of national currencies, it’s long been predicted that governments could move to regulate or even outlaw Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. Several already have, most prominently China which has imposed restrictions on banks and businesses, and several others including Ecuador, Kyrgyzstan and Bangladesh which have banned it outright.As Bitcoin’s encrypted and distributed nature makes it very difficult (though not impossible) to police, attempts to control its use seem more likely to push it underground than kill it. The implications of this will vary vastly depending on where in the world you live, though, so it’s certainly a consideration.Another risk is obsolescence. Should another technology emerge which does everything that Bitcoin does but faster and more energy-efficiently, the value of Bitcoin could plummet overnight.And the inevitable arrival of quantum computing is sometimes cited as another existential threat to Bitcoin. In theory, computers many thousands or millions of times more powerful than we have today will have no difficulty in breaking the encryption which keeps Bitcoin (and all blockchains) fundamentally secured. In reality, experts say quantum computers this powerful are at least a decade away. At this point it’s thought that quantum-safe blockchain technology will already be widely deployed. And of course, if quantum computers can break the advanced encryptions of Blockchains, then they should easily be able to break encryptions of traditional banking systemsBubble?The price of Bitcoin has increased because people have bought them. As hype has increased, and more people become aware of its potential to make them money, price goes up further. This has caused many commentators to predict that we are in a bubble and prices will crash back down to more realistic levels at some point.This already happened in 2013 when many people bought Bitcoin as its price approached $1,000 for the first time. Shortly after, itcrashed to around $300 where it resolutely stayed for the following two years.ShutterstockOf course, if investors have held onto the Bitcoin they bought back then, they are more than happy now, with the recovery and subsequent 900% increase in value. But if they had urgent need of their money before it recovered – to cover unemployment, basic necessities or medical bills, for example - they would have been forced to sell at potentially a much lower price than they bought, incurringlosses.Affordability Which brings me nicely to what I feel is the gist of the question of whether or not it is wide to invest in Bitcoin at this point in time.As a basic rule, never invest anything that you can’t afford to lose. With Bitcoin’s volatility, it’s value could diminish overnight – and with prices spiked as they are at the moment, now seems as good a time as any for that to happen.On top of that there are the unique threats to its very existence Bitcoin faces, some of which I outlined above. While in reality nothing is likely to wipe it from the face of the Earth overnight, there are a range of possible triggers which could quickly cause a large drop in the value of your investment.If you haven’t invested more than you can afford to lose, none of that will be a problem. If you do decide to play the game, however, don’t be surprised to find the stakes quickly raising. If you had invested $1,000 in Bitcoin in 2011, you would have £36.7 million now. You might (if you are lucky) consider that you could afford to take a $1,000 hit for the sake of a gamble – but could you afford to take a $36 million one?"

popular Wall Street strategist, believe that the price of Bitcoin will ...","Nov 27, 2017,10:30am EST","As the founder and COO of the first and largest cryptocurrency retirement program in the U.S., I’m seeing enormous demand from individuals and experiencing Bitcoin’s dramatic growth in price and adoption firsthand. ","ShutterstockBitcoin had a record-breaking year in 2017, taking a volatile growth course from $900 at the start of the year to $6,300 by October. But skeptics like hedge fund manager Ray Dalio and JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon have thumbed their proverbial noses and given cries of “bubble” and “fraud.” While other investment experts like Tom Lee, former JP Morgan director and popular Wall Street strategist, believe that the price of Bitcoin will continue to climb, likely reaching $55,000 within five years.Based on my experience in the space, I believe it will become the best high-growth investment of 2018, far surpassing its meteoric rise already this year. Here are my top five reasons why:1. Bitcoin’s Adoption Will Explode In 2018Bitcoin is growing in adoption across the world. In April 2017, Bitcoin officially became a method of payment in Japan. Now, over 260,000 food establishments and retail locations stores are accepting cryptocurrency. Japan’s widespread adoption and acceptance of Bitcoin sets a precedent for other countries. As other governments consider how to approach cryptocurrencies, the success of Bitcoin in a leading country like Japan is likely to be influentialTrading volumes are also up worldwide. Bitcoin has seen a 55% increase in transaction volume in 2017, along with 30,000 new wallets created daily. Rumors that Amazon will soon begin accepting Bitcoin are persistent. If the retail giant does begin accepting Bitcoin, the movement of cryptocurrency will be unstoppable.2. Formal Regulatory Oversight Will Flood The Market With Institutional MoneyIn 2018, we expect to see a dramatic increase in oversight and regulation for cryptocurrencies and, as a result, we expect to see established financial institutions invest billions of new money in the space. ETFs are widely expected to be approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2018. This would allow major financial institutions to start investing in the space and provide their clients with new investment options. ETFs would open Bitcoin to a significantly larger group of investors who are uncomfortable with buying coins and storing them securely. Aside from ETFs, the newly launched LedgerX is now available for options trading and is licensed as both a swap execution facility (SEF) and a derivatives clearing organization (DCO). An Overstock.com subsidiary called tZero has also recently gained regulatory compliance with the SEC and FINRA for an alternative trading system (ATS) for blockchain assets. CME Group, a strategic partner of BitGo, recently announced its intentions to launch Bitcoin futures in the final quarter of 2017. The growth of Bitcoin derivatives is another step toward the establishment of Bitcoin. CME Group, the leading global exchange for options and futures trading, is the latest entrant into offering derivatives for Bitcoin.These new government-compliant companies represent the beginning of a larger movement toward oversight and safety that will allow larger financial institutions to jump on board.3. Disruption Of The Status Quo Will ContinueTechnologies like Uber, Airbnb and Alibaba have disrupted major industries almost overnight, and Bitcoin is poised to do the same with the monetary system.The blockchain technology upon which Bitcoin is built is revolutionary and expanding rapidly. There are now 1,200 new cryptocurrency variations available on the market attempting to solve unique problems using the technology. Ripple (XRP) is set to completely change the way transactions across borders happen around the world. Instead of fighting blockchain, banks are beginning to work with Ripple to build a new, more transparent system. In a similarly disruptive fashion, Civic coin is using blockchain for identity verification and protection for both businesses and individuals. Civic is giving power back to the people to protect their identities. And it’s only the beginning.4. Trust In Wall Street Is Gone: Blockchain Is The New Messiah The world hasn’t yet forgotten the subprime business dealings that led to the 2008 financial crisis. We watched in disbelief as our own tax dollars were used to save the very banks that had caused the stock market to crash in the first place. JP Morgan received a $13 billion bailout, and Wells Fargo had more recently created large-scale fake account fraud under their customers' names for years to pump up their stock price. Wall Street can no longer be trusted by financial institutions. Bitcoin was developed after the poor financial practices from the economic collapse in 2009. At that time, the transferring of funds between parties required a middleman, a bank or a broker. Bitcoin, however, with its innovative blockchain technology, entirely eliminates the need for a central bank by providing a way to safely transfer money directly from one individual to another. It’s fully transparent and bypasses the unnecessary fees and systematic failures from traditional banks.As a greater number of companies recognize Bitcoin’s technology applications, we’ll likely see a fundamental paradigm shift in the landscape. Rules that have existed for decades -- even centuries -- will shift.5. Bitcoin’s Accessibility Will Dramatically IncreaseWhen Bitcoin first launched, it was solely a peer-to-peer currency system, and it took an industrious and tech-savvy person to figure out the process of buying Bitcoin and storing it safely. Today, sites like Coinbase.com have made Bitcoin easy to use and accessible to the masses. These sites provide a one-stop shop for cryptocurrency, making it easy to buy, sell, trade and store a variety of cryptocurrencies.Major retailers like Overstock and Expedia have also begun accepting it as payment, and countries across the world have begun opening up exchanges and accepting bitcoin as an official currency. Our company, BitcoinIRA.com, allows investors to hold actual Bitcoin in their retirement accounts. These five reasons will be a pivot point for Bitcoin in 2018, and savvy investors with strong volatility and risk tolerance could see explosive gains. "

[+] on January 8, 2015 in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Ethan Miller/Getty Images)","Disclaimer: this analysis does not constitute investment advice, financial advice or any other advice. Please conduct your own due diligence before making any investment decision.In January 2016, an anonymous user posted the following question on Quora: Does it still make any sense to buy Bitcoin in 2016? The price of Bitcoin then was below $400.My answer then was yes, but it wasn’t that I was religious about Bitcoin or had tools to analyze it quantitatively. To me, Bitcoin was just a very promising early stage startup.All VC investors know that it’s the early stage where the big multiples are (alongside the high risk, of course). No matter how bullish you are about Facebook’s future today- you can never hope to match the 800x return of Accel Partners who invested in Facebook’s series A.Back then, I theorized that Bitcoin was likely to disappear or lose value over time. But I thought it made a fantastic investment for the small chance it would ever reach the financial mainstream. Real estate investors hardly relate to this “funny math”, but for venture capitalists it’s the bread and butter.The year of Bitcoin Fast forward to 2017. Bitcoin has smashed other asset classes this year, surging almost 400% since January. Thousands of “Bitcoin millionaires” gave rise to a wave of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO’s) and sent more than $2bn in funding to hundreds of new crypto projects. While Bitcoin accounts for more than 50% of value of all “crypto assets”, the market currently sees about $5bn in trading volume per day across 1,100 currencies and tokens.More on Forbes: Will This Battle For The Soul Of Bitcoin Destroy It?Those who follow the Bitcoin scene at its native breakneck pace, or just the price movements, might miss the biggest item of 2017: Bitcoin is no longer a startup. In fact, it’s time to declare this year as Bitcoin’s “IPO moment”.The first mark of this “IPO moment” is a change in perception. In 2017, we’ve seen Bitcoin taken more seriously by media, regulators, the public and the mainstream financial system. This change is accelerated by greed and controversy, but it’s still fundamental and undeniable. Despite challenges on several fronts – from China to Jamie Dimon – there is now a strong sentiment that cryptocurrencies are here to stay, and that Bitcoin has emerged as the king of the scene. Even Christine Lagarde (MD for the International Monetary Fund) recently theorized that currencies like Bitcoin could be adopted by countries with shaky monetary systems, in what she calls “Dollarization 2.0”.A real assetInternally, the Bitcoin community enjoyed a massive confidence boost. With more brainpower and wealth to re-invest, it continues to thrive and innovate like never before. Leaders emerge. Disputes are no longer perceived as an existential risk. Bitcoin hasn’t only aged well, but also brought communities together and inspired breakthroughs in new directions.The second and more interesting mark of the “IPO moment” is institutional money -- good news for existing Bitcoin holders who were “pre-IPO investors”. If you’re close enough to both finance and the crypto community, you know that a heavy shower of institutional money is looking to enter this asset class right now. This is just a partial list of initiatives that try to meet the institutional demand for Bitcoin right now:No matter the market share that each of these segments end up serving, and how fast they develop, they will develop and drive investments into Bitcoin.The currency of the future With easier access for hungry institutions, the upside for Bitcoin can be significant. But how significant? Can the “post-IPO” multiples match those of the “pre-IPO” years? It’s unlikely, but not impossible, especially if you assume that Bitcoin belongs in the same category as gold and currencies. Gold is estimated to have a “market cap” of $7tn and the U.S. Dollar’s monetary base is around $3.8tn.As an asset, Bitcoin is an animal unlike any other. Just like other world-changing startups that went public in the last 10 years, it’s a relatively young invention. Many questions are still on the table and black swans could definitely pose existential threats to it. But all the signs point to the fact that we’re entering a new era in this asset’s history.Must Read: An Intrepid Investor's Guide To Buying Bitcoin And Other Crypto Assets"

(Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)","Somehow the Bitcoin roller coaster just keeps climbing, leaving many people wondering when it will finally crest the top of the hill and tumble down the other side or if it may just climb right out of the atmosphere.On Saturday the price of a single Bitcoin briefly crossed $19,700 on Coinbase, which is remarkable for the cryptocurrency that was trading for under $1,000 a this time last year and under $8,000 only a month ago. In just the past seven days, Bitcoin is up nearly 35 percent.All along the way there has been talk of a Bitcoin bubble about to burst, and as the price approaches another psychological milestone at $20,000 the question of whether we've finally reached the peak is top of mind once again.Bitcoin is notoriously volatile and it may not be well known that its price has actually crashed a handful of times in the past, when it was less on the mainstream radar.According to Dr. Daniele Bianchi, Assistant Professor of Finance at the Warwick Business School in the U.K., those crashes were essentially due to a few types of events: hacking, regulatory interventions, technology updates and subsequent competition from other crypto-currencies.Blockchain watchers surely remember the drama generated by the hacking of leading exchange Mt. Gox, which was subsequently shutdown a few years later: both events caused the price of Bitcoin to crash at the time. China's chilly regulatory approach towards Bitcoin has also taken a chunk out of its value on at least two occasions. Most recently, the failed fork (explained here) contributed to a price dip, although it didn't last for long.""This tells one simple story; the main risk for Bitcoin comes from external factors such as regulatory intervention and security breaches which might hit the credibility of the entire protocol and its effective usefulness as a method of payment/store of value,"" Bianchi explained to me.He also expects that competing currencies like Bitcoin Cash could impact the original Bitcoin currently generating all the attention.""The very open source nature of Bitcoin makes it vulnerable to competition, although the “first-mover” advantage had so far gave a gap with other competitors which is hard to close,"" he says.The recent introduction of Bitcoin futures contracts also opens up new possibilities and scenarios that could cloud the future of the asset/currency even further, but Bianchi notes that it ""will inevitably lead to further attention of regulators and specialized investors.""So what does all this mean for the talk of a Bitcoin bubble?While Bianchi says much of the risk comes from external factors, he thinks current enthusiasm for Bitcoin comes not just from speculation but also from what he calls an ""accelerating professionalization of cryptocurrency trading"" and a belief in the Blockchain technology that underlies it.Bottom line: neither Bianchi nor I offer investment advice and Bitcoin's price has dipped in the past due to largely unforeseen events, but he still sees the increasing legitimacy of cryptocurrencies pushing prices up over the short to medium term.But just be sure to watch out for those unforeseen events that tend to pop up eventually."

flowing through its blockchain. woobull.com. As you can see the value ...","Editors' Pick|Sep 29, 2017,08:01am EDT",Shutterstock,"February of this year, I tweeted a chart that presented the idea of a PE ratio for Bitcoin, something I temporarily called MTV Ratio before my buddy Chris Burniske suggested the less confusing term of NVT Ratio (Network Value to Transactions Ratio). Later in May, Chris was the first to present NVT Ratio at Token Summit 2017. Subsequently, this ratio has been mentioned in blog and media articles across the web. In my original tweet, I promised an article; it lay unwritten until now.The Idea Behind NVT RatioIn traditional stock markets, price-earnings ratio (PE Ratio) has been a long standing tool for valuing companies. It’s simply the ratio of a company’s share price to its equivalent earnings per share. A high ratio describes either over valuation or a company in high growth.What would be the equivalent in Bitcoin-land? We have a price per token, but it’s not a company so there are no earnings to do a ratio. However since Bitcoin at its essence is a payments and store of value network, we can look to the money flowing through its network as a proxy to ""company earnings”.Bitcoin’s Network Value closely tracks the money (Transaction Value) flowing through its blockchain.As you can see the value transmitted on the Bitcoin blockchain is closely tied to its network valuation. The idea that we can use the money flowing through the network as a proxy for network valuation is valid.We can express this as a ratio. I call it NVT Ratio, short for Network Value to Transactions Ratio. Below is a historic chart of Bitcoin’s NVT ratio. A live and interactive chart is available on my site at Woobull.com.Bitcoin's NVT Ratio is its Network Value divided by the Transaction Value flowing through its... [+] blockchain.NOTE: Estimation of daily on-chain transaction value provided by blockchain.infoHow To Use NVT RatioNetworks under high growth exhibit high NVT Ratio.We can see in the early years of the Bitcoin network, growth was very steep. This resulted in the markets valuing the network high in comparison to the actual transaction value flowing through the network. In other words, we're seeing a network growing explosively which then demands a premium valuation based on future potential. This is very similar to what we see in PE ratios in the high growth stages of young companies.Predicting a bubble before the fact is rather elusive as a price explosion does not necessarily mean the asset is in a bubble. We can only determine this after the peak when the market reassesses the new valuation and we see if the price consolidates or crashes.For example Ethereum’s valuation during Q1 of 2016 grew by a factor of 15x from $70 million to well over $1 billion. To the uninitiated, it looked like a bubble, yet there was no crash, its new valuation was sustained, thus it proved not to be.Similarly, NVT Ratio can not reliably determine a bubble ahead of time, but it is very useful for discerning between a crash or a consolidation after the price has peaked. It can determine this relatively quickly.After an explosive price climb, the price consolidates or crashes.During a price explosion there’s a short term flurry of trader activity and new users hitting the network which serves to drive transactional value through the network. It’s only after the frenzy has subsided do we see whether the value flowing through the network has kept in tandem with its higher valuation. Sometimes it does (it’s a consolidation), and in other times it does not (hence, a crash).Using the NVT ratio we can detect the difference between consolidation and bubbles very visibly. If the NVT ratio stays within a normal range, we are not in bubble territory. If it climbs above the normal range, it's a sign that the transactional activity is not sustaining the new valuation and we can expect a lengthy price correction.Bitcoin's two bubble detected by NVT RatioThe chart above shows the NVT ratio in action detecting two of Bitcoin's historic bubbles. In 2011 and early 2013, Bitcoin exploded in price followed by NVT ratio rising above the normal range. These were deemed bubbles under NVT ratio analysis. Subsequently we saw lengthy 92% and 83% corrections in price.NVT ratio called out the first ""bubble"" of 2013 as a consolidation move.Of particular interest is the first rapid price rise of 2013 (highlighted with a rectangle in the chart above). We saw a 83% consolidation from peak to trough. It's interesting as the NVT ratio did not rise high enough to signify a bubble, yet you would think a 83% correction would be fit to be called a bubble, right?Not so! If we dig into the network’s undergrowth, we find that the value transmitted by the network was high enough to keep the NVT ratio within normal range. Though the markets sold off until the price experienced a sudden dip that was 83% off the peak, that dip was very short lived and the long range chart reveals a pattern more akin to a consolidation which completed quicky. This is a case where the NVT ratio, had it been around back then, was telling the markets it was undervaluing the network at the peak of market fear.Hey NVT, Are We In A Bubble Today?At the time of writing, Bitcoin's NVT Ratio suggests we are not in a bubble.Now for the golden moment - let's apply the NVT ratio to test the Bitcoin's market at the time of writing. We've suffered a large pullback from $81b network value to a low of $49b, with market fearing the potential onset of a bear season.As we can see in the chart above, NVT ratio is within normal bounds. NVT ratio is saying this is a price consolidation. The transaction value flowing through Bitcoin's network is perfectly healthy and supports the currenct valuation.NVT Ratio On Other Crypto-Assets?The question arises, can NVT Ratio be used as a valuation metric for other crypto-assets? My tentative answer, subject to further study, would be “usually, but not always”.At its essence, Bitcoin’s NVT ratio is a comparison of how much the network is being valued to how much the network is being used. If you’re applying the NVT ratio to a different network, the value transmitted on-chain needs to be a good representation of how much the network is being used. This is not always the case.Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum's Network Value closely tracks the money flowing through its blockchainEthereum launched in 2015, as a smart contract computing network that's fast become the most popular platform for token sales this year. Since the token sales conducted on Ethereum require payment in Ether, there's a very strong correlation between the transactional value and network value as seen above.Ethereum is only two years old and its high growth phase. It will take some time before its NVT ratio settles into a meaningful long term range for bubble detection.Networks like Decred and Dash have transactional activity resulting from staking, a process where stakeholders of a network lock up and collateralise their tokens to provide services to the network in return for revenue.This revenue flowing back to the stakeholders is not reflective of the network’s utility and will skew the results coming from the NVT ratio. For these types of networks it would make sense to provide a corrected NVT ratio which subtracts the transactional value resulting from staking which is numerically predictable.Private and fungible currencies like Zcash and Monero hide some, or all of their value transmitted on-chain so it’s impossible to determine their NVT ratio accurately."

(Photo credit: /AFP/Getty Images),"Even though India’s key financial regulator Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has strongly voiced its opinion against using bitcoin for payments, technology enthusiasts believe the craze for cryptocurrency is only on the upswing in India. Indian bitcoin exchanges, bolstered by the growing number of bitcoin buyers and traders, are laboring on with their efforts to popularize cryptocurrency.At a banking event, RBI executive director Ganesh Kumar said that the organization will not be using bitcoins for payments or settlements anytime soon. This isn't the first time the RBI has expressed its discomfort about cryptocurrency and its usage in India. On numerous occasions, the RBI has largely maintained a measured and vigilant approach about popularizing the use of bitcoin. But, this hasn't held back Indians from exploring the various uses of cryptocurrencies aside from payment.Bitcoin For Investments & Remittance In India According to leading cryptocurrency exchanges in India, cryptocurrency is gaining popularity, primarily as a financial asset. While global trade volume is about $5 billion a day, India’s annual bitcoin trade volume stands at $20 billion. India’s first bitcoin exchange Zebpay says there are more than 1.5 million bitcoin users in India and 200,000 users are being added each month. Most of these users buy bitcoins as a financial asset. Cofounder Sandeep Goenka said, “Investing in bitcoin has emerged as a significant trend in the past few months. We have enabled Indians to buy an international asset in a large scale and help them contribute to increase in wealth.” The volume o users have been steadily growing on Zebpay. There was a distinct rally in November 2016 and numbers haven’t dropped since.Freelancers in India are increasingly utilizing bitcoin to accept payments for their services.... [+] (Photo Credit: FAHD SHADEED/AFP/Getty Images)Bitcoin in India has another appeal – remittances and compensating freelancers. Despite an 8.9% drop in 2016, India has retained its position as a top receiver of remittances worldwide, according to a World Bank report.  Many bitcoin startups in India believe remittances is a huge potential market for them, and bitcoin transactions are more economical than wire transfers.Unocoin, India's first entrant into the bitcoin industry, entered a partnership with U.S.-based Bitwage in 2016 to enable global payments for services. Bitwage can utilize Unocoin’s APIs, enabling employers to directly sell bitcoins as payment for a service, and beneficiaries will receive Indian rupees directly into their accounts. An Indian employee who is getting paid $ 1,000 can receive around 8% more if paid via Bitwage (returns are subject to bitcoin exchange rates). Unocoin has also collaborated with Canadian remittance app Paycase, which allows Canadians to send money to India and the Philippines effortlessly. Cofounder Sathvik Vishwanath says, “Bitcoin makes payments fast and inexpensive. Payment portals, like banks, levy transaction charges on beneficiaries. With bitcoin, there are no overhead costs or extra charges, making it a more appealing form of payment as workers get paid closer to real wages.”Asian Nations Race Ahead In The Cryptocurrency GameEven as cryptocurrency startups like Unocoin and Zebpay continue to do business as usual, the current RBI stance has raised some concerns about the perception of India as a fintech hub and its seriousness about financial inclusion.India’s reluctance to encourage mainstream bitcoin usage is more pronounced in the light of developments taking place in other parts of Asia. Singapore’s key regulator Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) along with Deloitte and leading banks has published a report on its work to develop Project Ubin, a tokenized version of the national currency on a distributed ledger. Moreover, fintech hub LATTICE80 is planning to do conduct an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2018, for which cities such as Singapore, Abu Dhabi, Tokyo, London and New York will be considered. Japan continues to be a trendsetter for bitcoin use. In March 2016, the Japanese cabinet approved bills that position bitcoin and cryptocurrency at the same level as authorized currency. Nearly 260,000 retailers, hotels, airlines and department stores in Japan are expected to accept bitcoin payments through PoS app AirRegi. South Korea is also showing a marked interest in blockchain, especially after electronics manufacturer Samsung announced in May that it was exploring corporate use for the software powering Ethereum.Goenka says, “India is already three years behind USA, Japan and Hong Kong when it comes to cryptocurrency adoption. We believe this technology will be a game-changer, probably even bigger than what the internet did for us in the 90s. The current concerns by the RBI only accelerates our need to engage with authorities and regulators to generate awareness about blockchain, which powers the use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.”Future Of Cryptocurrency In IndiaBolstered by positive reviews and growing customer acquisition levels, bitcoin companies are bullish about the market in India. ""Investing in bitcoin isn’t a get-rich-quick method. Investors must spend time educating themselves about bitcoin and the technology behind it, much like real estate or stock market,” says Goenka.The bitcoin frenzy isn’t about to die down anytime soon. While the RBI’s reluctance about cryptocurrency stems from concerns over new technology, the growing number of users in India cannot be ignored and beckons regulatory intervention sooner than later."

(Photographer: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg)","In the middle of November, a critical event in the history of Bitcoin was supposed to happen as a number of large Bitcoin companies and miners were going to attempt to get everyone to move over to a new cryptocurrency network with different rules and call it Bitcoin. However, those behind the proposal realized the error in their ways and pulled their support just days before the hard fork attempt was supposed to activate.For Blockstream CEO Adam Back and the vast majority of individuals involved in the Bitcoin protocol development process, this was the culmination of a years long debate. At a recent Bitcoin conference in Latvia, Back commented on the perceived notion that miners control the rules of the Bitcoin protocol and how it all came to ahead earlier this month with the attempt to move everyone over to a new cryptocurrency network with an increased block weight limit (effectively a limit on the number of transactions that can be processed by the Bitcoin network every ten minutes).Miner Signalling Was Mistaken as Miner VotingOn a panel that included a number of well-known developers from the Bitcoin ecosystem, the politicization of Bitcoin protocol development eventually came up, and some of the participants on the panel wondered if the current, contentious climate in the Bitcoin ecosystem would make future changes more difficult to implement in a timely fashion.In Back’s view, this increased politicization of Bitcoin’s consensus rules is partly caused by a misunderstanding of miner signalling, which is outlined in Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 9. The idea is that miners will signal their readiness for a soft-forking protocol upgrade before it activates in an attempt to make sure the deployment goes smoothly.In Bitcoin, soft forks are backwards compatible changes that do not require everyone to upgrade at the same time. In fact, the new features added via this upgrade mechanism are technically optional.“It’s to say [miners] are ready, but users and businesses should be upgraded first; miner signaling is the last stage,” said Back.From Back’s perspective, there was a somewhat prevalent view in the Bitcoin community that miners were in charge of whether or not a specific addition would be made to the Bitcoin protocol.“I think there were a lot of people who genuinely believed that miners decided on the protocol [rules], where it’s actually a complete misunderstanding because it’s the economic nodes — so anybody who runs a full node for their own verification (any business, any investor, whatever) — 100,000 nodes on the network, that’s what defines the consensus rules,” explained Back.Later in the panel discussion, Back would note that miners can do whatever they want with their hashing power, but users won’t even see the blocks that are mined if they do not follow the consensus rules. In other words, the blocks that are mined are worthless if they don’t follow a rule set that users put value behind.“People have come to realize that miners are just service providers who provide a security service to whichever chain they want to provide a security service to, and the users and investors are providing the — creating the value for the supply and demand of the coin,” said Back. “Miners just follow that. They follow the profit.”The 2x Hard Fork (Or Lack Thereof) Was a Learning ExperienceThe culmination of this debate over how much control miners have over the protocol rules came to a head with the 2x hard fork portion of the SegWit2x proposal. In the run up to this potential hard fork attempt that ended up being abandoned before the activation block, the supporters of the proposal, such as Bloq CEO Jeff Garzik and BitGo CEO Mike Belshe, pointed to the amount of hashpower signalling support for the change as proof that it will succeed.However, there were indications — in the form of futures markets, statements from local Bitcoin meetups, and other avenues -- that users were not behind the change. The core reasoning behind the abandonment of the 2x hard fork was eventually revealed to be an unwillingness from miners to continue mining the new chain for more than twelve hours after the fork.“Even until the 2x fork was cancelled, people were confused that miners making some kind of verbal show of support would actually be willing to lose ten million dollars per week or something,” said Back. “I mean, clearly that’s economic nonsense, but it takes experience to see [that].”Back added that the 2x hard fork fiasco can be a useful learning experience for when these sorts of situations pop up again in the future.More to Learn from a Potential Confidential Transactions ImplementationNear the end of his comments on the matter of miners’ role in potential alterations to Bitcoin’s consensus rules, Back indicated that another learning experience may come if a proposal to add Confidential Transactions to Bitcoin is made.Confidential Transactions is a way of masking the amounts involved in transactions, which dramatically improves privacy on the Bitcoin network. Recently, the proposal gained renewed attention due to the release of a paper that explains how these sorts of more-private transactions can be implemented in a manner much more efficiently than previously thought.“That’s a much more interesting discussion to have because it puts it front and center — that people care about fungibility and privacy,” said Back.The Blockstream CEO went on to add that the key reason miners exist in the Bitcoin system in the first place is to guarantee fungibility. While some miners may decide to censor specific types of transactions, it is likely that there is some miner in the world will eventually include any valid transaction in a block.“It would be interesting to see miners try and argue against fungibility; that’s their reason for being in the system,” Back concluded."

The symbolic meaning of a nice round number in base ten is entirely psychological and we are conditioned to overreact to it. I hope that many people would realize by the time Bitcoin gets to $10K that it is definitely here to stay. Maybe there will be more articles about the “death of Bitcoin”, but I am pretty sure that at that point there will be many celebrating the ‘triumph of Bitcoin’.” And, to go back to the beginning, apart from being happy I wouldn’t especially do anything different than today: I’d buy, accumulate, spend Bitcoin as needed, according to the products, services, ideas, investment opportunities that present themselves.— David, Bitcoin enthusiastWith this new bout of growth, David and other enthusiasts are actually going to have to contend with the question of what they'll do with their $10K BTC.So is it still worth investing in Bitcoin? Some are concerned about its sustainability, particularly related to hard forks, the prospect of it being a bubble, and fees and transaction speeds. Meanwhile, proponents stand by their belief in its ability to answer the general demand (and need) for a global digital currency, and believe that Bitcoin still has plenty of room for growth.Whatever the case, given the meteoric growth Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, in general, have experienced in 2017, it's safe to say 2018 is going to be quite a year for cryptocurrency.

It’s a venomous, egg-laying, duck-billed, beaver-tailed, otter-footed mammal. Those things simply aren’t supposed to go together.In fact, when leading scientists first read accounts of the platypus, they dismissed it as a joke—and for good reason: the platypus is a seemingly impossible animal that combines features from three different animal classes and four different animal orders.Enjoying the joke, the scientists asked the perpetrators of the seemingly-fraudulent platypus scheme to humor them with a sketch of the animal—the product of which was even funnier than imagined.George Shaw’s depiction of a duck-billed platypus from 1809Even after the initial inspection of the physical specimen, the conclusion was the same: “The first preserved platypus body was thought to have been a fake, made of several animals sewn together, when it was first looked at by scientists."" [1]Only upon the most careful and minute examination did some scientists finally come to believe the creature was real. Still, two decades after the platypus was confirmed, leading anatomists like Robert Knox still doubted the authenticity of the “freak imposture” which “the scientific [community] felt inclined to class this rare production of nature with eastern mermaids and others works of art""[2]. Register Now: A Beginner's Guide To Bitcoin And Other Cryptocurrencies Free WebcastEven once the platypus was broadly accepted as a real and legitimate animal, classification provoked arguments: What type of animal is it? As it turns out, the platypus isn’t good at being a duck, it’s not good at being an otter, nor is it good at being a beaver or a reptile. The platypus is, however, great at being a platypus!In the end, the platypus was so distinct that scientists had to create a new animal category to accommodate its unique features. The platypus is a category creator.Bitcoin is very similar. It exhibits characteristics that cross asset classes: Bitcoin is used for payments like a currency, it’s scarce like a commodity, distributes “special dividends” (hard forks) like a stock, and derives additional value from developer contributions like a technology platform.The initial reaction to Bitcoin resembles that of the platypus[3]:Bitcoin and the platypus are category creatorsBitcoin is truly a strange beast—and that’s a primary reason investors struggle to understand it: While Bitcoin has features from many different assets, it doesn’t fit neatly into any pre-existing categories. This creates a psychological hurdle to contextualizing Bitcoin as an asset.Currency investors will tell you that Bitcoin isn’t a currency because it’s not broadly used as a unit of account (goods aren’t typically priced in Bitcoin), commodity investors will tell you it isn’t a commodity because you can’t touch it, and Bitcoin certainly isn’t a FinTech company because there’s no CEO or headquarters.However, all this completely misses the point because while Bitcoin isn’t good at being a currency, a commodity or a FinTech company, Bitcoin is great at being Bitcoin. Like the platypus, Bitcoin is a category creator.Footnote: If you’d like to learn more about some of the unique features the define Bitcoin and its crypto-asset brethren as a unique asset class, I’d highly recommend the phenomenal white paper “Bitcoin: Ringing the Bell for a New Asset Class” from my friends and industry colleagues Chris Burniske and Adam White.[1] Walters, Martin; Johnson, Jinny (2003).

The technology that created Bitcoin will do it, one day.Investors chasing after Bitcoin as its price trades close to $6000, hoping that they will find other investors to sell at higher prices, are confusing the promise of the technology behind Bitcoin with the promise of Bitcoin as an alternative form of money. Bitcoin (BTC)**As of Friday October 20, 2017, at 7.30 pmSource: Coinranking.comWithout doubt, the technology behind Bitcoin, called blockchain, has the potential to change capitalism, by bringing efficiency and transparency to everyday transactions.Bitcoin as an alternative to national currencies has the potential to change capitalism, too, by democratizing transactions, and shifting power from central banks to the people.That's why we called it “people's currency” in a previous piece here.The trouble is that both promises are expected to face a great deal of opposition by economic elites. Using blockchain technology to fight corruption that holds most emerging economies back from becoming developed, for instance, is expected to face stiff resistance by the local elites that benefit from corruption.And the use of Bitcoin as an alternative to national currencies is already facing stiff resistance by central banks and commercial banks.That’s bad news for Bitcoin investors, as central banks and banks can find ways to taper the demand for Bitcoin, taming any further price gains and occasionally crushing it, as the Chinese government did recently.Then there's another, more fundamental, problem. Blockchain, the technology that created Bitcoin, can be used to create other cryptocurrencies that compete against Bitcoin, as already it has done. Like Etherium, Litecoin, and Ripple, to mention but a few.That would be the bad news for Bitcoin investors. A larger supply of cryptocurrencies could eventually crush Bitcoin prices for good, the way a larger supply of different varieties of tulips crushed tulip prices back in the 17th century.Simply put, the technology that created Bitcoin will eventually kill it.John-Paul McCaffrey, Associate Director, ITRC at Long Island University disagrees. ""Other cryptocurrencies will compete with but not crush Bitcoin,"" says McCaffrey. ""Those that joined the cryptocurrency market when Bitcoin was introduced have helped to develop what it has now become. With millions of dollars of transactions, Bitcoin has gained trust among its users by providing an ecosystem where they can buy and sell as an alternative to their national currency. This trust has seemed to remain despite the fluctuation in the price of a Bitcoin. The barrier to entry is relatively low as new cryptocurrencies are emerging often. The one thing that they lack is the large mass adoption that Bitcoin has a strong hold on. Other cryptocurrencies will compete but they have a long road to go if they are going to prevail over Bitcoin.""It remains to be seen. "

After languishing in the $300 range for a while and jumping up to the $600 range in November, it has now nearly quadrupled to around $2,500 a coin as of press time -- it had traded as low as $650 on Friday.Meanwhile, Bitcoin, which was trading at an all-time high of around $7,800 on Wednesday, is now down to around $6,000 as of press time but had dipped as low as about $5,500.[Update: shortly after publishing, the Bitcoin price took back some ground and Bitcoin Cash lost some. For the latest, check Coinmarketcap.com.][Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment. Disclosure: I own some Bitcoin and Ether.]ShutterstockThe surge by Bitcoin Cash led it to overtake Ethereum in market capitalization to $40 billion and become the second-largest crypto. (Earlier this year, as Bitcoin's market share of all crypto tokens was dropping precipitously and Ethereum was on a tear, many in the crypto community wondered about when they might see what they called ""the flippening"" -- when the market capitalization of Ethereum would overtake that of Bitcoin's. Instead, a different kind of flippening has occurred: Bitcoin Cash surpassing Ethereum. Even Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin congratulated the most vocal early supporters of Bitcoin Cash on Twitter.)Several active crypto players surmised that the market moves had to do with the disaffected group who did not get the hard fork that they supported, known as SegWit2x, shifting their money over to Bitcoin Cash, which is more in line with their vision of Bitcoin. The side that prevailed regarding the hard fork were known as 1xers because they supported keeping the block size limit at 1MB as opposed to increasing to 2MB as the supporters of the hard fork (so-called 2xers) wanted. The 2xers felt increasing the block size limit was necessary because blocks have become full, causing transaction fees to rise, making it hard to justify using Bitcoin for small transactions.But in the weeks leading up to the proposed split, Bitcoin futures markets seemed to indicate that 1x coins would retain 85% of Bitcoin's current value and 2x coins only 15%. The 2x side eventually decided not to go through with the proposed hard fork, and the day the news was announced, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high.That was Wednesday. Saturday has been an entirely different story as the price of Bitcoin Cash has skyrocketed and that of Bitcoin slumped.""What a plot twist,"" wrote Jacob Eliosoff, manager of Trevi Digital Assets Fund, in a message. ""Right after 1x's big day of glory, and especially after 1xers spent the last month talking about how the market would decide and was clearly validating them!"" But overall, he said, it's natural that backers of SegWit2x ""have nowhere to turn but BCH. It's not surprising that SegWit2x's loss has been Bitcoin Cash's gain.""Kyle Samani, managing partner of MultiCoin Capital, wrote in a message, ""There were lots of Bitcoin Cash whales who were in early on Bitcoin who were waiting to see what would happen with 2x. Now they're making their move. They're dumping BTC for BCH....I know many Bitcoin OGs who have dumped $10m+ of BTC for BCH ... Turns out there were a lot more BCH ideologues than we all thought.""Samani said Multicoin sold BTC for BCH in the last 48 hours as well. ""Ideologically, I gave up on Bitcoin long ago but I'm a fiduciary now so I have to make money on the swings,"" he wrote. One such whale, Roger Ver, nicknamed Bitcoin Jesus for his personal proselytizing of Bitcoin during its early years and one of the biggest holders of Bitcoin historically, told Forbes via email that he is selling his Bitcoin for Bitcoin Cash. ""Bitcoin Cash is useful in commerce, and therefore can also be used as a store of value,"" he wrote, referring indirectly to the high transaction fees on Bitcoin; Bitcoin Cash has much lower fees. When asked if he was trying to move the price, he said, ""Of course not. No trader ever wants to be the one to move the price.""Another big proponent of Bitcoin Cash, Jihan Wu, the CEO of Bitcoin mining equipment manufacturer Bitmain and mining pool Antpool, wrote via WeChat, ""Right now we have both BCH and BTC, but we believe BCH has more potential."" He denied that he or his companies sold Bitcoin for Bitcoin Cash on Friday or Saturday during the price gyrations.According to Coinmarketcap, the price of Bitcoin Cash on Korean exchanges was slightly higher than on other exchanges around the world, suggesting it also played a role in the price movement. However, data from CryptoCompare showed overall trading volume of Korean Won to Bitcoin Cash was down compared to recent weeks, while trading of Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash was up.Part of the debate around the potential hard fork was around the vision for Bitcoin: whether it should be a store of value only, like digital gold, or a store of value as well as a means of exchange, like digital cash.""The OGs believe in Bitcoin as digital cash and not as gold,"" wrote Samani, ""and they're sick of core,"" he said, referring to the Bitcoin core developers who mainly led the crowd who believed Bitcoin should mainly be a store of value and that payments should occur in a layer built on top of Bitcoin but not processed on the Bitcoin blockchain itself.Bitcoin Cash has a few other things going for it -- namely the fact that it is now 2.2 times as profitable for miners who can secure blockchains to mine Bitcoin Cash than to mine Bitcoin. That means the Bitcoin blockchain has lost so-called hash power, which will mean it will take longer for transactions to be processed.As Eliosoff explained, ""As BTC loses hash, its blocks slow down, confirmations take longer, and of course fees spike up as we're seeing now."" While that could take weeks to correct, it could also cause a downward spiral as people flee to another blockchain that doesn't have those problems -- such as Bitcoin Cash.However, Bitcoin Cash's recent streak may not last. Even during the writing of this article, it began to reverse some gains and Bitcoin took back some losses. The ideological battle marches on.Update, Sunday, Nov. 12, 2017, 2:57am EST: Bitcoin's all-time high was reached Wednesday, not Thursday as originally reported."

This question has haunted us since the beginning of our journey as Homo sapiens.","When it comes to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, this is an important question. You can buy and sell stocks, bonds, paper currencies and commodities like corn and wheat. They exist in the real world. You can physically deliver them, although they mostly are represented in electronic form.Warren Buffett. (Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images)Which brings us to Warren Buffett, one of the greatest investors ever, who recently noted: “You can’t value bitcoin because it’s not a value-producing asset...it's a real bubble in that sort of thing.”For those of you devoted to decoding Buffett's every pronouncement, his meaning is clear: Cryptocurrencies are not tangible investments. They don't generate earnings or pay dividends. How do you really value them if they have no intrinsic or ""book"" value? And people who buy bitcoin are simply betting that the price will go up.While I've always argued that there's a place for cryptos in modern finance -- governments shouldn't have a monopoly on mediums of exchange -- we need a refined understanding of whether computer code is a suitable replacement for hard currencies.The one powerful factor about currencies -- and even gold -- is that there's a finite amount of it. Well, that's mostly true, until governments start printing money, which begets inflation in many cases.There's also said to be a finite amount of Bitcoin, although we still don't know much its mysterious creator. While the technologists may understand the mechanics of how new Bitcoin is mined, many folks now speculating on the currency don’t know and don’t care. That’s troubling.Yet Buffett has a real concern. If you don't know what goes into something, meaning a lack of transparency, it can be snake oil. Here's Buffett's concern:""It doesn't make sense. This thing is not regulated. It's not under control. It's not under the supervision [of] any...United States Federal Reserve or any other central bank. I don't believe in this whole thing at all. I think it's going to implode.""Although anyone can speculate on conventional investments like stocks and precious metals, it's important to know what Bitcoin is not. Despite what Peter Thiel, one of the founders of PayPal says, it's not gold.""I'm skeptical of most of them (cryptocurrencies), I do think people are a little bit … underestimating bitcoin especially because ... it's like a reserve form of money, it's like gold, and it's just a store of value. You don't need to use it to make payments,"" Thiel said.Here's where we need to make a distinction: You can put all of the tangible gold mined on the planet in a large swimming pool. You can never do that with a cryptocurrency. That begs for a better definition of how to value a virtual denomination of wealth.Anyone is free to speculate on anything from land to soccer matches. It's human nature. Yet don't confuse a cryptocurrency with something you can hold in your hand -- like gold.Remember that most of the gold on earth is in the ocean -- dissolved in quadrillions of gallons of water that you can't even drink."

In light of this increased exposure, we decided to take the pulse of the country to gauge awareness and sentiment toward Bitcoin and get a better sense of where Bitcoin is in the adoption curve.The results are based on responses from a recent survey of more than 2,000 U.S. adults ages 18+ conducted online by Harris Poll on behalf of Blockchain Capital—many of the results are quite remarkable.In particular, the results highlight a millennial (we define as 18-34 years old) proclivity for Bitcoin that may be indicative of a bright future for the digital asset. [Disclosure: Investing in Bitcoin is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment. Disclosure: I own some Bitcoin.]For example, more than 1 in 4 millennials prefer Bitcoin to stocks: 27% of whom said they would prefer to own $1,000 of Bitcoin over $1,000 in stocks. The number was even higher for male millennials—38% of whom said they prefer Bitcoin.Not just stocks, many millennials prefer Bitcoin to other traditional financial assets as well. Given the choice of either $1,000 of Bitcoin or $1,000 of a traditional financial asset, 30% of millennials said they would choose Bitcoin over government bonds, 22% would choose Bitcoin over real estate, and 19% would choose Bitcoin over gold.The preference for Bitcoin is especially true for millennial men – at least one quarter would prefer $1,000 of Bitcoin over $1,000 worth of: government bonds (43%), stocks (38%), real estate (26%), and gold (31%).However, the results also show that only 4% of millennials have owned or currently own Bitcoin—indicating there’s a significant gap between preferred and actual ownership rates. If millennials close that gap as their purchasing power increases, it would be a significant and meaningful tailwind for Bitcoin adoption.Younger demographics are often a leading indicator of the future—especially as it relates to technology. So, what’s going on here? Why is Bitcoin more appealing to younger demographics?Bitcoin awareness and ownership is much higher among MillennialsFirst, and perhaps most importantly, more millennials are relatively knowledgeable and aware of Bitcoin than older demographics.Overall, Bitcoin awareness is more than two times higher among millennials than older demographics: 42% of millennials say they are familiar with Bitcoin, compared to 15% among those ages 65+.Millennials are more likely to view Bitcoin positivelyPerhaps as a result of their greater awareness, millennials are significantly more likely to view Bitcoin favorably compared to older demographics.Millennials are 10 times as likely as those ages 65+ to “strongly agree” that Bitcoin is a positive innovation in financial technology (20% vs. 2%). Roughly half of millennials (48%)—including 63% of male millennials—agree that Bitcoin is a positive innovation versus 19% of those ages 65+.Overall, 20% of millennials “strongly agree” that Bitcoin is a positive innovation in financial technology. This is particularly high if we consider that only 42% of millennials described themselves as at least “somewhat familiar” with Bitcoin—so, presumably, the conversion rate from those that are informed to those that are strong believers is quite high. Millennials don’t seem to view big banks as particularly trustworthyWhen given the choice of whether Bitcoin or big banks are more trustworthy, millennials choose Bitcoin (8+ year history) over big banks (400+ year history) at a surprising rate. Overall, more than 1 in 4 millennials (27%) think that Bitcoin is more trustworthy than big banks.  Talk about software eating the world!The figure is particularly impressive if we again consider that only 42% of millennials described themselves as at least “somewhat familiar” with Bitcoin. We can reasonably assume that those who identify as less than “somewhat familiar” with Bitcoin (58% of millennials) would not choose Bitcoin as more trustworthy than big banks—or least not at a meaningfully high rate.In this light, the fact that 27% of millennials see Bitcoin as more trustworthy than big banks despite only 42% self-identifying as at least somewhat familiar with Bitcoin is astonishingly high.Millennials have more conviction regarding Bitcoin’s futureOne in five millennials “strongly agree” it’s likely that most people will be using Bitcoin in the next 10 years—including 29% of male millennials.In total, more than 2 in 5 millennials (42%) agree that it is likely most people will be using Bitcoin in the next 10 years (vs. only 14% for those ages 65+).Millennials appear more likely to be inclined to purchase Bitcoin in coming yearsConsidering the awareness, positive sentiment, and strong outlook for Bitcoin among millennials, it’s not too surprising that roughly 1 in 3 (32%) are likely to buy Bitcoin in the next 5 years – they are 8 times as likely to say this than those ages 65+ (4%).Putting it all togetherIn sum, major takeaways from the survey include:The millennial proclivity for Bitcoin is interesting in that younger generations tend to be the early adopters of technology and social trends that ultimately affect the broader public. Indeed, the results suggest that millennials could drive a significant shift in asset allocation toward the adoption of cryptoassets like Bitcoin. While only 4% of millennials own Bitcoin today, many say they would prefer to own Bitcoin over stocks, bonds, real estate, or gold.Given strong demand for Bitcoin among millennials—a notoriously difficult but important demographic to capture—major financial institutions would be wise to offer their clients access and services for cryptoassets like Bitcoin.Ultimately, if this survey is any indicator, Bitcoin has a bright future ahead: It has meaningfully captured the hearts and minds of younger generations and is likely to benefit from increasing awareness and conviction across all age groups.To view more data from the survey, please go to Survey.Blockchain.CapitalThis survey of over 2,000 adults was conducted online within the United States by Harris Poll on behalf of Blockchain Capital between from October 18-20, 2017 among 2,112 U.S. adults ages 18 and older, among whom 387 are millennials (ages 18-34).  This online survey is not based on a probability sample and therefore no estimate of theoretical sampling error can be calculated.

We're still in the Wild West phase.There's little question that we need to know more about cryptocurrencies. While I'm optimistic that the blockchain technology will disrupt financial services in a good way, a little regulation would help.The Russian Finance Ministry, for example, said it would regulate cryptocurrencies by the end of the year. The country, which doesn't exactly wear a cybersecurity halo, said there was ""no point in prohibiting"" cryptocurrency trading.China, on the other hand, recently shut down Initial Coin Offering operations.ShutterstockHere's what Reuters was reporting on the Chinese action:""Bitcoin fell sharply on Friday after Chinese financial publication Caixin reported that China was planning to shut down local crypto-currency exchanges, although analysts said this was just a temporary setback.The news follows China's move earlier last week to ban so-called initial coin offerings, or the practice of creating and selling digital currencies or tokens to investors in order to finance start-up projects. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the report.""There are countless reasons to be cautious with cryptocurrencies. They are not transparent and uregulated. They are also incredibly volatile.Here are some trading questions offered by ForexLive:-- Do you hedge? We all want to make money on our investments, but with cryptos there's a lot of downside. You should be able to hedge your position to stem your losses.""The reason hedging is important is it provides clarity on a broker's risk management policies. Due to volatility in bitcoins and other cryptos, brokers that are unhedged are more exposed to large losses caused by their client base.""-- Can you trade on the weekend? Despite crypto exchanges being open, a broker and their market data providers may not want to be. Therefore, not every broker supports weekend trading.As a result, if the bitcoin and ethereum market is moving during the weekend, traders may not be able to react if their broker is closed.""-- What will trades cost you? All brokers charge commissions and offer margin accounts.""When trading cryptocurrencies, traders should keep in mind that they are priced more similarly to equities than forex. Therefore, in addition to wider spreads, many brokers also charge a commission on crypto trades.This increases the overall cost of trading and shouldn't be overlooked. Therefore, leverage on bitcoins and similar products is often 10 times or lower. Depending on a trader's strategies and risk tolerance, margin rates could be an important factor of which broker they use.""-- Does the broker offer short sales?  This is a way of protecting yourself and making money when the price drops.""Does a broker offer short trades of their cryptocurrency products? Due to only a handful of hedging solutions for opening short trades, many brokers limit their crypto products to 'long' only.As shorting is an important strategy, for many, trading with a broker that doesn't allow shorting cryptocurrencies is a non-starter.This is especially the case with bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies that are viewed to be in a bubble and prone to sharp 10-15% intraday drops where shorting would be profitable."""

The idea is that there is always a top to any boom or bubble and while ""to the moon"" is a great motto, it is not a likely outcome.","(Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)The boom, bubble and bust cannot be avoided; it is the history of innovation. But where are we in that cycle in regards to Bitcoin? I believe we are still early in the process.I think blockchain is bigger than dot-com because while dot-com was about chat - sorry communications - blockchain is about resources. While chat, sorry communications, has value, money is value. Blockchain will be for assets, what AI will do for trucking.So how high can Bitcoin go?Firstly this is a game of round numbers. Round numbers shouldn’t have any effect on prices but in practice they do. Approximation is a good skill to have in markets and people are draw to them as targets. So let’s get the obvious target for Bitcoin out of the way:$10,000.This is an extremely high probability.What people often forget about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is that the market cap of the whole sector is currently just about $200 billion, the equivalent of one decent NASDAQ company. If you think Bitcoin is a hula-hoop, then it is currently expensive, but if like me you see blockchain as the next big thing, the current levels are trivial.The next level for me is $50,000 a Bitcoin. This makes Bitcoin a trillion dollar asset. This is a real thing. Yet with perhaps 300 trillion dollars of equities and bonds out there on earth, it’s still not exactly creating a revolution.Some see Bitcoin as the new gold, an immutable element, hard to create, indestructible and no more or less abstract as money than as a lump of yellow metal. If Bitcoin had the total value of gold its price would be $300,000 a coin. Now I must admit my face is screwed up with a kind of conceptual pain at the thought but if Bitcoin was a global currency then $5 trillion dollars of it would be nowhere near enough. The US alone has $13 trillion of M2 and that is less than its government debt by $6 trillion, a mismatch that begs many questions about money supply.Finally there is the fact that Bitcoin has 100,000,000 satoshis. Imagine 1 satoshi became roughly worth 1c. You can see the analogy.Well that puts Bitcoin at $1,000,000.So what do I think?Personally I will start to get itchy to sell around $30,000 a coin. I think $50,000 is a real possibility but that at $10,000+ levels even while the total global sums involved won’t be more than the total value of Google, the uproar created by this revolution may bring down the dead, clammy hand of government to try and snuff out the boom. This will only set back progress but I’m not bold enough to plan my retirement on the moon spending my 1c Satoshi, when a Florida beach will do just fine.While trees might not grow to the skies, there appears to be plenty of head room for the price of Bitcoin and if one thing is destiny it is that blockchain trees will be sprouting left right and centre for the foreseeable future, bringing about prosperity to those countries and people that embrace them early.Clem Chambers is the CEO of leading private investors Web site ADVFN.com and author of Be Rich, The Game in Wall Street and Letters to my Broker, out now in paperback and on the Kindle, and the soon-to-be-published Trading Cryptocurrencies: A Beginner’s Guide."

hard forks is gaining new traction and holders of Bitcoin and ...","Editors' Pick|Oct 8, 2017,11:40am EDT",Photo Credit: JANEK SKARZYNSKI/AFP/Getty Images.,"Everyone has heard of ICOs, but an older approach involving airdrops and hard forks is gaining new traction and holders of Bitcoin and Ethereum stand to benefit significantly if the trend continues.In an ICO, participants contribute capital to buy tokens whereas, in an airdrop (or hard fork), tokens are allocated to existing holders of a particular chain—typically Bitcoin or Ethereum. That’s right, instead of buying tokens, they’re simply given away to the holders of another coin.If the trend continues, Bitcoin and Ethereum are poised to spin-off dozens or hundreds of crypto-offspring. If so, this phenomenon could have significant implications for Bitcoin and Ether (the native asset of Ethereum) holders—and increase urgency for prospective holders. (Disclosure: My firm, Blockchain Capital, invests in blockchain startups and crypto assets including Bitcoin and Ether.)Let’s dig in to understand the viability of this approach and, most importantly, its implications for Bitcoin and Ether holders.Objectives of a token saleWhy would a project distribute its tokens for free instead of selling them? In many ways, the airdrop (or hard fork) method of distributing tokens is a better way to accomplish the same objectives of an ICO, which are usually three-fold:Advantages of an airdrop or hard-forkOne option is to hold a token sale (“ICO”) and ask participants to come and buy tokens. However, even the token sales that are optimized for broad distribution are only reaching 10-20k participants while others fall abysmally short and only reach a couple dozen (or fewer) participants.In contrast, Bitcoin and Ethereum have millions of users. An airdrop effectively puts your token in the hands of millions. Even if only 1% of users actually engage your project, you’ve likely achieved significantly broader distribution and more engagement than even the most successful token sales.One of the ancillary but important benefits of token sales is that they help raise awareness for your project and help gain mindshare among potential users and developers.Again, a well-coordinated and properly telegraphed airdrop is likely far more effective at accomplishing the same objectives (awareness and mind-share) as an ICO.In any given week, there are dozens of ICOs creating noise for potential users and developers. The community at large can only seriously consider a couple projects each week—at most. However, your target community might be more likely to take a serious look at your project if they’ve been given a stake—rather than the burden of making a purchase decision.It’s a nuanced but important difference: People are in a different position when they’ve been given a stake and must decide what to do with it (Sell? Hold? Buy more?). At the very least, this will typically encourage some portion of the community to educate itself about your project. In this sense, giving away tokens in an airdrop or hard-fork is similar to a guerilla marketing campaign.Another primary objective of many token sales (“ICOs”) is to bring in capital in order to fund future development of the project. While a handful of the highest-profile ICOs ultimately raised hundreds of millions of dollars, most raise a tiny fraction of those amounts.Again, airdrops can be (and have been) at least as successful in this regard. There’s many potential approaches that a project could take here. A simple example would be to airdrop 95% of tokens to all holders of Bitcoin (or Ethereum) while the project itself and the team behind it reserves 5% of tokens to fund future development.I’m neither an attorney nor a regulatory expert so take my opinion with a grain of salt. That said, I think it is safe to say that the majority of the regulatory risk these projects assume is in the sale of their token. This makes sense: Regulators are interested and concerned when you’re selling a product or asking people to contribute capital.One way to address this risk is to give your token away in an airdrop instead of selling it. Considering that regulatory risk is among the most important factors for these projects, an airdrop could be the path of least resistance (and maximum effect).That said, an airdrop is clearly not a panacea for regulatory risk: If your token is considered a ""security"" by regulators, certain tactics (e.g. requiring people provide personal information or incentivizing promotion to others) will definitely run afoul of securities laws. Coin Center's Peter Van Valkenburgh recently wrote about this. As always, consult proper legal counsel before drawing any conclusions.Most of the crypto community already owns Bitcoin and/or Ether so asking them to buy into your ICO creates friction—especially when your new coin is competitive to the one they already own.However, granting these users free coins to your new network might be an effective way to garner community support.Forking versus AirdropsSo far, I’ve been using the terms “airdrop” and “hard-fork” interchangeably when, in fact, there are important nuanced differences between them—most of which are outside the scope of this article. Fortunately, we needn’t cover the nuanced differences to understand the advantages of each approach and the implications for Bitcoin and Ether holders.What airdrops and hard-forks have in common is that both approaches use ownership of coins on another chain as a way to decide who will receive tokens on a new chain— for example, everyone that owns Bitcoin as of October 27, 2017 at 12:00 UTC will be entitled to a proportional share of tokens on new chain XYZ.A few of the salient differences between airdrops and hard-forks include:Implications for (prospective) Bitcoin and Ether holdersUltimately, if this trend of airdrops and hard-forks continues—and for the advantages outlined above, I think the trend will only accelerate—the holders of existing popular coins stand to benefit significantly: By owning today, they essentially have rights to future coins.It’s likely that airdrops and hard-forks will be predominantly launched off the two most popular chains—Bitcoin and Ethereum—because they have the broadest distribution and industry support. If these coins are set to spawn dozens of new coins over the coming years, there’s an increased urgency to owning them sooner rather than later.Lastly, a reminder that whether or not the coins that emerge from these airdrops and hard-forks have any value long-term remains to be seen—in the meantime, it’s free optionality for Bitcoin and Ether holders.Stay informed and ahead of the crowd with Forbes Crypto Confidential, a free blockchain and crypto assets e-letter delivered to your inbox twice a week.

Today, it's worth almost $215 million.","Tech startup founders tend to live in the future, seeing future developments that most can't yet perceive as achieved facts. The same is true, apparently, of venture capitalists. Tim Draper has led investments in companies like Skype, Tesla, and Twitter.""In five years, if you try to use fiat currency they will laugh at you,"" Draper told me at WebSummit while wearing a tie with cryptocurrency logos on it. ""Bitcoin and other cryptocurriences will be so relevant ... there will be no reason to have the fiat currencies.""Simulated Bitcoin (Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)Bitcoin, of course, is the grandfather of cryptocurrencies and currently has a market capitalization of about $120 billion U.S. That compares poorly to a global fiat currency value in the $2 trillion range. (Fiat currencies, of course, are how cryptocurrency fans tend to refer to national currencies.) But Bitcoin has appreciated over 700% in 2017 alone.Draper's DFJ Venture Capital has long been bullish on Bitcoin. He famously bought 30,000 Bitcoin in 2014 in a government auction of assets seized from Silk Road, the online black market. At the time, it was worth under $20 million.Today, that same 30,000 Bitcoin is worth almost $214 million dollars.Making over $200 million on just one bet might tend to make anyone bullish on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and almost any other cryptocurrencies.And Draper is bullish.Fiat currencies, he says, are bounded by country borders. The Nigerian Naira drops 30% when you cross the border. Outside Argentina, the country's peso is currency non grata, and there are other countries where this is true as well.The U.S. dollar travels pretty well, as does the Euro, but there are challenges here too. Conversions between currencies are often double switches, TNG Fintech Group CEO Alex Kong told me, and losing 1.4% in the switch from currency A to U.S. dollars to currency B is fairly standard.Ethereum founder Vitalik ButerinThat will all disappear soon, Draper says, as we look to cryptocurrencies as stores of value and transfer agents.Even in an ICO-mad universe where new cryptocurrencies are being born in bulk every day. That is of course one of the charges leveled at new tokens and currencies built on cryptographic foundations: hundreds are being created out thin air, and are worth aproximately the same.But Draper thinks we'll survive just fine in an era of hundreds, if not thousands of currencies:""They’re all going to interrelate … and there will be exchange rates for all of them,"" he told me. ""My guess is that it will centralize around a wallet that you have, and when you pay for that Starbucks, your wallet will optimize to whichever currency has most value.""It doesn't necessarily sound simple -- another criticism leveled at the cryptocurrency field -- but Draper thinks that technology and smart marketing will abstract away the complexity.""If it doesn’t get simplified it won’t get adopted ... good marketing people will simplify all use of these things,"" Draper said. ""And we might have a johncoin and a timcoin …we might be trading those in realtime, putting a value on our time and attention."" "

Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, hates Bitcoin, but loves blockchain, Goldman Sachs CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, has embraced blockchain while he is warming to Bitcoin. Admittedly, I suffered from the same love affair with blockchain. As an early adopter of Bitcoin I still had feelings for the currency, but for a period of time I was infatuated with blockchain.Perhaps I should begin with the journey that lead me to Bitcoin. For more than two decades I was a part of Jamie Dimon's and Lloyd Blankfein's world of traditional finance. I began my career as an equities trader and then spent most of the internet bubble trading merger arbitrage -- for those old enough to remember the halcyon days of ""Merger Monday,"" I was the guy placing bets on whether the deal would go through and who would be next. After the internet bubble popped and in the throes of a recession, I started a brokerage firm that catered to mutual funds and other institutional investors. My clients were the old guard of the financial world. We did well, but I didn't find it very exciting.Then I began to trade ADR's (American Depository Receipts). These stocks represented shares in foreign companies and traded on the NYSE and NASDAQ. The trick with this type of trading was to watch the foreign currency markets for unusual moves. When currencies moved and the ADR's did not, there was money to be made. These markets were much more exciting than stodgy blue chip stocks. After a few years playing around in the currency markets, I made the leap to global macro investing.As a global macro investor I could make big bets on macro-economic trends in the global financial markets. I became quite adept at reading central bankers' cryptic messages. With this insight I would place bets on the world's currencies markets 24 hours a day. For a financial markets nerd like me this was exhilarating. The interplay between central bank policy, geopolitics and financial markets was a playground. Then I stumbled onto Bitcoin.Truth be told, I was a doubter at first. I even publicly declared it wouldn't work.When I first dipped my toe into Bitcoin, I was timid. I didn't really want my friends in the traditional finance world thinking I had gone crazy.  However the more I researched, the more I realized I was wrong to dismiss Bitcoin. Bitcoin was a game changer. It was going to challenge everything I knew about financial markets.I was hooked. But I still couldn't bring myself to talk about Bitcoin publicly.Blockchain was easier to talk about. It made me appear to be on the cutting edge and allowed me to avoid the dirty looks and the hushed whispers that followed any mention of Bitcoin. When I talked about blockchain, friends and colleagues would listen intently and engage me with questions about this wondrous new technology. However, once I mentioned Bitcoin they would pull me aside and ask how I was feeling, not so subtly questioning my mental clarity.Blockchain made me feel good, but there was something missing. There was something hollow about blockchain without Bitcoin. I went back and re-examined my first encounter with Bitcoin in an attempt to discover where we had gone wrong.My journey backward started with the problem of clarity. There was not a simple definition of Bitcoin. Defining Bitcoin as a decentralized crypto-currency, elicited angered responses at worst and glazed eyes at best  Bitcoin needed an elevator pitch -- the one sentence that every entrepreneur develops to describe their business in anticipation of meeting the perfect investor while riding in the elevator.Bitcoin is a lot of things to a lot of people, but to me it’s easiest to think of it as software. Bitcoin is a software program that allows people to securely transfer money over the internet without a bank. It does this by replacing the function of a bank with a network of computers running the software that verifies and transfers the money. These computers, known as miners, maintain a global ledger of transactions that is used to validate, verify and transfer money.Prior to Bitcoin, the process for maintaining the transaction ledger remained effectively unchanged since the Medici developed double entry accounting in the 14th century. The Medici process of accounting required banks (conveniently owned by the Medici family) to maintain a ledger of debits and credits that was held at the bank. The modern financial system is simply a network of these ledgers held at each bank.Bitcoin takes the global ledger of transactions out of the control of the banking system and distributes it onto every computer that is connected to the Bitcoin network. Financial behemoths no longer control the system. With Bitcoin the users of the financial system are in control.If I told you that I developed a mobile app that was able to use computers to modernize the 600-year-old process for transferring value, you might think I was crazy or you might ask how to invest. Bitcoin is this app, and the disruption of the 600-year-old double entry accounting system is why I have called Bitcoin one of the most important innovations in the history of finance.Bitcoin accomplishes this disruption not just with blockchain technology but also with the global decentralized currency also called Bitcoin.  The currency ""Bitcoin"" is the incentive for anyone in the world to run the software that changes the way the financial system works.  Banks love blockchain because they get to continue to maintain the ledger of transactions by running the software on their own computers.  But Bitcoin creates competition for the banks in the form of anyone with a computer and an internet connection.Without the currency, there would be no incentive for people to spend money on the computers needed to run the Bitcoin software. Blockchain without Bitcoin replicates the same financial system already in existence. There may be some efficiency gains through sharing private distributed ledgers, but blockchain without Bitcoin is not one of the most important innovations in the history of finance.Don't get me wrong, blockchain is important, but the banks are using it in a way that keeps their power in the financial system intact. I don't blame them. In fact, maintaining the position at the center of the financial system is exactly what a bank CEO is supposed to do. But they are also supposed to recognize when their industry faces a technological disruption. In the mid-1800's the world's street lights were kept alit with whale oil. Then John Rockefeller streamlined the process of refining crude oil. The whaling captains that did not recognize the change were left sailing a barren ocean in search of former riches, while Rockefeller went on to create Standard Oil, the predecessor to Exxon, Mobil, BP and Chevron.Bitcoin, the currency, is the incentive for all of us to become John Rockefeller.  Bitcoin creates the incentive for people to run a new financial system that's outside of the traditional one. The scarcity of Bitcoin drives people to buy the computer equipment and process the transactions (i.e. mine) in hopes of winning some Bitcoin. This self-sustaining incentive system has the potential to loosen the banks grip on the traditional financial system. This self-sustaining system has the potential to turn incredulous bank CEO's into lonely whaling captains.The currency plus blockchain creates a self–sustaining independent financial system that has never existed in modern finance. The currency plus blockchain creates a competitor to the modern financial system that has the potential to redistribute wealth using the power of truly free markets.As I wrote in my book, The Bitcoin Big Bang:[Bitcoin] is a social and economic revolution that will propel the next surge of human development. It will leverage what we have learned about capitalism and fuse it with collaborative consumption to produce a socioeconomic system fueled by the profit motive and serves the needs of society.So yes, Bitcoin matters … and yes, I remembered why I fell for it in the first place."

Vehicles are started up every day to invest and speculate in them. According to the Financial Times, the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority is eyeing new trading platforms that allow you to bet on crypto movements with as much as 30:1 leverage on derivative contracts linked to Bitcoin.Where is this all going? As Bitcoin prices blow past $6,000 a share, millions of investors want a piece of the action. Yet there are far too many questions to answer before cryptos become mainstream investments.In an insightful piece by Karen Webster of pymnts.com, she poses the kinds of questions all investors should be asking:-- Will Bitcoin Actually Replace Traditional Currencies?  ""No one believes in the merits of a global cryptocurrency, except bitcoin zealots.The notion that central banks will give up monetary control of their fiat currencies for a global cryptocurrency, especially bitcoin, is just not happening, so we should stop talking about it. Even economists who never agree on anything, agree on that.Besides, a currency that swings between $1,000 and $5,000 over the course of two years, and between $3,000 and $5,000 in the course of a few weeks, isn’t exactly a good basis for operating a strong and stable foundation for a global financial system.""— Is Bitcoin A Legitimate Exchange Of Value? ""Bitcoin has only two proven use cases after eight years: criminal activity and speculation.I honestly don’t understand why this continues to be dismissed in the face of mountains of evidence to the contrary. In the eight years since bitcoin has been a currency, transaction volume in the support of legitimate commerce is virtually nil.""-- Is Bitcoin Really Free?  ""Bitcoin is anything but free. Miners now expect a fee for their work and won’t process transactions for which they are not paid.That means that those costs are passed down the ecosystem to end users. There’s no such thing as a free lunch, even in the land of bitcoin.""-- Is Bitcoin Immune From Hacking And Fraud?  ""The rising value of bitcoin has made exchanges prime targets for hacking, and thus has made hacks there quite lucrative.The Mt. Gox hack netted $500 million, Bitfinex $72 million, Bitcoinica $460,000, Bitfloor $250,000 and Bitstamp $5.2 million. South Korea’s Bithumb hack last summer — the exchange that serves 75 percent of the South Korean market for bitcoin — resulted in tens of millions of dollars lost for the 30,000 customers affected. Even the wallets that store bitcoin are vulnerable.The FBI reports that some $28 million in losses were reported to them in 2016, triple what they saw in 2015. But that’s only what’s reported.It’s hard to imagine a money launderer or terrorist emailing the FBI to let them know they were hacked and lost money. That means that no one actually knows how much money has been lost to hacking, but the anonymity and irrevocability associated with bitcoin transactions means that the money lost is also irrecoverable.""-- Is It Too Soon For Crypto Derivatives And Margin Trading? With futures contracts on T-bills and corn, you know exactly what you're buying. The markets are backed up by regulated exchanges that have been around for 100 years or more.But with Bitcoin, are you buying bits of computer code or somebody's wildly irrational idea of what those bits and bytes are worth?“There’s a lot of interest from active traders and investors,” Claus Nielsen, head of markets at Denmark’s Saxo Bank, which has no immediate plans to offer crypto-CFDs, told The Financial Times.“But this is not a liquid trading product yet. It’s premature, and not professional, to offer margin trading on cryptocurrencies to the retail segment yet.”"

And when that happens, Bitcoin prices could be driven back to $1000.That’s according to some estimates which set the fundamental value of Bitcoin at $1,142.Still, it may take quite some time for this to happen.“We have known for a long time that rationality of behavior and expectations is not enough to prevent bubbles, as it is not enough to guarantee that the price of an asset is equal to its fundamental value,” says Christos Giannikos, Professor of Finance at Baruch College.But the Bitcoin crowd expects demand to soar, as the digital currency gains a growing acceptance as a medium of transactions, and a speculative “asset.”So what could cool demand for the digital currency?There are a couple of things that could kill the hype for the digital currency and help push demand in the opposite direction. One of them is a Lehman or Enron-style fraud event, not necessarily in the Bitcoin market, but in some other cryptocurrency market, which brings to mind the wild west mentality of mid-19th century capitalism.**As of Monday December 4, 2017, at 7.30 pmSource: Coinranking.comRegister Now: A Beginner's Guide To Bitcoin And Other Cryptocurrencies Free WebcastA major cryptocurrency fraud event could depress demand for Bitcoin in two ways.One of these is a “run on the bank,” style panic as fear replaces greed. That would provide the very much needed excuse for big governments and big banks to tame the growth of the “people’s currency.”The second thing would be the end of easy money. That would push interest rates higher, and take the “air” out of the Bitcoin bubble that has turned into mania.In that light, it should be noted that the 10yr US Treasury yields have already edged closer to 2.50%, almost a point higher than a year earlier.Higher interest rates could put pressure on Bitcoin demand in a couple of ways. One of them is that higher interest rates raise the “opportunity cost,” of money used to buy Bitcoins. That’s especially the case for investors who buy Bitcoins on “margin,” with borrowed money, and are expected to face “margin calls” should the digital currency drops precipitously.Another reason higher interest rates could put pressure on Bitcoin prices is that they would restore “credibility” to central banks and to national currencies they control. That would make alternative currencies like Bitcoin less appealing to the general public.While fraud and the end of money could depress Bitcoin demand, blockchain, the technology that created Bitcoin, can be used to create other cryptocurrencies that compete against Bitcoin, as already it has done.Like Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple, to mention but a few.That would be the bad news for Bitcoin investors.

They can disrupt the market at any moment and can trigger massive buying or sell-offs.","When it comes to Bitcoin, Wall Street isn't quite involved the way it is in stocks and bonds, so the story's still unfolding, although some real dangers lurk.-- Market Concentration Means Big Trades. Whenever a big mutual fund, investment bank or even Warren Buffett trades a big block of stock, they have to file a form with the SEC. That warns the rest of the trading world. Markets hate big surprises.But there are currently no such rules for cryptocurrency traders. According to Tetras Capital, only 100 Bitcoin ""addresses"" control some 20% of the market. That's a huge share. If they decide to dump Bitcoin, these ""whales"" are only going to add to volatility.(Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)Here's an analogy: What if the trading desks of Bank of America, Citibank and Goldman all decided to sell off their Apple holdings? I'm not suggesting that they would ever do this — it's highly unlikely -- but a similar impact could be felt in the bitcoin market.-- The ""Spillover Effect"" Could Mess up Other Markets. Suppose a big Wall Street bank or two amasses a huge position in bitcoin and decides to dump it. It doesn't have to tell any market regulator, so it just unloads it, triggering a huge price decline.And let's also suppose that other mostly-regulated banks do the same because they want to avoid massive losses. To try to offset the losses, these banks may dump stocks and bonds, triggering a wave of sell-offs in those markets.Of course, this is a doomsday scenario and there's no evidence that big banks have garnered large positions in Bitcoin or other currencies — yet.But the current market regulation system only oversees stocks, bonds and derivatives. Cryptocurrencies are on their radar screen, but it may take months or years before they catch up. In the interim, expect epic volatility.""Like tulips and dotcom shares before them, crypto-currencies—the only blockchain technology currently operating at large scale — have gripped the wise and reckless alike,"" notes Steve LeVine in Axios. ""Investors won't lose all the $250 billion in bitcoin that they currently hold when the fever inevitably breaks, but many will forgo paper profits, plus much of their original investment.""-- They Will Play the ""Big Short.' With futures contract trading, you can now play the downside of Bitcoin.Although most people who buy the cryptocurrency are ""long,"" that is, they're holding in hope that Bitcoin will continue to rise, you can also make money if it loses value.But what if a number of big players decide to short the currency at the same time? This could trigger a massive decline. The virtual currency is under no direct market regulation, so there are no rules against this move.Of course, most short sellers know that when the price falls like a rock, they buy in at the lower price and make money on the upswing.When and how this will happen is uncertain. But it's happened countless times in the past from short-selling railroad stocks in the 1880s to a handful of traders shorting mortgage securities in 2008. It's a time-honored practice and it will happen again."

None of the exchanges still trades a BTC/CNY pair, and accounts can no longer be funded or defunded with Chinese Yuan.BTCC’s Chinese division, trading under the domain btcchina.com, still lists itself as based and registered in Shanghai, but all trading happens through its international division, virtually based in Hong Kong and reachable under btcc.com.Huobi and OKCoin both shut down their Chinese sites (huobi.com and okcoin.cn), while still trading through their international companies. Huobi is currently branded as Huobi Pro and lists a Seychelles company in their Terms of Service, while OKCoin has rebranded as OKEx and is registered in Belize, though it maintains staff and offices in Hong Kong.New reality There are currently no laws, rulings, or announcements from regulatory bodies such as the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) or the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) on the legality of Bitcoin and its trading.A visual representation of the digital Cryptocurrency (Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)The circumstances under which Chinese exchanges were shut down and forced out of the country are unknown, and none of the exchanges’ executives have publicly spoken out about their conversations with regulators. While software development, management and customer support often still sits in offices of companies around Beijing and Shanghai, the new realities make it impossible to process Yuan payments of any kind. Instead, deposits are often made through the Tether system, a shadow-bank-like system with tokens supposedly backed by US Dollar deposits held by exchange Bitfinex, which itself is facing banking problems.Peer-to-peer OTCAs the big exchanges rebuild themselves as pure cryptocurrency to cryptocurrency trading houses, with no ability to process fiat currency transactions, buyers and sellers in China are moving to peer-to-peer markets.On platforms like Coincola, Localbitcoins and Poim, buyers find willing sellers, as well as their preferred methods of how to exchange Yuan.

For those with the ability to send money through the country’s tight capital control regime, this price differential can be a lucrative opportunity depending on the cost to move money out of the country. In Hong Kong, four dedicated OTC trading desks, Gatecoin, Octagon Strategy, Circle Trading and Genesis Block now compete for orders that can range between 1 and 10,000 BTC (up to US$10 million).Once Bitcoins are bought cheaply in Hong Kong, they can be sent to China at virtually no cost and without restrictions, where they can be sold on private chat groups and public platforms.While Chinese capital controls remain porous and plenty of relatively cheap options to send money out of the country exist, it is easy to imagine that the ability to easily purchase cryptocurrency and evade state laws will not soothe regulators.We can expect regulation and its enforcement to remain nebulous and swiftly change any time."

[+] (Photographer: Anthony Kwan/Bloomberg).","Note: This article has been updated to make it clearer that a Bitcoin Cash hard fork was initiated on Monday to solve the issues discussed herein.In the aftermath of the abandonment of the SegWit2x proposal by some of its most prominent supports, Bitcoin Cash has seen a spike in interest, and due to the way Bitcoin Cash mining works (or at least how it worked until Monday's hard fork), supporters of the Bitcoin alternative were able to launch a clever propaganda campaign (intentional or not) of sorts against the original Bitcoin over the weekend.Bitcoin Cash’s Mining Difficulty Adjustment AlgorithmTo understand the recent Bitcoin Cash propaganda, one first must understand the spinoff coin’s emergency difficulty adjustment (EDA) feature.Bitcoin has a difficulty adjustment algorithm that is used to keep the time between each new block at around ten minutes. As more hashing power is pointed at the Bitcoin network, it becomes easier to solve the mathematical puzzles that reward miners with new bitcoins and transaction fees. If blocks are being found by miners too quickly, the Bitcoin Difficulty will increase to make it more difficult to find blocks in the future and therefore slow down the pace at which new blocks are found.Conversely, bitcoin mining becomes easier when blocks are being found too slowly.When Bitcoin Cash was first created, it included an alteration to this algorithm that controls the mining difficulty. This was needed because Bitcoin Cash had relatively low support and blocks would be found very slowly if the original Bitcoin’s mining difficulty setting was not changed.While Bitcoin’s mining difficulty is readjusted roughly every two weeks, Bitcoin Cash’s difficulty adjustment algorithm can make changes on a more frequent basis. It is these more frequent changes that miners having been gaming for months. When looking at the history of Bitcoin Cash inflation, it’s easy to find periods of time where blocks are found six or more hours apart followed by new blocks being mined basically every minute.Miners are effectively able to inflate Bitcoin Cash at a rate much faster than was originally intended in Bitcoin. As of this writing, there are around 125,000 more Bitcoin Cash tokens than there are bitcoins, even though they’re supposed to have the same monetary policy.A hard fork intended to fix the problems associated with the EDA feature was activated on Monday.How Bitcoin Cash Mining Negatively Affects BitcoinBecause Bitcoin Cash had these periods of time where blocks are being mined once or twice per minute (or faster), it skewed the economic incentives for miners who were able to mine both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. While the vast majority of the economic value is found on the Bitcoin chain, mining on Bitcoin Cash became more profitable at times because more block rewards were being found over a shorter timeframe.This means that economically-motivated miners were incentivized to stop mining Bitcoin and move over to Bitcoin Cash whenever these fast blocks were rolling out. The drop in Bitcoin’s hashrate led to much slower blocks, which had the side effect of increasing congestion on the network.A higher rate of inflation on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain had effectively been incentivizing miners to lower the capacity of the Bitcoin network over short periods of time such as this past weekend. Bitcoin Cash’s higher rate of inflation from before Monday's hard fork can be seen at fork.lol.The increased congestion on the Bitcoin network is what Bitcoin Cash proponents could use as propaganda on social media because it led to much higher transaction fees and slower confirmations on the Bitcoin network. Of course, those who have recently been pointing out the high fees on the Bitcoin network via Twitter and elsewhere leave out the relevant technical details regarding Bitcoin Cash’s EDA algorithm when talking about this sort of stuff.Bitcoin transaction fees are at outrageous all-time highs right now. pic.twitter.com/EPirMGjOwk— Ryan X. Charles (@ryanxcharles) November 12, 2017It should be pointed out that it’s unclear whether people are participating in this propaganda campaign knowingly or if they just see the higher fees on the Bitcoin network without an understanding of the root cause.It’s unclear if Bitcoin Cash’s EDA was specifically implemented for the purpose of increasing congestion on the Bitcoin network, although Bitcoin Unlimited Chief Scientist has indicated as much.According to data made available by Bitcoin Core contributor Pieter Wuille (see chart below), Bitcoin’s one-day window hashrate estimate declined by more than 50 percent over the weekend, while Bitcoin Cash blocks were being mined left and right.Chart via sipa.bitcoin.be.A clearer indication of Bitcoin’s decreased capacity over the weekend due to Bitcoin Cash’s increased inflation can be seen when searching for Bitcoin blocks mined on November 11, 2017 on Blockchair.com. The results indicate that 81 blocks were mined on that day. This is 56.25% of the number of Bitcoin blocks that would be mined on a normal day (144).Data from BitInfoCharts indicates Bitcoin was experiencing all-time high transaction fees over the weekend. Fees are still high today as the network continues to chug through the transaction backlog.All Fair Game in Bitcoin LandThe use of a higher inflation rate (intentional or not) to bleed miners away from Bitcoin is fair game in the land of cryptocurrencies. Simply put, there are no rules and regulations, and crypto systems are not supposed to be built on everyone getting along and playing nice. Cypherpunks write code.While this weekend’s propaganda campaign may have been able to win over some Bitcoin Cash converts, it’s likely nothing more than a short-term gimmick to pump the price. In fact, the Bitcoin Cash price doubled in value and then lost all of that doubling in a matter of hours over the weekend.#BitcoinCash doubled in value and then went back to where it started in a matter of hours early this morning.

Over the summer, many speculators were hyped about the prospects of “The Flippening,” where the Ethereum market cap would rise about Bitcoin’s market cap for the first time ever. Since then, the ether price has declined around 66% against bitcoin.Chart via CoinMarketCap.com.As the MIT Digital Currency Group’s Tadge Dryja stated at the recent Scaling Bitcoin workshop at Stanford, “Bitcoin is the currency of enemies.”You can’t trust anyone in these markets.

possible to buy Bitcoins in your IRA, and there are several ways to do it. 
The ...","Dec 15, 2017,09:00am EST",Photo credit: stocksnap.io,"When I recently published an article on my website about Bitcoin IRA investing, a firestorm ignited among my readers and listeners of the Self-Directed Investor Talk podcast. When the dust settled, the most common question I’d received, by far, was this:“How can I invest in Bitcoin in my IRA?”The good news is that it is possible to buy Bitcoins in your IRA, and there are several ways to do it. The bad news is that it’s easy to be taken advantage of if you aren’t familiar with the alternative asset capabilities of IRAs and 401(k)s.Does the IRS really allow the purchase of Bitcoin in IRAs?Contrary to popular opinion, IRAs are not limited to stocks, mutual funds and other Wall Street-centric asset classes. In fact, the only asset classes explicitly prohibited by law for purchase in an IRA are life insurance and collectibles.Bitcoin is neither of those. As such, it’s broadly accepted that Bitcoin is not prohibited from purchase in an IRA.But, the lack of an IRS prohibition and an explicit IRS endorsement of Bitcoin are not the same. Because of that, some of the newer “Bitcoin IRA” types of companies use deceptive marketing that directly states or strongly implies that the IRS has approved the investments they offer. But these claims are entirely false and fraudulent, according to the IRS.So, if Bitcoin is not prohibited for purchase in your IRA, how’s it done? Follow these three simple steps:Step 1: Use the right kind of IRA.Yes, Bitcoin is compatible with your IRA. But, when you call your IRA provider to invest in Bitcoin, you’re quite likely to discover that they simply will not facilitate a purchase of Bitcoin with your IRA funds, even though the law doesn’t prohibit it.Why is this?Most IRAs fall under the category of captive accounts, which limit your investment options to the assets directly offered by the IRA company. So, if your IRA company doesn’t directly offer bitcoin to you, you’re out of luck.That is, you're out of luck unless you use a self-directed IRA instead. A self-directed IRA is identical to a captive IRA in every way except one: Where captive IRAs limit your investments to those assets sold by the IRA company itself, self-directed IRAs empower you to invest in any asset the law allows, including Bitcoin.The real distinction between captive IRAs and self-directed IRAs is in the IRA provider itself. So, step one of investing in bitcoin through your IRA is to transfer capital from your current retirement account into an account at one of the many excellent self-directed IRA custodians.Step 2: Establish a Bitcoin wallet.Having transferred capital into a self-directed IRA, you must now set up a “wallet” for use by your new IRA. A wallet is the cryptocurrency equivalent of a safe deposit box that holds the information necessary to buy, sell and use your Bitcoins. Wallets are provided by many vendors and offer varying degrees of security.Before you establish a wallet for your IRA, contact your self-directed IRA custodian to determine their preferred strategy. Some custodians will allow you to establish a wallet directly in the name of your IRA. Others will require you to take the intermediary step of establishing a limited liability company (LLC) within your IRA to hold your Bitcoin wallet.The direct style is certainly simpler, and I suspect it will become the standard in the near future. As for now, it’s usually cost-prohibitive. There are a few Bitcoin-oriented IRA providers that allow direct ownership by your IRA, but most of them are outrageously expensive, frequently charging exorbitant commissions of up to 15% or more of your IRA balance.If you find a reasonably priced IRA provider that allows for direct wallet ownership by your IRA, go for it. Otherwise, the great news is that the alternative of creating an LLC within your IRA to hold your Bitcoin wallet is both simple and inexpensive. You should expect to be charged a few hundred dollars each year to maintain proper government registration of the LLC. If you use this LLC exclusively for Bitcoin trading, the LLC strategy is a simple, elegant and inexpensive solution.Step 3: Fund your Bitcoin wallet with IRA funds only.The final step before actually investing your capital into Bitcoin is to fund your Bitcoin wallet using capital from your IRA -- and only from your IRA. You cannot comingle your IRA funds or its wallet with capital from any other source. Such comingling is unambiguously prohibited by the IRS and will cause you tax problems of a cataclysmic nature.To prevent such problems, always think of this term: exclusive benefit. In other words, your IRA’s Bitcoin wallet (whether owned directly or through an LLC) must be for the exclusive benefit of your IRA. Similarly, all investment capital placed in your IRA’s Bitcoin wallet -- including fees paid to establish a wallet and/or LLC -- must come directly from the funds in your IRA.The IRS offers zero flexibility on this requirement. It’s not even acceptable to use personal funds and then reimburse yourself from your IRA. All of the capital involved in establishing or funding your bitcoin wallet must come directly from and return directly to your IRA (or LLC) with no detours in between.That’s it. By following these three simple steps, you’ll have configured your IRA to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But there is, of course, an additional step you should take before executing your first bitcoin transaction: Consult with an objective, qualified, third-party adviser to confirm whether Bitcoin is right for your IRA and, if so, in what quantities.After all, Bitcoin could change the world and make you rich, or it could result in 100% loss of your capital. Invest accordingly."

It is based in Hong Kong since 2015 and raised $15 million in a little over an hour. It is corrected below.)It's official, blockchain technology has beat one of the biggest authorities on earth. The decentralized nature of what has become the backbone of the cryptocurrency craze has proven its mettle. Bitcoin and a host of other highly speculative digital currencies live another day.Last month, China banned mainland residents from trading in cryptocurrencies on exchanges and made it illegal for Chinese start-ups to raise funds via initial coin offerings -- a hybrid of crowdfunding, venture capital, and initial public offerings, to put it simply. Bitcoin prices fell. Ether prices fell. And then cryptocurrency start-ups shook it all off. It was as if they were punched in the face, shook the cobwebs out of their head, and remembered that this whole blockchain thing is decentralized and autonomous. That's the point. Banned in one country, move to another. Now they're back on their feet in most cases, like a terminator cyborg hard to knock down.Bitcoin prices are over $5,000.China's regulations might have stopped a few start-ups for raising funds, but the general consensus is that this is temporary.""The ethos behind blockchain has been tested,"" says Ken Sangha, COO of Open Money and the Open Project in San Francisco. ""A central, organized and powerful authority -- China -- said 'no' and we all have been tested worldwide because of it. But the system flexed its muscles. It's doing what it was supposed to do.""Sit. Stay. Good Dog.Not even an obedient service dog can sit still forever.Sangha was going to launch an ICO in September for Open Money, a developers platform like Java that would allow app makers to include user options to purchase their products with cryptocurrencies in app stores. The Chinese ban put their ICO on hold. Most of their investors were Chinese. Start-ups from San Francisco to Moscow had similar problems.Malta-based Providence Casino, a physical, crypto coin casino being planned and shooting for an ICO this year was initially targeting Chinese investors in the mainland. They were banned from doing so. Instead of marketing to Chinese en masse, investors are only brought on board if they have personal relationships with the company founders, a sort of who-you-know system of project finance networking.Chinese augmented reality start-up Metaverse reportedly lost out on a number of cross-border tie-ups and other deals. Its CEO Eric Gu did not want to talk on the record.Shanghai-based exchange C2CX had to temporarily scrap their planned joint venture with a Russian company called KickICO as key money men like CyberTrust of Switzerland dropped out for now. That project, a China-Russia exchange for Chinese investors to buy tokens of Russian start-ups listing on KickICO is still planned once the dust settles on the regulatory environment, the two partners said.""China is a main source of crypto investing and the bans just mean that that capital will go to projects based elsewhere because the local ICO platforms will not be able to attract new start-ups,"" says Scott Freeman, CEO of C2CX. ""For China, financing their blockchain companies is just going to happen outside of China. For foreigners looking to tap Chinese money, they will either wait a while or look elsewhere. People are adjusting.""Companies are adjusting. Chinese blockchain developer Bibox set up shop in Estonia, instead.""Let's put it this way, they opened up in Estonia after the ban and moved fast,"" says Vlad Dobrov, a blockchain investing consultant based in Singapore. ""As you can clearly see from their website, from every angle, they are targeting Chinese investors. Their founders all came from the top Chinese exchange. They know what they are doing.""There are ways around the ban, everyone will tell you. They include more peer-to-peer investing done in private rather than the traditional Kickstarter-esque crowdfunding method that some start-ups use on ICO platforms like KickICO in Moscow, now gathering hundreds of new tech companies, including American ones.Non-Chinese ICOs didn't kill their start-up funding plans because of China bans (and subsequent bans in South Korea). Instead, most put their plans to launch on pause to figure out ways to legitimize their activity and find the right investors now that crowdfunding these things in China is illegal under the ban. Chinese with crypto wallet accounts in Singapore, Hong Kong, London and elsewhere are still buying tokens of companies listing on exchanges and still speculating in cryptocurrencies.Open Money found Chinese smart money. They built relationships with Chinese venture funds over the years and private asset managers who are now delving into the crypto markets. Those funds in China are known as ""whales"". The whales tend to be large investment firms with tens of millions of dollars to throw around, often belonging to the family offices of Chinese multi-millionaires and billionaires.""We are definitely getting Chinese money and are still talking to a number of China-based funds,"" Sangha says.See: China's ICO Ban Doesn't Mean It's Giving Up On Cryptocurrency -- ForbesChina-Like Wages Now Part Of U.S. Employment Boom -- ForbesRussia Faces Eternal Battle Over Bitcoin -- ForbesChinese President Xi Jinping delivers a speech during the opening session of the 19th Communist... [+] Party Congress held at the Great Hall of the People on October 18, 2017 in Beijing. Xi is expected to meet with some of the biggest movers and shakers of the blockchain world this month. Cryptocurrency regulations will be a hot topic everyone will be paying attention to in China. (Photo by Lintao Zhang/Getty Images)Truly StatelessNearly all of these new start-ups are developing technology reliant on cryptocurrency as a finance or payment mechanism. All of them are tied into the autonomous, decentralized digital ledger of blockchain technologies. They are bypassing venture capitalists who demand equity in exchange for investment capital. They are all similar in their statelessness. Their founders are often based in countries that are not their first homes. Russians in San Francisco. Chinese in Tallin, Estonia. Their brain power is often separate from their legal offices; offices that are easily movable to other cities and states. Their marketing team is holed up somewhere in the Italian Alps. Unlike Apple and Facebook stocks dominated by American shareholders, their investor base is global, though increasingly Asian.They exist in a sort of virtual, science fiction world and don't have factories or skyscrapers. Their companies can be created in a WeWork rental office, or condo in St. Kitts with good wifi. They launch an ICO and become overnight millionaires. It is a lot like being a garage band with the audience size of Bruce Springsteen, deadmau5, Taylor Swift, and Beyonce, combined. No wonder everyone is doing it. They're everywhere and nowhere at the same time, and for this reason, the powerful Chinese government has failed to put a dent in demand for anything cryptocurrency related.On the other hand, the question is, does China really want to ban it?Most people with first-hand insights into the market there will say no.Red Pulse, a two-year-old Hong Kong-based market intelligence platform covering China's economy and capital markets, did an ICO on Oct. 8 and raised $15 million in less than 90 minutes, despite being closed to mainland Chinese investors. That's double what they were hoping for. The company said many Chinese start-ups are relocating to Hong Kong to raise crypto cash via ICOs.Ian Holtz, founder of Orion Technologies in Denver is now in Barcelona running a new start-up called Aphelion. They're building on the same Chinese platform as Red Pulse, called NEO. Like everyone else in the blockchain community, Aphelion will create their own product token in an ICO planned sometime next month, hoping to follow Red Pulse's path on the NEO platform in raising a few million bucks in a matter of minutes.""NEO took a little hit because the crackdown raised some eyebrows, but I think it is to their benefit in the long run,"" Holtz says, thinking NEO can beat the competition. ""NEO is working directly with the Chinese government from what I've read to carve out what regulations will ultimately look like. They've proven themselves in China. I think there is actually some pride in Beijing at what NEO has accomplished,"" he says.This month, Communist Party leaders will meet with fund managers and major cryptocurrency operators to hammer out what to do about regulations. If they want to centralize something that is innately designed to be decentralized, they will lose out. China money is already going offshore, and it is not just doing it to buy real estate anymore. It's going offshore to invest in digital assets.""We've had many investors from China with mutual investment agreements of $10 million or more and now all of them plan to register funds outside of the country where it is easier for them to participate in ICOs,"" says Alex Bessonov, CEO of Silicon Valley-based BitClave, a company building search-data privacy software powered by blockchain technology. ""It's entirely proper for the Chinese government to seek protections for consumers and prevent investor fraud. But to confine capital raising as the central bank would do is to ignore the enormous societal value that blockchain technology presents,"" Bessonov says.Chinese regulators clearly wanted to avoid panic in the market. ICOs were being launched like fireworks on a Chinese New Year. The central bank demanded companies return funds to their investors. Most of them did, only to get the money back through Hong Kong and Singapore based bank accounts, sources in China who wished to remain anonymous said.Other firms working with high net worth Chinese in Shanghai and New York said mainlanders will go to Hong Kong. ""Everyone is looking for fast money in China, and the liquidity to get in and out of an investment,"" says Tristan Zhang, managing director of Helix Capital. ""We know where a lot of them went; they went right to Hong Kong and did their ICOs there instead.""Chinese investing culture is casino-like. Some new coins have literally doubled overnight once retail Chinese investors got a hold of them. The last thing Beijing wants to see is a bunch of unsophisticated investors losing thousands in speculative investments in start-ups that have no assets, no income stream, and may even be nothing but snake oil.""I think regulatory efforts should focus on containing and limiting the potential for harm,"" says Bessonov. ""We are hopeful ICOs will come back to China again."""

Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen a major increases in their price and market cap, but how sustainable is their market dominance?I recently spoke with Daria Arefieva from CryptoFriends - a company that specializes in high‑end blockchain‑related events - at a blockchain conference in Singapore. According to Arefieva, we are witnessing the rise of new platforms as a result of ongoing challenges the big players are facing.As Blockchain and cryptocurrencies continue to develop, we will see many different types of platforms — not just Bitcoin or Ethereum but hundreds if not thousands of others. As we have seen in previous technology cycles, it is not always the first or second that become the default tech of choice. As the months and years go by and the technology matures, we will begin to see how crypto standards will work and be associated with more of our day-to-day activities.Old players, new landscapeFinancial services have already felt the impact of blockchain, but other industries should experience the disruption as soon as blockchain adoption widens. At the center of this are the two top blockchains, Bitcoin and Ethereum.While it has been common to lump these two together as cryptocurrencies, it’s important to make distinctions as to how these two blockchains are dictating crypto activities. Bitcoin was designed primarily as a digital currency while Ethereum was built to be a development platform.Several other blockchain platforms are already challenging their dominance in their respective functions. Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash have both risen in price during this latest bull run of cryptocurrencies showing that Bitcoin isn’t the only digital currency that could draw demand from investors. Smart contract platforms like NEO and EOS are also challenging Ethereum. NEO, in particular, is aspiring to offer better smart contracts compared to what Ethereum currently offers.With that, businesses and developers considering adopting blockchain may have to look for alternatives if they want speed and scale. Financial blockchain platforms such as Ripple and Stellar both promise faster confirmation times compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Smart contract platform Qtum, for instance, boasts a faster consensus algorithm compared to Ethereum while Jelurida-developed Ardor offers scalability and customizability through its child chain technology.The Problem of ScaleOne may recall that before Bitcoin’s meteoric rise in price to nearly $20,000, it was under threat of a hard fork. The entire hard fork controversy revolved around the debate concerning the way to scale the network. The fork was supposed to double Bitcoin’s block size in order for the network to accommodate more transactions. The fork didn’t happen, and the scale issue of Bitcoin remains. Until today, it’s common to have more than 100,000 unconfirmed transactions pending on the network.Ethereum is also having some issues regarding scale. Even founder Vitalik Buterin acknowledged scalability issues.Scalability sucks; the blockchain design fundamentally relies on bottlenecks where individual nodes must process every single transaction in the entire network.Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum Foundation and Bitcoin Magazine, speaks during the... [+] TechCrunch Disrupt 2017 in San Francisco, California, U.S., on Monday, Sept. 18, 2017. TechCrunch Disrupt, Etheruem is currently the 2nd largest coin by market cap and the authority in terms of building blockchain apps, but will Ethereum keep it's crown forever? Photographer: David Paul Morris/BloombergSpeed greatly affects application usability. Given the impatience of today’s users, building on slow and laggy technology could grossly affect services’ performance and limit future growth. The CryptoKitties episode simply highlighted this issue.Ethereum’s developers are working on ways to improve the platform’s scalability, including a shift from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS) as means of validating transactions and achieving consensus. PoS is supposedly more cost effective, and Ethereum’s development team is already working towards implementing it.Businesses Need Speed and FlexibilityScalability is a key reason why some organizations hedge their blockchain adoption. Speed and flexibility are critical to most business use cases – two things that both Bitcoin and Ethereum chains seem to struggle with. Other blockchain platforms see this as a way to distinguish themselves from the two giants.Financial institutions could consider using Ripple and Stellar instead of Bitcoin. Both are built for use in financial transactions and both boast of confirmation times of seconds thanks to their own consensus algorithms. This gives them the advantage over the minutes or even hours it takes Bitcoin to confirm transactions. Japan Business Consortium is set to use Ripple to power its cross-border and domestic payments.Smart contract developers could also explore platforms such as Qtum for their applications. Qtum already uses PoS for consensus, promising better performance and uptime. Qtum’s x86 virtual machine (VM), which is used to execute its smart contracts, is able to handle greater complexity compared to Ethereum VM. It also allows smart contracts to be coded using popular 32-bit programming languages such as C, C++, and Java. Ethereum mainly supports lesser known languages LLL, Solidity and Serpent. Storage on Ethereum is also a concern.Permanent storage is by and far the most expensive resource on the Ethereum blockchain. It is completely impractical to store any significant amount of data on the blockchain. In current network conditions, 1Kb of data is ~$2.50, depending on how fast you want it to confirm. This means 1Mb is over $2,000. So, it's impractical to store any significant data on the blockchain. However, this is for traditional storage. There are unconventional alternatives to the framework Ethereum lays out, shares Qtum co-founder Jordan Earls.Jordan Earls, Qtum co-founder and co-chair of the Smart Contracts Alliance believes that Ethereum's... [+] flaws are a breeding alternative blockchain protocols to rise.Aside from speed, those looking to build more customized applications need customizability in their development platform. Ethereum supposedly serves this need, but until the scalability issue is addressed, developers may have to opt to build on other platforms.Jelurida, the group behind the NXT platform, has been working on a new Blockchain-as-a-Service project called Ardor. Ardor allows businesses to take control of their own child chain. Each child chain can operate as a separate entity with its own token. These child chains are still confirmed by nodes in the network for transparency but can be pruned at a set time in order to prevent network congestion and bloat.Ethereum is facing challenges on several different fronts: the inherent security problems introduced by programmable smart contracts, the wasteful proof work consensus algorithm and the inability to properly scale the network. While the Ethereum team do present theoretical solutions to some of these problems, the sheer complexity of their design means that it will take a very long time to implement these solutions if at all. said Lior Yaffe, Managing Director and Co-founder of Jelurida, who created both NXT and Ardor, in a recent interview.Lior Yaffe, Managing Director and co-founder of Jelurida speaks in an interview for El País.... [+] Jelurida offers Blockchain as a service (BaaS) integration with its two main blockchain protocol's - NXT and Ardor - which he believes are solving different issues that exist within the Ethereum protocol.The Power of ChoiceDevelopers clearly have to weigh their needs for scalability and performance when choosing a platform. Having a mismatch between a platform’s capabilities and a project’s technical requirements could be catastrophic.Businesses and developers may also have to further evaluate the requirements of their use cases. This said, the choice is still a crucial one since the blockchain platform will be core to projects. The blockchain will be core to their adoption. It may take significant rework should they opt to switch from one platform to another. Other factors that can influence this decision are the strength of development teams behind the platforms, their communities, and the ecosystem of dapps, miners, and users that use them.This healthy competition between platforms should also compel their respective development teams to continue improving their technologies. Developers could expect stability as blockchain technology matures.The great thing about having several blockchain and smart contract platforms is choice. Instead of being limited and constrained by one dominant technology, developers gain flexibility by choosing a platform that best suits their requirements and without being forced to stick with the dominant ones."

certain math problems. Mining operations have turned from college ...","Dec 14, 2017,10:26am EST",Shutterstock,"Unless you’ve been hiding under a rock, you know bitcoin prices have gone bananas. I’m not even going to quote any numbers. Anything I say will be laughably wrong by the time you read this.Could some virtual currency that only exists on a computer screen really be worth these crazy prices?Maybe. If you think it will become a major medium of exchange, bitcoin is far underpriced.That’s a big “if” we’ll discuss in a minute.First, let’s look at some more practical issues.Bitcoins enter the digital world when someone “mines” them by solving certain math problems. Mining operations have turned from college students sitting at their laptops to huge enterprises that use massive computing power to run ever more complex math calculations. Some of the computers dedicated to solving those math problems fill entire buildings.Bitcoin’s anonymous inventor, who called himself Satoshi Nakamoto, built scarcity into the system. Mining gets more difficult as time passes and the supply increases. No one will ever hit a mother lode and double the bitcoin supply overnight.As the math gets more complicated and the computers have to work harder, bitcoin mining consumes an increasing amount of electricity. And that’s starting to be a problem.Here’s science writer Eric Holthaus at Grist:In Venezuela, where rampant hyperinflation and subsidized electricity has led to a boom in bitcoin mining, rogue operations are now occasionally causing blackouts across the country. The world’s largest bitcoin mines are in China, where they siphon energy from huge hydroelectric dams, some of the cheapest sources of carbon-free energy in the world. One enterprising Tesla owner even attempted to rig up a mining operation in his car, to make use of free electricity at a public charging station.That’s pretty crazy, but it gets crazier.In just a few months from now, at bitcoin’s current growth rate, the electricity demanded by the cryptocurrency network will start to outstrip what’s available, requiring new energy-generating plants. And with the climate conscious racing to replace fossil fuel-based plants with renewable energy sources, new stress on the grid means more facilities using dirty technologies. By July 2019, the bitcoin network will require more electricity than the entire United States currently uses. By February 2020, it will use as much electricity as the entire world does today.This is an unsustainable trajectory. It simply can’t continue.Not to put too fine a point on it, but this is bonkers.I have not independently verified these claims. In the comments section at the bottom of Eric’s article, many expert-sounding people dispute them. So maybe he’s wrong.Still, the broader point seems right. Bitcoin mining and transaction processing consumes a lot of power, and we don’t have infinite amounts of it.A trend that can’t continue, won’t—so something will change it. Here’s a partial list of possibilities:Of those, government interference is probably bitcoin’s greatest threat. Governments don’t like the anonymity, because it facilitates tax evasion, money laundering, smuggling, and other illegal acts.But there’s something even more basic to consider.You can’t talk about bitcoin for long before you get to the “What is money?” question.My favorite answer: Money is simply the most liquid asset in a given place and time. Almost everyone accepts it as payment because they trust it, and they trust it because they know others accept it.Could bitcoin or another cryptocurrency ever reach that status? Maybe, but it will have to cross a very wide moat.Pull a Federal Reserve Note from your wallet. Look closely and you’ll see a legend that reads “This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private.”Your dollar bill is legal tender for all debts, public and private. The government says everyone must accept it, so we do.Nothing prevents us from accepting other currencies as well. You can trade chickens for cows, or vice versa, if everyone agrees. But you’ll still have to report any taxable gain in dollar terms and pay tax in dollars.That’s the “public” part of the legal-tender legend.In the modern world, governments define money because they have the raw power to define how you must pay your taxes. They can and will use force to make you pay—and deadly force if you resist too hard.The IRS doesn’t accept cows, chickens, yen, gold, or bitcoin. It demands dollars. Don’t have any? Get some or go to prison.As long as we pay a significant part of our income in taxes,That means most people will default to using the same currency for personal spending and investing. This gives government-issued money an automatic advantage over bitcoin or any other competitor.When national governments start accepting bitcoin for tax payments, you can fairly call it “money.” Until then, it’s simply another risk asset like gold, stocks, or pork bellies.Is bitcoin a risk asset you should own? Probably not, unless you are prepared for some serious pain whenever the price heads south.I don’t know when that will happen. Bubbles get way bigger than anyone thinks possible, but at some point they all pop. This one will too."

This means once a “deal” is made, neither party can go back and rewrite the terms. Smart Contracts––a blockchain based contract that holds both parties accountable by only completing the terms of the agreement once both parties have fulfilled their end of the bargain––is a perfect example.Blockchain serves as a bookkeeping platform or ledger that is incorruptible, enforces transparency, and bypasses censorship. By tackling issues of financial, political and institutional corruption, this has the potential to create massive social change—and greatly protect the human rights of every individual.We’re already seeing some of this amazing work unfold.Here’s how.1. Tacking the Refugee CrisisThis year, the UNWFP sent over 10,000 Syrian refugees cryptocurrency-based vouchers.Led by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, and blockchain big data firm Datarella, Parity Technologies put this platform into action and helped thousands of refugees use cryptocurrency to purchase food, according to Coindesk.In 2014, the Syrian crisis had “become the biggest humanitarian emergency of our era,” said António Guterres, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Today, the global refugee crisis continues to grow, and the agencies and countries who are heavily invested are having to look toward new solutions to solve an otherwise unmanageable situation.The opportunity to bypass bureaucracy and international uncertainty with Ethereum technology not only gives refugees direct access to donations, but stands as a huge first step in including them in dialogue aimed at solving the international refugee crisis.2. Creating financial avenues for the world's most impoverished peopleThe same blockchain platform used to provide financial vouchers to refugees is also working to bridge a poverty gap around the world. As we’ve already seen, blockchain can act as a bank-like institution for people without bank accounts.As long as you have access to a smartphone, you’ll have a way to conveniently access money.Additionally, blockchain is a decentralized system, which means you don’t get charged to transfer money the way you would with typical financial institutions. This disrupts the international socio-economic landscape because remittance is costly, and as such can deter businesses from reaching certain regions of the world, severing opportunities for developing nations. It also creates a financial strain for people sending money to their family members overseas.Last year, the total amount it cost to send money to Sub-saharan Africa was over $30 billion, and according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the yearly remittance from international financial transfers out of the US is up to $50 billion.BitPesa, a platform that sends and collects crypto-payments between Africa and the rest of the world, is an excellent example of the positive effects and economic freedom blockchain technology can offer.This is exceptionally promising, considering Africa is currently the most costly continent to send money to.This technology tackles two huge variables of global poverty. First, it makes sending money cheaper for migrants, immigrants, and refugees who need to send money back to their families, and second, it makes doing business with hard-to-reach countries more convenient.This alone has the potential to lessen extreme poverty.3. Preventing voter fraudCybersecurity and voter fraud have been exceptionally concerning since the United State’s 2016 election. Unfortunately, this isn’t the first time voter legitimacy has been question.Voter fraud is a critical imposition on the productive and accountable formation of democracy across the globe.Blockchain technology has the ability to provide an unhackable electronic vote-counting system. This system can secure an election during voter registration, and can account for the voters identification and insure votes cannot be tampered with at a later date.In the same way blockchain acts as a public ledger for cryptocurrencies, it can also create a permanent and public ledger for votes as tallied—promising a future of equitable democratic elections around the world.There’s a startup already working on this called Follow My Vote.4. Improving Government EfficiencyBlockchain has the ability to accelerate governmental capabilities, and affect functions like public benefits, healthcare and education.For example, government processes can be slow, difficult to understand, and highly susceptible to corruption. Blockchain, as a solution, can aid governments in being more efficient and secure—in every sense.The archaic technology in hospitals around the world create unnecessary issues for medical patients and their records. MedRec is a perfect example of what blockchain is looking to improve within healthcare. According to MIT Media Lab, MedRec is, “a novel, decentralized record management system for EMRs that uses blockchain technology to manage authentication, confidentiality, accountability, and data sharing.”Blockchain, as both a technology and an industry, is still largely undefined. We are in an exploration stage, far from any established or proven solutions. However, it’s a promising (and relevant) solution aiming to solve for some of human right’s most vulnerable areas: corruption, financial inequality, and access to information.By setting an international precedent-––and hopefully a standard––for transparency, blockchain tech is closing the economic gap and solving for the preservation of human rights.This question originally appeared on Quora - the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.

Photographer: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg","While much of the world remains unaware or skeptical, Bitcoin and its crypto-cousins are quietly building a parallel financial system. It’s a friction-less system of economic networks with global 24/7 availability and advanced functionality that, in many respects, already exceeds the capabilities of big banks and legacy financial infrastructure.This rapidly emerging crypto-economic network will become the world’s largest and you, dear reader, will one day be an eager and delighted user. Importantly, this parallel financial system—which is built on the back of public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum—is its own distinct ecosystem, not an “add-on” to legacy banking products. (Disclosure: My firm, Blockchain Capital, invests in blockchain startups and crypto assets.)There’s a lot of questions: Why should anyone care about this parallel world of crypto-finance? Why are tens of thousands of developers dedicating themselves to building out these economic networks which, in aggregate, are already valued north of $120 billion? Who will be the winners in this sea change of money and finance?Digital infrastructure for a digital ageFirst, let’s address the most important question: Why is this happening? Why is this parallel world of crypto-finance emerging so rapidly and why are so many of the brightest minds dedicating themselves to this space?At the core, it comes down to a simple reality: That which is natively digital is more functional. The parallel world of crypto-finance is enabling the world’s first natively digital assets. Natively digital goods are programmable and free from the constraints that limit us in the offline world.Many years ago, PayPal helped bring money into a digital age by creating a layer on top of legacy systems. But while PayPal made it easier to use legacy financial infrastructure in a digital context, it didn’t create new financial infrastructure. PayPal is a digital front-end with an offline legacy back-end. In contrast, public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are new financial infrastructure: Digital infrastructure for a digital age.Programmable assetsTwo examples that highlight the advanced functionality of natively digital assets are “time-locked transactions” and “multi-signature transactions.”  The former allows users to “lock” bitcoin such that it can only be spent or withdrawn at a particular point in the future while the latter allows users to specify that particular bitcoins are restricted from being spent or withdrawn unless, say, 2 of 3 people agree (or 7 of 10, or whatever parameter the user establishes).These are things that I can replicate in the traditional financial system with crude hacks that require hours of legal time and effort to create something like a Trust. However, that cost and burden has been reduced to a couple lines of code in Bitcoin and Ethereum. “Time-locked” and “multi-signature” transactions are just two early examples of what will become dozens and eventually hundreds of advanced functions that will be combined in novel new ways. Programmable money is finally here.Software is finally eating the world of financial assets and value transfer and the outlook is incredible. We’re talking about an empowering world of advanced functionality, seamless exchange, and 24/7 global availability.Surviving without Big BanksBut how do we get there? After all, the big banks and legacy financial system as a whole have been hesitant to even acknowledge Bitcoin, let alone support, integrate or build off public blockchains.I used to struggle with this conundrum: On the one hand, public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are the valuable innovation that can change finance and money forever but, on the other hand, banks are subject to regulations that make it difficult or impossible to fully integrate these chains. It’s a “square-peg, round-hole” problem.For years, the question was whether these public blockchains could survive out in the cold on their own without support from the legacy system. However, as these blockchains have grown in value from $1 billion to north of $120 billion, that question has been definitively answered: They aren’t waiting for permission or support—they are creating a parallel world of crypto-finance.But who will be the winners and losers in this parallel world of crypto-finance?Winners and losers: banks, tech companies and startupsSo how will banks and technology companies be affected by this transition? Who will be the winners?Given their constraints, I expect that legacy financial institutions will be confined to the fringes of this rapidly emerging parallel world. It’s entirely possible that legacy financial institutions will only be as relevant to this new crypto economic network as telephone companies were to the internet: Valued on- and off-ramps but not much more.I expect that big banks will begin to offer rudimentary services for crypto-assets such as trading and custodianship over the next 12-24 months. The good news for legacy financial institutions is that this is a new product to sell and may help engage an otherwise difficult-to-capture millennial audience.The bad news is that crypto-assets like Bitcoin inside the legacy financial system will really only be a launch pad to something else: The parallel world of crypto-finance.In this sense, Bitcoin is a passport to a new, voluntary economic network—one that is natively digital and more functional than its legacy predecessor. It’s an opt-in system that users will adopt not because JPMorgan said to, but because it’s capabilities and fundamental features drive user adoption.After all, users didn’t wait for City Hall to figure out Uber, they just started using it. They didn’t wait for the post office to get faster, they just chose email. Similarly, you don’t have to wait for JPMorgan to evolve, you can start using Bitcoin at any time.In the forthcoming battle to capture market share in crypto-finance, tech companies will likely fare better than legacy financial institutions— this will be the tech industry’s first real push to create and support new financial infrastructure.Why will tech companies be able to capture more of the opportunity than legacy financial institutions? Simply put, tech companies are better positioned to assume the substantial risk involved in pursuing new ventures with large upside opportunity. In contrast, banks and their investors are more conservative with lower growth expectations (that’s why you’ve never heard of a “Moonshot Factory” at Citibank).The difference in expectations is evident in comparing the P/E ratios of large tech companies vs. Big banks. While JPMorgan and Bank of America have P/E ratios of 13-15x, Google and Facebook have P/E ratios of 34-37x. Investors pay ~2.5x more for each dollar earned by Google and Facebook than they do for each dollar earned by JPMorgan and Bank of America because they expect the former group to grow into huge new markets (like crypto-finance).Comparing P/E ratios of technology companies and banksEven then, while large established tech companies will likely capture more of the crypto market than banks, I expect that the majority of the opportunity will be captured by new startups.The desire from established tech companies to capture new markets will certainly push them toward the crypto industry but, like banks, they also have a lot to lose and will be similarly constrained by regulatory concerns. As a result, large established tech companies won’t be the most aggressive in building out crypto infrastructure and applications.The crypto industry is still very risky and, simply put, startups are best positioned to assume risk. For this simple reason, I expect startups will capture the majority of the value created in the crypto industry over the next three to five years.The fear of new technologyAs with any new technology, there’s also an element of fear associated with cryptocurrencies. The first thing to recognize is that this parallel world of crypto-finance is not a threat. It’s an opt-in, voluntary world of cryptocurrencies, cryptographic protocols, and digital assets that together are creating the world’s largest economic network.You don’t have to use it and it’s not going to make the legacy financial system function any worse than it already is. You didn’t have to give up Walmart to try Amazon. Similarly, you don’t have to give up Wells Fargo to try Bitcoin, Ethereum, or smart contracts—and I expect that most people will want to try these things over the next few years.As with any new technology, there will be significant ups and downs for the crypto industry, and they’ll be far more evident than they have with past disruptive technology trends because assets like Bitcoin and Ether trade 24/7 from day 1 whereas fluctuations in the value of Facebook and Snapchat were opaque until their equity was traded publicly many years later.Ultimately, this technology isn’t going to be un-invented, it’s not going away—on the contrary, it’s getting stronger, more resilient, and more functional. It’s being built outside of the legacy financial system and, over the next few years, users will increasingly find themselves popping over from the old system to the new system to pursue new opportunities and leverage its advanced functionality. "

(Photo by Dan... [+] Kitwood/Getty Images)Economists have a strict definition of what counts as money.For anything to be considered such, it must have three attributes. They are as follows.If anyone of these attributes disappears then quickly after that, the other two roles disappear also.For instance, if whatever you use as money doesn't keep its value then it will quickly lose its role as a medium of exchange or as a unit of account.Such a thing happened during a 1983 crisis in the then British-rule territory of Hong Kong. Fiscal problems were added to by political concerns over how the colony would be ruled when Britain's 99-year lease expired in 1997. The result was that a declining value of the currency meant that it lost its role as a medium of exchange until a the hong kong dollar's value was pegged to that of the U.S. dollar. At that point, the value of the Hong Kong dollar stabilized, and the money returned to regular use.Bitcoin hasn't lost its status as money because so far it has never had such a status.Of course, none of this says that Bitcoin won't one day become money somewhere in the world. Just that it hasn't made it yet."

In the near term, it struck me that Bitcoin is behaving as a Giffen good.Giffen goods are defined as ""those goods whose demand rises as their price rises."" This is the opposite of how most goods behave - as prices rise, demand falls off.  In the case of Bitcoin, it seems clear to me that we are in a stage where rising prices fuels further demand - like a Giffen good.This makes sense, because as I have said, so many people I talk to are examining bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies) to see if they fit in their portfolio or not.  As they search for information, they constantly run into the bitcoin 'evangelists' who adore cryptocurrencies and never have a bad word to say about them.  Even problem is only a minor setback on the path to widespread acceptance and new highs.  At the other end of the spectrum, they come across the 'bitcoin is a bubble' writing that is also prevalent.  So they are torn whether we are still in the early stages of a brand new system that will revolutionize money as we know it, or we are creating values that will make the Tulip Mania seem reasonable.I think higher prices, for now, will attract more interest.  As prices rise, more people who question the validity, will decide it is worth a shot to invest.  I currently think that behavior is how a Giffen good works, the detractors will quickly point out that a Giffen good and what makes a bubble occur is nonexistent.  The detractors may be correct (I continue to believe that blockchain will be important over the long run - I am less convinced that Bitcoin will be viable in the long run - but that doesn't stop me from attempting to trade it).The creation of a Bitcoin ETF would accelerate the  price rise in the near term.  Many of the potential buyers who I speak to, who are becoming more convinced that they are missing out on something as they see the price rise, would much prefer to invest (speculate) using more traditional vehicles - like an ETF in their brokerage account.  Until that occurs, there will be some pool of potential buyers who just aren't willing to spend the time and effort to create wallets and truly join the crypto world (though that group is shrinking as prices rise).So for now, rising prices will likely lead to more buyers, as doubters and skeptics become converted.  The danger, is that falling prices will tend illicit more sellers, as fears that the 'bubble theory' is correct will resonate.  For that to occur, I think we need to see another concerted attempt by governments or central banks to push back.Some will say that the stock market behaves as a Giffen good - especially for momentum investors, but I disagree.  Stocks have some long term metrics that investors understand.  They may be willing to enter into new territory relative to that metric - but many investors will not buy merely because price is higher.  Sellers will emerge as valuations become stretched.  Something like Bitcoin, with no traditional valuation metrics is very different from the stock market."

But is it worth considering the other side of the argument. Is there any chance – any at all – that Bitcoin isn’t a bubble?I recognise that the finest minds have said that Bitcoin is a bubble and that it displays all the bubbliest of bubbly qualities – a rapidly rising share price based on limited underlying business, plus cab drivers and your brother in law are talking about it.The alternative argument is that it unquestionably serves a purpose. In a recent paper, investment group Payden & Rygel said: “The birth of bitcoin marks the arrival of a novel economic institution—just like the emergence of nation-states, joint stock corporations, private clubs, or stock markets before it.”Their view is that the entire point of bitcoin is to create a form of ‘digital cash’ for use in the digital world. They say: “Buying stuff on the internet is more of a challenge. Cash payments? Impossible. And credit card online purchases present plenty of frictions, too. Often one needs to re-enter the card and cardholder information each time one makes a purchase. Worse, transaction fees are high and many people around the world don’t own credit cards.“These are the problems bitcoin sought to remedy. The world needed a way to make peer-to-peer, “cash-like” payments online. In 2008, the pseudonymous bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto wrote in a paper detailing the idea behind bitcoin that, while “costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency...no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party.”Its purpose may be even broader. In a recent speech, economist Dr Pippa Malmgren, said that governments with enormous debt problems had a number of choices: they can rein in public services, which is a tough call politically; they can hope for inflation, which brings social problems; they can say they won’t pay their creditors, or they will pay their creditors less. An alternative option is to completely abandon the system of accounting and money and start again. Wacky? Yes. But it has been done before: In 1834, tally sticks were replaced with paper money.Bitcoin is this alternative option. For governments and central banks, there is a real advantage. It makes it easier to implement extreme monetary policy, such as negative interest rates, because people can no longer squirrel cash under their beds.At the same time, many have suggested that its only real purpose is as a money-laundering tool. For Jeroen Bos, fund manager at Church House Investments, this is part of the reason the price could remain high: “For a money launderer, it is of great interest that the price of Bitcoin is as high as possible in order to facilitate ever-increasing amounts of money; it clearly works in their favour to have the price at the highest possible level. It is not a store of value for them, just a reference price. Art is often used for money laundering, especially paintings, as it is much easier to launder money with a £10m painting than it is with a painting costing £500.”For him, the price of Bitcoin could continue to rise, based on two factors: There are only a finite number of Bitcoins in existence, the maximum that it will ever reach is 21 million coins, which is likely to be around 100 years away; and the higher the value of the bitcoin, the more attractive it becomes for money laundering. As such, it could yet become a real store of value.The biggest problem for Bitcoin investors is that all these might support the price of Bitcoin, or they might support the price of any number of other cryptocurrencies. There are increasingly loud mumblings about rival HashGraph, for example, which is “a data structure and consensus algorithm that is faster, fairer, and more secure than blockchain.” That’s its own description, but one that a few have agreed with.Equally, just because it's changing the world doesn't mean it needs to cost the earth, and increasingly, that is what the pricing suggests. It still looks pretty much like a bubble to me. However, it doesn’t mean it’s not revolutionary."

greater than the market capitalization of McDonald's. This is remarkable ...","Editors' Pick|Dec 10, 2017,11:27pm EST","In less than a decade, bitcoin has gone from being an obscure curiosity to a household name. Its value has risen -- with ups and downs -- from almost nothing to $16,000 at the time of writing.","Bitcoin’s rise is spectacular. Its price is up almost thirtyfold in the past two years. Currently, the value of Bitcoin in circulation is more than US$170 billion, greater than the market capitalization of McDonald’s. This is remarkable because unlike McDonald’s, which has stores in almost every corner of the world, Bitcoin as a virtual currency is hardly even transacted in the real world.Bitcoin is a mirageThe rise in Bitcoin’s value reflects speculation about its future value: This digital currency will have long-term value as long as it is accepted as a medium of exchange and a store of value.The greater its acceptance, the more it will be worth. However,  it is difficult for Bitcoin to be accepted as real money. Therefore, the high volatility of its value largely reflects changes in the perceived degree of acceptance.
By design, there are inherent weaknesses that prevent Bitcoin from becoming real money.For it to be real money, Bitcoin must be a viable and stable store of value. It is a poor store of value because of its extreme volatility. Bitcoin’s price is characterized by wild swings, both up and down, with the potential to move more than 20% in a single day. This volatility is almost by construction because Bitcoin’s supply is relatively fixed but demand can change dramatically.More On Forbes: ICOs: A Gold Mine Or Fool's Gold?While the supply of individual cryptocurrencies may be limited, the supply of cryptocurrencies in aggregate is unlimited. They have low barriers to entry. Anyone can create a new cryptocurrency. For example, a digital cryptocurrency, Potcoin, was created to facilitate transactions within the cannabis industry.Bitcoin valuation has rocketed in 2017. (Alain Pitton/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Bitcoin’s utility as a medium of exchange is still very limited.  While there might be more usage of cryptocurrencies in the future, it is inconceivable for governments to allow the widespread adoption of them.  Governments will want to keep government-backed currencies as they do not want to give up their ability to control policy levers such as money supply and fiscal policy.  At the same time, banks and financial institutions are creating their own private cryptocurrencies to rival public cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.Blockchain holds promiseWhile Bitcoin’s future is still highly speculative, there is a need to differentiate between Bitcoin and Blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin.A blockchain is essentially a distributed database of records or public ledger of all transactions that have been executed and shared among participating parties. Each transaction in the public ledger is verified by consensus -- a majority of the participants in the system.More On Forbes: To Blockchain Or Not To Blockchain?Once entered, each transaction is encrypted and cannot be replicated or altered. Transactions are validated by a network of users called “miners” who donate their computing power in exchange for the chance to gain additional virtual coins using a shared database and distributed processing.Currently the most prevalent blockchain application is the Bitcoin blockchain. This has some characteristics with significant drawbacks.Blockchain technology has potential benefits across a wide range of industries, such as monitoring... [+] the supply chain in agriculture. (HOANG DINH NAM/AFP/Getty Images)The Bitcoin blockchain is anonymous and “permission-less” -- It does not reveal identity or offer privacy. This has led to various reports on the role of Bitcoin in illicit activities.Bitcoin’s cryptography required to achieve consensus slows processing down and currently such an infrastructure could not scale to cope with large transaction volumes.Blockchain technology is promising but still experiencing growing pains. It can evolve into different areas. While nothing else has achieved the same scale as Bitcoin, alternative blockchains offer other benefits, such as increased speed, larger data capacities and different consensus methods.More On Forbes: Bitcoin: Low-Hanging Fruit?Blockchain technology is finding application in wide range of areas: Banks can use blockchain to make secure, low-cost and faster transactions. Beyond financial transactions, blockchain technology can be used to put proof of existence of all legal documents, health records, and loyalty payments in the music industry, notary, and private securities.To sum up, there’s a lot of excitement about Bitcoin, but unrealistic expectations that it will become real money.There are similarities with how people in the mid-1990s thought Netscape Navigator, the world’s first commercial Web browser, was synonymous with the Internet and would be the big winner in the new Internet era; its valuation skyrocketed to nearly $3 billion by the close of the first day of its public listing in 1995.Slightly more than a decade later, the plug was pulled on Netscape Navigator by AOL -- development and technical support ceased. Today, it’s little more than a byword for nostalgia.Just like how Netscape is not the same as the Internet, there is a need to differentiate between Bitcoin and Blockchain. See through the bubble around Bitcoin and focus on Blockchain -- this we think is where the promise for the future lies."

At the time of his misspelled posting the price of per bitcoin was around $400. It now hovers at $18,000 per coin, representing a 4,500% return since the HODL posting.","Since its originating post, “HODL” has been given the backronym “Hold On For Dear Life” and has come to embody a philosophy among crypto enthusiasts of holding onto bitcoin or other volatile cryptocurrencies through crashes in order to hopefully reap exponential long term rewards. Given that the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies (especially Ethereum and, more recently, Litecoin) have increased so precipitously so quickly, even the most ardent HODLers would be hard pressed not to consider liquidating at least a portion of their crypto portfolio in order to lock in their gains. Doing so, however, will necessarily trigger capital gains tax.(Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)The IRS treats cryptocurrencies as personal property, not currency. Therefore, buying and selling cryptocurrencies is the same as buying and selling gold or stock.   So, the traditional rules apply: (1) is it a business asset; or (2) a passive investment?  If it’s not a business asset, then: (1) what did you buy it for; (2) how much did you sell it for; and (3) how long did you own it? Let’s assume for this article you’re not using your cryptocurrency for business purposes and you’ve bought cryptocurrency on a lark at a very low price. And now you’re potentially facing a large gain if you sell those coins.Given the taxes crypto investors may be subject to (currently, 39.6% for short term holdings, 20% for long term holdings, plus the 3.8% NIIT), and the IRS’s recent efforts to enforce tax payments on cryptocurrency gains, perhaps crypto-traders can look to traditional methods of tax planning for inspiration for solutions.Donating cryptocurrency to your favorite public charity (and not to a private foundation) can help you save taxes on the coins you do sell.  The charity gets a large donation, and you get a larger deduction, if you donate the coins to a charity instead of selling the coins and donating cash. Let’s say you sell coins that result in $1,000,000 of gain. Your approximate tax on that gain will be about $238,000 leaving you only $762,000 to donate to the charity. Instead, when you gift the coins to charity, you get a charitable deduction of $1,000,000 and the charity gets $1,000,000 tax-free when it sells the coins since it’s not subject to income tax. Since you’re charitable deduction for gifts of appreciated property is limited to 30% of your adjusted gross income (AGI), you should have sold coins resulting in at least $3,333,333 of gain in order to use the full deduction amount this year. If your deduction amount exceeds 30% of your AGI, the remaining amount will be carried over and deductible in future years. Be sure to donate coins you’ve held for at least a year, though, because if you donate coins held short-term, your deduction is limited to your very low cost basis.Generally, most charities have a process to be followed and forms to complete to receive your donation, so don’t wait until December 31 to make the donation.  Give yourself a couple of weeks to make sure everything gets done correctly. Also, keep an eye on Washington as Congress considers legislation to change the tax laws. Our Constitution mandates there be 536 people who always want to change tax laws to benefit themselves or their friends, or their contributors. Because of this constant urge to tinker with the tax code, tax lawyers are always busy, especially at this time of year.  So far, the charitable deduction seems safe. Both the House and Senate versions preserve the charitable deduction, increasing the deduction limit to 60% of AGI for cash donations, but there is still a lot of sausage to be made as they go to conference, and the charitable deduction could be a bargaining chip that ends up on the chopping block. Some of the top non-profit organizations that have started to increase their donor base through Bitcoin donations include: Fidelity Charitable, American Red Cross, Save the Children, Greenpeace, and United Way Worldwide."

(AFP/Getty Images)","International sanctions announced in September against North Korea didn’t stop the country from testing missiles, one of which launched on Sept. 15, just days after the economic punishment was announced. Missile tests worry its neighbors South Korea and Japan, and U.S. officials fume when the missiles fly. The reclusive totalitarian state, though economically isolated by the sanctions, may soon figure that it need not heed the sanctions.A possible reason: It stands to rack up a stack of bitcoin, the border-less cryptocurrency that has grown in value from half a penny per unit five years ago to more than $1,000 this month. North Korea began mining for bitcoin in mid-May, internet threat intelligence firm Recorded Future says, most likely meaning it added transaction records to the block chain -- the currency's public ledger of past transactions. It might also be hacking, some security analysts and South Korean media fear.“The cryptocurrency is the ideal form of money for North Korea because it can be moved quickly and anonymously across borders and can be used to buy goods and services online or converted to hard currency,” says Steven Kim, visiting research fellow at the Jeju Peace Institute in South Korea.Kim Jong-un’s relief from sanctions Economic sanctions approved by the U.N. Security Council in September curb inbound oil supplies, tighten inspections of cargo ships from North Korea and ban imports from a chief North Korean industry, textiles. Those measures answered North Korea’s suspected H-bomb test Sept. 2. They effectively limit the North Korean government’s access to common foreign currency used in normal world trade.The blockchain technology behind the acquisition of bitcoin is open to anyone, regardless of location, with a virtual wallet. You can also trade bitcoin like stocks or other financial assets, again making location a non-factor. Acquisition of bitcoin would satisfy the Kim Jong-un government’s “desperate bid to evade sanctions and eventually earn hard currency,” the Korea Times says, citing experts.More on Forbes: A State-Issued Coin Could Unleash Untapped Potential For CryptocurrenciesAn image of Bitcoin and US currencies is displayed on a screen as delegates listen to a panel of...

(ROSLAN RAHMAN/AFP/Getty Images)“Bitcoin's stateless nature makes it very attractive to North Korea, as the cryptocurrency is essentially sanctions-proof,” says Sean King, vice president of the Park Strategies consultancy in New York. “By contrast, the U.S. dollar's standing as the world's reserve currency, apparently favored by even rogue regimes like North Korea's, gives America uniquely extraterritorial power when enforcing its sanctions. That's because we can largely deny sanctioned entities' use of the dollar by cutting them off from the U.S. banking system.”Legal means of getting bitcoin?The utility or futility of sanctions is just one issue. Some outsiders worry that North Korea will acquire bitcoin illegally. South Korea’s Internet & Security Agency is forecasting that more “cyber-attacks” next year from North Korea “targeting exchanges of decentralized virtual currencies,” a Korea Herald report says. North Korea used fraud and malware in mid-2017 to try hacking four bitcoin exchanges in South Korea, Yonhap news agency reported in September.North Korean hackers stole $6.99 million worth of bitcoin in an attack on one computer in the south, media reports such as this one say. South Korean authorities are still investigating the February incident while vowing to tighten bitcoin regulation.The FireEye internet security firm documented six specific acts of North Korean cryptocurrency hacking from April to July. The culprits then went after three South Korean bitcoin firms, it says. FireEye likens those moves to North Korean “cybercrime” against foreign banks and the global financial system. "

In one ""market"" it traded above $18,000 (which simply means some poor soul was shown a price 11% above the real market and paid it).As we’ve discussed, there is no way to value bitcoin.  There is no intrinsic value.  To this point, it has been bought by people purely on the expectation that someone will pay them more for it, at some point.  So it's speculation on human psychology.Let's take a look at what some of the most sophisticated and successful investors of our time think about it...Billionaire Carl Icahn, the legendary activist investor that has the longest and best track record in the world (yes, better than Warren Buffett): “I don’t understand it… If you read history books about all of these bubbles…this is what this is.”Billionaire Warren Buffett, the best value investor of all-time:   ""Stay away from it. It's a mirage... the idea that it has some huge intrinsic value is a joke.  It's a way of transmitting money.""Billionaire Jamie Dimon, head of one of the biggest global money center banks in the world: “It’s not a real thing. It’s a fraud.”Billionaire Ray Dalio, founder of one of the biggest hedge funds in the world: “Bitcoin is a bubble… It’s speculative people, thinking they can sell it at a higher price…and so, it’s a bubble.”Billionaire investor Leon Cooperman: ""I have no money in bitcoin.  There's euphoria in bitcoin.""Billionaire distressed debt and special situations investor, Marc Lasry:  ""I should have bought bitcoin when it was $300.

I think it’s real, as it coming into the mainstream.""Billionaire hedge funder Ken Griffin: ""It’s not the future of currency.  I wouldn’t call it a fraud either. Bitcoin has many of the elements of the Tulip bulb mania.”Now, these are all Wall Streeters.  And they haven't participated.  But this all started as another disruptive technology venture.  So what do billionaire tech investors think about it...Billionaire Jerry Yang, founder of Yahoo: ""Bitcoin as a digital currency is not quite there yet.  I personally am a believer that digital currency can play a role in our society, but for now it seems to be driven by the hype of investing and getting a return, as opposed to transactions.”Mark Cuban: He first called it a “bubble.”  He now is invested in a cryptocurrency hedge fund but calls it a ""Hail Mary.""Michael Novagratz, former Wall Streeter and hedge fund manager.  He once was a billionaire and may be again at this point, thanks to bitcoin:  ""The whole market cap of all of the cryptocurrencies is $300 billion. That’s nothing.  This is global. I have a sense this can go a lot further.”  He equates it to an alternative to, or replacement for, the value of holding gold – which is an $8 trillion market… “over the medium term, this thing is going to go a lot higher.” But he acknowledges it shouldn't be more than 1% to 3% of an average persons net worth.Now with all of this in mind, billionaire Thomas Peterffy, one of the richest men in the country and founder of the largest electronic broker in the U.S., Interactive Brokers, has warned against creating exchange traded contracts on bitcoin.  He says a large move in the price could destabilize the clearing organizations (the big futures exchanges) which could destabilize the real economy.With that, futures launch on Bitcoin on Sunday at CBOE. This is about to get very interesting.It’s hard to predict the catalyst that might prick a market bubble.  And there always tends to be an interconnectedness to bubbles, across the economy, that aren't clear before it's pricked (i.e. some sort of domino effect).Join our Forbes Billionaire's Portfolio today to get your portfolio in line with the most influential investors in the world, and hear more of my actionable political, economic and market analysis.

Since January 2017, Dash’s coin is up 8,000%, roughly six times the rise of bitcoin, according to CoinMarketCap.com. Network: Dash | Token: Dash | Ticker: DASHCreatorsEvan Duffield created Dash, previously called “Darkcoin,” in January 2014.What is it? Dash believes it’s created a superior cryptocurrency to bitcoin. From a consumer standpoint, the two work similarly: people who own dash can transfer the coins to prepaid debit cards like SpectroCoin and spend the money wherever debit cards are accepted. Some merchants in the U.S. accept dash directly for goods and services, but not many—a search on Dash’s website reveals just three places in Manhattan that deal in it, two of which are ATM machines. As of July 2017, Dash’s average transaction size was more than $10,000, indicating it’s being traded primarily as an investment, like bitcoin. Dash’s self-funding structure makes it unique. When new dash are minted, 10% are set aside to improve the currency’s ecosystem. For example, Dash has planned to invest up to $1.2 million in Alt Thirty Six, which makes point-of-sale payment software targeting the legal marijuana industry in the U.S. Alt Thirty Six’s platform, of course, accepts dash. Dash power users vote to decide which projects get funded. Bitcoin relies on volunteers and donations to fund software development. Dash’s two-tiered structure is another distinguishing trait. Unlike Bitcoin, where miners do all of the work on the blockchain, Dash has a tier of super-users called “masternodes” who perform key functions like deciding which projects get funded and enabling private transactions on Dash. To become a masternode, you must buy at least 1,000 dash coins—as of December 2017, that buy-in price is nearly $1 million. When new coins are created, 45% of them go to miners, 45% go to masternodes, and 10% go to the network.Crypto IntelligenceDue to Dash’s masternode structure, where power is more concentrated in the hands of some users, some critics say it’s not truly a decentralized network. Others, like authors Chris Burniske and Jack Tatar, take issue with the initial distribution of coins, saying it unfairly awarded its creators and early adopters with nearly two million dash on the first day of mining. (Dash has said a software bug caused coins to get mined too quickly, and that it proposed to re-launch the currency to correct the mistake, but the community voted it down.) Regardless, the coin is on a big rally this year, and some see it as a worthy alternative to bitcoin, especially given its lower price, which makes it easier to buy in. ""I think there is a lot of value in some of the smaller tokens such as Dash, Ripple, and NEO ... They are very cheap, but their business ecosystem is really strong,"" former trader Naeem Aslam told Forbes contributor Ken Rapoza. Dash’s biggest competitors are Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, and Litecoin. "

Photographer: Dimas Ardian/Bloomberg","At first glance, Indonesia possesses the unique conditions that make it well-poised for bitcoin adoption. As the world’s fourth most populous country, it’s home to a largely cash-based and offline community, and huge swaths of the population—up to 80%— remain unbanked. Because one of the inherent advantages of digital currency is that it doesn’t necessitate having a bank account, cryptocurrency enthusiasts have long championed bitcoin's immense potential to bring those without access to traditional banking services into the fold by offering an alternative form of money remittance and transfer. Other factors—the absence of a national credit lending system, coupled with increasing smartphone penetration, also make Indonesia ripe for cryptocurrency disruption, according to Zac Cheah, CEO of blockchain startup Pundi X.Given these fertile conditions, one would expect bitcoin to have taken off in Indonesia. And for the most part, this is true. Oscar Darmawan, CEO of  Bitcoin Indonesia, the country’s major exchange which controls more than 70% of bitcoin transactions in Indonesia, has observed what he calls “exponential growth” in users of Bitcoin Indonesia’s marketplace platform. He has seen his users grow 50,000 members in 2015 to 500,000 members this year.Still, despite reaching a daily transaction value of more than $10 million a day, he believes it has barely moved the needle in terms of capturing the wider consumer market. “To be honest, we have not even penetrated the 1% of the total population in Indonesia. The opportunity to grab an even bigger market is huge,” Darmawan says.Investor Outlook This year's BlockBali Blockchain Conference drew a turnout of over 300 people from 31 countries.  However, Indonesia has registered as a small blip on international investors’ radars—not because investors are wary of cryptocurrency’s success there—but because there haven’t been major players that have emerged to warrant huge investment vis-à-vis other Southeast Asian countries.“ On paper, Indonesia is one of the regions that is well poised to leverage blockchain technology. But I still haven’t seen a reason to visit Indonesia, and that definitely makes me think about why we haven’t seen top innovation,” says Siddharth Sthalekar, founder and CEO of Sacred Capital, a firm which evaluates and rates blockchain companies and ICOs.While Sthalekar, who has researched the Asian market extensively, believes that institutional support for blockchain technology isn’t needed, one reason is that resources aren’t being diverted to support it. “This just isn’t a priority for regulators on their end. Blockchain technology may not be top of the mind in Indonesia—whereas in jurisdictions like Singapore it is,” he says.An elevated track for the Jakarta Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) stands under construction as vehicles... [+] wait in congested traffic in this aerial photograph taken in Jakarta, Indonesia, on Sunday, Aug. 13, 2017. Photographer: Dimas Ardian/BloombergOther investors also echo Sthalekar’s sentiment. Jeff Quigley, partner at Red Door Ventures and former Southeast Asia Regional Manager of Fenox Venture Capital recalls that he did not encounter a single cryptocurrency business while he was working in Jakarta, but that “the sheer number of unbanked in the archipelago makes it a compelling market for digital wallets” and was largely responsible for driving the fintech boom and subsequent popularity of Indonesia’s Go-Jek and Tokopedia. Likewise, Bill Barhydt, CEO of Abra, a bitcoin-based digital wallet is “not aware of anyone doing any significant volume bitcoin business in Indonesia yet,” but remains bullish on the Indonesian market.Part of the reason for bitcoin’s slow uptake is that for the average consumer, its use cases— which include store value and remittance services— are still not clearly defined. Cryptocurrency is a difficult subject for the average consumer to wrap their head around, according to Timo Lehes, a partner and venture capitalist at Swarm Fund.“It’s still a fairly technical product at this point. Even if you have the wallet and the mobile infrastructure, it’s actually quite difficult for the average user to get properly set up.” New Avenues For Digital Payment But just because Indonesia isn’t gaining huge inflows of investments doesn’t mean that there aren’t bitcoin communities sprouting up, and new avenues for the digital currency are gradually making their presence known.Pundi- Pundi is one such startup which began as a cashless QR payment app and has since expanded to reach 100,000 users in 600 stores in Jakarta. It aims to allow anyone without a bank account to hold, buy and sell cryptocurrencies in physical stores with a smartphone, and its recent roll-out of the Pundi X POS smart device also offers a retail point of sale consumers in shops, cafes and convenience stores. “In any purchase made through the Pundi X system, cryptocurrency is first converted to fiat currency in real- time through its connection with exchanges, and then fiat is transferred to the merchant,"" says Cheah.Tech In Asia also lists five more bitcoin Indonesian startups challenging the status quo, including Bitspark, which uses bitcoin as a remittance service.(Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)Navigating Hazy RegulationsBut in recent times, the Bank of Indonesia has enacted more stringent regulations. Indonesia’s central bank has affirmed that bitcoin transactions are not legally recognized and Darmawan, who has had conversations with Indonesian regulators, observes that cryptocurrency regulations are poorly defined, and hazy at best. “Currently cryptocurrency is not clearly defined whether it is treated as a currency or a commodity. It is indeed a bit difficult for us to comply with any existing regulations especially if we don’t exactly know how to treat this cryptocurrency in the perspective of law,” he says. “I think our regulators have many other things to prioritize at the moment.” But the veil enshrouding regulations is slowly lifting. The regulatory crackdown from Bank of Indonesia on bitcoin as payment recently caused the shuttering of Indonesian payments platforms providers Toko Bitcoin and Bitbayar —although there remains no adverse effect on exchanges like Bitcoin Indonesia. According to an issued statement from Cheah, Pundi X too has heeded these new regulations.But the biggest stumbling block, Gary Dykstra, the co-founder of Bitcoins in Bali, a cohort which is invested in building a cryptocurrency community in the Balinese town of Ubud, is what he calls the “social change” that will need to occur before bitcoin is widely adopted.  Indonesia is still a largely cash-based economy, and the widespread adoption of bitcoin will require a paradigm shift in which people see bitcoin as “a useful thing rather than just a speculative asset.”"

At the start of the crypto craze, it seemed anonymous. But now, the IRS is getting Coinbase customer data. It now seems practically mainstream, with futures and institutional investors. And on the subject of taxes, many a Bitcoin millionaire may be thinking like their forefathers did with appreciated stock. In general, shares of stocks are considered intangible assets for tax purposes. One effect of that rule is that, for tax purposes, you can take them with you when you move. If you live in California and sell your stocks and bonds, they are sourced to California where you reside for tax purposes.","(Photo credit: PIERRE TEYSSOT/AFP/Getty Images)However, if you move to Nevada or Texas before you sell, your sale should be sourced to Nevada or Texas. Since California has a 13.3% income tax, and no tax break at all for capital gain, paying tax in California would be painful. Nevada, Texas, Florida, Washington, South Dakota, Alaska and Wyoming have no state income tax. So it may be worth thinking about the total tax hit. The IRS has said that Bitcoin property, and it sure seems intangible. It seems hard to imagine that the IRS or state tax authorities would view it as different from a share of stock that travels with you when you move.Moving has its own rules. You have to really do it, and it has to be permanent, not a visit. At the federal level, the capital gain rate is 20% for higher income taxpayers. Add the 3.8% net investment tax under Obamacare, and you have 23.8%. California taxes long term capital gain as ordinary income, so Californian's pay up to 13.3%. By paying 23.8% plus 13.3%, Californians are paying more on capital gain than virtually anyone else in the world. California's tough Franchise Tax Board (FTB) polices the line between residents and non-residents, and it does so rigorously. As with other high tax states, California is likely to probe how and when you stopped being a resident.A California resident is anyone in the state for other than a temporary or transitory purpose. It also includes anyone domiciled in California who is outside the state for a temporary or transitory purpose. So, if it looks as though you are exiting to sell and then will come back, the state may say you effectively never left. The burden is on you to show that you are not a Californian. If you are in California for more than 9 months, you are presumed to be a resident. Check out FTB Publication 1031. On the other hand, if your job requires you to be outside the state, it usually takes 18 months to be presumed no longer a resident.Your domicile is your true, fixed permanent home, the place where you intend to return even when you’re gone. It should be no surprise that former Californians often become residents of no-tax states like Texas. The IRS reports that between 2013 and 2014, over 250,000 California residents moved away. More than 10% went to Texas alone. Some people get the travel itch right before cashing in shares, a public offering, or settling litigation. Some people have unrealistic expectations about establishing residency in a new state. They may have a hard time distancing themselves from California, and may not plan on California tax authorities chasing them.You can have only one domicile, and objective facts can bear on your intent. Start with where you own a home. Where your spouse and children reside counts, as does the location where your children attend school. Your days inside and outside the state are important, as is the purpose of your travels. Where you have bank accounts and belong to social, religious, professional and other organizations is also relevant. Voter registration, vehicle registration and driver’s licenses count. Where you are employed is key. You may be a California resident even if you travel extensively and are rarely in the state. Where you own or operate businesses is relevant, as is the relative income and time you devote to them.California, like the IRS, gets unlimited time to audit if you never file an income tax return. You might claim that you are no longer a resident and claim that you have no California filing obligation. But the FTB may disagree and can audit you forever unless you file a return. That can make it smart to file a non-resident tax return, just reporting your California-source income as a non-resident."

In fact, if you are a borrower, other than tax deductions for interest, you might not even think about taxes. Lenders too generally only face taxes on the interest they receive on the loan. Sure, there can be big tax issues when loans are forgiven. If your loan is forgiven, that is income in the amount of the debt discharged. Mostly, though, loans can be neutral from a tax viewpoint. How about loans in bitcoin or other digital currency? You might think the tax rules should be the same, but that’s not so clear. With loans in dollars, money is fungible. But the IRS says digital currency is property, not currency. Most property is not fungible for tax purposes.","ShutterstockWhen you receive a loan in cash, the lender usually knows that you will invest or spend the money. Everyone understands that you will pay the lender back with other money. But the same is not necessarily true with a loan of property. If you rent or borrow a lawn mower, can you return a different mower? Probably not. If you lend your car to another person, you probably want your same car back. If the borrower returns a different car, that transaction could be viewed as the sale of the original vehicle for tax purposes, followed by the purchase of another car.The IRS likes finding more opportunities to collect taxes. That can mean gain or loss, even if the deal ends up netting you a different car with the same value. Except for certain special tax provisions such as Section 1031 exchanges (allowing tax-free swaps of property under certain conditions), just about everything you trade is taxed. In general, if you want to avoid taxes, a loan of property should require the return of the same property. With loans of cryptocurrency, the parties probably intend the cryptocurrency lent to be treated as fungible currency, rather than like property. Whatever the IRS says, people generally view it as money.A borrower may receive bitcoins and sell them, repaying the lender with other bitcoins. The bitcoins may be intended as fungible currency, a continuation of the bitcoins that were lent (with the same tax basis and the same acquisition date). But will the IRS agree?  Consider the fluctuating value of cryptocurrency, and these tax issues could be big. In light of the IRS's conclusion that cryptocurrency is property, there is a risk that the IRS may treat the loan as a sale of the original bitcoins for tax purposes. Even if the IRS agrees that loan treatment is appropriate, it is not clear how interest payments will be treated.In the current climate of uncertainty, careful documentation might help. Emphasize that the transaction is intended to be a loan, not a sale or disposition. Consider stating that both parties will report the loan in this manner for tax and accounting purposes.  If the transaction has profit sharing or equity provisions, that could complicate the argument for loan treatment. The loan documentation could emphasize that repayment should be made in digital currency that is identical in value and denomination to the digital currency lent.Perhaps the document could even require that repayment be made with the exact same cryptocurrency lent. In practice, this may not be possible. Still, a requirement that the loan repayments be made from the same wallet to which it was lent (and ideally one that is segregated from other funds) might help to strengthen the argument that the very same property has been repaid. The best strategy to avoid IRS problems is not clear. For example, the parties may want to emphasize in the loan documentation that the cryptocurrency is a fungible asset.Perhaps they want to state that the cryptocurrency received in repayment will be considered identical to the cryptocurrency lent (that will use the same acquisition date and tax basis). Loan documentation could distinguish between transfers made in repayment of the loan principal, and transfers that are payments of interest. Care might also be taken to address possible forks in the cryptocurrency. A loan transaction that began with bitcoin might become even more problematic when the lent funds are now represented by both bitcoin and bitcoin cash. Parties should anticipate what to do, and how to emphasize that repayment is still being made from the same source and property.Taking steps of this sort may not prevent the IRS from successfully challenging a loan. Even so, it may help put you in a better position in case the loan is examined. The IRS is using tracking software, and is issuing summonses to cryptocurrency exchanges for user personal information and transaction histories. The IRS revealed that nationally, only 802 people reported bitcoin on their tax returns for 2015.  Particularly with meteoric rises in value and high demand, perhaps some people are not reporting? The IRS sure thinks so.Stay informed and ahead of the crowd with Forbes Crypto Confidential, a free e-letter delivered to your inbox twice a week. Sign up today. "

built on top of that base Bitcoin layer. Digital Gold vs PayPal. Today 
In: ...","Nov 9, 2017,01:47pm EST",Shutterstock,"The so-called New York Agreement is sometimes credited for bringing the Segregated Witness (SegWit) improvement to the Bitcoin network (others say it was the user-activated soft fork outlined in Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 148), but the hard-forking capacity increase that was attached to the agreement has failed to gain much traction. For that reason, support for the 2x increase has waned and a number of CEOs who pledged their support for both changes have withdrawn their advocacy for the change.Some have pointed to the hard-forking increase associated with SegWit2x as a contentious waste of time, but there was also much to be learned from the whole experience.One key takeaway is that it now seems clear that the base Bitcoin protocol is more of a digital gold than an improvement on PayPal or Visa. Having said that, better versions of those payment systems can still be built on top of that base Bitcoin layer.Digital Gold vs PayPalSo what does the digital gold vs PayPal debate mean?The short answer is that there is a divide in the Bitcoin community between those who view bitcoin (the token) as a new asset class outside of the reach of any government, bank, or other third party and those who see Bitcoin (the network) as a payments innovation.Those who view bitcoin as digital gold do not want to see any contentious rule changes made to the network to protect the idea that there is no counterparty risk associated with storing value in the digital bearer asset. However, those who see Bitcoin as a payments innovation would like to see at least one rule change in the form of a hard-forking increase to capacity.For those who don’t know, a hard fork is a protocol change that requires every Bitcoin user to move over to a new network with different rules.This hard-forking increase to capacity would lower transaction fees on the network (at least over the short term). If you built a company around the promise of nearly free transactions provided by the Bitcoin network, it’s easy to see why you would want to see some changes happen once those fees start to rise, even without clear consensus for the change.You Can Build a Better PayPal on Top of Digital GoldOne clarification that often gets left out of this debate is that a better version of PayPal can be built on top of Bitcoin in a situation where the base layer is used for the digital gold use case. But it doesn’t work the other way around — you can’t build a more secure system on top of a less secure base.This point needs a major clarification. Yes, bitcoin is digital gold, but you can still build a better, trustless PayPal on top of it. @nathanielpopper https://t.co/xA7Y8VOCo4— Kyle Torpey (@kyletorpey) November 8, 2017The most often-cited example of a “better PayPal” that can be built on top of Bitcoin today is the Lightning Network. In this system, a network of cached Bitcoin transactions (sort of like trustless IOUs) are sent between users rather than on-chain transactions.In this setup, the blockchain is more of a court for the Lightning Network’s smart contracts. Whenever there’s a dispute, users can fall back to the blockchain.While the Lightning Network usually gets all the attention in terms of layer-two payment solutions for Bitcoin, other options are available as well. These alternatives usually involve a different set of tradeoffs in terms of centralization, privacy, and other areas.For example, a paper (PDF) from two members of the Zcash project (a privacy focused alternative to Bitcoin) describes a trustless third-party payment processor that could be built on top of the Bitcoin or Zcash blockchains. This would effectively be a trustless, cryptocurrency-denominated version of PayPal that cannot seize user funds and doesn’t know where money is being sent.While the base Bitcoin blockchain is built entirely around the removal of third parties, one has to wonder what the downsides of a more centralized model built on top of that decentralized base would be if a third-party payment processor is unable to steal from its customers, censor transactions, or spy on its users.The Problems with a Payments-First ApproachOf course, a question some may be asking right now is: Why can’t cheaper transactions be built into the base layer? After all, this is the main selling point of some altcoins, namely Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin.For one, a cryptocurrency does not work well for payments unless it has the liquidity provided by those who view the digital asset as a store of value (or digital gold).Bitcoin volatility chart via BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com.As the chart above indicates, bitcoin’s price volatility has tended to decline as more money has entered the market and the price has gone up. As liquidity rises, it takes more money to push the price around with a single trade.A better payment system (and better form of money) will be built on top of a more liquid asset.In addition to layer-two payment systems built on top of Bitcoin having the benefit of being denominated in bitcoin, the payment systems themselves are also likely to offer features that simply cannot be found via on-chain transactions such as drastically lower transaction fees, instantly-confirmed payments, and potentially better privacy in a more scalable manner.Note: A previous version of this article indicated that the New York Agreement led to the activation of SegWit on the Bitcoin network, but it's possible that the threat of a user-activated soft fork to implement the improvement was the root cause.Note 2: This article was previously titled ""The Failure of SegWit2x Shows Bitcoin is Digital Gold, Not a Better PayPal""."

Trading will start on December 11 and 18, respectively.","Even better news, they could be a better instrument than Bitcoin itself. Here's why:A cryptocurrency markets app, BitBay Ticker is seen on an iPhone on December 1, 2017. (Photo by Jaap... [+] Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Futures exchanges run by markets experts. The creators of Bitcoin invented Blockchain, an exciting technology that may have many other uses. For that, these inventors should be commended.However, they aren't experts in creating markets. CME and CBOE both have long histories in creating successful venues for the buying and selling of futures contracts. The launch of these trading venues will enhance price discovery. That means any new information about Bitcoin will quickly be reflected in the price of the contracts. That will likely be far better than the price discovery on the existing Bitcoin exchanges.Big financial firms understand futures. Wall Street firms are familiar with futures exchanges and how they work. Most have back-office operations that allow for such instruments to be traded with ease. That ease-of-use will attract more dollar volume to these Bitcoin-related contracts investment community. As a result, the market for Bitcoin futures will become more liquid, perhaps more liquid than Bitcoin itself. William Rhind, CEO of Granite Shares, recently explained to me how the very largest ETFs, such as the SPDR S&P 500, is now more traded than the underlying shares of the index. That could happen with these Bitcoin futures.Reference price. The contracts will be settled each trading day using a transparent reference price. That reference price may not be perfect, but it will soon get written into contracts that involve Bitcoin being paid or received as happens in other markets. For instance, jewelry makers and retailers often use reference prices for gold in their contracts. In short, having a transparent settlement price will simplify the matter of using Bitcoin as a method of payment.Futures contracts don't go missing. You might lose money, but you won't misplace the contract. A friend of mine bought a small chunk of Bitcoin and then found that it had disappeared. It's a story I hear all the time from other folks. That is unlikely to happen when trading futures.In addition, with rare exception, client cash doesn't go missing in the futures business; it seems to get mislaid all the time in the Bitcoin business even though that isn't supposed to happen.You can easily bet on a decline in prices. Selling short a futures contract is as simple as buying one, which isn't the case with stocks. If you think Bitcoin prices are in a bubble, then you can bet on a drop.It's regulated. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulates futures trading. Some people who love Bitcoin because it is potentially a non-government currency will hate that the regulation is a plus. Nevertheless, it is a significant benefit for Bitcoin fans overall. The good news is that CFTC regulation isn't as onerous as regulation of stocks and bonds. But what it does do is to introduce some rules to which all the participants in the market need to adhere. These rules simply set a level playing field for all speculators and investors in the futures contracts. That will attract professional traders and hence increase the trading volume in the market. More trading volume will be good for Bitcoin fans because it will establish the cryptocurrency futures as a significant financial instrument, and hence Bitcoin itself.I still maintain that gold is better than Bitcoin. But the introduction of futures helps tilt the scale a bit in the direction of Bitcoin."

Conceptual image for investors ...

The president’s office said the decision was not yet confirmed. Read more on why South Korea's crackdown on cryptocurrencies is in for a long fight here. Don't panic just yet, South Korean regulators are putting a stop to the rumours that the government is banning all crypto transactions.The confusion came after local publications quoted a government official saying it is ""considering"" a ban in the country as a way to cool down the digital currency craze. The announcement follows Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon's harsh warning that cryptocurrencies might ""corrupt the nation's youth."" Last month he urged regulators to create a task force alluding to crypto as a gateway to pyramid schemes and speculative investment if left unchecked.  Korea's top financial watchdog, the FSC (Financial Services Commission) Chairman Choi Jong-ku, noted that the ministries are in discussion over the extent of trade regulation. As of now, several government groups involved in the virtual currency task force are of divided opinion on the matter -- some in fear of stifling crypto and fintech innovation. But Choi confirmed that any decision to prohibit transactions must have legal basis. A seed investor in blockchain project ALIS social media, Douglas Crets believes regulation is good: ""In the long-term chess game of bitcoinization, regulation helps the government ‘process’ what’s happening and it makes it more legitimate for bigger institutional players to put funds into cryptocurrencies.” South Korea currently bans financial institutions from dealing with virtual currencies. What is clear though -- the ban on initial coin offering (ICO) remains. And six safeguards are being pushed forth for operating exchanges. Those conditions include confirming the user's real name, submitting proof of income, face-to-face interviews to meet strict Know Your Customer (KYC) policies, and providing cryptographic keys to establish anti-money laundering (AML) systems, as well as separating fiat accounts, supply sufficient investment warnings, etc.     ""Regulation of the way in which exchanges work will weed out bad players, and make bitcoin more mainstream,"" says Crets. Illustrated through price, the country has indeed shown more enthusiasm compared to its peers. At the height, bitcoin was trading at a $3,500 premium in South Korean exchanges compared to the rest of the world. Partly due to the limited liquidity -- supply of bitcoin -- coupled with strong demand from the finance sector, BTC is often propelled to cost about 20% more than the mark-to-market. Still, the country's bitcoin activity only accounts for less than 7% of the currency's global trade."

Both involved clueless regulators and unfettered markets.No one knew what to expect because only a handful of people on the planet understood the technical connections between derivatives markets and stocks. Exchanges were based in two different cities with two different sets of rules.Now comes Bitcoin and its brethren. We know even less about how Bitcoin is valued -- it's embedded in software only a handful of people understand -- and what's driving the price.While Bitcoin's market cap could eclipse that of Apple, that doesn't increase its market transparency. We know far more about Apple, its products and executives that we do about the shadowy origins of Bitcoin and its miners.History provides some examples of how markets can implode without warning. Diana Henriques's masterful ""A First-Class Catastrophe"" provides telling details on how the 1987 crash occurred and how regulators were caught flat-footed.""Black Monday (1987) was the worst decline since 1929,"" Henriques told a meeting of business journalists at a SABEW conference on Oct. 13. ""There was balkanized regulation and the two top regulators had opposite views on the crisis.""Although the 1987 crash didn't trigger a recession, Henriques says regulators are still befuddled about how to avoid another crash. They failed spectacularly in 2008 and are even more hamstrung by the existence of more than 60 stock exchanges in which computers are not only running the exchanges, but are doing most of the trading in micro-second bursts.So it stands to reason that virtual currencies are even more problematic. While blockchain is a game-changing technology that could change everything from contracts to global banking, it's still a black box to most investors. With stocks, you know that there are a finite number of shares and derivatives called options based on their future prices.Share prices are listed every minute an exchange is open. You can find out who's trading big blocks, get earnings estimates and know nearly everything about a company's financial state.Not so with cryptocurrencies. What is the source of their valuation? Pure speculation? Animal spirits? ""The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent,"" according the great economist/investor John Maynard Keynes, who made that observation in the 1930s.Still, the circus show is what drives Bitcoin. Commentators and investors continue to focus on the wrong thing. Prices can't go up forever.Panics and loss of confidence have triggered market sell-offs over hundreds of years. Think tulips, Louisiana swamp land, Florida real estate and tech stocks. Markets are indirectly connected through herd psychology.One massive sell-off could spill over into other investments. A crisis in obscure credit-default swap derivatives fueled the 2008 stock/real estate meltdown and recession.  Could Bitcoin tanking ignite a confidence crisis in common shares? It sounds illogical, but markets are rarely rational when everyone's selling in fear.Ultimately, as investors (and skeptical observers), we should ""focus less on market declines [and run ups] and more on market structure, especially when it falls apart,"" Ms. Henriques wisely counsels.What is the structure of the cryptocurrency market? Is it a giant, flimsy tent that can be blown down in the next storm or a steel-beamed skyscraper?"

even ...","Oct 2, 2017,07:00am EDT",Courtesy: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg,"Imagine you could own one of two currencies. One currency is easy to obtain. In fact, you won’t have to do any more than live your life in the usual way — paying by credit card and eating occasional meals at restaurants — in order to fill up your account. You can exchange that currency at any time you want for a free flight or a free upgrade to a first class seat or a free stay in a hotel. Play it smart and you can travel anywhere you want in the world at any time for next to nothing.The other currency requires a bit of knowledge. You need to buy it with regular currency on special exchanges and store it in special wallets. You can exchange it for lots of different things but it’s not easy, and you probably won’t want to. That’s because this currency is so popular its value is going through the roof. The currency you spend today could have doubled in value by the end of the month. (It can also fall sharply too.)The first of these currencies is airline loyalty points. They’ve been around for a while. Everyone knows about them but no one ever talks about them. A few people have dedicated their lives to collecting and using them but for most people, they’re just what you get if you fly with one airline for long enough. The other currency is bitcoin. It’s the flavor of the day. Even though little has changed in the world of bitcoin since the whitepaper that launched it (give or take the occasional fork, and when news does break, it’s often bad), the value of the coin has continued to climb. People could get all the airline points they want — and they could actually use them in a way that enriches their lives — but some people don’t want to. They’d rather pay several thousand bucks to own a bitcoin.What defines the difference between those two currencies — what makes one so much more exciting than the other — is the story surrounding them. Bitcoin has a mystery genius at its heart: its story begins with Satoshi Nakamoto, a secretive figure who no one’s ever met and who might not even be real. It’s also subversive. Part of the story of bitcoin is the idea that it lets people own currency without government involvement or endorsement. The currency isn’t under the control of a national bank, and governments have little influence over it. The banking infrastructure has been built entirely from the ground up. (Airline miles are under the complete control of the airline companies who can — and do — devalue them at will.) Of the two stories, one has much more power than the other.In a recent interview with Quartz, economist Robert Shiller described how even students at Yale University react when they discuss cryptocurrencies. “You start talking about bitcoin and they’re excited!” he said. “Big things happen if someone invents the right story and promulgates it.”The Story Of Donald TrumpThat story doesn’t have to be about a cryptocurrency. Shiller uses the same idea to explain the success of Donald Trump. He describes the president as a genius at recognizing stories, listening to his audience and understanding what drives them, and he explains how the president’s campaign moved audiences to accept his message. “He presented a story that involves you, the voter, as a success in this new world, and that’s why the Trump story was so popular.”What both those stories have in common is their ability to make people feel in control. Bitcoin tells its users that the government and the big banks can’t devalue their currency; the people are in charge. For people who identify with that message, the story can build a close relationship to the product. Bitcoin has that story. Airline points? Not so much.That doesn’t mean that every product story has to be empowering. Every product has to tell its own story and to do it in its own way. When Dior releases a new perfume commercial starring Charlize Theron, it doesn’t try to describe the different aromas the perfume contains. How the product smells is hardly important. What really matters is the story that surrounds the product and how the audience sees its role in that story. One year it could be a story of the customer becoming a whole new person; the next year it might the customer getting a feel for nature. Charlize Theron is an actress. She plays a character in those stories and the audience gets to identify with it.Customers Are Characters In A Product’s StoryWhat we see in the success of bitcoin is the power of the story in marketing. The currency took off because its story appealed to people who wanted to feel that they were part of an adventure that took them outside of government control. As more people joined that story, the price went up and a new story developed. Now people could be part of a story that allows anyone to enrich themselves if they’re willing to step outside their comfort zones and learn about a new technology. Bitcoin investors are risk-takers and explorers. They’re characters in the bitcoin story.Of course, the story isn’t the only thing that matters -- the quality of the product is vital too. If the price of bitcoin crashes, then the story of a renegade currency won’t be strong enough to keep any but the most hardcore fans wanting anything to do with it. If Dior’s perfume smells like a sewer then it doesn’t matter whether Charlize Theron climbs out of a palace or wades through the sea -- no one will wear it. But as long as the product works, it’s the story that makes people identify with it and want to use it. That’s true of a cryptocurrency, and it could be true of airline miles too if the airlines put effort into creating a story about them."

Within a few weeks, the two were hooked.Winstanley says he was always interested in markets – during his freshman and sophomore year, he taught himself stock trading. And while at a marketing internship this summer, 21-year-old Porter says he stumbled on blockchain-based secure message platform Obsidian and decided to invest in its ICO. They soon began to network with other college students on Facebook, sharing market analyses and predictions.“I logged over 2,000 hours in the last four months in research, charting analytics and data, and it’s really become a passion,” Porter says. “I wake up every morning and I’m excited to begin to learn.”Much to the dismay of Porter’s roommates, the seniors converted Porter’s apartment into a Bitcoin trading room. In September, Winstanley started investing $200, while Porter contributed an additional $2,000 to the endeavor.By December, the two had amassed about $15,000 – enough to convince Winstanley (and his parents) to drop out of school and pursue cryptocurrency trading full-time.“I’m not opposed to trying to finish school and I’d love to have my degree at some point and come back and get it,” says Winstanley, now just one semester short of graduating. “But I couldn’t let this market happen again without my full attention on it.”Winstanley and Porter represent a growing wave of college students who are being swept up by the seemingly easy riches in cryptocurrencies and are now speculating in the tokens. Volatile Bitcoin, the blue chip among cryptocurrencies, has climbed 15-fold in 2017. While only a rare few students make the leap to full-time trading, buying crypto is nearly as easy as sending money via Venmo and many students are shelling out spare cash in hopes of striking it rich.ShutterstockThirty-two percent of Millennials are likely to buy Bitcoin in the next five years, according to an October survey of more than 2,000 U.S. adults conducted by Harris Poll on behalf of Blockchain Capital. And about one in four Millennials would rather own $1,000 of Bitcoin over $1,000 in stocks.Sensing a growing trend, many universities — from Stanford University to the University of California at Berkeley to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — are now offering Bitcoin and cryptocurrency classes and student-run Bitcoin clubs are popping up increasingly popular.Porter says he is reducing his course load, and expanding his senior year over two semesters instead of graduating in the spring. Today, he and Winstanley are coming at it with more capital. They’ve secured almost $70,000 – a mix of money from their fall semester profits and from family.In the coming weeks, Winstanley’s Ann Arbor apartment will be converted into a trading hub, complete with a 10-by-10 foot projection screen and about 12 different monitors following trades on various crypto exchanges around the world.“For those that have not stepped in yet, the window is closing,” warns Porter, a double major in digital media communications and cognitive science. “Wall Street and the big money has begun to enter. They are moving very, very fast.”At the University of Florida, students in the newly-formed Gator Bitcoin Club meet periodically to educate each other about cryptocurrencies or hear lectures from professionals in the blockchain industry. They also find solace in trading together.Club member Felipe Faria, 20, says he started investing $200 in Bitcoin four years ago, before he started school. Now, the sophomore computer science student says he’s made almost $7,000.He reluctantly admits that he doesn’t have a part-time job – trading Bitcoin has become it.“I believe the future is slowly moving away from the stock market 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. deal to 24-hour exchanges,” Faria says. “It’s definitely something I’ll be doing for quite a bit.”At Berkeley, students have formed Blockchain at Berkeley, a non-profit organization dedicated to education, research and consulting for companies such as Airbus and Qualcomm. When the organization started in 2014, it had less than 10 members, says lead publications editor Melissa Mokhtari, a Berkeley senior. Now, they have about 100 student members, and an external Slack branch made up of about 1,800 community members.Since the fall of 2016, the group has designed and taught three blockchain courses on Berkeley's campus that students take for credit with an enrollment of about 120 each, says Mokhtari, Class of 2018 in applied mathematics. The group also runs a popular online cryptocurrency trading course.New York University Professor David Yermack says his course, “Digital currency, blockchains and the future of financial services,” was one of the first cryptocurrency courses in the world when it started in 2014. Demand has grown so much that next semester, the course was moved into a 350-seat lecture hall.“On college campuses, given how quickly these things are rising in value, there is an incredible curiosity about them,” Yermack says. “There is the allure of the ‘get rich quick.’ This is capturing the imagination of university students.""Yermack, chairman of finance department at NYU Stern, said students are constantly asking him for advice on how to invest. Though he’s never invested, Yermack said he recently found out two of his four children have invested – his 13-year-old daughter in Bitcoin and his 18-year-old son in Litecoin.Though he’s chosen not to invest, MIT MBA student Mark Weber say the craze has taken over campus. Weber is a project manager at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative, where students conduct research on blockchain and cryptocurrency, as well as host bootcamps and other education programs.In his industrial economics class last week, Weber says, well-known economics professor Robert Pindyck asked his students what they wanted his final open lecture to cover. The overwhelming response from his 200-some students? Bitcoin.“Even just in two years, and even just in three months, everybody is asking about it,” Weber, Class of 2018, says. “Everybody wants to talk about it.”"

Of course, diversifying without paying a big tax hit would be best if you can. Up until now, depending on how aggressive you were, and how you could orchestrate it, you could try swapping one asset for another. If different kinds of real estate can be swapped for one another tax-free, why not digital currencies? The IRS says that Bitcoin and other digital currencies are property, right? Whatever the arguments for the past, the House tax bill and the Senate tax bill both make it clear that after passage, 1031 exchanges are only for real estate.","(Photo by Alain Pitton/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Most swaps are taxable as sales, so a 1031 exchange is an exception to the rule that swaps are taxable. When it comes to whether 1031 applies to cryptocurrency, the debates are over the fundamentals. The IRS has been asked about this, but has so far remained mum. The big question is whether exchanges of cryptocurrency should be considered swaps of property of like-kind. A direct Bitcoin for Bitcoin swap might be fine, but that is hardly diversification. A Bitcoin for Ripple or Ethereum trade is much more appealing, but that might not qualify.If you don't argue for 1031 treatment, or if the IRS rules against 1031 exchanges even for the past, are there any other choices for transfers that might be tax free? Some investors put Bitcoin and other virtual currencies into an investment or trading company, but can it be done tax efficiently? That is, if you form an LLC or a corporation, can you transfer Bitcoin and other digital currencies to your new entity tax free? Generally, yes. Both the partnership tax rules and the corporate tax rules allow for tax free transfers, if you meet certain rules. So, in a simple case, if you transfer $X worth of Bitcoin to a new LLC or corporation you form, swapping your $X worth of Bitcoin for all of the ownership interests in your new entity, it should be tax free.Of course, then your new entity will be buying and selling, and paying tax on any gains. You may not have changed the ultimate tax due when you sell. But you might alter the reporting playing field materially. For example, suppose that you are worried about IRS Form 1099 reporting rules. The IRS has said that payments for services in Bitcoin are subject to IRS Form 1099 reporting. The payor is supposed to file the form, filing a Form 1099 with the IRS to report the payment. The Form 1099 reports as if the Bitcoin was cash, reporting at its then dollar value.However, payments to corporations generally do not need to be issued IRS Forms 1099. Corporations--both S corporations that are taxed as flow-throughs and C corporations that are taxed as entities--can be end-runs around the Form 1099 reporting rules. Not having to deal with Forms 1099 could be one advantage. You might also change (and reduce) your tax audit profile with an entity tax return. Sole proprietorship tax returns (Schedule C to IRS Form 1040) are one of the most likely types of tax returns (or portions of tax returns) to be audited. So forming an entity can materially reduce your audit risk.Finally, there could be some types of transactions that you might more readily facilitate with an investment or business entity of your own. For example, you might end up combining your company with one or more others, in effecting ending up with a smaller percentage interest in a larger entity, rather than owing your small entity all by yourself. There is no magic solution that allows tax-free diversification. But it can be worth trying to be creative."

But on October 2, the Wall Street Journal reported that rival Goldman Sachs is considering trading in cryptocurrencies, potentially the first Wall Street firm to do so.For me, the jury is still out. Here’s why.Back in the 1960s, I partnered with a commodities broker at the then-existent Hayden, Stone brokerage firm to form the Comsec Fund, a mutual fund that could trade commodities as well as other securities. I provided a statistical trading system; he handled administration and sales. Hedging was an important feature of the fund, since trading in commodities requires frequent short selling of commodities contracts. Registering the fund with the Securities and Exchange Commission was difficult and time-consuming. We had to persuade staff members that hedging both securities and commodities contracts was an acceptable investment strategy and not mere speculation. Eventually, we succeeded in registering with the SEC and 37 US states before piling up legal debts that were so large that we had to find a buyer, in our case a financial services company, to bail us out.The experience could have soured me on the entire notion of hedge funds. But of course hedge funds later came into vogue, prompting the growth and development of an entire hedge fund industry. If anything, the experience left me more open-minded than ever about innovative financial endeavors. So that brings me to the subject of digital money or “cryptocurrency,” a form of encrypted digital money.How should we think about the future of a currency that is manufactured (“mined”) and priced in the private economy (as opposed to being minted on a controlled basis by governments) through an innovative, supposedly secure, and secretive system of digital codes that enables owners of the currency to complete transactions off the books and out of the sight of government regulators?The number of such currencies are multiplying quickly for use in various ways. Some are being accepted by a limited number of buyers and sellers as tender for transacting business. They are now even being created as funding devices (ICOs or initial coin offerings) by companies avoiding more public IPOs (initial public offerings). The companies simply create and sell tradable digital currencies that can be used to purchase future goods or services offered by the startup, possibly on more favorable terms than in the real market. According to one report, 140 startups have raised over $2 billion in this manner so far this year. In one case, $35 million was raised in less than 30 seconds.The most highly developed of the digital currencies is  Bitcoin, the product of an ingenious and secretive tech programmer who developed a complex algorithm for “mining” the currency and tracking its ownership on computers located around the world using  blockchain software.It can be used for currency speculation, with the value of a Bitcoin fluctuating at least as wildly on digital currency exchanges as the commodities we used to trade; over the past 90 days, the value of a Bitcoin fluctuated over a range of $1,900 to $4,700. But more than 100,000 organizations accept it in transactions. ATMs installed by Bitcoin exchanges to process transactions recently could be found in more than 150 US locations. Hackers recently demanded it in payment for the “service” of having one’s frozen computer files restored. (Just as with commerce around pornography in the early days of the internet, digital currencies seem to attract some people operating on or beyond the edge of legality.)Bitcoin is mined in “farms” that, according to one description, “verify other users’ transactions by solving complex mathematical puzzles,” receiving Bitcoins as payment for their services. Today, the largest “miner” of Bitcoins is a factory containing 25,000 computers and serviced on a 24/7 basis by 50 employees in Dallad Banner in Inner Mongolia, China. In fact, more than two-thirds of the currency is mined and much of it is traded on exchanges in China. Nervous Chinese leaders have threatened to shut down the exchanges, causing the value of the currency to drop about 30 percent instantly. As comedians often ask, “What could possibly go wrong?”But the same question could probably have been asked about our little mutual fund that engaged in hedging. (We weren’t even clever enough to call it a “hedge fund.”) Hence my question. What’s the future of digital currency? What do you think?P.S. Everything turned out well for the two of us. My partner went on to found, develop, maintain majority ownership in, and eventually sell the third largest discount brokerage organization in the United States. I was even more fortunate; I was able to return to the faculty at Harvard Business School."

potential ...","Oct 27, 2017,01:08pm EDT","Gold bars are pictured at the German central Bank Bundesbank, in Frankfurt, Germany (BORIS... [+] ROESSLER/AFP/Getty Images).","While bitcoin would appear to be a libertarian’s monetary dream at first glance, the reality is that many of the longtime gold bugs have yet to go all the way down the cryptocurrency rabbit hole. For those most part, these gold bugs do not believe in the long-term viability of bitcoin due to its lack of “intrinsic value.”Peter Schiff is one such gold bug who is a noted critic of bitcoin. I recently dissected some of the arguments he made against bitcoin on The Joe Rogan Experience in another post.Indeed, I also followed this line of thinking when I first found out about bitcoin. One of the first questions I had about this new digital commodity was why it was not backed by a physical commodity such as gold.However, that was back in 2011. And I eventually learned that the lack of physical backing behind bitcoin is a feature, not a bug. Without physical backing, bitcoin is able to act as the world’s first digital bearer asset, which can be stored and transacted without interference from a third party custodian or government.Like many others who have researched bitcoin thoroughly over the years, my understanding of money and intrinsic value has been flipped on its head by Satoshi Nakamoto’s financial innovation.Bitcoin’s Intrinsic ValueSo how does bitcoin have any value at all? How can you go from zero to one?In the early days, bitcoin was nothing more than a collectible to most people who were looking into the new technology. This is in contrast to the “cryptocurrency” and “digital currency” monikers that would eventually be placed on it.In an early thread on the Bitcointalk.org forum regarding how bitcoin should be defined, Nakamoto stated, “Bitcoins have no dividend or potential future dividend, therefore not like a stock. More like a collectible or commodity.”This speculative view of bitcoin as a sort of collectible for crypto-anarchists and other like-minded individuals is where bitcoin first attained any value at all. The fact that there was a limited supply of bitcoins meant you had to convince someone else to send you theirs (or put in work as a miner) if you wanted to have any.The Collectible Use Case Bootstraps More ValueOnce bitcoin gained a price in other assets, it could then be used to transmit value over the internet in a censorship-resistant manner.“If it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it,” Nakamoto wrote back in 2010.One Bitcointalk.org user famously traded 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas, but the best illustration of bitcoin’s use as a censorship-resistant medium of exchange likely came in the form of darknet marketplace Silk Road. The bearer nature of bitcoin made it the perfect option for illicit commerce on the internet.Bitcoin’s use for near-instant, censorship-resistant online transactions is the closest thing it has to the gold bug’s obsession over “intrinsic value,” but it had to be bootstrapped by its use as a collectible. This feature does not exist with any other asset in the world, physical or digital, outside of alternative cryptocurrencies, which have been unable to compete with bitcoin’s network effects up to this point.At any point in time, there is a portion of bitcoin that is being held for the purpose of buying or selling goods on a darknet market, making a ransomware payment, depositing or withdrawing funds from an online sportsbook, or any other type of financial activity where the use of bitcoin is a requirement. This is the bitcoin equivalent of gold’s use in jewelry or electronics.In these situations, people are usually using bitcoin because they have to, not because they want to.The Digital Gold MemeWith its scarcity and resistance to control by governments, the investment case for bitcoin eventually became “digital gold.” In the digital realm, there is no better tool for storing and exchanging value (discounting the use of virtual IOUs for physical assets).So now the debate is over which meme people prefer for their money. There is gold, which has stood the test of time for thousands of years and already has a sufficient amount of liquidity in its market. Then there is bitcoin, which is still extremely new, has relatively low trading volume, but also acts as the first digital bearer instrument in an increasingly digital world.It’s clear that bitcoin has at least a niche use case among those who wish to hold digital value without the use of a third-party custodian, which is not possible with gold. The only question that remains is if more people will continue to prefer bitcoin over gold as a store of value and medium of exchange."

recall that only 20 years ago AOL and Yahoo! were poised to dominate ...","Oct 9, 2017,02:37pm EDT",Last week I spoke on the topic of the blockchain last week at the Subscriber Investment Summit in Vancouver. My presentation focused on the future of mining—not just of gold and precious metals but also cryptocurrencies.,"Believe it or not, there are upwards of 2,100 digital currencies being traded in the world right now, with a combined market cap of nearly $150 billion, according to Coinranking.com.Obviously not all of these cryptos will survive. We’re still in the early innings. Last month I compared this exciting new digital world to the earliest days of the dotcom era, and just as there were winners and losers then, so too will there be winners and losers today. Although bitcoin and Ethereum appear to be the frontrunners right now, recall that only 20 years ago AOL and Yahoo! were poised to dominate the internet. How times have changed!It will be interesting to see which coins emerge as the “Amazon” and “Google” of cryptocurrencies.For now, Ethereum has some huge backers. The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), according to its website, seeks to “learn from and build upon the only smart contract supporting blockchain currently running in real-world production—Ethereum.” The EEA includes several big-name financial and tech firms such as Credit Suisse, Intel, Microsoft and JPMorgan Chase, whose own CEO, Jamie Dimon, knocked cryptos a couple of weeks ago.Lately I’ve been seeing more and more headlines asking whether cryptos are “killing” gold. Would the gold price be higher today if massive amounts of money weren’t flowing into bitcoin? Both assets, after all, are sometimes favored as safe havens. They’re decentralized and accepted all over the world, 24 hours a day. Transactions are anonymous. Supply is limited.But I don’t think for a second that cryptocurrencies will ever replace gold, for a number of reasons. For one, cryptos are strictly forms of currency, whereas gold has many other time-tested applications, from jewelry to dentistry to electronics.Unlike cryptos, gold doesn’t require electricity to trade. This makes it especially useful in situations such as hurricane-ravished Puerto Rico, where 95 percent of people are reportedly still without power. Right now the island’s economy is cash-only. If you have gold jewelry or coins, they can be converted into cash—all without electricity or WiFi.Finally, gold remains one of the most liquid assets, traded daily in well-established exchanges all around the globe. Every day, some £13.8 billion, or $18 billion, worth of physical gold are traded in London alone, according to the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA). The cryptocurrency market, although expanding rapidly, is not quite there yet.I will admit, though, that bitcoin is energizing some investors, especially millennials, in ways that gold might have a hard time doing. The proof is all over the internet. You can find a number of TED Talks on bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and the blockchain, but to my knowledge, none is available on gold investing. YouTube is likewise bursting at the seams with videos on cryptos.Bitcoin is up 350 percent for the year, Ethereum an unbelievable 3,600 percent. Gold, meanwhile, is up around 10 percent. Producers, as measured by the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, have gained 11.5 percent in 2017, 23 percent since its 52-week low in December 2016.The news is filled with negative headlines, and sometimes it’s challenging to stay positive. Take Friday’s jobs report. It showed that the U.S. lost 33,000 jobs in September, the first month in seven years that this happened. A weak report was expected because of Hurricane Irma, but no one could have guessed the losses would be this deep.The jobs report wasn’t all bad news, however. For one, the decline is very likely temporary. Beyond that, a record 4.88 million Americans who were previously sitting out of the labor force found work last month. This helped the unemployment rate fall to 4.2 percent, a 16-year low.There’s more that supports a stronger U.S. economy. As I shared with you last week, the Manufacturing ISM Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose to a 13-year high in September, indicating rapid expansion in the manufacturing industry. Factory orders were up during the month. Auto sales were up. Oil has stayed in the relatively low $50-a-barrel range, which is good for transportation and industrials, especially airlines. Small-cap stocks, as measured by the Russell 2000 Index, continue to climb above their 50-day and 200-day moving averages as excitement over tax reform intensifies.These are among the reasons why I remain bullish.One final note: Speaking on tax reform, Warren Buffett told CNBC last week that he’s waiting to sell assets until he knows the plan will go through. “I would feel kind of silly if I realized $1 billion worth of gains and paid $350 million in tax on it if I just waited a few months and would have paid $250 million,” he said.It’s a fair comment, and I imagine other like-minded, forward-thinking investors, buyers and sellers will also wait to make huge transactions if they can help it. Tax reform isn’t a done deal, but I think it has a much better chance of being signed into law than a health care overhaul. "

According to Yahoo Finance, Bitcoin, the world’s first decentralized digital currency, is up by 1600 percent this year. Just this past Tuesday, it reached an all-time high of nearly $18,000, compared to its meek start at less than one U.S. dollar per coin in 2009. This trend of booming popularity is true for other cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin and Ethereum, which joined the market a few years after in 2011 and 2013. Bitcoin has gone from an obscure, speculative investment idea to a mainstream and sought-after phenomenon, all in less than a decade.What’s been fueling this seemingly sudden Bitcoin boom? It’s a variety of different factors, but mainly, it’s mistrust in the government and the rebellious nature of a new generation. Bitcoin is innately anti-institution, and purchasing it goes against traditional wisdom because it lacks inherent, tangible value. On the other hand, that’s a large part of its appeal to anti-institution investors – you don't have to look at earnings, yield curves or otherwise justify valuations. Bitcoin is never under or overvalued because you simply don't know what the appropriate valuation is.Average USD market price across major bitcoin exchanges.Bitcoin Popularity and Lack of Faith in Institutions The recent explosion of interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies links to the current state of our government and financial systems. The political environment in the U.S. is the most tumultuous it’s been in recent history, and evidence would suggest that has had a direct impact on the markets and how people are investing their money. The rise in Bitcoin is closely correlated to people’s faith, or lack thereof, in government-backed institutions. Therefore, the less faith people have in the political climate, the higher Bitcoin valuations will continue to rise.There could be a generational gap here as well. There’s been a downward trend of trust in government across the board. Specifically, Millennials are showing less faith in institutions and the government than previous generations have. They’re also showing some of the highest interest and participation in Bitcoin, with more than a third of millennials saying they’d rather own Bitcoin than stocks, according to a survey by venture capital firm Blockchain Capital. Moreover, when politics are discussed in the U.S., you’ll commonly hear about “fake news” and how the government system is corrupt. This mentality is common among millennials—thus, indirectly increasing the popularity of Bitcoin.Government trust by generation.Is History Repeating Itself? An anomaly like Bitcoin is going to draw strong, varying opinions. Those who’ve bought into Bitcoin already think it's going to continue to increase in value. Those who are just catching wind of it think it's a bubble that’s bound to burst at any time.Some skeptics are drawing close comparisons to the gold and silver bubbles in the mid-1970’s and 80’s. Gold and silver both experienced dramatic price escalations, similar to what Bitcoin is going through right now. For example, silver’s price spiked from $6 per troy ounce in 1979 to a high of $49.45 per troy ounce in January 1980. Gold’s price spiked from $512 in 1979 to $850 per troy ounce in 1980.Bitcoin has been referred to as “digital gold”, but whether it will share the same fate is still widely unpredictable. Gold and silver’s notorious bubble burst in the 1980’s, which was partly due to extreme geo-political events, show that government decisions can play an intrinsic role in a commodity’s value.Bitcoin Shows Signs of Continued GrowthHistorically speaking, many of these euphoria-fueled investments eventually end up crashing — much like the technology bubble bursting in the early 2000s. Many investors expected the dot-com bubble to burst in 1997, but it didn’t happen until 2001, and those who pulled out early missed out on substantial gains.Although there are valid concerns that the Bitcoin bubble could burst, it can take a long time for things like that to play out, and there is still a probable amount of upside for bitcoin in the short-term. First of all, the infrastructure to support Bitcoin is improving. GBTC, for example, is a security that loosely tracks Bitcoin, and increasing the ability to buy and sell cryptocurrencies through this and other common investment vehicles could increase the demand. Perhaps most importantly, Bitcoin continues to be extremely appealing to mainstream investors. This cultural phenomenon has provided a way for people to rebel against institutions that have compromised public trust, hence the recent surge of popularity.Time will tell if Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will slowly make their way into our day-to-day lives, but if they are able to continue gaining mainstream trust and acceptance among investors, there will be a bright short-term future for this new asset class.Duncan Rolph is a managing partner at Miracle Mile Advisors, an independent, SEC Registered Investment Advisory firm based in Los Angeles."

[+] England. (Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)","Call it a win for the federal government - mostly. The Court has issued a ruling in the battle between the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Coinbase, a company which facilitates transactions of digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, to determine whether the IRS is entitled to customer data. Today, the Court granted in part and denied in part the federal government's petition to enforce the hotly contested summons: in other words, the IRS may legally investigate Coinbase account holders who may not have paid federal taxes on their virtual currency profits, but the scope of the summons has been dramatically narrowed.The case began in November of 2016 with a request filed on behalf of the IRS to serve a ""John Doe"" summons on all U.S. Coinbase customers who transferred Bitcoin, a convertible virtual currency, from 2013 to 2015. A ""John Doe"" summons is an order that does not specifically identify the person but rather identifies a person or ascertainable group or class by their activities. The IRS argued that the ""John Doe"" summons was necessary because they had found evidence of noncompliance and underreporting among Coinbase customers - the agency just couldn't identify the exact identities and scale of the problem without more information. The IRS was initially seeking all records, including third party information, related to Bitcoin transactions conducted by U.S. Coinbase customers over the 2013 to 2015 time period.The initial request was granted and in response, Coinbase customer and attorney Jeffrey K. Berns, the Managing Partner of Berns Weiss LLP, filed a motion to intervene and have the ruling set aside. The IRS responded with a motion asking the court to deny Berns the right to intervene. Eventually, Berns withdrew his motion and in March of 2017, the IRS filed a new action seeking to enforce the summons on Coinbase. Coinbase also argued against the summons as did several ""John Does.""In its defense of the subpoena, the IRS argued that:There has been an explosion of billions of dollars of wealth in just a few years from bitcoin, a significant amount of which has no doubt accrued to United States taxpayers, with virtually no third-party reporting to the IRS of that increase in income.(You can read more on taxation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin here.)The IRS also scoffed at the argument that ""Bitcoin and blockchain are high regulated technologies,"" comparing it to ""barter exchanges in the 'Wild West' days of the late 1970s and early 1980s, before Congress imposed reporting requirements on these barter exchanges."" Further, the IRS argued that some users of cryptocurrency ""have openly acknowledged they consider using bitcoin in order to avoid tax reporting requirements.""Even as they argued that such a broad request was necessary, the IRS agreed to narrow the scope of the summons. The IRS also agreed not to seek records for users for which Coinbase filed forms 1099-K during the time period in question or for users whose identity is known to the IRS.After the scope was narrowed, the IRS argued that Coinbase admitted that the targeted information still involved 8.9 million Coinbase transactions and 14,355 Coinbase account holders. However, according to the tax agency, ""only 800 to 900 taxpayers reported gains related to bitcoin in each of the relevant years and that more than 14,000 Coinbase users have either bought, sold, sent or received at least $20,000 worth of bitcoin in a given year."" That suggested ""that many Coinbase users may not be reporting their bitcoin gains."" The IRS, the court found, ""has a legitimate interest in investigating these taxpayers.""Register Now: A Beginner's Guide To Bitcoin And Other Cryptocurrencies Free WebcastCoinbase and other parties argued that the scope of the investigation meant that IRS was conducting something akin to a fishing expedition. The Court disagreed, finding that the IRS’ purpose in requesting the information was related to tax compliance, not research.However, the Court did agree that the summons was over-broad. The IRS initially sought records on all U.S. Coinbase customers who transferred convertible virtual currency at any time between December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2015. Those records included user profiles, user preferences, user security settings and history, user payment methods, and other information related to the funding sources for the account/wallet/vault. IRS also sought all records of account/wallet/vault activity including records identifying the date, amount, and type of transaction, names or other identifiers of parties to the transaction; requests or instructions to send or receive bitcoin; and all related correspondence.That request, the Court found, was ""broader than necessary."" The Court determined that certain items, such as account opening records, copies of passports or driver’s licenses, all wallet addresses, and all public keys for all accounts/wallets/vaults, were not relevant to the IRS' purpose. Other requested information, such as records of Know-Your-Customer diligence, agreements or instructions granting a third-party access, control, or transaction approval authority, and correspondence between Coinbase and the user or any third party with access to the account/wallet/vault pertaining to the account/wallet/vault opening, closing, or transaction activity, was also found to not be relevant ""at this stage."" The Court did note, however, that those records ""may become necessary for a specific account holder once the IRS reviews the relevant records"" but would not grant unfettered access to that information for all account holders.So what does this mean for Coinbase customers? The Court has ordered Coinbase to produce the following customer information:However, that information is limited to those accounts with at least $20,000 in any one transaction type (buy, sell, send, or receive) in any one year from 2013 to 2015.No other records must be produced at this time.This resolution likely means that many account holders are breathing a sigh of relief - for now. But as virtually currency continues in popularity, with Bitcoin blowing past $10,000 this week, you can bet that IRS won't stop with this request. Those who are buying Bitcoin (including speculators) are currently making money - and Uncle Sam wants a cut.The case, United States v. Coinbase, Inc. (3:17-cv-01431-JSC), is assigned to Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley in the U.S. District Court, California Northern District (San Francisco). You can read the Order in the case here."

[+] act. Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg","Hackers have proven just how urgently a gaping flaw in the global telecoms network, affecting what's known as Signalling System No. 7 (SS7), needs to be fixed. In a video demonstration, shown to Forbes ahead of publication today, benevolent hackers from Positive Technologies were able to take control of a Coinbase bitcoin wallet and start pilfering funds via the SS7 flaws.SS7 weaknesses, despite fixes being available for years, remain open. They allow anyone with access to that part of the telecoms backbone to send and receive messages to and from cellphones, with various attacks allowing silent interception of SMS texts, calls and location data. (Typically, the SS7 network is used by telecoms companies to talk with one another, normally for shifting customers between operators when roaming).In their attack, the Positive researchers first went to Gmail, using Google's service to find an email account with just a phone number. Once the email account was identified, the hackers initiated a password reset process, asking one-time authorization codes to be sent to the victim's phone. By exploiting SS7 weaknesses they were able to intercept text messages containing those codes, allowing them to choose a new password and take control of the Gmail account. They could then simply head to the Coinbase website and do another password reset using the email they'd compromised.Scary SS7 attacksThis isn't just a threat that affects bitcoin, of course. It affects anything linked within the Gmail account, not to mention the complete loss of all those emails and the entire Google account. ""This hack would work for any resource - real currency or virtual currency - that uses SMS for password recovery,"" said Positive researcher Dmitry Kurbatov. ""This is a vulnerability in mobile networks, which ultimately means it is an issue for everyone, especially services relying on the mobile network to send security codes.""The biggest barrier, perhaps, to such attacks is acquiring access to the SS7 network in the first place. Positive's researchers had access to it ""for research purposes to identify vulnerabilities and help mobile operators make their networks more secure."" Typically, criminals would either have to buy or hack their way onto the network.As for how others might do that, Kurbatov added: ""The risk lies in the fact that cybercriminals can potentially buy access to SS7 illegitimately [on the] dark web."" He pointed to dark web sites, like Interconnector, that have been seen selling SS7 services. (Some claimed Interconnector was a scam).Indeed, criminals have, on at least one occasion, used SS7 vulnerabilities to carry out an attack. That occurred in Germany this year, when crooks were able to use the same methods as the Positive researchers, but to pilfer funds from bank accounts of O2-Telefonica customers.Surveillance companies, such as Israeli firm Ability Inc., are also actively selling services to spy on targets over the SS7 network. Ability's Unlimited Inteception app has sold for as much as $5 million, though the cost can go up to $20 million, the firm's CEO told Forbes last year.While the world waits for telecoms companies to act, users could also stop using SMS for two-factor authentication. SS7 attacks such as those carried out by Positive, which previously showed how to hack WhatsApp and Facebook accounts with similar exploits, currently won't work where data-based communications are used for sending one-time codes, such as Google's Authenticator app.Daniel Romero, Coinbase vice president of operations, said the company has been reaching out to customers about migrating from SMS-based two-factor authentication to apps like Google Authenticator. ""Additionally, we've enhanced our own monitoring systems to prevent phone-related security threats. We are continuing to monitor this vigilantly,"" he said. The company has witnessed an uptick in hacks using another popular method for bitcoin theft: stealing a user's telephone number by social engineering the telecoms firms. From there, the hackers can, in a similar way to the SS7 attacks, reset passwords.Google has various tools available to concerned users on to of Authenticator, such as the Google Security Checkup. For non-SMS two-factor authentication, which will prevent SS7 attacks, it's possible to use a Google prompt or security key instead.But the problem won't go away until telecoms operators take action. Even with pressure to patch coming from Capitol Hill, chiefly from representative Ted Lieu and senator Ron Wyden, little progress appears to have been made.Must Read: An Intrepid Investor's Guide To Buying Bitcoin And Other Crypto Assets"

Its market cap is more than $293 billion, and while some analysts warn of a crypto bubble, others say Bitcoin could eventually compete against the gold market. Regardless, cryptocurrency has created fast wealth for investors, and now some are cashing out and going house hunting.","Real estate agents in Boston, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Washington D.C. and several cities in California said they’ve had conversations with people about using cryptocurrency as part of their transaction.Carina Isentaeva, a Redfin agent in San Francisco, recently helped a client write an offer on a luxury home in Silicon Valley that was contingent on the sale of cryptocurrency. The offer was accepted, but the buyer ended up backing out when his cryptocurrency didn’t sell. Isentaeva said she’s confident he will buy when it does.Jeremy Paul, a Redfin agent in San Diego, also worked with clients who held Bitcoin. He said his clients cashed out two bitcoins, valued at $7,435 each, to cover the closing costs on a home in Carlsbad, CA.And homebuyers aren’t the only ones in the cryptocurrency game. Redfin found 75 listings nationwide in which the seller mentioned he or she will accept Bitcoin as payment. The seller of a condo in Miami is requesting payment in Bitcoin only; it will cost the buyer 33.One way to illustrate the unprecedented growth of Bitcoin is to look at the price of the typical home in bitcoins over the past year. For example, in January 2016 in San Francisco, the typical home would have cost a buyer 2,805 bitcoins. Today, the median home in San Francisco is 82 bitcoins.National median home price in BitcoinsLatest median metro home price in BitcoinsFor buyers who have made a lot of money on the recent surge in cryptocurrency value, buying a home is a reasonable way to use the proceeds. For sellers accepting Bitcoin, however, it’s riskier because accepting cryptocurrency as payment is a bet that it’s going to continue to increase.“It’s hard to say whether the use of cryptocurrency to buy and sell homes is a long-term trend or just a blip based on the recent spike in value,” said Redfin chief economist Nela Richardson. “In some ways, cryptocurrency investors have just won the lottery, and so it makes perfect sense to buy their dream home. On the other side of the ‘coin’, sellers probably wouldn’t accept lottery tickets as payment.”Currently, Redfin does not accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment.MethodologyFor this analysis we pulled the monthly median sale price for each metropolitan division with a population of 750,000 or higher. Then we pulled the daily weighted BTC to USD exchange rate from Bitstamp (via Quandl) and used the value for the end of every month. Then we divided the typical home price by the corresponding exchange rate to convert home prices in dollars to bitcoins."

It’s a digital currency that exists on a decentralized network of computers located around the world that keep track of all Bitcoin transactions. The transactions are recorded on an open-source ledger—the blockchain—that is constantly updated and viewable by anyone participating in the network.Like stocks and commodities the price of Bitcoin is determined by bidding on exchanges and can be extremely volatile. At the beginning of the year the price of a single Bitcoin was less than $1,000, but it has climbed dramatically since then, particularly in the last few weeks. The price broke the $10,000 barrier on November 28 and then really took off, gaining $5000 in one 48-hour period to hit an all-time high of $18,000 on December 7, but dropping more than $3000 by the next morning.Why is Bitcoin so popular?  The answer lies in the long-term debasement (through low interest rates and money printing) of fiat currencies around the globe.  Fiat currencies are those backed by nothing other than an expectation that their central bankers will manage them prudently.  For example, ever since President Nixon announced the U.S. would no longer convert dollars to gold at a fixed value in 1971, the dollar moved from gold backing (where USD $35.00 was readily convertible into an ounce of gold) over to a free float.  Since then, U.S. dollars are backed by nothing other than the “full faith and credit” of the United States, as written on each buck.  As you would expect, the greenback has therefore steadily depreciated since then and one ounce of gold is worth USD $1,248 today.  The problem with fiat currencies is that, inevitably, central bankers have a terrible long-term track record of managing supply prudently.  For example, the U.S. Central Bank expanded its balance sheet by ~$4 trillion after the Great Recession in 2008.  Nearly a decade later, it has only just started to reverse prior quantitative easing efforts with monthly reductions of only $6-8 billion!  Moreover, interest rates (otherwise known as the price of money) remain extremely low.  In fact, the Bank of England recently published research showing that today’s risk free interest rates are near an 800-year low!  That’s why Bitcoin is so popular – because its block chain technology promises to objectively control supply in an environment where central bankers have proven an inability to effectively do so.Is Bitcoin a bubble?  Although many commentators suggest it is, the answer to this isn’t so clear to me.  I’ve witnessed many bubbles over the years, the Internet mania, the housing bubble, fixed income bubbles of all sorts, the NASDAQ bubble, the art bubble, just to name a few.  I’ve also read about historic bubbles, like the Tulip Mania and the railroad bubble.  Most bubbles include circumstances where money supply was abundant and leverage was readily available similar to what we see today.  However, not many bubbles included a potential solution to the problem of long-term fiat currency debasement.  Moreover, Bitcoin’s overall current total market capitalization remains well below what it would be if it were to become a major substitute currency.  Thus, it’s hard to conclude that Bitcoin is currently in a bubble even though it has appreciated spectacularly of late.One final observation about Bitcoin is that alternative investors speculating on it seem to be acting more rationally than those who’ve dialed down their alternative asset return expectations.  Institutional investors and their consultants often tell us these days that they’re no longer looking for big gains from alternative investments.  Instead, they say that they would prefer steady returns (6-8%) without any big drawdowns.  However, many of these same investors are flooding into Bitcoin speculation lately.  The answer to this conundrum is twofold: (1) greed and fear are driving alternative investors into Bitcoin (greed of achieving big returns and fear of missing out) while (2) lack of good recent returns from the largest alternative asset managers (the big safe bets that many consultants have recommended for years) are causing them to dial down their overall return expectations for alternative assets.  An important lesson can be learned from all this – strong returns will generate strong investor demand so don’t change your strategy because consultants tell you that investors no longer want to make money! "

Founded in Singapore in 2015, TenX raised USD $80 million in one of the biggest initial coin offering to date.We recently met to discuss about blockchain, ICOs and the crypto market:Omri Barzilay: What is Tenx? Why and how it was started?Dr. Julian Hosp, Co-Founder TenXDr. Julian Hosp: At TenX we are bringing virtual currencies to the masses. We separated this vision into three subparts. The first one and that’s how TenX got started is making virtual currencies instantly spendable anytime anywhere in a very easy and convenient way. At TenX it’s all about convenience and being user-friendly. Users can spend different virtual currencies with the TenX debit card all around the world. The next step is going to be converting fiat into virtual currencies with a click of a button. We are testing it right now and it’s going to be live soon. The third step will allow people to just deposit money and have them spread over different virtual currencies without deciding which one to use. We are going to use COMIT for this which will become the financial rails that will be connecting literally any financial asset. That’s a long-term view over the next 5-7 years.Barzilay: You raised $80M in one of the biggest ICOs to date. Tell me about the process? What helped you raise so much?Dr. Hosp: I think the key is delivering much more value than what we are asking for. Around half a year before our token sale we started educating people on the token sale. We were delivering value and building a product without getting any money for two years leading up to the token sale. And then within 7 minutes we basically cashed in on all that work without spending at all on marketing, because we already had the credibility. Many companies don’t want to work upfront, they want to get money first. We are aiming to have a million active cards by the end of 2018. We can get there by delivering a lot of value. At the moment, we do it through educational videos and we just launched the “Cryptocurrencies simply explained” book which we were using in the company and now people can get it on Amazon and learn about the fundamentals of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.Barzilay: Have you kept the funds in virtual currencies? If not, why?Dr. Hosp: We kept a small percentage in virtual currencies and converted the majority into fiat money, because our community didn’t give us money to speculate on profits of cryptocurrencies. We wanted to have the majority of the money in a sustainable way to build the business - to develop our product, to get the banking licence, to scale up, grow our team (we are 50 people now, are going to get 200 people next year and 500-600 people the year after) and to build COMIT. We can’t be depending on the price of virtual currencies going up and down. I think in the long run it will go up, but if you need a monthly cash-flow and crypto goes down massively, you just deplete your money. It’s important to avoid that.Barzilay: What strategic partnerships have you secured to date? What's in the pipeline?Dr. Hosp: We have partnerships with other blockchain companies, where we offer products together, but we didn’t announce these partnerships, simply because for us partnerships are not there to create hype but to execute. Obviously, we have secured several card-issuing partnerships for our debit cards. We have a partnership in Europe, in Singapore and are going to release soon one for the US, Japan and some other countries. These are the most relevant and we have a lot of smaller partnerships. We’ve been working with a lot of regulators in Europe on getting the banking licence and it looks very promising.Barzilay: How are you different than competitors like Monaco, Polybius and others?Dr. Hosp: The main and most important difference is that we are live and have over 100,000 users. The companies you mentioned don’t have a live product and I think one should not compare something that is already working and something that is just promised. So, let’s better compare TenX to the products that are live - WireX, Xapo or Bitwala. They focus only on Bitcoin and their entire backend is set up in a way that it’s working for Bitcoin. We have multiple virtual currencies on - Bitcoin, Ether, Dash and ERC20 tokens. At the moment, we don’t offer all the coins to everyone, but on a request basis to different groups, so that we can scale fast enough. We scaled within a couple of months to 100,000 users, and aim to scale to 1,000,000 next year.Barzilay: What do you think about the current rally in Bitcoin and other currencies?Dr. Hosp: The World Economic Forum predicts that 10% of the global GDP will be stored on the blockchain in less than 10 years. In terms of today’s global GDP that would be $7.8 trillion. It’s also being predicted that over the next 7-10 years, the entire crypto market will undergo another 25X. Right now we see a very steep growth. The speed of the growth will be sustainable. There will always be some setbacks - this is normal. You see the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, adding Bitcoin features, and we are going to see more and more structured products there. Bitcoin and Ethereum will be more mainstream. We see for example Kryptokitties a new game on Ethereum. All these things cause adoption to the crypto ecosystem. I think we see just the beginning of this and Bitcoin will be a leader. We will see lower and also way higher prices.Barzilay: Do you believe Bitcoin will ever be embraced by the U.S. government?Dr. Hosp: I think that the concept of virtual currencies will definitely be embraced, because they have a very transparent transaction ledger. So, we know exactly what’s been happening. With bank transfers, it’s quite hard, but with fiat money it’s impossible, so I think virtual currencies will see a huge uprise by governments. Whether governments will embrace Bitcoin - let’s see, but there is definitely value for people. Bitcoin is very difficult to hack, it’s almost impossible to steal if you use for example multi-signature bolt. And with TenX you can spend Bitcoin pretty much anywhere. So, this is the future to go. I don’t think that Bitcoin is going to be a currency, but it’s going to have status like gold."

At the time, bitcoin lost about $1,000 worth of value but is up more than four times since. Most people think it's a bubble and argue that the cryptocurrency is a magnet for money laundering.Regardless of popular opinion, the CME Group launched bitcoin futures recently. We have a bona fide, legally traded derivative.On Tuesday, bitcoin futures were down nearly $1,000 to $17,210 for the January contract. Due to its size, it is the only cryptocurrency with a futures contract.

(Chart courtesy of ThinkMarkets)ThinkMarkets' chief market analyst and Forbes contributor Naeem Aslam hasn't any real conviction on ether. It can go either way at this point. The Russian-developed coin is down today but has outperformed bitcoin over the last several weeks because investors are looking for cheaper coins to buy.Over the last several months, a handful of financial pundits, like James Altucher, have been shining a light on smaller cryptos. Litecoin is one of the brightest stars.Litecoin volume is half that of ether, but newcomers to the cryptocurrency gambling den can buy one... [+] for $324 on most exchanges. It was around $200 only last week. (Chart courtesy of ThinkMarkets.)Because of bitcoin's popularity, and because it is so expensive, newcomers are discovering new coins. It's a shell game that hedge funds from Russia, China, the U.K. and the U.S. are willing to play.According to Coin Market Cap, a website dedicated to the hundreds of cryptocurrencies startups have created over the last year to fund their projects, the total market cap of these things is $624.3 billion. Newly created cryptocurrencies have also created newly minted millionaires worldwide. That's got everybody looking at this market and trying to make a play, even if it means throwing money into a firepit. Investors putting money to work in cryptocurrencies must be prepared to lose their entire investment.Interests is growing, despite the risks. Smaller cryptos are gaining on bitcoin in terms of headline space.""I think there is a lot of value in some of the smaller tokens such as Dash, Ripple, and NEO,"" says Aslam in an emailed interview today.Dash is a top 10 coin priced at $1,590 as of Wednesday and is up 32.8% today. Ripple is a top five coin based on market cap and is priced at $0.75, making it one of the cheaper cryptos with trading volume.NEO was created by Chinese developers and is a spinoff of Ethereum, with proprietary technology. That one is down 6.4% on Wednesday and trades around $270 million coins per day, according to Coin Market Cap. One NEO costs $69.33.Investors shouldn't just buy coins because they are cheap.""They are very cheap, but their business ecosystem is really strong,"" says Aslam about dash, ripple and NEO. ""Ether has been rising because of superior technology but some upcoming ICOs...have technology that can process cryptocurrency transactions even faster than Ethereum.""Bitcoin is destined to become a niche asset, ING financial analysts wrote in a report to clients on Dec. 18. The report alone shows how top-tier investors are feeling left behind on what many see as a cryptocurrency gold rush.Bitcoin is up over 2,000% in the last 12 months. A thousand dollars pumped into bitcoin last December is now worth over $20,000.(No wonder this Indian couple asked for bitcoin as a wedding gift instead of gold, an old standby for newly wedded couples there.)ING thinks bitcoin has ""little to offer"" a wider audience and will likely return to being a niche product for a select group of enthusiasts. What cryptocurrency developers regard as key benefits may end up being impediments to wider adoption, report authors warned.Bitcoin, ether, Litecoin, dash, and the hundreds of other coins out there are not normal investment assets. No one knows their true value. Most are based on the ideas of a startup company with no sales to speak of.Comparing bitcoin to currencies is better than comparing it to a security like stocks and bonds, ING says. In that case, it stands to reason that if a large enough group of people decide a particular cryptocurrency isn't needed to buy or sell a service or product, then its usage plummets and the value goes to zero because there is nothing backing it.""The risks are all around solvency and exchange,"" says Aslam. ""We all know how an exchange can go down and your digital wallet — where you are holding your currency — can disappear. This is why clients need the regulatory support,"" he says, in order to protect investors from fraud."

""The potential gains are huge. In this case BCH went from $1k to $8k in an hour.""Bitcoin Cash has jumped in Value since the Coinbase announcement. Chart by CoinMarketCap.The stakes are huge when a cryptocurrency enters the big exchanges. Suddenly a cryptocurrency that might have only been available to a few people with specific digital wallets is available to a much larger audience of potential buyers. While Coinbase had publicly revealed that it would support Bitcoin Cash at some point, the exact timing was unknown.In this case, someone who invested $150,000 in BCH before the adoption stood to make over $1,000,000 in profit very soon after the Coinbase announcement, which states that ""sends and receives are available immediately,"" and that buys and sells would be ""available to all customers once there is sufficient liquidity on GDAX.""The key question: who ""mukiwa2"" isIt's not clear who ""mukiwa2"" is, but upon questioning in the Reddit thread, the user reveal that he or she had an inside source.""I have a mate at CB ;),"" mukiwa2 said.(CB almost certainly refers to Coinbase.)""mukiwa2"" seemed to realize the danger of posting this publicly rather quickly. After more questions, whoever was behind ""mukiwa2"" deleted his or her comment. Unfortunately for ""mukiwa2,"" the comment was archived, so then ""mukiwa2"" deleted his or her entire account.However, Renshaw saved a screen capture of the commentary on December 20 at Archive.is.Renshaw believes he has uncovered the person who posted the note on Reddit, and has publicly named him on his Facebook account. The person in question is a self-described ""Bitcoin and Altcoin enthusiast,"" with many tweets about cryptocurrency, including ""winning Bitcoin"" and getting ""free Bitcoin.""I contacted the individual via Twitter, however, and the person denies it, and shared a different Facebook account he named as his own, which is not the one Renshaw named. I find his story credible, and as a result, I am not linking to his social profiles. (Note: even with reasonable doubt I would not ""doxx"" a person by linking to their social accounts. That would require significant and compelling evidence from multiple sources.)Update: I've contacted Renshaw, shared the additional information, and he agrees that the individual he first suspected is likely not the right person. He has made his Facebook post private.Regardless of who the exact individual is, it seems apparent that there was the clear potential for insider trading. Somehow, on December 18th, someone knew about Coinbase supporting Bitcoin Cash beginning on December 19th, and posted publicly about that fact.I have asked Coinbase for commentary, but do not expect an answer today, as it's Christmas.However, Coinbase noticed the price run-up itself, and has already launched an internal investigation."

[+] (ISS) early on September 13, 2017. (KIRILL KUDRYAVTSEV/AFP/Getty Images)","In the incredibly competitive world of bitcoin mining, one of the keys to the game is finding the cheapest possible source of energy. In the not so distant future, that source of energy may be found in space.As a quick review, the bitcoin mining process is what keeps everyone in the world on the same Bitcoin ledger; it effectively prevents people from spending the same bitcoin twice. Bitcoin miners are rewarded for their work through the creation of new bitcoin and transaction fees (known as the block reward).At a recent Bitcoin security conference in Paris (called Breaking Bitcoin), cryptography consultant and former Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd explored the idea of mining bitcoin in space.It should be noted that this is more of a thought exercise at this point than something that is going to happen at any point in the near future. As Todd has explained on his blog, “Sorry guys, but the phrase ‘not as crazy as it sounds’ just means we’re in the realm of hard sci-fi rather than pure fantasy: if space-based solar power ever becomes practical, then it’d made sense to put Bitcoin miners in space. But we still need to make space solar practical, and that’s a lot way off.”Generating Power in SpacePutting solar panels in space is an idea that has been explored for many years, and the reasoning behind it is quite simple.“You put a bunch of solar panels up there, and it’s nice and shiny,” explained Todd during his presentation. “There’s none of those annoying clouds to get in the way. And you beam your power back to earth.”There have also been proposals for the generation of nuclear power in space, but no matter what kind of power generation you’re talking about, one key issue remains: How do you get the power back to earth in an efficient manner?In a 2010 article in the New Scientist, one proposal for beaming power from space back to earth was described by the president of a consultancy firm that specializes in space solar power as providing less energy than moonlight.Getting That Power Back to EarthPointing to a tweet by Max Keiser of The Keiser Report as a reference, Todd noted that bitcoin may be a solution to the problem of what to do with power once it has been generated in space.“The easiest way to get the power back is, really, to get the money that the power represents in terms of bitcoin,” said Todd.The longtime Bitcoin researcher went on to note that this sort of phenomenon already exists on earth. In both China and Russia, there have been examples of using bitcoin to convert “stranded power” into cash.“You have some power getting generated in a place, but you don’t actually have the infrastructure to get it off to the grid where it would actually be used,” noted Todd. “If you did, somehow, solve the challenge of solar power in space, adding the bitcoin miners too is actually pretty easy in comparison.""While putting bitcoin miners in space potentially solves the incentives around getting solar panels out there in the first place, it should be noted that those solar panels will not lead to any of that power being used back at home on earth.Getting a Mined Bitcoin Block Back to EarthOne last thing to think about in terms of mining bitcoin in space is that any block a miner finds need to get back to earth in a timely manner. In this regard, Todd estimated that it would take roughly 0.3 seconds for a newly found block to get from a miner in geostationary orbit back down to the rest of the network on the ground.Todd explained why getting the block data from space back down to earth would not take as long as some may think.“First of all, in space you can go in a straight line,” explained Todd. “Whereas, if you actually look at fiber maps of where they actually put the cables in the ocean, they go and squiggle all over the place because they have to avoid obstacles like undersea mountains. The other thing is, the speed of light in fiber is actually slower than a vacuum . . . So, it’s a bit slower, but it’s not as slow as you’d think.”According to a simple estimate provided by Todd during his talk, miners in a geostationary orbit around earth would be 99.4% as profitable as well-connected miners on earth due to the extra bit of time it takes for the space miner to get their data back to earth.Of course, this assumes the majority of miners are found on earth. If the majority of miners are in space, then the miners on earth are the ones at a disadvantage."

To Know",https://www.forbes.com/sites/tysoncross/2017/10/17/yes-the-bitcoin-hard-fork-really-is-taxable-income-heres-what-you-need-to-know/,"I write about the tax treatment of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This 
article is more than 2 years old.","Editors' Pick|Oct 17, 2017,12:24pm EDT",Shutterstock,"UPDATE: In the absence of guidance from the IRS and in light of the inherit difficulty of reporting hard fork income accurately, taxpayers might consider reporting income only when they claim or otherwise exercise control over the hard forked coins using the market price on that date.Less than three months have passed since the Bitcoin Cash hard fork and already two more Bitcoin hard forks are looming. In light of what seems to be a recurring event, questions still remain about the tax consequences of cryptocurrency hard forks. Although the IRS provided general guidance on cryptocurrencies back in 2014, the Service has remained silent on the topic ever since. US taxpayers are on their own to determine the proper tax treatment of cryptocurrency hard forks (among a myriad of other issues), and opinions vary wildly.Free Money is Generally Taxable IncomeThe problem with the Bitcoin hard fork from a tax perspective is that every Bitcoin holder receives an equivalent amount of the new cryptocurrency for free. Bitcoin message boards and forums are already full of posters excited for the prospect of ""free money.""Unfortunately for US taxpayers, the IRS has a long and successful history of treating ""free money"" as taxable income. Lottery winnings, game show prizes, and found property all qualify as taxable income in the eyes of the IRS. Even unwanted free money is considered taxable income. See Haverly v. U.S., 513 F.2d 224 (7th Cir. 1975)(holding that free textbooks sent unsolicited by a publisher to a high school principal were taxable income).There's little doubt that the IRS has plenty of legal authority to treat the hard fork as taxable income. However, several factors make it difficult for taxpayers to accurately and reliably determine the amount of such income.What is the Amount of the Taxable Income?The first hurdle is determining the amount of the taxable income. To do so, the taxpayer will have to establish the fair market value of the newly created cryptocurrency at the time of the hard fork. ""Fair Market Value"" is generally defined as the price a willing buyer will pay to a willing seller. An obvious problem exists for determining FMV when there are no buyers and sellers. In the case of the Ethereum hard fork last year, the new cryptocurrency Ethereum Classic did not start trading on exchanges for several weeks. As a result, establishing the FMV for Ethereum Classic at the time of the hard fork was essentially just guess work.In some cases, though, taxpayers may have other indications of FMV. For example, Bitcoin Cash had been trading on futures markets for weeks prior to its hard fork in August. The price on these futures markets was approximately $275 at the time of the hard fork on August 1, 2017, and that price was more or less confirmed when BCH began trading on cryptocurrency exchanges a few hours later. However, there is no way to tell whether the IRS will accept the use of futures markets to establish FMV, or what taxpayers should do if there is no futures market at all.For the time being, Taxpayers should try to establish FMV with whatever method appears reasonable, and report that amount as taxable income. That likely means using the futures price of the new cryptocurrency if an exchange price is not immediately available.  Taxpayers who adopt the method that yields the lowest possible value should be prepared for the IRS to disagree. In either case, the FMV of the new cryptocurrency will be the taxpayer's cost basis of the new cryptocurrency going forward.When Does the Taxable Income Arise?Another hurdle for taxpayers is when to report the income from the hard fork. The issue is that not all Bitcoin holders will receive the benefit of the hard fork at the same time. Some users will have immediate access to their new cryptocurrency wallets, but others will not. Users who keep their Bitcoin on third-party exchanges like Coinbase will not be able to access their new cryptocurrency until the platform supports the new blockchain, which could be months or never at all.Taxpayers in the first group almost certainly have taxable income on the date of the hard fork. But taxpayers in the second group can probably delay recognizing taxable income until they're actually able to claim the new cryptocurrency, whenever that is. These taxpayers might be able to use the value of the cryptocurrency on the date it becomes available to them, as opposed to the date of the hard fork.The IRS is likely to say that neither group, though, can avoid the taxable income by simply ""turning their back"" on the new cryptocurrency. Under the doctrine of constructive receipt, an item of income becomes taxable as soon as it is credited to the taxpayer's account or otherwise made available to the taxpayer so that he or she can claim it at any time. See Treas. Reg. 1.451-2(a). Thus, it's irrelevant to the IRS whether the taxpayer actually claims the cryptocurrency, all that matters is that he or she could claim it. (Read: Is the Bitcoin Hard Fork Taxable? for more information on the constructive receipt doctrine.)This raises a concerning issue.  Although most Bitcoin holders know of the pending hard forks, certainly some are completely unaware. Does the doctrine of constructive receipt apply to such taxpayers? If the taxpayer truly did not know of the hard fork, then the answer is likely ""no,"" but that's of little comfort if the IRS decides to require proof of the taxpayer's lack of knowledge. Establishing actual knowledge (or a lack thereof) is exceptionally difficult from an evidentiary standpoint. Depending on how strict of a standard the IRS decides to adopt, the lack of knowledge defense could prove meaningless.And what happens when taxpayer does learn of the hard fork, possibly years down the road? One option is to report the income in the year it was discovered, but it's possible that the IRS would require the taxpayer to go all the way back to the year of the hard fork and amend that year's tax return.  From the IRS's perspective, ""unknown hard forks"" create an opportunity for gamesmanship. Taxpayers could intentionally turn a blind eye to future hard forks and wait until its convenient for them to ""discover"" their new cryptocurrency - possibly years later. This would allow taxpayers to manipulate the timing of their income, which is exactly the type of behavior the constructive receipt doctrine is intended to curtail. So, the IRS is likely to take an aggressive stance on the issue of unknown hard forks.The Bottom LineClearly, guidance is needed to provide taxpayers with a reliable way to determine the value and the timing of the taxable income from a hard fork, as well as clarification on the application of constructive receipt. Until then, taxpayers are left in the uncomfortable position of assuming the worse on every issue to avoid future conflicts with the IRS, and unfairly overpaying on their tax returns as a result. Of course, there's also the possibility that taxpayers will simply give up on trying to figure out the correct tax treatment and not report the hard fork income at all.  If the IRS wants to encourage voluntary compliance in the cryptocurrency universe, it should start by providing clear guidelines on issues like this one.For questions about Bitcoin taxation, email me at tyson@bitcointaxsolutions.com.

They are also combining blockchain technology and cryptocurrency with solar leases.","Leveraging blockchain and Bitcoin to increase transparency and reduce the costs of the cross-border transactions, both problems that inhibit the majority of commercial solar projects - from accessing traditional funding options - the Solar Energy Marketplace hopes to transform the sector with a few taps on the screen.With Sun Exchange anyone can buy remotely located solar cells and earn rental income from them. Assets are recorded on the blockchain, and income is paid in crypto-currency - what is dubbed as “streaming monetized sunshine” around the world. And, in the process the protagonists behind the project have asserted that solar energy forms a crucial part of the “save the world tool-kit.”Members of the market place can have their solar cells installed and rented to hospitals, factories, schools and rural communities in Africa and the Middle East, earning them income from solar powering the developing world.The latest investment is touted as helping to boost Sun Exchange’s capacity to meet the demand for its pipeline of “commercial-scale” solar power projects, located in the sunniest climes and connecting solar projects in emerging markets to retail customers around the globe.If one were to overlay a map of the areas of Earth that are least electrified and/or under developed with a map of the sunniest places a distinct correlation would be found, making it ideal economically and socially to install solar facilities in such locations.Engineers discussing an installation of a solar panels project. (Image: Shutterstock).From an environmental standpoint, if we take mainly coal-powered South Africa as an example, it is claimed that the embodied carbon in the electricity and the favourable solar conditions mean that a solar panel located in this African nation will offset by four times the greenhouse gas emissions versus the same panel, were located in countries like Germany or the UK. So, from a global perspective it lacks sense to install solar panels where they are least effective.Solving this problem, Sun Exchange enables people to locate their solar panels in the optimal places on the planet for the good of the owners, the energy users as well as indirectly the entire world population.The absolute sunniest places include southern and eastern Africa, particularly the northern parts of South Africa and Namibia. Many regions of India and elevated regions in Latin America also are perfect. As such these are the areas that Sun Exchange is focussed on.The news of its seed investment comes within days of  SolarCoin’s founders introducing a new Blockchain-based network for global, decentralized energy trading. The Greeneum announced on October 17 an upcoming launch of its blockchain-based platform, Greeneum Network, which leverages blockchain, smart contracts, targeted artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies.Their aim is to redefine renewable energy systems globally by enabling decentralized peer-to-peer trading, providing analytics and predictive insights on the energy lifecycle, and incentivizing the production and consumption of green energy.Its network will produce utility ERC20 token called GREEN to incentivize green energy production and reward users for consuming green energy. (Note: Individuals wishing to participate in cryptocurrency or token offerings should be aware that it is highly speculative and that the market is largely unregulated).A number of test nets and pilots are running currently for this project in Europe, Cyprus, Israel, Africa and the US. Greeneum expects the project and platform MVP will be completed by mid-2018. Such moves come against a backdrop of energy systems worldwide being notoriously outdated and inefficient, with many being plagued by the challenges of transitioning to low-carbon sources, poor grid reliability and the lack of transparency between incumbent politicians.In California, for example, growing solar generation has occasionally driven power prices to extremely low levels. Yet consumers in thus US state continue paying some of the highest electrical bills in the nation.Elsewhere, UK-based Energi Mine, a global energy solutions company that manages over $140m in energy assets, will shortly launch a blockchain-based platform designed to incentivize energy conservation with digital currency in an effort to decentralize the $2 trillion global energy market. The Manchester firm currently looks after around 1,100 customer sites across Europe - in UK, Belgium, France and The Netherlands.For its part, Sun Exchange claimed that it is the first marketplace of its kind and leverages blockchain technology to allow individuals to purchase solar cells in solar projects, which are mostly situated in emerging markets that are “solar-rich but power-poor.”It is explained that the marketplace makes solar panel ownership accessible to retail and institutional investors around the world, while giving businesses and communities in emerging markets access to “fully-funded solar power plants” to reduce running costs and drive sustainable development.African Energy MarketSun Exchange has been leading in the African energy market since 2014, and has expanded globally with a U.S. headquarters in California and a regional operating office in Dubai. Supporting its claim, the enterprise won Best Bitcoin and Blockchain Business in Africa two years in a row now (2016 and 2017) at the Africa Fintech Awards.It has been estimated that there over 600m Africans living presently without access to electricity. This hinders economic development, accelerates environmental degradation and has considerable negative consequences as regards health. With it being suggested that it would take $350 billion to provide every African with basic access to electrical energy,  the cheapest way to address this would be through solar power.Harnessing BlockchainUsing its blockchain-based platform, Sun Exchange is positioning itself to “democratize the green economy” by giving retail customers around the globe the chance to lease solar cells bought on their platform to medium to large solar installations in emerging markets. Solar panels are sold by the single solar cell, reducing the cost of solar plant ownership to below $10.So how does this $10 figure compare to what there is now on the market? Well, until now for a typical home owner to be able to utilize solar energy has meant that they would have to have their property surveyed by a number if installers, compare the quotes, pay for a team of installers to fit the system, and probably have some remedial works undertaken to the roof to ensure future proofing.And, in most cases the home’s electrical system will need updating for safety reasons in order for the solar system to be connected.All factors considered, to own even for a small solar system for a house is going to cost around $10,000 upfront, which does not count ongoing solar panel cleaning and inverter maintenance. That kind of figure effectively excludes most folk. And, given that most people do not own their own home or live in an apartment, it makes solar ownership financially challenging and a pretty distant reality.But by enabling anyone to buy solar cells that are installed and maintained in much larger commercial solar projects that are in ideal locations is a very low fuss and low cost way of owning a solar cell.“The economies of scale mean that we can sell a single solar cell for under $10, which is a three orders of magnitude lower cost. In increments of $10 it is now possible to go solar and monitor your solar production through the Sun Exchange dashboard,” said Abraham Cambridge, CEO and founder of Sun Exchange.Commenting in the wake of the latest seed investment, serial solar energy entrepreneur Cambridge, who has an MSc in the Science of Climate Change from the University of East Anglia in the UK, ventured: “Solar power is the most promising technology to achieve a zero-carbon future. It’s the fastest growing source of energy, but billions of people don’t own their own roof or have the capital to get it.”He added: “By breaking down solar panel ownership to a single cell we reduce the cost of going solar by several orders of magnitude and we are utilizing empty roof space in some of the sunniest cities on the planet, such as Dubai and Johannesburg.”Before to moving to South Africa, Cambridge pioneered utility-scale solar in Britain in 2010 and co-founded The Renewable Energy Co-operative two years later, which was nominated ‘International Co-operative of The Year’ in the United Nations Year of Co-operatives.Why Bitcoin?In order to “super-charge” the process, Cambridge explained that the firm have combined their solar leases with another breakthrough technology - blockchain - together with cryptocurrency.They leverage blockchain and Bitcoin to “increase transparency and reduce the costs” of the cross-border transactions, both problems that are said to inhibit the majority of commercial solar projects - from accessing traditional funding options.“Putting the two together empowers anyone to go solar and be part of the global solar energy transformation with just a few taps on a screen,” he said.(Image: Shutterstock).Solar cells in the projects hosted by Sun Exchange are available to everyone in the world. However, if you do not live in the country where the project is located, transferring currency across borders is often expensive and time-consuming. The exchange market place accepts Bitcoin so that an individual’s payments and lease rental payments can be sent wherever they are in the world swiftly, securely and at low cost.David Orban, Founder and Managing Partner of Network Society Ventures (NSV), and member of the Board of Directors of Sun Exchange, posited that: “At the intersection of the exponentially growing technologies of solar photovoltaics, crowdfunding and blockchain, Sun Exchange is uniquely positioned to become a leading force in the profound transformation that will be witnessed as they build what he described as a global 21st century civilization.”Based at Rockerfeller Plaza in New York, NSV is focused on making investments in disruptive technology based companies leading transformation from the post-industrial age - usually in the range of $100,000 to $500,000 - and constituting what its Network Society Project refers to as the “Eight Pillars of Change”. This spans sectors across energy, manufacturing, food, health, learning, finance, security and policymaking.By presenting a simple and accessible opportunity for anyone to join the solar economy, Sun Exchange said that “unlocks the potential” for the construction of environmentally sound and socially responsible projects that would otherwise not see the light of day.In addition to the its U.S. strategic partners - NSV together with leading technology accelerators based in the U.S. in the shape of BoostVC, Powerhouse and Techstars, African venture capital firm Kalon Venture Partners based in Johannesburg (formerly Grovest Tech Limited), is also involved.Led by an experienced team in the South African venture capital space, Kalon Venture Partner's fund invests in entrepreneurs solving African problems with the potential for global application. It is set up to invest in digital disruptive technology in post-revenue start-ups with high growth potential, focussed on providing smart capital as well as on delivering what are touted as “smart returns.”A FAQ sheet on Sun Exchange that provides further information and the open solar projects available can be viewed via this link. "

Laura ShinSenior Contributor ...","Nov 29, 2017,08:00am EST","At the CoinDesk's Consensus: Invest conference in New York on Tuesday, on the same day Bitcoin hit the $10,000 mark, the crypto space seemed both to have matured and to recognize just how far it had to go.","Two common themes throughout the one-day gathering of 1,300 institutional investors, hedge funds, money managers, banks, and family offices were about how much opportunity the new asset class seemed to offer and yet how many basic problems, such as securely storing these tokens or how to designate beneficiaries in the event of one's death, remained.Comparing the excitement around crypto to the '90s internet boom and the flourishing of sites like eTrade, Howard Lindzon, founder and general partner of venture capital firm Social Leverage, recalled, ""You'd wake up and check your account because you knew you were richer."" Similarly, he said about crypto, ""This is a giant onramp to a new world and that's exciting.""(Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)That sentiment was reflected in CoinDesk's quarter 3 State of Blockchain report, which found that 83% of respondents checked prices at least every day -- 33% even hour. And half rejected the notion that cryptocurrencies were in a bubble.Dan Matuszewski, head of trading at Circle, noting how much the space had evolved, said that, two to three years ago, a $1 million trade in Bitcoin might have happened once every few months but now that was the average order. He added that many are in the $10-$20 million range and commented it was remarkable they could even be accommodated.Yet multiple panelists and speakers throughout the day bemoaned the difficulty of doing basic things such as safely custody assets, particularly for tokens beyond the two leaders in the space, Bitcoin and Ether.Attendees echoed the sentiment. ""I've been trying to get this room of crypto bulls' contrarian arguments, what their bearish cases might be,"" Tushar Jain, managing partner at crypto hedge fund Multicoin Capital, told Forbes. The most common answer he heard was that ""the infrastructure isn't there yet -- we've gotten ahead of the infrastructure in terms of custody, payment rails and store of value use case.""On a panel about tools for traders, Circle's Matuszewski called custody ""the single biggest issue."" Digital tokens are managed via public/private key pairs, with the public key amounting to an address or mailbox that non-owners can send money to and the private key offering the ability to send money out -- which hopefully is only ever triggered by the owner of the money. However, private keys kept online are subject to hack and other types of theft, but those kept offline make the money much harder to move.Some crypto investors even resort to storing investments in other tokens directly on exchanges despite the long history of hacks of crypto exchanges, including one at Mt. Gox that cost investors almost $500 million in 2014 and is still not resolved.Observing that institutional investors were having a hard time getting into the space because of its small size -- a $322 billion market cap as of press time -- Hu Liang, a former senior vice president of State Street and the founder and chief executive officer of Omniex, said it needed to go to the trillion-dollar range before larger institutions could make investments. But even then, he said, as of yet, there's little infrastructure in terms of algorithms or back office systems.""There's a ton of institutional money waiting on the sidelines right now and eager to get in the space, and if there's not formal, proper and mature processes for recording and performance transparency, which there's not today, then that institutional money really won't flow into this space,"" said Jake Benson, chief executive officer of Libra Tech, in an interview.Several company announcements were aimed at making the space friendlier to traditional financial firms used to higher-functioning infrastructure, with credentials and backing signifying a level of sophistication beyond what Bitcoin saw even a few years ago.For instance, Benson's company announced a $7.8 million Series A round of funding, as well as the launch of Libra Crypto Office, an enterprise application for back and middle office processes for funds, market makers, and exchanges. Already, liquidity provider XBTO and crypto-to-crypto exchange ShapeShift, which typically has two taxable events every time a customer makes a trade, have signed on as customers.Liang's Omniex is creating a platform of services for the entire crypto-asset investment and trading lifecycle, including a portfolio management system, order management system and execution management system. It also announced a seed round of $5 million from Wicklow Capital, Digital Currency Group and others.These new offerings come in the wake of Coinbase's announcement of its new custody product for institutions with $10 million or more in assets. More than 100 crypto hedge funds now exist, with three-quarters of them launched in 2017, according to financial research firm Autonomous Next.Despite the eagerness of crypto entrepreneurs to cater to the institutional players whose interest has been piqued by this parallel world of finance still in its infancy, conference speakers did not hold back on what they believe has fueled this asset class's dramatic rise.Lindzon said that after JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called Bitcoin a fraud and a bubble, headlines filled Bloomberg terminals and the price dropped. However, he noted, it picked right back up again within hours. ""The world doesn't care what someone from a 19th-century financial institution thinks anymore,"" he concluded.Joshua Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, had a similar take. Noting that Bitcoin's price surge took place against the backdrop of the Trump presidency and the Equifax hack, he said, ""Bitcoin's a vote saying, 'Fuck you.'"""

(Photo credit should read ROSLAN... [+] RAHMAN/AFP/Getty Images)If only I had invested in Bitcoin when it was trading for less than a penny. If only I had started mining Bitcoin years ago. And the regrets keep piling up.There are several problems with this thinking that are important to understand. They are important to your future as an investor.But first, let's play woulda, coulda, shoulda.According to Motley Fool, a single Bitcoin cost $0.003 back on March 17, 2010. That's 49 years ago in Bitcoin years.Had you invested the miserly sum of $1,000 on that date, you would have received 333,333 Bitcoins. I'm sure you see where this is going.As of December 12, 2017 at precisely 8:33 am ET, Bitcoin is trading at $17,106.58. (Note my precision; wait a few seconds at Bitcoin can rise like a rocket or fold like a lawn chair.) At that price, you would have amassed Bitcoins worth $5,702,187,631.14.That represents a compound annual growth rate of . . . oh who really cares? As my son would say, it's a crap-ton of money.Note that the Motley Fool article has the ending value at $4.7 billion. But that article was written five days ago, so it's outdated Bitcoin news.So What's the Problem with this Thinking?There are several problems, actually.First, had somebody purchased $1,000 worth of Bitcoin for $0.003, it's highly unlikely that they would still own it today. When the price hit just 10 cents, they'd own Bitcoin worth more than $33,000. When it hit a buck, they'd be sitting on more than $333,000. Would you really hold on to that kind of money from a $1,000 investment?Second, If the rise in price didn't prompt a sale, the repeated crashes certainly would. The rise of Bitcoin's price reminds me of the Chinese curse--may you live in interesting times. Reviewing Bitcoin's price history one sees double-digit monthly declines repeatedly. While we may all like to believe the market's don't phase us, the reaction to the current market for Bitcoin belies this sentiment.Third, the regret of missing out is not limited to Bitcoin. One can regret not buying any number of investments years ago. Google IPO'd at $85. Today it trades at $1,045. Amazon IPO'd at $18 and trades today at $1,166. Berkshire Hathaway has made numerous millionaires and billionaires. Shoulda, woulda, coulda.The point is that there are always investments that have risen substantially over a relatively short period of time. Bitcoin may be an extreme example of this, but it's not alone. We could easily drive ourselves crazy worrying about the missed investments. And that brings us to the real problem.Fretting about the one that got away can easily cause us to make poor investment decisions going forward. The fear of missing out is real. And that fear can propel us to make investments on the belief that it will be the next Amazon, or Google, or Bitcoin. The current Bitcoin mania is living proof.And even if we are lucky, yes lucky, enough to pick the next winner, it's unlikely we would stay in the investment long enough to reap the real rewards. The first major setback would cause most to head for the exit. And the first significant spike would cause most to take their ""winnings"" off the table.Don't believe me? Can you identify just one person who invested a substantial amount of money in Bitcoin at $0.003 each who still owns the digital currency today? Doubtful.So Now What?We must change the way we think about investing. Too often we see investing as buying low and selling high. There's a better way.How about buying a great company at a reasonable price and holding the investment for a lifetime? That's the way we should think about investing. We should view every stock purchase as if we are buying a real operating company. Why? Because we are buying a real operating company.We should make an investment in Apple the same we we would buy the local dry cleaner down the street. We compare owner's earnings (profits after capital requirements are considered) to the purchase price. Using a reasonable interest rate we determine the present value of the future cashflows. It's really not complicated.Of course, applying this assessment to Bitcoin leaves us on the sidelines. And as a value investor (is there really any other kind?), we must be comfortable watching others get ""rich"" betting on something like Bitcoin.I'm ok with that. Are you?(Here's how to invest in Bitcoin if you haven't heard a single thing I've said.)"

However, there is an issue with this token that makes it unlikely to stand the test of time, at least in its current form.What is Tether?The basic concept behind Tether is quite simple. An entity holds U.S. dollars in a bank account and then issues Tether tokens based on that bank account balance. One Tether is equal to one US dollar.The first version of Tether was issued on top of the Bitcoin blockchain by way of the Omni protocol, and there is currently over $430 million worth of Tether on the network (according to CoinMarketCap). With Omni, users are able to issue digital assets in a manner similar to the popular ERC-20 tokens seen on Ethereum.Before creating Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin worked on the Omni project — although it was called Mastercoin back then.What Happens When the Bad Guys Use Tether?While questions over solvency may have been quelled by a recent report from Friedman LLP (PDF), there is another systemic issue with Tether that still exists: What happens when the bad guys use it?Governments around the world will undoubtedly try to clamp down on the use of digital currencies for illicit purposes at some point in the future. And this clampdown may happen sooner rather than later with the alleged use of bitcoin by North Korea to get around various sanctions placed upon it by the United States and others.Last week, U.S. Senator Ed Markey called for Bitcoin to be “shut off” (either entirely or just from North Korea) on CNN.Of course, the point of Bitcoin is that it is supposed to be able to avoid censorship from governments. This same logic does not apply to Tether. The central point of failure for Tether is the bank account where all of the actual US dollars that back the token are stored.Without real U.S. dollars to back it, Tether would have no value. Putting U.S. dollars on a blockchain does not remove the central point of failure that backs them.So what will happen when governments decide to target Tether? The best place to look for guidance here may be the cases of Liberty Reserve and E-gold. When these centralized virtual gold currencies were being used for illicit purposes and the companies backing them did not implement the proper tools to track payments and holdings to real-world identities, they were shut down.So, either the code that controls the Tether tokens on Bitcoin and Ethereum will need to be updated to track payments or the bank account backing the token will be seized.In the case where the Tether token is updated, those who do not identity themselves will most likely not be able to send their tokens to anyone else or redeem them through Tether directly (this is how the process worked when E-gold was shut down), making them worthless. Even if a Tether user is willing to identify himself in order to claim his money, those funds will likely be unavailable to him during the legal proceedings following the shutdown.If Tether does not comply with regulators, they’ll likely face the same fate as Liberty Reserve and E-gold.This is Why Bitcoin is Not Threatened by Fiat Virtual CurrenciesThe potential regulatory issues around Tether illustrate the value proposition of bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto’s creation exists because any form of true digital cash must be resistant to censorship from attackers (governments or otherwise). If someone can shut down the Bitcoin network, then the intrinsic value of bitcoin is lost.Recently, BTCC CEO Bobby Lee gave a presentation in New York where he discussed the properties of bitcoin and how they differentiate the cryptocurrency from various forms of fiat-based virtual currencies.As I’ve written in the past for Nasdaq, there should be an opportunity for bitcoin to succeed as the world becomes increasingly digitized and governments do not want to relinquish their ability to track payments, seize assets, and inflate the money supply.

Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.],"I entered the cryptocurrency field in 2013 and watched the price of Bitcoin skyrocket from a low of $100 to over $1000. There was a rush to invest in Bitcoin companies, then in 2014 the price crashed back to $250. Investors that had become interested in the technology started to think, “OK, Bitcoin is dead, but the blockchain concept is an advance. How do we take that coin out and keep the blockchain?”.Three years of investment later, the world still doesn't have any major live applications of a private blockchain. But what if this was the wrong question? What if the real question was “how do we take the blockchain out of Bitcoin”? What if we could have cryptocurrency, secure/transparent data transfer and decentralized autonomous organizations without a blockchain? This is what the team behind IOTA, a cryptocurrency with a market cap of over $1.2bn USD at the time of writing this, set out to determine.Iota LogoWhy would the blockchain be seen as a problem? It all comes down to scalability and there are three hot button issues: the tiny maximum number of transactions per second, coupled with the cost of storing an entire blockchain and the power hungry cryptographic computing required that may be required to maintain it.Bitcoin, the original blockchain, is a system that allows for people to exchange cryptocoins in a peer to peer fashion. There is no Federal Reserve issuing Bitcoin, there is no FDIC insuring online wallet systems, by their very nature peer to peer systems do not have a central authority.The fundamental difference between Bitcoin and any other digital artifact is the fact that the blockchain means only one person can have possession at a time. If I use my cell phone to take a picture of a cute puppy I meet at the park, I can send you a copy of that picture, and then the world is a little brighter for both of us. If I send you some Bitcoin, it disappears from my wallet and appears in yours. There are no counterfeiters in the Bitcoin universe, which is another way of saying that there is no “double spend problem”. There is a fee structure for transactions, it's both linear and transparent, but that doesn't make sense for IoT devices for many reasons.Iota TeamDavid Sønstebø, cofounder of IOTA and blockchain veteran, described a few problems with blockchain infrastructure. In 2014 Serguei Popov and I started exploring the internet of things and convergence between the Internet of Things (IOT) and Distributed Ledgers. The Internet of Things will be made up of billions of sensors and actuators communicating with each other, as well as purchasing things like data and energy. The blockchain does not scale for this use case, nor is it built to do so. You need to build second layer ad hoc channels, which will be fine for local implementations but not for ecosystems with billions of transactions a day. The blockchain scalability problem revolves around how the system enables peer to peer transactions without double spending.  It is a complex system that requires a high number of decentralized miners and nodes to verify the transactions. In order to maintain node decentralization, the number of transactions directly input into a block of transactions, mined every 10 minutes, must be limited. Through the decentralization of nodes, miners, or both, no single verifier has monopolistic power, which is a good thing. However, it comes at the cost of either having a limited number of transactions per second or needing to rely on second layer protocols or services to scale.  Searching for an answer to the blockchain scalability problem, Sønstebø and the other three IOTA cofounders came across the mathematical concept of a Directed Acyclic Graph, otherwise known as a DAG. The properties of this type of graph, namely that all nodes were connected with no way to backtrack through a link, was tantalizingly similar to what a blockchain does.IOTA TangleThe IOTA team realized that the blockchain itself acted like a single threaded DAG, a single line of chained blocks that can never retrace its steps to a previous state. The team settled on a multi-threaded DAG of transactions, which they call The Tangle. Having trouble getting your head around how to visualize that? Think of the blockchain as the full copy of every credit and debit from every account for a bank, while The Tangle is more like the collection of reconciled check books of all the bank's customers.So how does The Tangle work? Instead of incentivizing that set of power and storage hungry third party miners a blockchain needs to validate transactions, individual nodes are required to validate two transactions for every one that they want to perform. Instead of waiting for a block before trusting a transaction, they rely on two thirds of the network has validated the transaction directly or indirectly.The Tangle resolves all three scalability problems within blockchain. There are no third party miners to pay transaction fees to, the work required to maintain the DAG is not compute intensive so there is little capital or operating cost, and it's very, very fast. Recall that this is The Tangle at work, a hint that there might be more than one path to doing things.The Tangle has no explicit cap on transaction size and they can be connected to each other in an arbitrary order. This potentially has a major effect on scaling. Blockchains are limited in the number of transactions that can be fit into a block and those blocks are created one at a time. The Tangle is not just a distributed network, it's one that naturally engages in parallel processing, which is a curious missing feature to be missing from blockchains, given how otherwise network-centric they are.Bitcoin's blockchain can only handle about 5-6 transactions per second even after the recent segregated witness upgrade has been activated, Sønstebø claims the IOTA network has already been able to handle over five hundred transactions per second.The Tangle scales nicely but the nodes only remember their current state, not how they came to be there. That history still matters in many situations such as auditing or performing analytics. The solution is a 'perma node' which does remember the full history. Instead of a huge cloud of those systems, solutions could range from a single system, to a redundant pair, to a server per location. As an example, imagine a company with ten warehouses using IOTA for inventory management. The IoT devices use their local perma node, but can switch to a remote if the local is down for some reason.One interesting element of decoupling cryptocurrency from the blockchain is the ability to create offline mesh network branches of The Tangle that can then be reattached to the original. Blockchains cannot perform offline transactions, since when you attempt to reattach the blocks created offline they are incompatible with the main blockchain. The Tangle, on the other hand, is perfectly happy to splice in an arbitrarily large set of transactions, which it can quickly ingest.As an example use case, imagine a shipping container full of goods bound from Shanghai to San Francisco. There is no internet on the ship, but all the shipping containers have IOT sensors. Those sensors can monitor the cargo and ensure the integrity of it in an IOTA Tangle branch. Once the container comes ashore the branch can then reintegrate into the main Tangle, which can provide a reliable snapshot into the state of the goods in the container. Shrinkage and misplacement would be much less prevalent with self monitoring like this.Sønstebø offers another interesting use case:Say your self-driving car runs off the road and kills a pedestrian. The car company might have a strong urge to change the data from the case, putting you in the driver's seat. If it's on a distributed ledger, no one can change it without being detected.Sønstebø goes on to describe many different use cases for IOTA, including micropayments and secured digital identities. Companies like Bosch, Microsoft, and Volkswagen are already experimenting with IOTA behind the scenes, building an IoT community where cars, sensors and other objects communicate with each other on a daily basis.You might be thinking that this sounds great, but are there any flaws? When I asked Sønstebø directly, he indicated the main thing that still troubles him is the fact that the timestamps used are not as accurate as those in a blockchain. This is due to the fact that multiple nodes can simultaneously add content to the DAG and there isn't a strict ordering of transactions by time. Overall this is seen as a worthwhile tradeoff for the additional transaction volume.However, doing some digging myself, I found three other issues.First, there are no smart contracts.Per Sønstebø as long as you can leverage the Tangle for micropayments and ensuring data integrity, the “smart contracts” can be made in a centralized environment. In fact, I agree with this approach. The main reason for a smart contract on a blockchain is so that the contract can be seen transparently by all the market participants and trusted because it is immutable. If the immutability is not required, say for an in-house application, then it would make sense to have the smart contracts function in a centralized system. It's also possible to envision a bridge between IOTA for IoT devices and one of the blockchains that provides both a cryptocurrency and smart contract functions.Second, creating a new cryptographic function can be a big warning sign.IOTA felt the need to create a new hash which they have named Curl. The motivation for doing this was the desire to use a quantum cryptanalysis resistant function, which is not a current standard. However, best practices suggests that no live applications handling important data should be relying on newly created cryptographic functions. Proper vetting typically takes years. Then an MIT study that described a possible weakness for the hash itself was published, which led to the IOTA team replacing most of the Curl function with an older, well tested hash.And finally, the third issue involves loss of a third of the total network.If 33% of the computers in IOTA fail the system becomes unusable. An adversary could join the network with a mass of systems and suddenly pull them once they comprised enough of the network. Bitcoin is subject to something similar in that a bad actor taking over 51% of all nodes can cause a work stoppage. The IOTA solution to this is the Coordinator.CinnobarSeeking to understand the Coordinator concept a bit better, I spoke with one of its most vocal critics, Eric Wall, Blockchain & Cryptocurrency expert at Cinnober Financial Technology.In contrast to Bitcoin, IOTA does not have miners constantly securing the network. Instead, they rely on tiny mining efforts (Proof-of-Work) to be done on every transaction submitted by the users. The idea is that when the network gets sufficiently large, these transactions will generate enough work to secure the network. Until then the network is secured by The Coordinator, which is a central point of failure. If it is corrupted, the whole network can fail. I have described a double spend attack on it via IOTA's GitHub software repository.IOTA relies on the notion that tiny IoT devices and their often sporadic transactions will be numerous to withstand a focused attacker. In our conversation, Wall discusses how this is an unrealistic premise, at least at the start, hence the need for The Coordinator. IoT devices have CPUs similar to turn of the century laptops and often run on battery which they want to last as long as possible. They are optimized specifically for their sensor roles, not participating in a distributed computing cloud.Wall's prognosis is not positive in the long term either. Withstanding an attacker with specialized hardware attacking the network at a constant speed is wishful thinking. In June, I made the prediction that IOTA will fail to disable the Coordinator in 2018. I am not convinced the Coordinator can ever be safely disabled, which means that IOTA may potentially stay centralized indefinitely.As Wall describes, there are some significant issues that IOTA has yet to overcome, but there is flexibility, room for growth, and they certainly exhibited agility in their quick removal of the Curl function, once the hazards were understood. Will my company, Bitwage be leaving Bitcoin anytime soon? Probably not, but I installed the wallet Sønstebø recommended, plan to buy a bit of IOTA when the price of Bitcoin stops skyrocketing, and will be keeping a close eye on this system.Correction:  An earlier version of this article mentioned that David Sønstebø was a cofounder of NXT, when he was only an active community member.  It has since been corrected to say that he is a blockchain veteran."

That's what caused Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index to skyrocket to 40,000 in the late 1980s and to plunge so much that 28 years later it has still not recovered -- hitting 22,939 on December 11.And history could rhyme in Japan -- with possible global repercussions -- this time with an exchange that lets its customers borrow up to 15 times their cash to buy Bitcoin (BTC) -- now including a futures market up 26% this morning.Before getting into that, let's take a look at the 1980s real estate bubble in Japan that propelled its Nikkei 225 index from 10,000 in 1984 to 40,000 in 1989. As Quartz wrote, that strong performance was a result of ""low interest rates [which] spurred a real-estate asset bubble [which valued the grounds under Tokyo's Imperial Palace more highly than the state of California] that sent stocks to unprecedented levels. When the bubble burst, the consequences were harsh, saddling Japan with two decades of stagnation.""Behind all that land price appreciation was debt held by banks, insurers, and corporations. A Harvard Business Review article estimated that in 1990 before the bubble burst, ""total bank debt collateralized directly or indirectly by land [was] 30% or more. Other creditors active in the real estate and corporate and household lending markets, such as insurance companies, leasing companies, and financial services firms, presumably [added] heavily to the volume.""This raises questions in my mind: Why do people borrow money to buy appreciating assets? Why do governments encourage such borrowing?The answer to the first question is simple enough: Lending money to buy an appreciating asset is good in the short-term for the lender and the borrower. The lender gets a bonus for making the loan and her employer gets upfront fees and interest. The borrower can put down a relatively small amount of his money and buy much more of the asset -- which looks like a great way to augment his returns on the rising price of that asset.And if the borrower can sell the asset at a higher price, the lender gets its money back plus interest and the borrower gets more of a profit than he would have without the leverage.Consider this example: a borrower puts down $100 and borrows $900 to purchase an asset worth $1,000. A year later the asset is worth $17,000. The borrower sells the asset, uses $900 worth of the proceeds to repay the loan, and enjoys a pretax gain of $16,000 (sale proceeds net of debt repayment minus the original investment of $100).Of course there is another way that this can go. Crowds of investors are desperate to borrow as much money as they can to buy this appreciating asset. Those who bought at $1,000 look at the rising price as an opportunity to lock in their profit.Crowding at the exits causes price of the asset to plunge and the lender demands immediate repayment of the loan. The borrower can't come up with enough cash. The lender can't collect on its loans and goes bankrupt. And the government bails out the bank.Something like this could happen with BTC. That's because one huge Tokyo-based BTC exchange is letting people borrow up to 15 times their cash balances to purchase the crypto-currency.The exchange in question is called bitFlyer. According to a Financial Times interview with its CEO Yuzo Kano, ""His Tokyo-based exchange has an 80% share of BTC trading in Japan and 20% to 30% of the global market."" But Kano says not to worry because bitFlyer's liquidity is ""deep enough to handle even the biggest market movements.""Kano is so confident about this that he allows his customers to ""buy in with leverage up to 15 times their cash deposit."" What's more bitFlyer ""ranks third for trading in the underlying digital currency [and] has won authorization to open in the U.S."" -- meaning that Americans could be able to borrow 15 times their cash deposits to purchase BTC.I was alarmed to learn about how much of bitFlyer's volume comes from derivatives. “People who’ve owned them for a long time and have made a fortune have ¥10bn and they’re selling a little,” Kano told FT. 15% of the exchange's trading is in BTC, while 75% is in derivatives, ""where customers make leveraged sidebets with each other on the [BTC] price.""Kano believes that these trades are risk free to bitFlyer since they are ""between our customers.” And according to FT, ""BitFlyer automatically closes client positions when they lose half their initial margin. For example, a customer who used ¥10,000 to buy ¥150,000 of bitcoin would be forced to sell if its value fell to ¥145,000, a drop of slightly more than 3%.""A market panic -- in which there might not be enough buyers to close all the long positions -- was of no concern to Kano. “We have a huge amount of liquidity. No matter how big the position we can close it out. If bitcoin rose 20-fold in a day then I don’t know.

After all it's regulated by Japan’s Financial Services Agency and has raised $36 million worth of venture capital from blue chip banks like Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho and Sumitomo Mitsui.It's not just in Tokyo that people are borrowing to buy BTC. According to a May 2017 FT report, ""A mortgage-free [British] homeowner with a house valued at £10m [took] out a fixed-rate loan of just under £2m to buy [BTC].""And as Joseph Borg, president of the North American Securities Administrators Association, told CNBC on December 11, ""We've seen mortgages being taken out to buy bitcoin. … People do credit cards, equity lines.""I wonder whether anyone can now map out how much money has been lent to people who are trading BTC around the world and -- were BTC's price to collapse -- how much capital would be wiped out.Let's hope that borrowing money to buy BTC does not cause as much damage as the Japanese land bubble."

Nowhere to be found in the tax code and yet increasingly popular in the financial press, the promise of marrying high-profit Bitcoin investing with tax-free IRAs has led to an explosion of questions from listeners to my Self-Directed Investor Talk podcast, like:• Is it legal to invest in Bitcoin in an IRA?• What is a Bitcoin IRA?• Has the IRS approved Bitcoin for IRAs?The answers to all of these question are related but different. Of greater concern, however, is the amount of blatant misinformation about this topic. So, let’s take a moment to set the record straight.Is it legal to invest in Bitcoin in an IRA?I’m not a lawyer and I don’t play one on TV, so I’m not giving you legal advice. But as an exceptionally well-informed layman who teaches professional education courses to lawyers about this topic through UCLA/CEB, here’s my take on this question:The operative question isn’t whether it’s legal for an IRA to own Bitcoins, but whether it’s prohibited. Under the tax code, certain assets and activities are strictly prohibited, and running afoul of those prohibitions can be very painful indeed.Bitcoin is not statutorily prohibited in the law. In fact, only two types of assets are explicitly incompatible with IRAs: life insurance and collectibles. Bitcoin certainly isn’t life insurance, so we’re all clear there. But, since the IRS includes most coins in the definition of collectibles, there was substantial confusion about how Bitcoins would be categorized by the IRS for tax purposes.Fortunately, the IRS clarified this in a notice issued in 2014. As of that moment, Bitcoin enthusiasts could proceed with confidence knowing that the IRS viewed their asset-of-choice as personal property -- much like shares of stock -- and thus it is not prohibited for inclusion in IRAs.What is a Bitcoin IRA?There’s no such thing as a Bitcoin IRA, just as there’s no such thing as a gold IRA or a real estate IRA or any of the other myriad types of asset class-specific IRAs. All of those are marketing terms that hold zero practical significance.Under the law, there is only the IRA -- the Individual Retirement Account. Most IRAs are of the captive variety, forcing the IRA owner to invest in a very narrow range of asset types offered for sale by the IRA company itself, such as stocks or mutual funds or even Bitcoin.But there’s another type of IRA that’s provided by a special type of custodian that allows investors to deploy their IRA capital into any asset class the law allows. These IRAs are known as self-directed IRAs and are capable of holding not just conventional assets but also alternative assets like real estate, precious metals and Bitcoin.So, when you see the term Bitcoin IRA, be aware that there’s no such thing. That’s simply a marketing term that, in reality, refers to a self-directed IRA that is capable of owning Bitcoins. Practically any self-directed IRA custodian can facilitate ownership of Bitcoins -- not just those that specialize in cryptocurrencies.Has the IRS approved Bitcoin for IRAs?The IRS does not approve Bitcoin investments. I cite as authority for this claim a recently published notice from the IRS with an impressively unambiguous title: “The IRS Does Not Approve IRA Investments.”In that notice, our friends at the IRS even go on to describe as fraudulent any sales pitch that makes this claim.It’s a big deal when the IRS uses the word “fraudulent."" It seems to me that Uncle Sam may be losing patience with investment providers who falsely use the IRS as a source of credibility for their Bitcoin or other investments.Nevertheless, it’s important to understand the distinction between approved and not prohibited. As you learned a moment ago, since Bitcoin belongs to neither of the two types of statutorily prohibited asset classes (life insurance and collectibles), it’s therefore legally compatible with IRAs.But the lack of a prohibition is not the same thing as approval. While the IRS sometimes provides clarity on assets that they prohibit, they never have -- and likely never will -- offer explicit approval of any asset class or of any specific investment for your IRA.What’s the verdict on Bitcoin IRAs?I offer no analysis of the wisdom of Bitcoin as an investment for your IRA. That’s up to you to decide.But I do offer this advice: If you choose to buy Bitcoin in your IRA, do so through a truly self-directed IRA custodian that allows you access to the full potential of self-directed IRAs rather than opting for an IRA provider that focuses narrowly on cryptocurrencies. Otherwise, when the time comes to shift gears into your next great investment, you’ll not only be forced to buy a new asset but to establish a new account as well."

the power of capitalism. Bitcoin. pixabay.com. Today In: ...","Nov 13, 2017,03:35pm EST","Some of you reading this might already be familiar with the “Parable of the Talents,” but it’s worth a brief retelling. The story, which appears in the gospels of Matthew and Mark, involves a master who entrusts three servants with some of his “talents,” or gold coins, while he’s away on business. Two of the servants take a risk by putting the money to work and end up doubling their master’s wealth. The third servant, however, buries his share to “keep it safe” and so doesn’t generate any returns. (Indeed it likely loses value because of inflation.)","When the master returns, he’s so pleased at how the first two servants grew his wealth that he puts them in charge of “many things” and invites them to share in his own success.The third servant, though, he calls “wicked and lazy” and says he might as well have deposited the money in a bank while he was away—at least then he would have received a little interest. The servant is punished by having his share of the talents given to the two who faithfully grew their master’s money, leaving him with nothing.The lesson here should be plainly obvious, and we can express it in a number of different ways: There can be no reward without risk. You must spend money to make money. You reap what you sow. This should resonate with investors, entrepreneurs and any true believer in the power of capitalism.BitcoinJesus’ parable applies not just to individuals but to corporations as well. Companies must grow to keep up with the rising cost of labor and materials and to stay competitive. To do that, they must put their money to work just as the two servants do.And just as the two servants were invited to share in their master’s success, corporate growth has a multiplier effect—for the company’s employees and their families, shareholders, the local economy, strategic partners, companies up and down the supply chain and much more.I think the business model that best illustrates the meaning of the “Parable of the Talents” is the one practiced by gold and precious metal royalty companies. As much as I write and talk about royalty companies, I still encounter investors who aren’t aware of how significant a role they play in the mining space.As a refresher, these firms help finance explorers and producers’ operations by buying royalties or rights to a stream. Because miners have had to slash exploration budgets since the decline in metal prices, the kind of financing royalty companies provide has only grown in demand—as evidenced by the mostly positive earnings reports last week.Chief among them is Franco-Nevada, which had a very strong third quarter, reporting earnings of $55.3 million, or $0.30 a share, up 3.4 percent from the same three-month period last year. The Toronto-based company, having also recently diversified into the oil royalties space, closed its purchase of an oil royalty for C$92.5 million, bringing the number of its oil and gas assets up to 82. Including precious metals and other minerals, the total number of assets Franco-Nevada had in its diverse portfolio as of the end of the quarter stood at 341.Here’s the multiplier effect: Not only do the miners benefit from the deals, allowing them to continue exploration and other operations, but shareholders are also rewarded handsomely. Since the company went public nearly 10 years ago, it’s raised its dividend each year and its share price has outperformed both gold and relevant gold equity benchmarks. After its earnings announcement last Monday, Franco-Nevada stock closed up more than 6 percent on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), its best one-day performance in nearly a year and a half. Shares hit a fresh all-time high last week.Precious Metal Royalty Names Have Outperformed Gold and Gold ProducersOther royalty companies’ reports were just as impressive and show the rewards of putting your “talents” to work. Sandstorm Gold, reporting higher operating cash flow of $11.9 million, has acquired as many as 10 separate royalties since the end of September on properties in Peru, Botswana and South Africa that collectively cover more than 2.4 million acres.Osisko Gold Royalties bought a $1.1 billion portfolio of 74 precious mineral royalties, including a 9.6 percent diamond stream. The company reported record quarterly gold equivalent ounces (GEOs) of 16,664, up 65 percent from the same quarter last year, and record quarterly revenues from royalties and streams of $26.1 million, up 48 percent.Royal Gold also had a strong quarter, reporting operating cash flow of $72 million, an increase of 30 percent from last year, and returned as much as $16 million to shareholders in dividends.Wheaton Precious Metals, the world’s largest precious metal streaming company, showed a sizeable decline in profits in the third quarter, but it continued to generate strong cash flow and looks poised to meet its end-of-year production guidance.Although some investors might not realize how important these companies are to the industry, many other investors are opting to place their bets on royalty names, seeing them as having ample exposure to precious metals without some of the risks associated with producers. In its review of the third quarter, the World Gold Council (WGC) reported that global gold demand fell to an eight-year low as investment in gold ETFs slowed to 18.9 metric tons, down from 144.3 metric tons in last year’s September quarter. This could be a consequence of the media’s continued negative coverage of gold, despite its competitive performance against the S&P 500 Index. Whatever the cause, in this environment, there was no lack of love for royalty names, as you can see in the chart above.We were one of Wheaton Precious Metals’ seed investors in 2004, when it was then known as Silver Wheaton. Because Franco-Nevada wouldn’t be spun off from Newmont Mining for another three years, Wheaton had first-mover advantage. It was something new, something different. This, coupled with what I recognized as a superior business model, gave me the conviction to allocate capital into the fledgling company, a move that turned out to be highly profitable.Today I have the same conviction in blockchain technology and digital currencies. As of the end of October, the initial coin offering (ICO) market had raised $3 billion so far this year. That’s more than seven times the amount generated in crowdfunding in all of the previous years before 2017. And Bloomberg just reported that Google searches for “buy bitcoin” recently surpassed searches for “buy gold.”Search Queries for ""Buy Bitcoin"" Surged Past ""Buy Gold""With bitcoin’s market cap having grown past that of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, cryptocurrencies can no longer be written off as a curiosity. Major financial institutions have become bullish, having filed approximately 2,700 patents in blockchain technology.Abigail Johnson, the youthful chairman of Fidelity, was quoted as saying, “Blockchain technology isn’t just a more efficient way to settle securities, it will fundamentally change market structures, and maybe even the architecture of the internet itself.” Johnson allegedly has a crypto-mining computer rig in her office, and Fidelity accountholders are now able to see their bitcoin holdings on the brokerage firm’s online platform. USAA, the massive financial firm used by millions of U.S. military personnel and their families worldwide, provides a similar service.USAA Fidelity Members Are Tracking Their Bitcoin Wallets OnlineThis all comes as Coinbase, a leading digital currency broker, saw a record number of people opening new accounts on its platform recently, doubling the number of accounts from the beginning of the year. In one 24-hour period, 100,000 new accounts were opened.A lot of this growth in demand is thanks to millennials, the largest U.S. generation. Forget the stereotype of the “entitled” millennial in the workplace and the misconception that they’re all wasting their money on $10 avocado toast. Consulting firm Deloitte estimates that by 2020, millennials will make up 50 percent of the workforce and control between $19 trillion and $24 trillion. Many are savvy investors and were found to be more likely to be aware of their brokerage account fees than older generations, according to Charles Schwab’s Modern Wealth index.In some ways, millennials are reshaping our living habits. Many of them choose to rent instead of own to stay mobile. They’re more likely to get their news from Twitter than from TV. Online dating apps have helped foster today’s hookup culture, but while young people now might have more sex partners than before, they’re having less sex overall than their parents or grandparents might have had at their age.It’s little surprise, then, that millennials are among the earliest and most enthusiastic adopters of blockchain technology, bitcoin and digital currencies in general—none of which existed even 10 years ago. A poll conducted by Blockchain Capital found that large percentages of millennials would prefer $1,000 in bitcoin to $1,000 in other assets. More than a quarter said they would prefer bitcoin to stocks, while nearly a third preferred it to bonds.Percent of Millennials Who Would Prefer $1,000 in Bitcoin to $1,000 in ...What I find especially encouraging is that only 4 percent of those who took the poll owned or had owned bitcoins. I say encouraging because this suggests there’s quite a lot of upside potential for bitcoin ownership, which in turn could raise prices further. As I shared with you recently, Metcalfe’s law states that the bigger the network of users, the greater that network’s value becomes. Consider Facebook. The social media giant has more than 2 billion active users. That’s 2 billion pairs of eyes Facebook is able to charge top dollar for advertisers to reach, helping it deliver record profits in the third quarter.We could see the same thing happen across the blockchain and cryptocurrency network as more and more businesses and people embrace this new form of exchange.It should be clear by now that something is changing in financial markets, and this is what inspired me to make a strategic investment in a company with first-mover advantage in the cryptocurrency space, just as we did with Silver Wheaton years ago. As the “Parable of the Talents” teaches us, no reward can come to you without some risk-taking.

After winning $65 ...","Dec 10, 2017,09:00am EST","Last Monday the New York Post reported that Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss became the world’s first Bitcoin billionaires. After winning $65 million from Mark Zuckerberg in a dispute over who came up with the idea for Facebook, the twins subsequently purchased $11 million worth of Bitcoins with their lawsuit haul.","The twins began purchasing the cryptocurrency in 2013, and according to rough estimates arrived at by the Post, they bought 91,666 coins for around $120 each.  Readers can do the math.  With the mis-named“currency” having reached $11,400* as of last Monday, the Winklevoss brothers could lay claim to billionaire status.But rather than discuss the twins’ prescience as investors, luck, or whatever, it’s best to turn their great fortune into a “teaching moment” as it were.  The transformation of $11 million into a $1 billion with what is mistakenly described as a currency is a great way to explain inflation and deflation.Importantly, this explanation will have nothing to do with the modern definitions of inflation and deflation arrived at by Keynesians, monetarists, and even some Austrians.  To be clear, inflation is not caused by booming economic growth whereby demand outstrips supply as Keynesians (including top economists at the Fed) commonly believe.  More realistically, economic growth is the greatest enemy of rising prices simply because periods of booming prosperity are defined by investment in production advances that drive prices down.  Also, there’s no such thing as demand outstripping supply given the basic truth that demand is a certain effect of supply.  Conversely, deflation is not a function of slower economic growth.  As the malaise-ridden 1970s and 2000s should remind readers, prices are most likely rising when the economy is weakest due to a lack of investment.As for monetarists, they believe inflation is an effect of rising money supply, while deflation the opposite.  Ok, but money is always and everywhere abundant wherever production is.  That’s the case because we only pursue money in return for our production insofar as it’s exchangeable for goods and services.  So just as the Keynesians get inflation backwards, so do the monetarists.  They forget that surging “money supply” can’t be engineered as much as it’s an effect of production.  At the same time, falling supply is a signal of reduced production.And then there are modern Austrians.  They believe inflation is an effect of “excess credit” creation, usually by the Fed.  Except that the latter is an impossibility too.  To understand why, readers need only consider the teachings of Austrian eminence Ludwig von Mises.  He was very clear that individuals only borrow “money” insofar as it’s exchangeable for other goods and resources.  Mises was stating the obvious, but also something that those generally flummoxed by inflation and deflation don’t get.  Mises’s observation was a reminder that credit is what we create.  Plain and simple.  A booming economy signals major production increases.  And that’s why a booming economy is defined by mass borrowing.  People are borrowing access to the resources produced in abundance.  So while modern Austrians weirdly believe surging lending causes inflation, it’s more realistically an effect of growth; meaning an absence of inflation.So what is inflation? It’s a decline in the value of the currency.  It’s a dollar that is exchangeable for quite a bit less relative to what it was previously exchangeable for.  Conversely, deflation is a rise in the value of the unit of account.  In dollar terms, it signals exchangeability for more in the way of goods and services relative to the past.  Both are economically harmful, and to see why, readers need only consider the floating value of Bitcoin.As previously mentioned, a Bitcoin exchangeable for $120 in 2013 could command over $11,000 as of last Monday.  That speaks to a massive deflation.  Consider the latter in terms of a debtor/creditor relationship: you borrow 5 Bitcoin from me in 2013 based on a promise to pay me back with one coin per year, including 2013.  You’ll be all paid up in 2017, but it’s fair to say that as the debtor you’ve been wiped out.  While you borrowed roughly $600 from me, you’ve essentially returned to me $13,000.  Deflation whacks debtors.Let’s now consider the reverse.   While the future is never certain, it’s possible Bitcoin’s value could go the other way.  If so, imagine me lending you 5 Bitcoin today, to be paid out one/yr. over the next five years.  And what if the value of Bitcoin plummets back to 2013 levels.? If so, I’ve lent you the equivalent of $55,000 only to get $600 in return.  Inflation wipes out the lender.What’s crucial is that neither scenario is beneficial.  Money’s sole purpose is to facilitate trade, and investment.  But when the value of money is uncertain, the trade that fosters our migration to the work we do best is less likely, as is the lending and investment that boosts our productivity.To see why, let’s use the same numbers again.  In 2013, I offer you 10,000 Bitcoin to build a house for me.  5,000 in 2013, 5,000 in December of 2017.  Explicit in my offer is that I want to pay you $1.2 million.  Ok, but under the scenario described I paid you the equivalent of $600,000 in 2013, and followed up with $55,000,000 in 2017.Conversely, imagine a 10,000 Bitcoin investment in a software concept based on an investment valuation of $110,000,000.  Imagine then that the value of Bitcoin once again plummets from $11,000 to $120.  The investor is totally wiped out.  Thinking about the latter in dollar terms, is it any surprise that the U.S. economy was so weak in the 70s and 2000s? Not in the least.  With the dollar weak, those with capital were naturally reluctant to invest.What all of this should communicate to readers is that Bitcoin is not a replacement for the dollar as much as it exhibits in exponentially worse fashion all of the dollar’s very worst qualities.  Money is just a measure that facilitates exchange.  I have bread, I want your wine, but you want the butcher’s meat.  Money is solely an agreement about value that enables individuals with disparate wants to produce for a stable-in-value “ticket” that is exchangeable for other goods and services.That money was historically stable in value was a screaming statement of the obvious.  Of course it was.  Money can’t be eaten, it can’t clothe us; it simply facilitates the exchange of our toil for the food, clothing, necessities and luxuries that we need and want.Yet when money is floating in value, the mutually enhancing act of trade fosters winners and losers.  And investment dries up simply because investors are less certain about the quality of money they’ll get in return for their capital commitment.Bitcoin is presently exhibiting massive deflationary characteristics.  If it collapses in value, it will exhibit inflationary characteristics.  Under either scenario, can readers imagine trying to transact or write contracts in terms of something that not only lacks a fixed value, but that floats in endlessly volatile fashion? If the dollar were as volatile as Bitcoin, the world economy would be in the midst of total chaos, including war.Private money is a great idea.  Here’s hoping great minds get to work at replacing the dollar with it.  Still, readers shouldn’t let themselves be fooled.  Bitcoin is not a replacement for the dollar.  In truth, it’s a shining example of all the floating dollar’s worst qualities many times over.* As of publication, the value of Bitcoin has surged well beyond $11,400.  The surge doesn't change the argument within this piece as much as it reveals to an even higher degree why Bitcoin is many things; none of them a currency.John Tamny is a Forbes contributor, editor of RealClearMarkets, Director of the Center for Economic Freedom at FreedomWorks, and a senior economic adviser to Toreador Research & Trading.  He’s the author of Popular Economics (Regnery Publishing, 2015), Who Needs the Fed? (Encounter 2016), and then his next book, The End of Work (Regnery) about the ongoing explosion of jobs that don't feel like work, will be released in 2018.  "

Consensus: Invest, the world's first digital asset investor outlook event hosted by CoinDesk, brings institutional investors, hedge funds, money managers, banks, and family offices together to get connected with how to invest, store, trade and judge value in this new asset class. Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg","In August, the hedge I cofounded, Multicoin Capital, published an analysis of XRP, the native token of the Ripple network. We presented a bearish view of XRP tokens. A quick summary:Ripple, Inc. — the company that builds and maintains the Ripple network — has built a blockchain-based system that banks use to issue IOUs and settle debts. XRP has two uses: to pay fees on the Ripple network, and as a “bridge currency” for value transfers between any two institutions that don’t have a trusted relationship. However, its native token, XRP, is simply not necessary for the network to function.Since the Ripple network is permissioned as a direct result of its unique node list (UNL) system, the risk of rational actors spamming the network is low. It’s unlikely that JP Morgan would spam Bank of America, or that Hana Group of South Korea would spam Fidelity. Even if these institutions don’t trust one another, they still want to conduct business with one another. Spamming other banks just doesn’t make any sense.The other intended use for XRP is to act as a “bridge currency:” If a scenario arises in which two financial institutions need to settle IOUs in local currencies, how does the debtor acquire the local currency of the creditor? Many currency pairs simply don’t exhibit substantial trading volume, for example, Kenyan dollars to South Korean won. Although most currency pairs are not substantial by volume relative to USD-Euro, the combination of long tails of currency pairs grows factorially, as a function of n!. Given that there are 180 fiat currencies around the world, there are about 16,000 currency pairs.Today, this problem is usually solved by using a market maker which provides liquidity in each currency to USD because USD is the global reserve currency. Ripple, Inc. proposes that financial institutions solve this problem using the Ripple network and XRP instead of the legacy banking infrastructure and USD.The Ripple network is superior as payment rail system relative to the legacy financial infrastructure. However, it just doesn’t make sense that rational financial institutions will voluntarily use XRP as a reserve currency to settle transactions because XRP will always be -- by definition -- less liquid than a global reserve such as Bitcoin. Regardless of the quality of the underlying technological infrastructure, the single most important attribute of a global reserve currency is liquidity. This is why USD reigns supreme: the largest economy in the world by definition has the largest amount of liquidity for most currency pairs.Given XRP’s continued meteoric rise over the last 3-4 months, we decided to revisit our original thesis. In the last month, we’ve spoken with blockchain leads at major international remittance companies, traditional asset management firms, commercial banks, and investment banks. The individuals we spoke with have all evaluated Ripple’s solution and XRP. All of them used the system in some capacity, and all of them independently came to the same conclusion: if their institution were to ever come to use the Ripple network to settle transactions -- which they deemed unlikely -- they would want to use the global reserve currency for settlements, and not XRP. The global reserve currency is far more likely to be BTC, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), or Ether (ETH) because these are permissionless financial systems and experience significant native demand from consumers and businesses all over the world. It simply doesn’t make any sense that XRP -- as a permissioned currency that only banks can access in substantial quantities -- will ever have more liquidity than a global reserve that’s used by billions of people.The magnitude of the liquidity discrepancy between currency pairs is enormous. Over the last 30 days, the average daily volume for BTC was just shy of $10 billion, and for XRP was about $500 million. This gap is likely to grow as BTC becomes a global, censorship-resistant, store of value.Ripple Inc. is aware of this problem: they recently launched a liquidity program. Since Ripple Inc. owns about 2/3 of total XRP supply – with an implied valuation of $45-50 billion based on current spot prices – they are deliberately discounting their service at a significant rate to entice their customers to use XRP rather than BTC. This artificial liquidity is just - artificial. It will run out. This will maintain a floor of liquidity for XRP in the short term, but there’s just no way for this program to provide the liquidity necessary to exceed that of the global reserve.Unfortunately for XRP holders, the probability of XRP becoming the global reserve just became substantially more difficult. The CBOE and CME -- two of the world’s largest futures exchanges -- just launched Bitcoin futures trading. The magnitude of this development cannot be overstated. This hinders XRP’s chances of becoming the global reserve currency.For large financial institutions, the single largest problem with cryptocurrencies, other than perhaps custodianship, is price volatility. Futures can be used to hedge price risk. In the next few months, as these futures markets mature, banks will be able to buy and hold billions of dollars worth of BTC on their balance sheets while hedging out price risk.Given this, why would any rational financial institution want to use XRP as the bridge currency to settle transactions? BTC now has two huge advantages: ~20x the liquidity, and a futures market that allows banks to hedge price risk while holding large amounts of BTC. XRP bulls counter that XRP offers faster settlements times and lower fees than BTC. This is true, but irrelevant. The value of liquidity and ability to hedge price risk are far more important than these two relatively insignificant technology details.So why does XRP keep pumping? The team is one of the best in crypto. The venture capital investors backing Ripple Inc. are top notch. They continue to announce new banking partners. I fully expect these banks to use Ripple’s software, and experiment with XRP. But...We maintain our position: in the long run, we’re bearish on XRP. We simply don’t see any series of events that can occur that would cause financial institutions to voluntarily adopt XRP over the global reserve. Having said that, given the state of crypto markets today, XRP could keep pumping. There’s really not a good objective valuation model for XRP given the intrinsic velocity problem that it faces, so it could 5x before our thesis is reflected in XRP price movements.“In the short term, the market is a voting machine; in the long term, it’s a weighing machine.” - Warren BuffettUpdate 12/21/2017 at 12:53 US Central Time: This article originally misstated the number of currency pairs globally. It is about 16,000, not an astronomical number as originally reported."

More than 90% of Bitcoin trading took place there, on exchanges that charged no-trading fees. The majority of Bitcoin miners were located there due to the cheap electricity. And the biggest Bitcoin mining equipment manufacturer in the world, Bitmain, is a Chinese company.While it’s still true that China is dominant in mining and manufacturing mining equipment, that no longer is the case with Bitcoin’s trading volume. Around New Year’s, when China banned no-fee trading and began enforcing other regulations on Chinese Bitcoin exchanges, trading of Bitcoin in China plummeted, and over the course of the year, Bitcoin trading shifted toward countries like Japan.Still, it was a surprise to many when, a few weeks ago, China banned this year’s runaway crypto trend: initial coin offerings. Even more, authorities asked token issuers to refund participants’ money. Then, within two weeks, the Chinese central bank, the People’s Bank of China, told Bitcoin exchanges they had to close as well.What happened?“In the past few weeks, there were 10 ICOs every week, and a lot of people don’t understand Bitcoin. They don’t know what Bitcoin is. They’re just coming in and want to make big money. When the situation got worse, old ladies were investing their retirement savings, and the government stepped in,” said Da Hongfei, cofounder of NEO, a blockchain platform for digital assets and smart contracts, in the latest episode of my podcast, Unchained (Google Play, iTunes, iHeartRadio, Stitcher or TuneIn Radio). Da Hongfei of NEO and Patrick Dai of QtumPatrick Dai, the cofounder of Qtum, said that as ICOs took off in popularity, people seemed to forget their initial purpose. “The initial idea of the ICO is, okay, I have a good idea, I want to build an open source project, no business model. OK, I need the community to support me, to donate to me some money.” Instead, a lot of traditional businesses decided to do ICOs — like a mooncake company.Then, there were the actual Ponzi schemes and other scams that were cropping up. That made people associate ICOs with fraudulent activity.“ICO is just a method for you to raise money. ICOs itself is not a scam. Some ICO projects are a scam, but people in China cannot distinguish the difference. They do not understand what is an ICO or an ICO project. They think, oh, all ICOs are scams, or that an ICO itself is a scam,"" said Dai.Plus, he said, it became too easy for people who didn’t know what they were doing to invest. He said the country had 65 ICO broker platforms that lowered barriers to entry.As for the refund back to investors, well, Da says not a single NEO investor has yet requested one.As much of a dampener the ICO ban was on the Chinese token market, the bitcoin exchanges closings had an even bigger impact in China. When discussing the bitcoin exchanges ban, Dai said, “People were even more surprised and scared. Some new people who just joined the industry this year, maybe a few months ago, and they all think the bitcoin price will always go up and they invested a lot into bitcoin, and after BTC China confirmed they will close the exchange, the price went down 25-30%, so you can see people scared bitcoin may become useless in the future.”But despite fears that the price of bitcoin could crash and many newcomers may be selling, others have used the dip to buy more, said Da and Dai.So, what are NEO’s and Qtum’s plans going forward? Qtum will be moving its focus to other countries, opening an office in Denver. NEO is working on a global legal framework for smart contracts on NEO so that people holding token sales on NEO can do it legally in most major countries. And both projects want it known that they are hiring.Tune in to the full episode (Google Play, iTunes, iHeartRadio, Stitcher or TuneIn Radio, web) to hear how Chinese regulators seemed to be defining tokens vs. virtual currencies, what kind of crypto fundraising is still permitted, and whether or not these bans are permanent or temporary.Tuesday, September 19, 2017, 12:40pm EST: The photo caption originally mixed up the ICO with which each podcast guest was associated.

Which is precisely where it is all heading.Huobi, one of the top three Bitcoin trading platforms, stopped all bitcoin trading in mainland China and have moved to Singapore, Hong Kong, and South Korea. Shanghai-based BTCC stopped trading and said it will charge users a service fee to withdraw existing funds by Friday.Bitcoin is one of the hundreds of cryptocurrencies that have become all the rage in just the last two years. A number of professional investment firms, from Hong Kong hedge funds to wealthy family offices, have been investing in these new digital securities, often created out of thin air and used to fund new start-ups. Bitcoin is the most popular. The Chinese penchant for gambling set Beijing monetary policymakers off this summer to shut down exchanges and initial coin offerings, the main funding mechanism for tech start-ups losing to raise what same say is fake capital. Regardless, hundreds of millions of dollars have been raised in the ICO market, which was also banned, and many of those Chinese investors are either buying cryptocurrencies in offshore accounts or investing directly in start-ups by purchasing the tokens they issue in those ICOs.See: China's Bitcoin Ban No Match For Stateless Blockchain -- ForbesThe Battle For The Soul Of Bitcoin -- ForbesThe crypto market is not afraid of China one bit.""None of the exchanges previously based in China ceased business. They simply moved their servers abroad,"" says Scott Freeman, CEO of C2CX, a digital assets exchange registered in Luxembourg but what designed for the Chinese market. ""The only change is that for the moment the funds will move in and out of local currency via P2P transactions instead of via direct deposit. From a regulatory perspective this is an inferior solution because it's much harder to prevent money laundering.""Stopping criminal activity, including tax evasion, is always one of the reasons why countries move to diminish or shutdown exchanges.The decentralized nature of the cryptocurrency world makes it hard to control.When the government announced the ban, bitcoin prices fell to $3,300 after hitting nearly $5,000 for one bitcoin. Today, one bitcoin costs $6,700. If you bought one hundred bitcoin in October 2012 for $10.26 each, you would now have $672,000 worth of bitcoin.China's regulators said it was not giving up on blockchain technologies, which ironically is used today primarily as a ledger for recording transactions in cryptocurrencies.On Tuesday, the CME Group, the world's largest derivatives exchange operators, said they would launch a bitcoin futures contract this year, pending regulatory approval.

As the industry takes on new modes of identity, it naturally adapts to other evolving, innovative fields -- an extremely important one being the cryptocurrency market. The worlds of influencer marketing and cryptocurrency are, in fact, rapidly converging. Digitization continues to revolutionize the way consumers and producers interact, and many influencer marketing startups are now jumping at the opportunity to raise funding via initial coin offerings (ICOs).For instance, Mattr, a top influencer marketing startup, is now utilizing blockchain technology for its marketing contracts and agreements, while indaHash, an influencer marketing app which connects over 300,000 influencers from 70 markets with global brands, has introduced their own indaHash Coin. Streamtoken.net, a blockchain-based token modeled on decentralized streaming, is even seeking to directly compete with the centralized payment models of YouTube, Twitch, Periscope and Netflix. To make sense of this convergence and to offer more insight for those who desire to get their feet wet in the Bitcoin investment domain, I spoke to leading tech entrepreneur and cryptocurrency influencer Oliver Isaacs. Isaacs is one of the UK’s leading serial entrepreneurs and tech influencers, garnering a total social media following of a few hundred thousand followers. A London School of Economics graduate and founder of Amirite.com, Isaacs has become a respected figure in the tech world as well as a leading advisor to social media influencers, Fortune 500 CEOs and tech investors alike. Due to exceptional determination and savvy investing, Isaacs has been able to purchase a number of virtual currencies at staggeringly reduced prices, such as the NEO coin and Ethereum bought for only $14 in early 2017. Today, the NEO coin costs about twice that at $30 per coin while an Ethereum is even pricier, topping off at around $300. Isaacs has made quite an impressive name for himself for someone still shy of 30. Here are his top five resources for the beginner Bitcoin investor:Become familiar with the cryptocurrency market.Before jumping head-first into Bitcoin as an investor, Isaacs recommends becoming more thoroughly acquainted with Bitcoin in general, such as building an understanding of the terms “Blockchain,” “Bitcoin,” “Ethereum,” “Neo,” “Litecoin” and “ICO.” The best way to do this, he said, is through bitcoin.org. “[Bitcoin.org] gives a solid introduction of Bitcoin in general,” Isaacs said. “I suggest visiting the merchant associations listed there to find current newsgroups, insights and forums on cryptocurrencies.”Be up-to-date on all things cryptocurrency.Like with any industry you decide to become a player in, it is crucial to be a student of the game. Isaacs reminds us that the Bitcoin industry is no different. “I would definitely advise reading daily cryptocurrency sites and media outlet sites covering all things cryptocurrency to keep on top of the daily news,” Isaacs said. “It’s important to fully grasp and understand the fundamental and technical analysis of different coins, and the sentimental analysis, which involves the psychology of the market.” As for his personal favorite sources, Isaacs lists CoinTelegraph, CryptoInsider, CoinMarketCap and CoinDesk as his daily providers of cryptocurrency insights, opinions and breaking news. He adds that these sites also give important insights into the varying characteristics of different coin management teams. “Like all business, management quality matters in this space too,” said Isaacs. “I would recommend beginner investors look for currencies (like Ripple, Dash or NEO) that are run by a full-time, professionally managed and experienced team that has a vision to grow, as opposed to those which are run by developers.”Utilize Bitcoin.directory.Finding a site that can condense a web full of data into one simple location is always a convenience, and Bitcoin.directory does just that for the crypto web. Providing a fully fleshed-out list of Bitcoin news, tools, exchanges, graphs, shopping and more, Bitcoin.directory is a valuable asset that Isaacs recommends for anyone considering a future in Bitcoin investment. “It is an excellent resource, full of socially curated submissions from the public covering topics ranging from the basics to technical analysis charts and graphs to comparisons of Bitcoin wallets and exchanges,” said Isaacs.Tap into cryptocurrency Facebook communities.“There are numerous, excellent groups on Facebook and the Telegram app covering crypto topics ranging from my personal favorite, All Things Cryptocurrency, full of a great group of people, to investors and to tech influencers.”Along with All Things Cryptocurrency, Isaacs also recommends The Cryptocurrency Academy for a wealth of “excellent advice, thoughts, and analysis.” Use Reddit subreddits to start building a portfolio.“Almost every cryptocurrency has its own subreddit such as (r/litecoin, r/ethereum, r/monero), which is a great way of discovering unknown coins and start diversifying your portfolio,” said Isaacs. “I strongly believe it’s important to hedge against volatility. Much like investing in the stock market or FX, you should diversify your portfolio as a risk management technique.”For subreddit starting points, Isaacs suggested /r/bitcoin (for discussions on Bitcoin in general), /r/ethtrader (Ethereum investing forum) and /r/BitcoinBeginners (for topics for beginners in bitcoin, general cryptos and blockchain).Like anything you are considering investing your time and money into, Isaacs encourages you to do your research in order to be able to independently deduce the potential trajectories of the digital currencies market. In order to successfully do so, Isaacs concludes with the following eight characteristics to look for when investing: • A strong technological soundness• Liquidity and security• Exchanges must be willing to store the coin in virtual wallets• High potential for future growth and scalability• The team in charge of future development and processes possesses a solid track record• Any key points, marketplace advantages or likely changes in the future• The ability of the currency to resist manipulation.As the worlds of influencers, freelancers, content creators and entrepreneurs keep rising in our collective conscious, so is their inevitable interface with payments via an international, digital proxy currency, such as crypto."

The heart-stopping volatility of Bitcoin and Ether is even more inflated in South Korea, where Bitcoin reached a whopping 25 million won ($24,000) on Dec. 8. With 2 million people buying into digital currencies, the Korean won processes the third-highest volume of Bitcoin transactions behind the dollar and yen.That fire is still ablaze despite authorities eyeing heavy-handed regulations. South Korea has become a stage for the clash between conservative regulators and thrill-seeking investors. Here are five ways the cryptocurrency craze rocked South Korea this year.1. South Korea has its first ICOs (May)ICON raised $35 million in a September ICO.South Korean fintech company Blockchain OS issued the country’s first initial coin offering in May. An ICO of 50 million BOScoins through a Swiss-based foundation finished in nine minutes in exchange for 6,900 Bitcoins. The volume of the ICO attracted a lot of attention and interest in the scene from South Koreans.Soon after, ICON launched its ICX token through a Swiss-based foundation in September, raising 150,000 Ether (then $42 million) in its presale to power a blockchain that aims to hyperconnect the country. Glosfer, another startup, raised 15 billion won ($13 million) in an ICO pre-sale Sept. 25.2. The Kimchi Premium hits new heights (July)South Korea was swept mysteriously by Ethereum fever, leading to local prices hitting 30-50% above the global average. With such limited investment opportunities -- even most gambling is illegal -- the risk-takers were ready to pour hot money into the digital currency market.Read: Have Yourself A Merry Crypto Christmas With These Gift IdeasIncreased traffic during peak trading prices regularly brought down servers at the exchanges, where the so-called Kimchi Premium soared as high as 50% above global prices, notes See-eun Ha of The Blockchainers, a Korean YouTube channel.“It really spurred the government to take regulatory action. Also, the government was probably very concerned about the unregulated arbitrage market,” he says.The price of Ethereum is higher in Korean won.3. Major companies get into blockchain (May-October)Large companies embraced the blockchain storm, with Samsung SDS joining the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance in May and banks experimenting with Bitcoin remittances. Kakao Corp, maker of KakaoTalk messenger, acquired fintech startup Dunamu to launch its own crypto exchange Upbit.The biggest deal was gaming giant Nexon acquiring Korbit, the country’s first Bitcoin exchange, a milestone for a corporation taking the dive into cryptocurrencies despite regulatory uncertainties surrounding their exit success.Gaming giant Nexon acquired Korbit, South Korea's first Bitcoin exchange.“The fact that Nexon was willing to take on this regulatory risk indicates how positively they view the future of cryptocurrency,” says Steve Kim, foreign legal advisor at Seum Law. “Unlike typical game companies that have an interest in crypto primarily as it relates to the purchase of game items, Nexon’s acquisition indicates its interest in the industry as a whole.”4. Government declares war on ICOs (September)(JOHN MACDOUGALL/AFP/Getty Images)As ICOs gained global momentum, the craze over the new financing method became impossible to ignore. While the South Korean government formed a task force in November 2016 to survey cryptocurrency trends, it was silent until September 2017 when it issued its first statement, noted Chan-sik Ahn and his tech team at HMP Law.In early September, the Financial Services Commission distinguished between securities-type tokens and utility-type tokens and emphasized that it would regulate securities-type tokens, a line consistent with the position of regulators including in the U.S. and Singapore, notes Kim.Many in the blockchain scene saw the regulatory statement as a relief, a sign that regulators were finally taking control. “Before the rush of middle school, high school and university students to invest in cryptocurrency, the market had a very large population of people over 50 years old who had money to spare. They were more susceptible to misinformation due to unfamiliarity with technology,” Ha says.But it hardly tamed activity. After the price of Bitcoin rose rapidly and China stifled its cryptocurrency market in September, an influx of money flooded the Korean market, Ahn noted. On Sept. 29, the task force stepped up its rhetoric to say it wanted to propose a legal amendment that would prohibit all ICOs, along with other heavy-handed regulations, thus bringing down the hammer on the new technology. But the local blockchain scene prepared to protest the ban, arguing the government - which does not recognize digital currencies as a financial product or legal tender - had no grounds to do so.Read: An ICO Ban In Japan Is Still A 'Definite Possibility'As of present, no ban - nor any other crypto regulation - has been enacted. But the September announcement has certainly set the tone for the government’s direction, Kim notes. Regulators said they were cracking down on crypto crimes such as multilevel Ponzi marketing schemes, ICO fraud and Bitcoin-based marijuana sales.The FSC’s comments didn’t stop local startup Metaps Plus from launching PlusCoin in October as the first crypto issuance based in Korea rather than through an overseas foundation. “Unfortunately, no more ICOs dare to be scheduled in Korea due to the government’s September announcement,” Ahn says.5. Government gears up for full-fledged regulation (December)The government’s September announcements gave the local market an uneasiness that has only been compounded. December has been peppered with bombshell regulation proposals as the government accelerated its process of building a regulatory framework. On Dec. 8, the Ministry of Justice took charge of the FSC’s task force - a signal in itself that regulators would take a stronger position to regulate and punish crypto-related activities in an effort to clamp down on alleged fraud or Ponzi schemes, Ahn said. Authorities are mulling corporate, value added and transaction taxes to gain income from the trade.Since then, FSC officials have said they would consider soon taking regulatory actions on both ICOs and the cryptocurrency exchanges, he added. “It seems reasonable to take some time for the authorities to catch up with new technology, but the cryptocurrency trades boom has become so feverish in such a short time that the South Korean government has had to spend more time and expense to take control of it,” Ahn said.Amid the chaos, the Korea Blockchain Association pledged its own self-regulations to tackle money laundering and other fraud.The government also proposed measures that would require crypto exchanges to meet disclosure and reserve requirements. Concern has risen over asset protection after Bithumb, the largest local exchange, suffered hacks allegedly at the hands of North Korea, and smaller exchange Youbit filed for bankruptcy this week after a second hack. While this was first reported as a ban on exchanges, the objective is to require the exchanges to afford to pay back their users as necessary, Kim noted.Read: How A Website About North Korea's Tech Use Battled -- And Beat -- Being Blocked In South KoreaTo restrict crypto-related inbound foreign investment, the government has asked banks not to process such remittances, Kim says. It is using a provision in foreign investment laws that allows rejection of foreign investment if it negatively impacts national security and public order. Banks are no longer accepting outbound crypto-related remittances either, he added.“Apparently the government has told the banks to reject foreign investment related to cryptocurrency based on this law---this is, of course, not an official nor public position held by the government,” Kim says.What This Means For 2018Photographer: Tomohiro Ohsumi/BloombergWith such volatility both in the market environment and in regulations, it is difficult to predict what 2018 holds for South Korea’s crypto scene. The government has expressed a negative view on cryptocurrency, ICOs, exchanges and other trading, but even its announcements so far have been vague, Ahn notes. He expects the government to legalize ICOs and crypto exchanges with strict requirements to prevent fraud, speculation or hacking, which should stabilize the cryptocurrency market.“It says it could prohibit all ICOs and cryptocurrency exchanges to prevent fraud or speculation, but many experts point out that the government will not prohibit cryptocurrency entirely because the institutionalization of issuance or exchange of cryptocurrency is a worldwide trend, and such a drastic policy could hurt the freedom of the market,” he says."

Blockchains have the potential to decentralize how trust is guaranteed in anything that can be stored digitally, which includes money, data, identity and ownership records. It is hard to exaggerate the potential disruption of legacy institutions and business models. In late September, the head of IMF, Christine Lagarde, cautioned that cryptocurrencies can displace central banks, conventional banking and national monies in the long term.","What has gotten less attention, however, is how blockchain will impact international politics in general and economic statecraft in particular. A key foundation of the predominance of the West, and particularly the United States, is the reliance on economic power. It is codified in the Bretton-Woods institutions and the role of the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency. Since all financial actors need to function on the U.S. market, the U.S. treasury’s domestic powers are in effect international. If they designate an entity a money-laundering concern or suspect of terrorist activity, the possibility to do business or transfers would vanish.Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, however, threaten to disrupt this foundation by decentralizing the operation of the financial system outside sovereign states’ control. This ties well into the goals of revisionist states, who long have sought to de-dollarize the world economy. The most noteworthy actor in this regard is Russia, who announced on the 15 October that it will issue a blockchain-based CryptoRuble.A bitcoin token sits next to the image of George Washington on a U.S. one dollar bill in this...

Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/BloombergRussia has been at the forefront of encouraging a national cryptocurrency as a way to avoid Western sanctions and economic influence. To this goal, Putin has met with Vitalik Buterin, founder of the second largest cryptocurrency Ethereum, and discussed its possible implementation in Russia. The more global cryptocurrencies are used, the less influence can be generated from the role of the US dollar.A key vulnerability in the Russian economy is the access to SWIFT, the standardised network for interbank transactions. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, there were many calls to prohibit Russia’s access to SWIFT. Among transfers between Russian banks, only 5-10% went outside the SWIFT system. It has sometimes been called the ‘nuclear option’ of economic warfare to block a state from its access to SWIFT and Prime Minister Medvedev have said that there would be ‘no limits’ to the Russian response if they were de-swifted. Russia is indeed right to be worried; when the EU imposed sanctions Iran’s access to SWIFT, the Iranian’s capability to move money out of Iran was disrupted. Hyperinflation ensued and the rial lost 50% of its value against the dollar and have not rebounded since. When trust is guaranteed by a protocol instead of financial institutions, mostly based in the West, the capability of the West to leverage economic power is reduced, which has been a key component of its grand strategy since the Second World War. Decentralized protocols are impossible for one state to sanction. A successful implementation of a national cryptocurrencies, as pioneered as well in Estonia and Tunisia, or larger implementation of global ones, will mitigate the impact of Western sanctions in general and the option of sanctioning of SWIFT in particular.Using public blockchains, transactions can be made quicker, cheaper and without the involvement of any third parties. Today, an international transfer requires several days and multiple institutions: banks, clearinghouses and SWIFT. Transactions with cryptocurrencies, such as Dash and Litecoin, cost between 1-2 cents and take seconds or minutes. The use of Bitcoin already gives North Korea opportunities to circumvent Western sanctions. According to Recorded Future, a threat intelligence company, North Korea commenced a large-scale Bitcoin-mining operation on 17 May. Similarly, one of Putin’s internet advisors, Dmitry Marinichev, launched a $100 million operation to mine Bitcoin. All these cases offer opportunities for states to diversify value outside the dollar system, as opposed to commodities that are generally traded in dollars. In Venezuela, mining Bitcoin has offered an opportunity for survival. In the midst of a hyperinflation in the bolivar projected to reach 1,600% year to year, many have started mining Bitcoin in order to pay for basic necessities. Since electricity is heavily subsidised, it is one of few commodities that the inhabitants have access to and can convert to Bitcoin with the rest of the economy falling.The core impact of blockchain technologies is a powerful decentralization. For centralized incumbents -- the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency, the financial system, predominantly governed by Western financial institutions -- their leverage is poised to decrease. For revisionist states, cryptocurrencies can be an attractive alternative to speed up this process."

He recently attended the Global Blockchain Summit in Wanxiang, where many bright-eyed Chinese are looking forward to a digital economy. ""The first kind is afraid of everything, to the point that some execs didn’t come to the recent blockchain summit because the event had the word 'blockchain' in its name, and they feared that Chinese police would take their picture there and use that as evidence to repress them later on. The second kind of Chinese is the type that is not afraid of anything. And these are the ones who are re-registering their blockchain companies in Hong Kong and Singapore, and will continue operations shut down by the central bank,"" Dzyatkovsky says.During the Wanxiang blockchain conference, rumors were already circulating that founders of new tech firms that tapped the ICO markets had come up with new ways to get around the ban.

The camera zooms in, between the backs of some mens’ heads, to show a conference panel. The screen gets darker, the camera jolts back and forth, then it shows the backs of chairs, then everything goes blurry …. It seems like the last video anyone would want to watch. (Quite literally. More than four years after it was published, it still only has 94 views.)","But four and a half minutes in, one of the panelists begins to describe an idea he’s had:“If you wanted to, today, start a new protocol layer on top of Bitcoin, a lot of people don’t realize, you could do it without going to a bunch of venture capitalists and instead of saying, hey, I’ve got this idea, you can — you’re familiar with Kickstarter I assume? Most of you? You can actually say, okay, here’s my pitch, here’s my group of developers — there’s a lot of developers in this room. If you get a bunch of trustworthy guys together that people have heard of and say, okay, we’re going to do this. We’re going to make a new protocol layer. It’s going to have new features X, Y and Z on top of bitcoin, and here’s who we are and here’s our plan, and here’s our bitcoin address, and anybody who sends coins to this address owns a piece of our new protocol. Anybody could do that. And I’ve been telling people this for at least a year now because I want to invest in it. I don’t have a ton of coins, but that’s where I want to invest my coins. And I’ve yet to find somebody who wants my coins. Does anybody in this room want my bitcoins because I want to—”“I’ll take them,” someone shouts, and the video ends.It was the 2013 San Jose Bitcoin conference. By that point, the panelist, J.R. Willett, had been hawking his crazy idea for more than a year. In January 2012, on the Bitcoin Talk forum, the Seattle-based software engineer published a white paper titled, “The Second Bitcoin White Paper.” (To quote the summary: “We claim that the existing bitcoin network can be used as a protocol layer, on top of which new currency layers with new rules can be built …. We further claim that the new protocol layers … will provide initial funds to hire developers to build software which implements the new protocol layers, and … will richly reward early adopters of the new protocol.”) Seventeen months later, still no one had tried it. Little did he know it would be five years before the idea in his white paper would become a runaway trend (built on Ethereum instead of Bitcoin, but the same concept nonetheless), raising $2 billion in just the first nine months of 2017 and leaving venture capitalists fretting about the future: the initial coin offering.J.R. Willett, the founder of the ICOThough Willett, who’s been obsessed with Bitcoin ever since he discovered it in 2010, did finally launch the first ICO, Mastercoin (now called Omni), back in 2013, he’s not been involved in cryptocurrency in recent years — until now.He’s found what he calls “the perfect token sale” and is backing it with more than $1 million of his own money — and not even at a pre-sale price. (“I feel pre-sales stink of insider favoritism, so we’re not doing a pre-sale,” he wrote via email.) The so-called UpToken, whose sale begins October 16, is also different from the tokens that have garnered the most attention this year — those powering new decentralized blockchains and apps built on top.[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]So what exactly is Willett backing? What he calls the “shovels” in this digital gold rush: crypto ATMs (by Washington-based company Coinme) with tokens that offer discounts and cash back to token holders. While ATMs — physical infrastructure that have been around since the 1970s — don’t feel like they belong in a blockchain-based future, Willett says, “This really pushes crypto assets/crypto economy to new audiences and opens that gateway to people who will learn about Bitcoin perhaps just by walking in the mall and seeing the Bitcoin ATM.”Whether or not Willett's new venture aiming to ""put a crypto ATM on every corner"" will turn out to be an instance yet again in which he was two steps ahead or an idea whose time has passed remains to be seen.From Penny Stocks To Magic Internet MoneyIn 2010, the quirky, affable Willett was a software engineer who had an intellectual interest in “these ridiculous penny stocks would float way up and crash.” He traded them on paper, but not with actual money. He was also researching payment systems for some personal projects when he read that credit card chargebacks could be avoided with Bitcoin. At that point he fell down the rabbit hole. “I spent days just reading everything I could about this,” he says. “I didn’t know if Bitcoin would be huge itself, but I thought, something that looks a lot this is going to take over the world and I really would like to own a piece of it.”But with two children and another on the way, there wasn’t a lot of extra money to throw into a speculative investment — especially one in which the exchange options were, one, the “sketchy-looking” Mt. Gox website, which was named for Magic the Gathering cards and subsequently lost almost half a million dollars worth of Bitcoin, and two, mailing an envelope full of cash to a guy in Canada who would send you bitcoins back.For months, he and his wife argued, with him insisting Bitcoin could be huge. “Watching the penny stocks — the dumbest things would suddenly take off because someone was pumping them up and others were legitimately hyping these ideas that were getting people excited, and some were blatant scams. In fact, it reminds me a lot of the ICO market today,” he says. But he believed Bitcoin could get into a speculative bubble. “People on the Bitcoin forum were already moaning about the speculative bubble from 1 cent to 25 cents. How could something go up 25 fold? Everyone was saying, this is unsustainable, this is a crash, it’s going to end in tears. And I was thinking, this could go so much higher.”Finally, after four months of bickering, his wife gave him $200 for both his birthday and Christmas and said, “Flush it down the toilet if you want to.”With that money, he launched a Bitcoin mining scheme — in which he paid random people from Craigslist monthly to run his mining software.From Sleepless Nights To The First ICOBut mining bitcoins wasn’t enough. Willett kept lying in bed night after night, trying to imagine what would happen with cryptocurrency. He dreamed up something like contracts on top of Bitcoin, the way email is layered on top of TCP/IP, but wondered how he could pay for its development. Realizing he could float a coin on top of Bitcoin that buyers would automatically own if they sent bitcoin to fund its development, he wrote the white paper but didn’t want to play entrepreneur himself. Finally, after a year and a half of promoting his idea, he became so frustrated no one was trying out his idea, he decided to do what he called an “initial distribution” himself. “Basically the reason I did the first ICO is that I just wanted to prove that it would actually work,” he says.The invention of the ICO “did not seem like such a big deal at the time,” though Willett says it was this “bizarre feeling of, whoa, I published a white paper and an address, and strangers were sending me money.” And though Mastercoin proposed all sorts of ideas like decentralized commerce and a decentralized exchange, Willett soon realized, “What everyone got really excited about was, hey, I can publish a paper and people will send me money. Literally within a few months, other projects were doing the same thing — the most famous of which was Ethereum.”But Willett was correct that launching a new venture was stressful. First, soon after launching the sale, “there were literally people saying I’ve reported you to the SEC, you’re going to go to jail,” says Willett. “I got really worried about the SEC swat van — if there is such a thing — kicking down my door and dragging me off in the middle of the night.” (He hadn’t consulted a lawyer.) Then, there was the fact that, after raising $500,000 worth of bitcoins, the price jumped tenfold. Suddenly he had $5 million to keep safe. Though at first he had contractors working to develop Omni while he kept his full-time job, once the token reached 100 multiples of its ICO price, he sold just 2-3% of his tokens — “just enough to make my wife happy to be able to quit my job,” he says. But then it went down almost a hundred-fold. Within a year, he was back at his old employer, Cozi, working on a calendar applications for families.This year, watching ICOs take off, Willett had mixed feelings. On one hand, “I worry about unsophisticated people losing their shirts,” he says. On the other, he says, “token sales allow people to participate in a number of exciting projects at a very early stage,” and he finds it exciting that projects that are doing good work can now “get the funding they might otherwise not have gotten to push the ball forward in the crypto economy.”‘The Perfect Token Sale’When Bitcoin ATM purveyor Coinme called Willett, he became convinced ATMs were the next big expansion of the crypto economy — as long as their network was powered by a token. He persuaded the team to adopt what they’re calling UpToken, which is designed like loyalty points, and quit his job again in July. He now serves as a contractor on the project.While it seems counterintuitive that many people would buy digital currencies through a physical ATM, Coinme cofounder and CEO Neil Bergquist says, “Bitcoin appeals to a technical audience. The majority of the world is non-technical, and what they need is a physical portal to participate not only in the crypto economy but also in financial transactions in general.” On top of that, he says, the experience can be preferable to a process even as easy as a service like Coinbase’s where it can take about a week from time of purchase before the coins show up in your account. “We get calls and Facebook posts every day from people saying, this was amazing, I just bought my first bitcoin, it was so easy and instant,” says Bergquist. On top of that, the transaction allows more privacy, whereas signing up for an online exchange may require you to link your bank account. Plus, crypto exchanges have a long history of being hacked.But just how popular crypto ATMs can prove to be and how much volume they can handle remains to be seen. Coinme's average ATM volume per month is only $100,000 and the company currently has 39 in the Western United States, while fewer than 1,600 exist total worldwide, compared to an estimated three million fiat ATMs.However, Bergquist isn’t banking everything on the ATMs. “We see ATMs as the beachhead,” he says, adding that Coinme gives customers their own Coinme wallets, crypto IRA and 401(k) offerings and other financial services. The company even has a private client division for customers who want to buy and sell up to $1 million of cryptocurrency a day.But if ATMs are the beachhead, the troops need to be increased. About 85% of all Bitcoin ATMs are located in North America and Europe, which are the same geographies where the unbanked are a lower proportion of the population than the rest of the world. Perhaps a token could rev up demand for more ATMs — which is the purpose of UpToken. Every ATM user receives a cash back equivalent to 1% of the total transaction amount in UpToken. Any customer who pays for their fees, typically 5-10% of the transaction, in UpToken will receive a 30% discount on those fees. And UpToken holders will be able to vote on the new cryptocurrencies to be added to the network. Willett says this is the “perfect” token sale because it grows in accordance with the amount raised. Also, for UpToken, it doesn’t matter whether Bitcoin or Ethereum or another coin we may not yet know becomes the dominant coin.As for whether this offering could get the “SEC swat van” to come running, Marco Santori, a partner at law firm Cooley who is familiar with how securities law may apply to crypto assets, says the risk that a coin like UpToken is labeled a security is low. On top of that, he thinks crypto loyalty points is the wave of the future.“I think [crypto loyalty points have] the potential to unlock a tremendous amount of value in industries that have really been untouched by the technological revolution over the last 10 years. Affinity points — airline miles and loyalty haven’t changed very much over time, for example,” he says. However, Spencer Bogart, head of research at venture firm Blockchain Capital, says the setup is like “a big Rube Goldberg machine.” Noting that he believes that tokens seem best for businesses that want to build a network effect — where early adopters benefit the more people end up joining the network — he says, “The ATM experience is not better to me because other people also use the ATM. I don’t care if 100 of my friends use the ATM or don’t use it or anybody in San Francisco uses it or doesn’t use it.” On top of that, he says competitors could just charge better rates instead of offering discounts. Or, pump-and-dumpers could buy a lot of UpTokens to have their coin added to the network and then sell if their coin wins and the price jumps.Coinme ATM users who received UpToken with the 1% reward may not like the fact that they can't touch their Uptokens until they've amassed $10,000 in ATM transactions, but Bergquist explains this is like not being able to redeem airline miles until you've earned at least 10,000 miles.As for Bogart's network effect criticism, Bergquist says that the vast majority of Coinme users have never purchased a Bitcoin before, so ""the network effect of UpToken will be felt across the entire crypto community,"" he wrote via email. He also says the more ATMs that are deployed, the lower the fees, as small Bitcoin ATM operators can charge as much as 17%. As for people trying to sway elections to pump and dump, Willett, using Litecoin as an example, wrote in an email, ""Of the hundreds or even thousands of people who used their UpToken to win that auction for Litecoin, undoubtedly some of them would sell Litecoin as the price went up. I don't see a problem with that. It's still great news for Litecoin to be on a massive worldwide ATM network.""UpToken is a crypto token meant to be used like loyalty points. Compared to some other blockchain projects that are attempting to bootstrap decentralized networks, it should be easy to see whether they've achieve their goal to ""put a crypto ATM on every corner."" As with Willett's initial idea, only time will tell -- but now many more will be watching.Update September 21, 2017 at 1pm EST: This article originally misstated how much Coinme ATM users will receive cash back in UpToken. It is 1% of the total transaction amount, not of the transaction fees. And Coinme has ATMs throughout the western United States, not just in Washington state. "

(MARK RALSTON/AFP/Getty Images)","Even as China cracks down on Bitcoin exchanges, its central bank is promoting a state-backed digital currency. Tests on such a currency have been successfully carried out, and there appears to be support among some officials and experts for a potential rollout down the line. The digital currency may reduce the incidence of money laundering, but authorities would need to guard against hacking, another type of crime.The director of the People's Bank of China's (PBOC), Yao Qian, announced last week that China has completed trial runs on algorithms that would be used to supply a digital currency. Test transactions between the central bank and commercial banks were successful. The next step may be piloting of the currency in urban areas.Benefits of digital currencyThe proposed currency would be treated as cash and used in digital wallets managed by commercial banks. Digital currency could then be used directly for payments. This would greatly reduce transactions costs, since payments could be directly transferred from buyers to sellers. Use of a state-backed digital currency would also make transactions more transparent in order to reduce the incidence of money laundering and tax evasion. China has struggled with unseen uses of money, particularly through underground banks, which often hold extensive networks within the country and abroad. Leads provided by use of a digital currency may help authorities to crack down more easily upon such illegal organizations.Chinese authorities have been far less amenable toward cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, digital currencies that are not backed by a state authority. Bitcoin has been accused of aiding financial crimes. Sheng Songcheng, an adviser to the People’s Bank of China, stated last month that Bitcoin facilitates money laundering and tax evasion. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s inherent value has been questioned by Chinese scholars, who view the cryptocurrency as a product of speculation rather than real value, since it is not backed by a state.Precedent for state-backed digital currencyStill, some form of digital currency remains suitable for China. Chinese consumers have shown increasing readiness to use non-cash forms of payment. Digital payments are used daily to make payments through WeChat or Alipay, reaching $5.5 trillion in 2016. This indicates that there is demand for digital payment services as well as an understanding of how to use them. Pilot tests in large cities such as Beijing or Shanghai will be instructive in determining precisely how great the demand is for using a digital fiat currency rather than cash, and to what extent the public will require education about the new system.China is not the first country to consider adopting a digital currency. Sweden, England and Canada, have been considering adoption of digital currencies themselves. Other countries have already adopted them. Ecuador was the first country to issue a state-backed digital currency, in 2015, called the Sistema de Dinero Electrónico. The currency was not well publicized, however, and also faced controversy due to rumors regarding its security (link in Spanish). Tunisia and Senegal also have their own digital currencies.A major weaknessA major weakness, however, in using this type of currency is vulnerability to hacking. Even decentralized Blockchain digital currencies like Ether and Bitcoin have been subject to hacking. In a single incident in July for example, $32.6 million in Ether was stolen by hackers, who took advantage of a vulnerability in Parity’s digital wallet software. This resulted in a massive decline in market value of Ether. In another case, the world’s then-largest Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, was hacked over a period starting in 2011, with $460 million stolen.Therefore, while China's digital fiat currency will not be held in a traditional bank account, officials must consider providing some form of deposit insurance or other type of guarantee for digital currency wallets in order to protect citizens from these types of attacks and to protect the system from bank runs.This doesn't mean that a digital currency cannot work for China, especially as it seems that the digital currency proposal has been well received. China's leadership is moving slowly to ensure that any new system is properly and safely implemented, which is certainly the right direction."

Both programs provide options for different outcomes ...","Oct 31, 2017,03:50pm EDT",Shutterstock: Cryptocurrencies,"If you have multiple cryptocurrency (coin) trades, consider a trade accounting solution dedicated to coin transactions. The program should calculate taxable income and loss based on IRS rules for coin transactions. It should generate capital gains and losses reports to support Form 8949 and “other income” statements. The program needs to account for all coin transactions, including coin-to-currency trades, coin-to-coin trades, receipt of coin in a hard fork or split transaction, purchases of goods or services made with a coin, and mining revenue.I reviewed two coin accounting solutions that fit the bill: Bitcoin.Tax and CoinTracking.Info. Both programs provide options for different outcomes and in general, stick with the default method to stay clear of potential IRS trouble. (See How Cryptocurrency Investors Can Avert IRS Attack).Coin exchanges do not provide taxable income reports Don’t look to your coin exchange for much help with tax reporting. They don’t keep cost-basis information and are unable to give the users online tax reports. A coin is not a “covered security” for Form 1099-B issuance, so coin investors and the IRS don’t receive a 1099-B.Coin investors are responsible for generating their accounting and tax reports. With uncertainty on tax treatment due to lack of sufficient IRS guidance, many coin traders wind up under-reporting taxable income on coin transactions. In most cases, it may be inadvertent, but sometimes, it’s willful. Using accounting software shows an attempt to be compliant.The IRS is pursuing coin investorsThe IRS served a “John Doe” summons (the worst kind) to the most significant coin exchange, Coinbase, to obtain its customer list for investors and traders with coin transactions worth more than $20,000. The IRS calculated that less than 900 taxpayers reported capital gain or losses on coin transactions in 2015, an alarmingly small number.With coin prices skyrocketing in 2017, the U.S. Treasury wants tax revenues — its share of the windfall profits. Perhaps this is the reason they labeled coin “intangible property” rather than currency. There wouldn’t be any taxable income or loss on the use of money.Bitcoin.TaxI spoke with the owner of Bitcoin.Tax (BT), Colin Mackie, who described his program to me in detail. Here’s what I learned.“Most coin exchanges allow a download of account history as a CSV file, and then BT imports it,” he said. “BT also has an API solution that works with some coin exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini, to download directly into BT.”Mackie said the program produces various downloads for capital gains, such as Form 8949 PDFs, 8949 attachable statement, TurboTax import, TaxACT import, and plain CSV.“For income, it’s a summary of income and mining per coin as a CSV,” he said. “For Section 1031 like-kind exchanges, it’s a statement of the appropriate lines from the Form 8824, one row per trade.”The BT default method is to report capital gains and losses on coin-to-coin trades like trading Bitcoin for Ethereum. I suggest our clients use this default treatment to be compliant with IRS rules. The program offers an option to defer income and loss on all coin-to-coin trades by treating those trades as Section 1031 like-kind exchanges. If you select the like-kind exchange option, the BT program delays all taxable income or loss on these trades for the entire year until the user sells the coin for currency. Mackie said some accountants requested this option, but I strongly advise our clients against it. (See Cryptocurrency Traders Risk IRS Trouble With Like-Kind Exchanges.)Mackie recommends BT users to pay careful attention to hard fork transactions, such as when Bitcoin distributed Bitcoin Cash.“The coin exchange shows an addition to coin balances for the hard fork distribution, but some don’t include the new coin received in trade activity,” he said. “Sometimes BT picks it up automatically. Otherwise, it requires the user to add the new coin manually. The user can enter the new coin in as income using the daily price on the fork date. But, users also have the option to enter zero for cost basis.”Sometimes a user doesn’t get a constructive receipt of the new coin, or the new coin doesn’t have a trading price on the day received. Report it as taxable income when accepted if you can determine it’s value. (See How To Report Bitcoin Cash And Avoid IRS Trouble.) BT offers a wide selection of accounting methods, which it calls basis methods, and I am not sure all of them will pass muster with the IRS. BT offers FIFO, LIFO, average cost, and specific identification.Mackie says the specific identification method “uses strategies so the user may select the lowest cost, highest cost, or closest cost, where the program finds the best match to minimize capital gains.” That sounds like too much cherry picking after year-end. I think users should use acceptable accounting methods and select them in writing before the year commences.I suggest our clients use FIFO to stay out of harm’s way with the IRS. This program feature of greater choice of basis method naturally leads to more income deferral and that will attract more IRS attention.All that being said, I think BT is an inexpensive accounting solution that can work well for American taxpayers, provided they stay clear of the non-compliant options to defer income. Be sure that the program captures all transactions from the coin exchange.BT is free up to 100 transactions, and it charges $19.95 per year when users exceed 100 entries.CoinTracking.InfoCoinTracking.Info is another accounting solution to consider. I spoke with CoinTracker founder and CEO Dario Kachel to learn more about this program. According to Kachel, CoinTracking is the only service with current and historical prices for all 4,878 coins on the market.RG: Does CoinTracking (CT) generate a capital gains and losses report for American coin investors in compliance with U.S. tax law?DK: Yes, it does. CoinTracking creates U.S. compliant tax reports such as Capital Gains And Losses on Form 8949, Other Income Reports, Gift and Donation Reports, Lost and Stolen Reports, and Closing Position. Reports can be exported in many formats like Excel, CSV, PDF and even in standard forms like Form 8949, Statement for the IRS, TaxACT, and TurboTax.RG: Does CT account for all coin transactions, including coin-to-currency trades, coin-to-coin trades, receipt of coin in a hard fork or split transactions, and each time a coin investor purchases goods or services using a coin?DK: Yes. We support all your mentioned transactions, which is necessary for a correct capital gains report. Also, we handle mined coins, income (e.g., a salary in cryptos), gifts, donations, and lost or stolen coins.RG: On coin-to-coin trades, like trading Bitcoin for Ethereum, does CoinTracking report a capital gain on the imputed sale of Bitcoin?DK: Yes it does. All coin-to-coin trades will be calculated based on the cost basis and the proceeds value of the cryptos at the time of the transaction converted in USD or any other FIAT currency.RG: On coin-to-coin trades, does CT offer the user an option to use a “like-kind-exchange” to defer the capital gains income?DK: The option for like-kind calculations on CoinTracking is already in progress, and we will release it in December 2017. But as you said, coin investors do not qualify for like-kind exchanges, and there are no other countries officially supporting like-kind calculations (that we know of at this moment).RG: For coin forks or splits, does CT account for the receipt of the new coin and report its fair market value or initial trading price as income? Does the program report other income or capital gains income?DK: There are two ways (for our program) to calculate forked coins. The easy way is to figure them with their fair market value. The other way is to set the cost basis of both coins on the date of the fork depending on the coin distribution. For example, the BTC/BCH split was a 90:10 split. This would mean, that all your new BCH coins would receive a cost basis of 10% of your BTC cost basis.RG: In How To Report Bitcoin Cash And Avoid IRS Trouble, I suggest two options, too.RG: Do you give the user the choice of accounting method after-the-fact, so they cherry pick which is best for them in a given tax year? (We frown upon that practice as pointed out in my last blog post, How Cryptocurrency Investors Can Avert IRS Attack.)DK: Yes, users can change the accounting method as often as they like. We also provide an instant gain calculator, where users can estimate their gain/loss and tax even prior the sale of assets.CT’s Website states that it offers the various accounting methods including FIFO, LIFO, HIFO, and LOFO.CT is free to use for up to 200 transactions, and it charges $325 “for lifetime use,” when users exceed 200 entries. “CT also offers more imports than other providers, margin trades, lending and borrowed coins,” says Kachel.Coin investors and traders face a minefield of IRS trouble on a wide selection of tax accounting issues. Non-compliance is rampant, and the IRS is on the case. Put your best foot forward by using one of these accounting solutions and don’t use the features that can get you into trouble like like-kind exchanges.Postscript: The IRS calls for the “specific identification” (SI) accounting method for use on sales of property, including intangible property (coin). IRS regulations for SI require “adequate identification” of lots sold on a contemporaneous basis, and I don’t think most coin traders comply with these rules. In June 2016, the AICPA asked the IRS if coin traders could use “first in first out” (FIFO) as an alternative solution, which the IRS permits for securities. Unless you comply with SI rules, I suggest using the FIFO accounting method for coin. (See Accounting Method Impacts Crypto Income Taxes.)Contact me with questions. "

The new contract from the Chicago-based exchange is to provide a “regulated trading venue” for the cryptocurrency market.","The contract will be cash-settled, based on the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR), which serves as a once-a-day reference rate of the U.S. dollar price of bitcoin. And, bitcoin futures will be listed on and subject to the rules of the CME.Terry Duffy, CME Group Chairman and CEO, commenting on the development said: “Given increasing client interest in the evolving cryptocurrency markets, we have decided to introduce a bitcoin futures contract.”He added: “As the world's largest regulated FX marketplace, CME Group is the natural home for this new vehicle that will provide investors with transparency, price discovery and risk transfer capabilities.”Through its exchanges, the CME offers the widest range of global benchmark products across all major asset classes, including futures and options based on interest rates, equity indexes, foreign exchange, energy, agricultural products and metals.Today the company comprises four Designated Contract Markets (DCMs) or exchanges, the CME, CBOT, which brings a suite of interest rates, agricultural and equity index products and joined the CME Group back in 2007, as well as COMEX (metals products including several global benchmarks in precious, base and ferrous metals) and NYMEX offering energy products plus metals and agricultural contracts. The latter two joined the group in 2008.Since November 2016, the CME and Crypto Facilities Ltd., a crypto futures trading platform regulated by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority that supports currencies bitcoin and Ripple, have calculated and published the BRR. This aggregates the trade flow of major bitcoin spot exchanges during a calculation window into the U.S. Dollar price of one bitcoin as of 4:00 p.m. London time.Earlier this October, Crypto Facilities launched two new crypto currency rates in open beta, namely: (1) CF Ripple-Bitcoin Reference Rate (RRR_XBT), a once-a-day reference rate of the bitcoin price of 1 Ripple; and, (2) CF Ripple-Bitcoin Real Time Index (RRTI_XBT), an instantaneous rate of the US dollar price of 1 Ripple.Flags fly on the front facade of CME Group Inc.'s Chicago Board of Trade in Chicago (CBOT), in... [+] Chicago, Illinois, U.S.. The CME Group consists of four designated contract markets: CME, CBOT, NYMEX and COMEX (Photographer: Tim Boyle/Bloomberg).The BRR is designed around the International Organization of Securities Commissions’ (IOSCO) Principles for Financial Benchmarks. Several bitcoin exchanges and trading platforms - Bitstamp, GDAX, itBit and Kraken - are the constituent exchanges that currently contribute the pricing data for calculating it.Dr. Timo Schlaefer, CEO of Crypto Facilities, remarked: “We are excited to work with CME Group on this product and see the BRR used as the settlement mechanism of this important product,”He added: “The BRR has proven to reliably and transparently reflect global bitcoin-dollar trading and has become the price reference of choice for financial institutions, trading firms and data providers worldwide.”The CME and Crypto Facilities Ltd. also publish the CME CF Bitcoin Real Time Index (BRTI) to provide price transparency to the spot bitcoin market.The BRTI combines global demand to buy and sell bitcoin into a consolidated order book and reflects what is described as “the fair, instantaneous U.S. dollar price” of bitcoin in a spot price. It is published in real time and said to be suitable for marking portfolios, executing intra-day bitcoin transactions and risk management.The CME’s BRR and BRTI, a standardized reference rate and spot price index with independent oversight that launched November 14, 2016, were asserted by the exchange to be “accelerating the professionalization” of bitcoin trading and further establishing digital assets as a new asset class.Cryptocurrency market capitalization has grown in recent years to $172 billion, with bitcoin representing more than 54% of that total (equivalent to $94 billion).  As for the bitcoin spot market, it has also grown to trade roughly $1.5 billion in notional value each day.In terms of what bitcoin exchanges were saying about this latest CME development, Nejc Kodric, CEO of Bitstamp, said: “An independent, transparent bitcoin reference rate will further professionalize the asset class.”Jesse Powell, CEO of Kraken, added: “This is an exciting initiative and brings the asset class to a new level. As a market-leading digital asset exchange, Kraken is proud to contribute to the reference rates.”The CME exchange group provides electronic trading globally on its CME Globex platform and also offers clearing and settlement services across asset classes for exchange-traded and over-the-counter derivatives through CME Clearing.Core members of the independent oversight committee responsible for overseeing the scope of the Bitcoin Reference Rate by developing a code of conduct for participants and reviewing the practice, standards and definition of the reference rate, includes the CME’s Gavin Lee and Payal Lakhani, independent expert Andreas M. Antonopoulos, Max Boonen, B2C2, Professor William J. Knottenbelt of Imperial College London, Michael Moro, Genesis Global Trading, and Dr. Timo Schlaefer.For the methodology behind the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR), which includes a summary description and covers definitions including the calculation date, TWAP period and constituent exchange, see this document."

Among those recipients is a new rising star in the charity world, MAPS, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, which is spearheading a movement to legalize psychedelics for therapeutic use. ","To some readers, the idea of psychedelic therapy may seem odd. For years, it's been an obscure therapy and has only just begun to be talked about as a mainstream treatment.  For instance, the Food and Drug Administration acknowledged that recent small-group studies with psychedelic-assisted therapy have been so profoundly effective at treating mental illness, it fast-tracked it as a rare ""breakthrough"" treatment; now, it may be legal to use MDMA (""XTC"") for clinical use as soon as 2021.It took a long time to for MAPS to shed the stereotypes of psychedelics as an obscure, hippy medical treatment. Traditional public funding agencies weren't helpful, so the group needed early backers to fund the research. They found help in the tech sector.Psychedelics and Silicon Valley have a long history together; now that many of these technologists have garnered wealth, they're paying back their respects by aiding MAPS in its long-time quest to get psychedelics accepted in the broader medical community. For instance, Vice has a great feature on noted venture capitalist and philanthropist George Sarlo, who used psychedelics to overcome his own trauma as a holocaust survivor. As for this latest new donor, little is known about the Pineapple Fund, which just says that it isn't seeking publicity and wants to donate the majority of its newfound wealth to worthy causes. MAPS has to raise several more million dollars to fund the Phase III research trials, the last step required before psychedelics will become legal for (limited clinical) use in America.Regardless, given recent trends in Silicon Valley giving, when a mysterious bitcoin philanthropic fund dropped an astoundingly generous $1M to MAPS, it wasn't entirely out of the ordinary. I follow a lot of political and charitable giving out here in the Valley; I've rarely seen an organization that is as beloved as MAPS. After the Pineapple Fund's donation, I expect even more notable and anonymous philanthropists will be giving to psychedelic research."

investors are starting to adjust their fundraising and investment ...","Dec 6, 2017,12:15pm EST",The US Dollar & Bitcoin,"With Bitcoin and cryptocurrency going mainstream, startup founders and investors are starting to adjust their fundraising and investment strategies. This year was that of the Initial Coin Offering (ICO), where startups raised funding by creating and selling their own coins/tokens, instead of the traditional method of selling equity.ICOs started as a way for technology that doesn't have an underlying business model to raise funding. A perfect example of a technology like this is a protocol (like the Internet).The ICO trend started to skyrocket in June, as early adopters took advantage of being the first movers. Ninety-three percent of their projects were funded, and for some of them, they managed to raise tens of millions based only on a basic business plan (known in the industry as a whitepaper).However, over the past few months, we’ve seen the rate of successfully funded ICOs start to decline, with investors getting smarter and less likely to fund speculative projects. The adoption rate of cryptocurrencies is increasing, however, as more companies are starting to add Bitcoin as a method of payment. Expedia, Virgin and Microsoft all currently accept it, while McDonalds and Wal-mart are odds-on favorites to adopt Bitcoin in 2018.How are founders changing their fundraising strategies? Jane Lippencott is the cofounder of the cryptocurrency ZenCash, which is based on a private and distributed blockchain platform for communications, transactions and publishing. She feels that founders should have the foresight and discipline to refrain from ICOing at an early stage because, ""doing so exposes careless or uneducated investors to high risk, and burdens teams with unnecessary pressure to demonstrate price returns on an abbreviated and unrealistic timeline.""More on Forbes: Don't Be Dumb Money: How To Invest In ICOs And Blockchain StartupsThe general consensus is to first raise traditional angel and seed rounds to achieve product-market fit. Afterwards, however, Lippencott advises founders to explore ""opting to ICO, instead of raising a Series A or Series B round, as it could make perfect sense. Especially, because entrepreneurs can simultaneously raise substantial non-dilutive capital, acquire customers, and build a community.""Maxine Ryan is the cofounder of Bitspark, a blockchain remittance platform for money transfer businesses, which recently launched the token, Zephyr. She encourages founders to conduct thorough research before launching an ICO to understand the regulations. Ryan said, “as more startups are considering this route to raise funding, founders should closely study the difference between an ICO and a Token Sale, as there are specific regulatory requirements which affect both.”Token Sales generally refer to the creation of a Utility Token, which provides a specific use case within the startup's ecosystem. ICOs, on the other hand, can be recognized as issuing a security based on the underlying company, which has significantly stricter regulations.More professional investors jumping onboardEven though the number of ICOs is slowing down, interest from investors is increasing. Established investment firms are now adopting cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class, which is fueling additional growth, and more importantly, credibility, for the industry.More on Forbes: Planning To Do An ICO? Don't Forget About TaxesCME Group is launching a Bitcoin Futures investment product this month, while JP Morgan looks likely to offer their clients exposure to Bitcoin via this method. For hedge funds, according to CNBC research, there are now over 124 funds which solely focus on cryptocurrency, with this number rapidly rising each day.While in the venture capital scene, leading firms like Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz are starting to invest into ICOs. Innovative investment methods are being developed, too, like using SAFTs (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens).How do investors see the trends evolving?Jehan Chu is the managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a blockchain investment platform. Chu predicts that “the 2017 vintage of ICOs with $100-$200 million hard caps will soon give way to the newer, sleeker, more efficient and sustainable 2018 model. Ten million dollars will be the new $100 million, and we’ll see ICOs not only broken up into stages with milestone deliverables in between, but also equity raises working their way back into the equation for later-stage funding options.”Simon Dixon is the CEO of BnkToTheFuture.com and is an active investor in the industry. He's bullish on the future of ICOs as they ""produce an excellent way for protocol technology to reward its users and benefit from its adoption.""Dixon predicts that more large businesses, that already have traction and customers, will start to tokenize their ecosystems and communities. We've started to see this trend rising already, as publicly listed companies, like iCandy Interactive Limited, are starting to create their own coins.Dixon's advice to founders is, “prove what you can do with traditional investment first. And then if you get traction, explore if a token fits into your model as a way to build a great network, rather than raise capital."""

And while you may have heard friends, relatives, and coworkers talking about Bitcoin, you might not know that it's creating more than a buzz: it's creating jobs. From crypto startups to established companies, the job market has never looked so good for blockchain enthusiasts.","Let's look at the state of the cryptocurrency job market, what kind of work is available, and how to potentially land one of these roles yourself.How cryptocurrency has created tech jobsJob Trends In CryptocurrencyAccording to research from job search site Indeed, job postings mentioning “blockchain”, “bitcoin” or “cryptocurrency” have increased by 621% since November 2015. And supply is growing along with demand: they also report a 1,065% growth in searches for jobs mentioning those three terms.Some of the companies searching for these skills may surprise you. Uber, eBay, Capital One, Match.com, and GEICO number among the ranks of companies that have searched for and/or contacted candidates who have listed ""bitcoin"" or ""blockchain"" in their skillset. Whether this indicates that more widespread adoption of cryptocurrency is on its way or not remains to be seen--but the interest is certainly there.As with most tech fields, cryptocurrency is a male-dominated field...but women can always seize the opportunity to change that trend while the technology is still in its early days.What Kinds Of Crypto-Related Jobs Are Out There?From developers to project managers to miners to data scientists, there's a broad spectrum of jobs available in the cryptocurrency business. There are even specific job search sites featuring these postings now, such as CryptocurrencyJobs.com. Some roles merely incorporate blockchain technology; others focus on it.Cryptocurrency analysts design investment strategies. Blockchain developers use blockchain technology to implement solutions for their companies. Mining technicians assemble, run, and maintain the ""rigs"" that mine cryptocurrencies. There are crypto-focused jobs for traders, sales associates, reporters, DevOps engineers, consultants, technical product managers, and more. Even a few internships are available.These jobs may entail working with a currency that's already been built, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum--or they may be an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) project where team members build an entirely new currency using blockchain.How Do You Get A Cryptocurrency Job?Obviously, in such a new industry, the specific duties of each role will vary widely between companies--and may even change while you're actually on the job as the space evolves. Your day will look very different if you're at an early-stage startup versus a large, publicly-traded company.The first step is simply being familiar with (and ideally enthusiastic about) cryptocurrency and the technology that powers it. Whether you've been investing personally, running your own mining rig, or soaking up information about how blockchain tech works, if you're going to land a job and dive into doing this 9-5, it's something you should be passionate about.Many companies won't require in-depth knowledge of crypto technology right off the bat; they know it's a new industry, so they may be willing to train talent on the job. That said, going in with as much knowledge as you can will only increase your chances. Taking a course like Princeton's Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies on Coursera is a good place to start.The second piece of the puzzle is simply having a background in the kind of work you want to do. If you want to be a blockchain developer, holding a ""normal"" developer role first will make you an attractive candidate. If you want to be a cryptocurrency project manager, have project management experience to show.Debating what kind of company you'd like to work at? According to AngelList, cryptocurrency startups are hiring in record numbers due to the massive amounts of funding they are acquiring. Another cool perk: if you end up working on an ICO, you'll probably receive some coins as a form of ""equity"" in the project in addition to your salary.Bitcoin was invented in 2008, which means it's coming up on its 10th anniversary next year. Since it doesn't seem to be going away, now might just be the perfect time to embrace the new career opportunities the crypto world has to offer."

Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]Sibling RivalryWhile Bitcoin has had a great year, breaking through several price levels and enjoying a meteoric rise, Litecoin has experienced an even stronger rally.Bitcoin has risen to as much as $17,364.56 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), representing a YTD gain of more than 1,600%.The digital currency has climbed even more by some measures, surpassing $18,300 on CoinMarketCap and rising more than 1,800% for the year.While these figures are impressive, generating countless headlines about Bitcoin's sharp climb and all the so-called ""Bitcoin Millionaires"" it has produced, Litecoin's YTD gain is more than twice that of its digital sibling.Sustained CorrelationBitcoin and Litecoin have both pushed higher this year, but this is certainly not he first time that the price of the two cryptocurrencies have risen in tandem.Earlier this year, a CoinDesk article described Bitcoin and Litecoin as ""birds of a feather,"" emphasizing that the two have frequently followed each other in their price movements.This development has led some to speculate that Litecoin is simply riding Bitcoin's coattails.Tim Enneking, managing director of Crypto Asset Management, recently stated that the former currency is ""absolutely cruising in BTC’s wake!"" He emphasized that while Bitcoin has been generating headlines, Litecoin has not announced any major updates as of late.Bitcoin HedgeWhile the aforementioned explanations may provide a better sense of why both Bitcoin and Litecoin have pushed higher this year, certain analysts have started offering different points of view.Some of them have asserted that Litecoin is a ""Bitcoin hedge,"" as the latter currency's network is dealing with a high level of unconfirmed transactions.Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst for eToro, was in this camp.""Litecoin is more scalable by nature and with bitcoins mempool currently flooded with unconfirmed transactions Litecoin is looking much better than BTC as a medium of exchange,"" he said. Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of digital currency platform CryptoCompare, also agreed that Litecoin is a Bitcoin hedge, stating that while the two are very similar, the altcoin has greater upside potential and less downside risk.Bitcoin AlternativeOther market observers took a different tack, describing Litecoin as an investment that has been receiving tailwinds as market participants flock to cryptocurrencies.Jeff Koyen, strategic advisor for 360 Blockchain, stated: ""All the attention paid to bitcoin in the past few weeks has served as a rising tide for all cryptocurrencies,"" he said.""But with bitcoin overbought at the moment and Ethereum relatively flat, they're turning to Litecoin -- a grande dame crypto with reliable underpinnings and enough similarities to bitcoin that they're comfortable buying.""Yazan Barghuthi, project lead at Jibrel Network, also weighed in on the situation: ""We're going to see a lot of value flow into alt-coins driven by portfolio diversification and realization of gains,"" he stated. ""In a speculative market, with new non-savvy entrants, the alt-coins that will do the best are the ones with highest accessibility. With LTC being provided across the main exchanges - i.e. is highly accessible to the average investor, it is no surprise to see a large chunk of the Bitcoin to Altcoin flow towards LTC.""Disclosure: I own some Bitcoin and Ether."

According to a press release, “MasterCard’s blockchain solution provides a new way for consumers, businesses and banks to transact and is key to the company’s strategy to provide payment solutions that meet every need of financial institutions and their end-customers.”MasterCard plans to implement the technology initially in the realm of business-to-business (B2B) transactions. The company believes its blockchain technology will help to address challenges involving speed, transparency and costs associated with cross-border payments.Blockchain is the technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Through blockchain technology companies can create an irrevocable digital ledger of transactions. “The technology can be integrated into business processes today, not even in the near future. And smart contracts can be created for literally any task: from smart homes and property insurance, to payment cards and logistics,” says Alexander Borodich, Founder of Universa, a blockchain technology company that enables its users to create smart contracts.Additionally, blockchain technology removes the need for a central authority to manage transactions, making these transactions highly secure and impenetrable for hackers.This technology has yet to be widely adopted, but it has already proven critical for businesses and even more so for the B2B realm since it often involves larger transactions. But that’s only one of the reasons why blockchain technology will be critical for B2B. Here are three more reasons.TransparencyBlockchain technology provides a high level of privacy by ensuring that transaction details are shared only amongst the participants involved in those transactions. With blockchain transactions there’s no need for a third party.But the level of privacy associated with blockchain payments has raised concerns among many in the finance community. However, in addition to the high level of privacy built into blockchain technology, there is also a high level of transparency. Blockchain systems include a fully auditable and valid ledger of transactions. This ledger is indelible and unforgeable. Entries into the ledger can only be made if they are validated by the system. And in order to change it, every single other blockchain in the system would also need to be changed. For this reason it’s impossible to delete a blockchain transaction in an attempt to hide it and fraudulent transactions cannot be added.This transparency eliminates the need for checks and balances that often take up important resources and manpower. With blockchain, payment transparency is automatic. As a result, some predict financial reporting costs could shrink by 70%. Data is also optimized and simplified, making it easier for companies to comply with regulations and meet demands for data. And some have even argued that due to the transparent nature of the technology, it should not be regulated.SavingsSmart contracts are a component of blockchain technology that is self-executing and stored on blockchains. Due to the decentralized nature of the system, no one controls these contracts and therefore every involved party can trust their validity. The code has the power to control and restrict how the data in the blockchain is accessed and used. Because of the high level of automation in this technology, those companies who have adopted blockchain have experienced huge cost savings.According to a report by Accenture, a global management consulting and professional services company, and McLagan, a compensation data and consulting firm, blockchain technology can reduce infrastructure costs. The analysis looked at the banking industry and found that “blockchain technology could reduce infrastructure costs for eight of the world’s 10 largest investment banks by an average of 30%, translating to $8B to $12B in annual cost savings for those banks.”In the B2B world, blockchain can also reduce the amount of fees that companies pay to financial institutions. In many B2B financial transactions there are fees at both ends for the parties involved, and sometimes there are fees at other stages of the transaction process. But with blockchain there is no third party through which transactions must travel, resulting in fewer fees.SpeedThe amount of automation in blockchain technology not only has implications for the bottom line of B2B companies, it also means these companies will be able to conduct their transactions faster. This is also true for business transactions conducted internally. Due to automation, employees would no longer have to wait to be paid the traditional two weeks after they have completed their work. Instead, they could be paid at the conclusions of every workweek, or even every day.And blockchain technology can also speed up cross-border transactions. Without blockchain technology, international transactions can take anywhere from days to weeks. But blockchain transactions can be done in a matter of seconds. Instead of having to pass through multiple parties, blockchain transactions only need to be confirmed through the blockchain system.Experts predict blockchain technology will only get faster as its scale increases. As more companies embrace this technology, B2B transactions at every level will run more smoothly. Essentially, the more widely blockchain is adopted, the better it will become. "

BlockTower’s hedge fund is backed by Union Square Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz, a court document says.A graduate of Stanford University, Miguel, 36, is a former Morgan Stanley proprietary trader who also worked at a hedge fund. BlockTower hired Miguel in August for what the hedge fund describes as a trading position. Miguel claims he was the cryptocurrency hedge fund’s portfolio manager. He was fired after a nearly six-week run.BlockTower sued Miguel in October, trying to get a Connecticut state judge to declare Miguel has no ownership in the hedge fund. In its 13-page complaint, BlockTower claims it fired Miguel because his refusal to communicate with his bosses during trading hours while he worked from his Los Angeles home presented a risk to investors.The hedge fund says Miguel was distracted by his side projects, including an advisory business he started with former football star Eric Dickerson, and that “with millions of dollars of assets under his control” and the authority to execute hedge fund trades by himself, BlockTower was concerned that Miguel “had gone ‘rogue.’”According to a 15-page complaint filed in California state court in Los Angeles, Miguel claims his former bosses are “a couple of ‘used car salesman’ selling a bill of goods.” He says the hedge fund was unprepared when it started trading in August with $6 million in assets.The way Miguel tells it, when he arrived at BlockTower’s office on August 10, it was essentially empty—no desk top computers, telephone lines or Internet connection. He says accounts set up with exchanges and Over The Counter desks were incomplete. For four days prior to the hedge fund launch, the BlockTower partners connected to the Internet through a hotspot connection that slowed down Internet transactions to a snail’s pace, the complaint says.“BlockTower’s office looked like the aftermath of a fire sale of a bankrupted business,” Miguel’s complaint says. “On the day before the launch of the BlockTower hedge fund, the promised cutting-edge trading and risk management tools were nonexistent and BlockTower did not have basic items such as position spreadsheets, real-time profit and loss statements and trade transactions.”The hedge fund’s launch was delayed because of a bureaucratic error that caused BlockTower to refund the investment of a small investor, the complaint says, and when BlockTower finally did open for trading on August 15, Miguel claims he had to wake up Paul in order to alert him to a Bitcoin trading opportunity, saving him from “incompetence.”Miguel’s complaint makes some nonsensical insinuations, suggesting for example that Paul wanted Miguel to engage in insider trading, even though it’s unclear how such a violation of securities law would apply to cryptocurrency trading. Miguel does not elaborate or give any details regarding this accusation.Miguel’s complaint boasts that Miguel was responsible for an “unprecedented 30% return in the month of August” and offers examples of his winning Bitcoin and Ethereum trading while deriding Paul as a blundering and “irresponsible” day trader.BlockTower, which intends to fight Miguel’s lawsuit vigorously, says Miguel’s accusations “are false, lack any basis in fact and are clearly designed to harass BlockTower.”Paul and Goetz locked Miguel out of is BlockTower email account and froze his ability to trade on behalf of the hedge fund in the middle of September. Miguel wants the hedge fund to acknowledge the 3.5% ownership stake he says he was orally promised by BlockTower’s founders. BlockTower claims Miguel was told he would be eligible to earn a 3.5% ownership stake and that the hedge fund offered him a generous severance deal, including sending him a check for his wages.In a statement, BlockTower says it “severed ties with Mr. Miguel in mid-September because of performance issues and concerns about his accountability and communication as a trader.” The hedge fund also says its “returns are up considerably since Mr. Miguel’s departure.”“I was brought on board because they have a combined zero years of hedge fund investing experience,” Miguel said in an interview. “When the launch happened they were overwhelmed.”"

this week, Kevin Harris from SumZero sat down with Johnny to discuss ...","Dec 1, 2017,11:20am EST","Johnny Steindorff  launched Focus Investments in 2014.  Focus was one of the first pure play crypto funds to launch, and was a first mover in what is now a burgeoning sector of active management.  Being such an early adopter, Focus faced significant headwinds launching and managing a fund based on an emergent asset class with no institutional backing.  However, their strategy proved extremely prescient, and Focus aggressively took advantage of the several thousand percent growth of the crypto sector into a ~$300B+ asset class.","Through critical early investments not just in Bitcoin, but Ethereum, Qtum, EOS, and several other now high profile digit assets and companies, Steindorff's first fund significantly outperformed Bitcoin's 1000%+ gain from 2014 to date.  He and several other prominent early crypto investors and entrepreneurs have now partnered to launch Distributed Global, one of the most pedigreed crypto / digital asset funds in existence.   With Bitcoin finally exploding past and oscillating around the $10k mark this week, Kevin Harris from SumZero sat down with Johnny to discuss Bitcoin, crypto funds, and the future of blockchain technology.Justin TALLIS / AFP PHOTO / Getty ImagesKevin Harris: How did you come to launch Distributed Global?  What brought you into the crypto space? Johnny Steindorff: Like many of us in the crypto digital-asset space I was roped in through an overzealous friend who’d fallen down the bitcoin rabbit hole. I’d had prior exposure to bitcoin from friends or acquaintances but those initial discussions were superficial and centered around price, profits, losses and trading. This conversation was different, it was centered around the technology, philosophy and the revolutionary implications of a digital, trust-less currency and decentralization. That conversation would become the starting point of my ever-growing obsession with digital-assets. Shortly after I made my first investment, I became an active participant in a small and extremely passionate community of bitcoin enthusiasts. It became increasingly obvious to me how distributed ledger technology would become the primary catalyst for the disintermediation of trusted third parties while simultaneously birthing an entirely new asset class.The inspiration behind Distributed Global dates back to 2013 when my thesis shifted around how this space would impact the world and where value would ultimately be captured, in digital assets not traditional equity in private companies. This catalyzed a partnership with fellow enthusiast and investor, Tucker Waterman and together we launched one of the first digital-asset funds, Focus Investments, with a thesis on capturing value by investing in the greatest digital asset backed protocols. We believed then and continue to believe today that most industries will inevitably be disrupted by distributed ledger technologies and decentralized digital-asset backed protocols.We believe that this is the first time in history that decentralization is being driven by capitalism via digital token incentive structures which are built into this next generation of distributed protocols. Our ultimate goal is to help these projects become successful and provide massive global utility at a scale greater than the internet. Harris: What have been the biggest challenges to managing a fund focused on crypto-based assets?  What advice do you have for investors interested in the space? Steindorff: We launched our first fund, Focus Investments in 2014, so we were one of the first crypto funds in existence. This was a much more challenging time to educate investors on the market opportunity because the asset class hadn’t had enough time to prove itself. Bitcoin had been in the news, but not always for the right reasons. Convincing traditional investors of the value of seeding the next generation of tokenized, open source and decentralized protocols was pretty far out there at the time. But, the exercise of educating traditional investors on this emerging digital asset class helped us refine our thesis and those early investors have become some of our biggest advocates. Things have changed quite a bit since then. There is now quite a strong tailwind for the space, and investors have done much more diligence and reading on the space before we meet. Another challenge we encountered at our early stages was identifying and empowering service providers to learn and cater to this burgeoning space. Legal counsel, administrators and auditors did not yet understand how to work successfully with a crypto fund so there was a learning curve for everyone. For investors interested in diversifying into this space I recommend a simple strategy. First, invest only what you are willing to lose. For most this is <1% of their portfolio. Second, spend a massive amount of time understanding the space and the particular asset you are buying before making the purchase. We don’t recommend trading in and out of these assets, so it’s best if you have a strong thesis that can govern your investment decisions. This will not only help accelerate the learning process but will help create a healthier market with a better informed investor base.Harris: Your fund is split between emerging and established protocols - could you please walk us through your fund’s strategy / philosophy, particularly as it relates to the emergence of new coins/tokens through forks and ICOs? Steindorff: Distributed Global Fund II is a long-only, stage agnostic investor in protocols. We invest in the tokens of established protocols and in the seed and pre-ICO rounds of early stage protocols. In either case, we look for protocols that are well positioned to capture market share from centralized incumbents. The protocols we invest in share three common traits: they are tokenized, open source and decentralized. We believe protocols with these characteristics represent a paradigm shift in how human economic behavior is organized and incentivized. This shift has the potential to fundamentally alter many of the world’s largest industries, and create investment opportunities that are desirable for thoughtful, long-term investors. It is important to note that we don’t employ leverage and we seek to be tax efficient, our investors are looking for broad exposure to this new digital asset class while reducing taxable events, transaction costs and exposure to unnecessary risks. While we invest at every stage, we believe the best returns lie at the earliest stage, where deal flow is critical. To be successful at an early stage we believe a fund needs to be able to add value to those teams via feedback on their protocol design, access to a broader pool of investors, and help attracting partnerships and engineers. We believe our disciplined long-term investment approach combined with our attractiveness to early protocol development teams will be a part of our unfair advantage.We believe innovation in open source protocols will be faster and more like an evolutionary system, as developers fork, combine and extend protocol code with minimal friction. In fact, we believe forking will be continuous and native to this process and believe it is a net positive for the industry, though it does introduce complexities for investors.Harris: Would you walk us through your take on the current state of the crypto market and active management of crypto assets?Steindorff: We believe that we’re still in the early stages of adoption of decentralized protocols. The technology itself is evolving quickly and most of the technology is aimed at developers, not at end users. However, the run up in prices has attracted more interest in the space. This is a feature, not a bug. It is part of how tokenized protocols bootstrap by levering off of interest from investors, attracting new developers, and ultimately driving more adoption. There have been a lot of new digital asset fund launches in 2017, but still only a couple of funds with more than $10m under management and even fewer with more than $100m under management. Flows into actively managed digital asset funds were strongest in the UHNW, family office and VC channel in 2017. We believe 2018 will mark the beginning of Wall Street and institutional capital entering the digital asset market. You’ll see endowments and global macro managers enter the market in a big way. You’ll see some sovereign wealth funds look to get exposure. That said, it is important to level-set. This is a still a tiny market. It’s a $300 billion market today, so it still has a ways to go before hitting mainstream.Harris: What are your takeaways from your experience so far as one of the first actively managed crypto funds?  What general investing advice would you give 2013 you?Steindorff: Advice I would have loved in 2013: trust your instincts, buy more and hold. There is some hindsight bias in this, but our thesis has generally played out.Harris: Would you walk us through your early stage investment in ETH in 2015?  What was your base case for its performance?  By what degree has it outperformed your predictions? Steindorff: In 2014 my business partner, Tucker Waterman and I drove to San Francisco to attend Coin Congress. The conference was primarily dominated by Bitcoin maximalists, a colloquial term for those who believed bitcoin would be the only successful blockchain based digital-asset. Simultaneously, there was a small minority group of about a dozen of us with a brewing excitement about the prospect of BTC 2.0. All 12 of us grabbed lunch during the conference and discussed the prospect of alternative digital-asset backed protocols leveraging blockchain technology to establish use cases beyond a medium of exchange, unit of account or store of value. Among these fringe thinkers was Ethereum founder, Vitalik Buterin.That Coin Congress event coincided with the Ethereum presale so everything came together quite nicely. After participating in the pre sale we diligently tracked the project and saw many signals indicative of tremendous growth potential ahead. Noteworthy metrics included node count/growth, rate of unique transactions and active wallet growth, accelerated community growth, developer interest/participation and institutional partnerships. We continued to invest in the single digits.Even now, as ethereum flirts with a $500 price point and a ~$46B market cap, we believe that if Ethereum becomes the dominant smart contract protocol its market cap will be in excess of a trillion dollars. There are a lot of things that need to take place in the meantime to make this a reality, specifically around scalability but the potential is certainly real given the breadth and scope of its disruptive technology.Harris:  On a more macro level, has the exponential growth of the crypto sector exceeded your expectations?  Steindorff: The market’s growth has accelerated much faster than I initially anticipated. However, I believe the market is still being driven by 99% retail investors. As the space matures, becomes recognized as a unique, uncorrelated asset class and institutional investors find investment vehicles they feel confident in we’ll see an influx of new money into the space. Witnessing the birth of an entirely new asset class which can provide a hedge against economic downturn is a once in a lifetime opportunity and institutional investors won’t continue to sit on the sidelines.Harris: Good or bad, which specific crypto assets’ performance have most surprised you?Steindorff: Litecoin. LTC taught us a very valuable lesson about the strength of a brand and its corresponding community. We missed the boat on LTC early on because we felt that its use case overlapped too heavily with BTC. It was hard to imagine that LTC could gain any significant market share from its dominant predecessor but despite our beliefs, Litecoin’s brand and community have driven it to become a top 10 cryptocurrency with a lot of volume and liquidity. The lesson here was that the power of a trusted brand and a devoted community has the ability to outweigh innovative tech. Harris: What do you think the most interesting ICO’s on the horizon are?  What emerging coins do you think have the highest upside?Steindorff: QTUM is an emerging smart-contract platform with a strong team and promising future. You can think of QTUM as a bitcoin/ethereum hybrid in the sense that the platform enables smart contracts to be built atop bitcoin’s UTXO blockchain. This is an important technological achievement as it enables mobile and IoT compatibility for smart contract backed decentralized applications, a feature not currently available with Ethereum. Mobile compatibility will accelerate the proliferation of smart-contract adoption among businesses while simultaneously broadening its use case as a digital currency via mobile friendly QTUM wallets. Additionally, QTUM has shifted away from the Proof of Work consensus model (Bitcoin/Ethereum) and instead leverages the Proof of Stake model which rewards QTUM token owners for confirming transactions via “staking” instead of “mining.” Without getting into too many details this method is both more environmentally friendly and less prohibitive for individuals to participate than the Proof of Work method.  Since launching in early 2017 QTUM has garnered a massive community throughout the Asia-Pacific and the United States. We believe the QTUM team is unrivalled in Asia and their protocol stack has the potential to become the dominant Smart Contract platform of Asia. WAX (World Asset Exchange) is an emerging project with a bright future. Developed by the founders of OPSkins, the leading marketplace for virtual video game assets. The WAX team has built the first decentralized exchange for gamers to trade digital-assets for nominal fees on a trusted platform. There’s a massive market for this platform considering there are over 400 million gamers who purchase more than $50B in digital goods every year. WAX is one of the few emerging projects with a built-in use case and existing user base which already has experience using cryptocurrencies to purchase digital assets. Basecoin is a stable coin (not volatile cryptocurrency) whose money supply algorithmically contracts and expands based on market demand and a decentralized Consumer Price Index.  What this means in english is that this token is effectively managed by a robot central bank free from the political interference that real central banks face.  We still have not come across a stable coin that can act as an everyday usable cryptocurrency, but doesn’t wind up in fiascos involving the legality of the token (see Tether articles).  If the project works as intentioned, it could change modern currency markets.  One could reasonably pay wages in basecoin, or use basecoin to more effectively trade digital assets, but the best use case of the basecoin would be for the digital currency to alleviate the inflation madness occurring in countries like Venezuela or Zimbabwe.  Harris: What are the biggest problems you think are solvable through tokenization or creative uses of blockchain technology? Steindorff: The most significant and noticeable disruption will stem from the disintermediation of trusted third parties. Decentralized smart contracts will have far reaching implications beyond the financial segment and will eliminate the need for third parties in most industries including insurance, energy, real estate, medical, travel, and governance. In theory, entire cities, states or countries could run autonomously via programmable, trustless smart contracts, but in reality that future is a ways off until we solve some of the scaling and security challenges.Harris: Could you walk us through your process for valuing a cryptocurrency?  How similar is this to valuing a traditional security?  What metrics have you found to be most predictive of future performance?Steindorff: Investment assessments for established and emerging projects are conducted to ensure each project’s team and underlying technology fit within the guidelines of our general thesis and pass our initial set of criteria to weed out superficial, low growth and fraudulent offerings. Upon approval, our researchers collect, review and analyze all relative qualitative and quantitative data pertaining to the project’s team, thesis, code, security, vision, momentum, partners, roadmap, operations, structure, geographics, cryptography, incentive design, applications, utility, compliance, industry specifics, token mechanics, economics, competition and growth potential. You have to remember there is no P&L, there is no way to calculate a present value of future cash flows for a protocol. Since many of these projects are essentially developer tools at this point we think some of the strongest signals come from tracking engagement and involvement on Github and the strength and passion of the developer community around a project.We systematically track each of our investments on an ongoing basis to evaluate performance relative to our investment thesis. Key metrics used to quantify performance are unique to each project but generally cover social community growth, developer community growth, network growth, roadmap execution, security and the competitive environment.Harris: If you were building a five year blind trust of crypto assets, what would you put in it?  How would you expect it to have performed come 2022? This is how we think about Distributed Global Fund II. We currently hold fewer than 20 positions. We expect that even with only 20 positions a number of them will not exist in 2022. You can be buy and hold in this marketplace, but you can’t be buy and go to sleep. The market moves too fast, and because it’s open source a differentiating function of one coin can quickly be copied and integrating into others. Harris: Where do you see the crypto sector in five to ten years?  The digital assets market will either be 0 or a multi-trillion dollar space. We obviously believe the latter. Highly disruptive technologies have always experienced tremendous challenges early on. Most people are unaware that even technologies such as the automobile and the lightbulb were initially met with massive resistance. Initially, technological breakthroughs do not have the right infrastructure in place to showcase their true potential. This will take time, but if it’s truly transformative the infrastructure will eventually develop, and the new technology will be accepted. We think the truly extraordinary returns will come earlier in the cycle from investors willing to take the extra risk. In my opinion we’ll look back on this day like it was mid-1990’s internet, we had the vision, but the true winners had not distinguished themselves yet. For more buyside focused content from SumZero, follow the link here"

There is taxable income or loss on all coin transactions, including coin-to-currency trades, coin-to-coin trades, receipt of coin in a hard fork or split transaction, purchases of goods or services using a coin, and mining income. In this post, I show you how to capture the proper income amount on all coin transactions.","Capital gains and lossesSome coin deals naturally generate taxable income, including coin-to-currency trades and mining income. For example, Bitcoin sold for U.S. dollars is a noticeable capital gain or loss reportable on Form 8949. Or, when a coin miner receives a coin for his work, he naturally recognizes revenue based on the value of the coin he received.Imputed incomeThe big problem for the IRS is that most other coin transactions are not evident for tax reporting, including coin-to-coin trades, hard fork transactions, and using a coin to purchase goods and services. The coin investor must “impute” a sales transaction to report a capital gain or loss on coin-to-coin trades and using a coin for purchases of items. Many coin investors and their accountants overlook or mishandle this reporting and underpay the IRS.Coin is intangible property, not moneyOverlooked income has to do with the fact that the IRS labeled coin “intangible property.” Coin users may call it “digital money,” but it’s not money. That’s the critical difference: Each use of money is not a taxable event. Imagine having to report a capital gain or loss every time you purchased an item or asset with cash or a credit card. That would be ridiculous.Coin-to-currency sales are capital gains and lossesMost taxpayers comprehend that if they purchased Bitcoin in 2016 for $10,000 and sold all of it in 2017 for $30,000, they should report a capital gain of $20,000 on their 2017 tax return form 8949. If the investor held the coin position for one year or less, it’s considered a short-term capital gain taxed at ordinary tax rates (up to 39.6% for 2017). If the position was held for more than one year, the long-term capital gain rate (up to 20% for 2017) applies.Coin-to-coin trades don’t qualify for deferral of income Many taxpayers and preparers delay capital gains income on coin-to-coin trades by inappropriately classifying them as a Section 1031 “like-kind exchange,” where they may defer income to the replacement position’s cost basis.I do not think coin-to-coin trades qualify for Section 1031 transactions as they fail the two primary requirements. First, Bitcoin does not qualify as like-kind property with another coin. Second, coin-to-coin trades primarily executed on exchanges are not “direct two-party exchanges” or “multi-party exchanges using a qualified intermediary.” (See Cryptocurrency Traders Risk IRS Trouble With Like-Kind Exchanges.)Coin splits in hard forks are taxable incomeBitcoin had a hard fork in its blockchain on Aug. 1, 2017, dividing into two separate coins, Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Cash. Each holder of a Bitcoin unit was entitled to arrange receipt of a unit of Bitcoin Cash.Some Bitcoin holders did not gain immediate access to be able to sell Bitcoin Cash so they may feel it’s okay to defer income on the fork transaction until they gain such access. For example, the most significant U.S.-based coin exchange, Coinbase, did not initially support Bitcoin Cash. Before the fork date, Coinbase informed its customers how to arrange receipt of Bitcoin Cash outside of Coinbase. For this reason, the IRS could argue the holder did, in fact, have “constructive receipt of income.”A Wall Street Journal article, Bitcoin’s Civil War: What You Need to Know, stated the initial fair market value of Bitcoin Cash on Aug. 1, 2017, was $266 per unit. Taxpayers should report $266 per unit or another price that they established, as “Other Income” or as a capital gain on Form 8949. (See How To Report Bitcoin Cash And Avoid IRS Trouble.)Not every hard fork coin transaction should be treated the same. A very successful coin trader told me it would be more equitable to value new coin received in hard fork transactions with zero cost basis. He pointed out that hard forks are uncontrollable, contentious and they frequently happen, that their initial fair market value varies significantly across coin exchanges, the new coin may not even trade for several days, and that each new coin acts differently with the original coin. For these reasons, he said it’s nearly impossible to establish a balanced formula and value for reporting income on the new coin. Even Bitcoin Cash had a wide-ranging initial trading price on exchanges.On Oct. 24, 2017, Bitcoin had another hard fork, splitting off Bitcoin Gold. There are more than 4,000 coins; many were created in hard fork transactions.Example: Purchasing goods and services with coinOn Jan. 1, 2017, Joe bought 100 Bitcoins at a price of $998 each, for a total cost basis of $99,800. On June 1, 2017, when the price of a Bitcoin unit was $2,452, Joe used one Bitcoin to purchase a new computer for an invoice price of $2,452.Without realizing it, Joe triggered a reportable short-term capital gain on his 2017 Form 8949. The sales proceeds are $2,452, representing the fair market value of the one bitcoin he used to purchase the computer. His cost basis for that one Bitcoin unit used is $998, so his net short-term capital gain is $1,454. If Joe uses the computer in his business, he will deduct $2,452 as an expense.The IRS is taking action against coin exchanges and investorsThe IRS was late in recognizing a coin “tax gap,” and it recently commenced an aggressive campaign to catch coin investors with under-reported income.The IRS successfully served a John Doe summons (the roughest kind) on Coinbase, and we are awaiting the results of its investigation. You should respect the tax rules for all types of coin transactions to avoid an IRS exam, which could lead to an assessment of back taxes, interest expenses, and penalties. Accuracy-related penalties include a negligence penalty of 20% and a substantial understatement penalty of 20% if you understate your income by 10% or more.In March 2014, the IRS issued long-awaited guidance (IRS Notice 2014-21) declaring coin “intangible property” and addressing some other tax questions. But, many issues remain uncertain including whether coin-to-coin trades may qualify for a Section 1031 like-kind exchange, how and when to report hard fork coin transactions, how and when to select permissible accounting methods, whether wash sale losses on securities apply to coin, and more.We cannot hold tax return filings waiting for new IRS guidance, which may not come at all.  Our position is that coin traders cannot use Section 1031 on coin-to-coin trades executed on coin exchanges. Hard fork income is often taxable income when the new coin is received. Section 1091 wash sale loss rules and Section 475 MTM do not apply to coin because it’s not a security. Coin traders should select a permissible accounting method in advance of the year or contemporaneously with the trade — not after the fact.In my next post, Coin Traders Should Consider These Two Tax Accounting Solutions, I discuss coin accounting solutions and review two leading programs. Contact me with questions.

(Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images),"In the wild, wild west of cryptocurrency, anything goes and volatility prevails. It is what makes things so thrilling. Yet even the most venturesome of cowboys crave stability from time to time. Without some semblance of it, any initial excitement quickly turns into a lurking fear, a constant looking over the shoulders.Enter stablecoins, or coins that have value stable in fiat or other real-world assets. One attempt is Tether, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, but it was compromised recently. DAI, an asset backed by a basket of digital currencies, is another try but it is not yet ready for public utility due to its complex structure -- even though it has been under development for three years.As regulation struggles to keep up in the blockchain space, state-issued stablecoins have become an increasingly important means of curbing some of this volatility.Curbing the volatilityA state-issued stablecoin is an encrypted digital asset whose value is pegged 1:1 to a country’s fiat currency. Such an asset would be able to withstand the unrestrained volatility of cryptocurrencies today. Bitcoin, whose value has been on the inexorable rise, is still subject to large price fluctuations and this unpredictability makes it an unreliable store of value. Tokenizing local currency on the blockchain will fill this gap and restore market confidence, all while providing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies time to mature and stabilize. A stablecoin will also expedite the process of blockchain adoption, since it allows traders, merchants and consumers to complete transactions using a currency that is strong, steady and familiar to them.A national stablecoin will also enable a government to monitor transactions, thereby curbing tax evasion and money laundering activities.More on Forbes: Why Blockchain Is Real And Bitcoin Is A MirageIs this antithetical to the initial ideals of cryptocurrency and trustless decentralization? Perhaps. But it is one thing to have small, private payments using virtual currencies, and another to eliminate central-bank-issued money altogether and have corporation-scale transactions that are fully anonymous. The social costs of financial crimes would be too high and the global economy as we know it might go into meltdown.Moreover, even if those issues can be addressed, full decentralization takes time; it is probably naïve to expect a fiat world to transform into a crypto one overnight. State-issued digital dollars would serve as the bridge for the fiat and crypto world, allowing for harmonious co-existence and mutual infrastructural support in the interim. Whether we can transition fully to a new world economy with just cryptocurrency remains to be seen. Whether that is desirable, remains to be fought over.State efforts to issue digital dollars are already underway: Russia is hoping to launch its very own CryptoRuble; Kyrgyzstan plans to create its own cryptocurrency backed with gold; the Swedish central bank has proposed an e-Krona; and China is arguably ahead of the pack with its tests to build a domestic cryptocurrency that will exist alongside the yuan.Singapore might have the most to gainA tourist boat travels past the city skyline in Singapore, on Wednesday, July 12, 2017.... [+] (Photographer: Nicky Loh/Bloomberg)Singapore is also in the race. In 2016, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced the launch of Project Ubin, a payment system prototype on the Ethereum platform aimed at enabling local inter-bank transactions using a tokenized Singaporean dollar. Major financial institutions including DBS Bank, UOB Bank, OCBC Bank and technology companies participated in the project. Project Ubin has since concluded two successful phases and launched software prototypes that transfer funds efficiently, protect transaction privacy, and mitigate the risks of a single point of failure. The insights gained from these two phases will pave the way for further development of the digital SGD (e.g. scaling and cross-border payments).More on Forbes: Putting Singapore's Dollar On Blockchain May Prove It's The Most Crypto Friendly Place On EarthOne can only speculate where Singapore currently stands relative to other countries in the scramble to launch a national stablecoin, but the larger point is this: It must emerge as the victor in this race to become the smart financial center it wants to be.It must channel more resources into creating a roaring blockchain hub, one that will deliver economies of scale and attract even more developer talent, creating a positive feedback loop of growth. Successfully launching its own stablecoin will allow the nation-state to sustain its first-mover advantage, enhance financial security, and develop the infrastructure for a thriving blockchain ecosystem, all of which will lead to greater adoption, fintech dominance and economic prosperity."

It's been a mostly solid, albeit unspectacular stock in my portfolio, despite the fact that its year to date performance is significantly trailing its broader index.On a fundamental level, Disney passes my litmus test for an investment. Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, do not. Despite that, I'm still tempted to make a calculated play on cryptos and their potential long-term future after careful consideration and due diligence.I understand that there's a basic concept of supply and demand at work here that's driving prices so high. There will only be 21 million Bitcoins mined and afterwards, no more will be added to the circulation.But I can't pay my rent using Bitcoin or buy health insurance with Ethereum (not yet, at least). There's a high risk of fraud, market manipulation and account hacking. The volatility of the crypto market is enough to make a professional rollercoaster tester queasy.Still, the money keeps pouring in and prices continue to rise. CNBC spends half the trading day discussing the markets and the rest of the time talking about Bitcoin.A company called Longfin announced it was buying a blockchain company and within two days, Longfin's stock price went from $5 a share to over $140. The CEO of Longfin appeared on CNBC FastMoney and, after being worked up into a frenzy, said that his company's $4 billion gain in market capitalization wasn't justified. Instead of cratering the next day, Longfin stock was higher for a bit before closing down over 5%.Have we all lost our collective minds? Haven't we learned from past mistakes? The dot-com and real estate bubbles should have taught us to tread carefully and to spend considerable time analyzing an investment opportunity.Temptation is a powerful force, however. Far too many people are opening Coinbase accounts with dollar signs in their eyes and not enough knowledge in their heads. Their hairdresser or Uber driver told them about Bitcoin and now they want in on the action.A 1,400% gain over the span of a year is astronomical compared to Disney's relatively lackluster 8.84% total return. But as Forbes writer Antoine Gara argued, it's OK to ignore Bitcoin. Sound investment principles should continue to reward steadfast investors over the long-term, and no one knows what fate will befall crypto-keepers.The dark side continues to lurk in the shadows, calling me to join the party. I'm holding steady with my traditional investments, resisting temptation and speculation — for now."

You can't spend it very easily.""That's what Ray Dalio, founder of mega hedge fund Bridgewater, had to say about crypto last month. He went on to say:""It's not an effective storehold of wealth because it has volatility to it, unlike gold [...] Bitcoin is a highly speculative market. Bitcoin is a bubble.""These remarks (as well as a recent barrage on the topic by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon) got me excited.Excited because the very people who have built modern “Big Money” don't understand the power that crypto is unleashing around the world. What’s being built isn’t a new area of finance—it’s an entirely new parallel replacement. So Ray, Jamie—these are the highlights of crypto that opened my eyes to what may be coming. And now I can hardly look away.Some ground rules:1. What the internet is for information, blockchain tech is for transactions.This is important. The Internet is, at it’s core, a series of protocols that allow people—who have no prior relationship—to move data back and forth. This goes from low-level things like semi-structured text all the way to streaming 360-degree video. But as soon as the smallest snippet of text was transferred, everything else could follow.What the internet also did—that wasn’t really possible in the previous world of proprietary machine data connections—was provide smart linkage between content. Example primitives here include embedding a photo and linking to a different web page.How does this apply to transactions?Bitcoin’s key “academic” revelation was the first practical solution to a long-standing (since 1982) problem—called the Byzantine Generals Problem.This problem is as follows:Several armies surround a castle they are going to attack. Each army faction is led by a general. However, they must all attack simultaneously to ensure success. It doesn’t matter what time they attack, so long as they agree.Since they are spread out, it makes communication unreliable. If two attack times were proposed, some generals might hear a different one first. And worse, some of the generals are traitors, and may relay an incorrect message (wrong attack time or similar) to the other generals.So how can the generals ensure a coordinated attack?In Satoshi's (the pseudonymous founder of Bitcoin) own words:They use a proof-of-work chain to solve the problem. Once each general receives whatever attack time he hears first, he sets his computer to solve an extremely difficult proof-of-work problem that includes the attack time in its hash. The proof-of-work is so difficult, it's expected to take 10 minutes of them all working at once before one of them finds a solution. Once one of the generals finds a proof-of-work, he broadcasts it to the network, and everyone changes their current proof-of-work computation to include that proof-of-work in the hash they're working on. If anyone was working on a different attack time, they switch to this one, because its proof-of-work chain is now longer.After two hours, one attack time should be hashed by a chain of 12 proofs-of-work. Every general, just by verifying the difficulty of the proof-of-work chain, can estimate how much parallel CPU power per hour was expended on it and see that it must have required the majority of the computers to produce that much proof-of-work in the allotted time. They had to all have seen it because the proof-of-work is proof that they worked on it. If the CPU power exhibited by the proof-of-work chain is sufficient to crack the password, they can safely attack at the agreed time.If you are new to crypto: a “hash” is basically a fingerprint—a secure, repeatable reduction of information. Imagine I send you a file via an insecure channel. Someone could tamper with the file. But if I’ve told you (offline, or another secure channel) what the “hash” is, then you can check to make sure the file arrived without tampering.With the solution for the Byzantine Generals in hand, “Money” as we know it is the easy demonstration app to build—akin to transferring plain text between computers in Internet terms. Bitcoin may not be the platform that captures much of the innovation yet to come, but it’s clearly benefitting from the network effects of being the first real-world deployment that demonstrates the power of this technology.2. Never before could anyone build a monetary “country.”Our locally-issued currency (“fiat” for short) is a relatively fragile, modern invention. We don't have to look very far into history to see how this method may well be ill suited for our future.Consider the Bretton Woods Agreement — named for international conference held in a New Hampshire town of the same name in 1944, at the end of WWII. In short, the agreement was that countries may set their own interest rates, so long as they artificially constrained and fixed exchange rates between each country.Why? The goal was for countries to have sufficient yield in capital to rebuild war-torn Europe. If currencies were to be fluid, all the capital would go to the economy with the highest real yields (and likely be unavailable for lower-return, but still necessary projects.) The IMF and World Bank were established to finance shortfalls across member countries.But differences in inflation rates went on to rip this agreement apart by the beginning of the 1970s. Even at the size of nations, it's hard to keep anything static in markets. Even after further recalibration, the subsequent floating exchange rates put in place led to rampant inflation in the ‘70s.In our modern age—with unlimited information and entirely geographically dispersed organizations—why would any organization tie themselves to their geographically-proximate neighbors? Ask anyone who has managed payrolls across currencies: it's an entirely different risk.Now with crypto, anyone—whether a company, a protocol, a network (think EBay buyers and sellers)—can create their own monetary country. This new country's value, relative to more-commonly-traded-counterparts, may experience significant amounts of volatility.It doesn't matter that Bitcoin's transactions aren't scalable: you don't have to carry only one physical currency to the global markets.It doesn't matter that it's highly volatile, relative to fiat currency: you will seamlessly be able to convert value to the economic “country” where you need to spend it. Some of these countries (maybe even Bitcoin itself) will eventually become incredibly stable. (Or maybe a monetary country will emerge that provides a simple future yield contract, with desired stability characteristics.)Some of these “new countries” may badly draw their own borders and be unsustainable or disastrous. Existing nations may be hostile—and attempt to seize or shut down smaller crypto countries. As the Bitcoin project itself has shown—internal politics and inability to move quickly might be huge challenges within these projects. Regardless of an individual ecosystem’s success or failure, this is a new power we've never seen or experienced at scale.3. It's a currency. It's access to the network. And it's equity in the project.With the “real” rates (interest minus inflation) stuck at nearly zero for so long, there's just too much money seeking return. I've written before about the ICO phenomenon and the incredible volume (relative to VC as a whole) that is rushing into the system.At the core: the flexibility of the token system is allowing market demand for non-zero interest returns to seep into new technology projects.So what’s an ICO? Answer: it totally depends.The closest parallel I've been able to find is the earliest days of stocks in the industrial era. This was a time before anything was standardized. No Sarbanes-Oxley. No agreement over what “Vanilla” terms meant.If we look back to the Robber Barons for inspiration (great biography on subject—discovered via Larry Ellison's recommendation), there was a simple playbook for profit:Take over a small company to be able to have control to issue convertible debt. Drive up the price with affiliates. Convert debt you've issued into now-more-valuable equity. Seize control of operations or dump new equity on the market (depending on your plans). Corporate governance was such a mess—so early that there was no real controls over who, when, and how more stock could come onto the marketThis brings us back to ICOs. There are no standards yet. No rules. Now, with the magic of “programmable money.” So an issuer can make up all the rules to their liking.One could sell you stock/token with a 10 year lockup. Then use the price you paid to mark it up for people with a shorter lockup. And issue new stock/tokens all the way, dumping into the market before you have liquidity.One could carefully distribute 85% of all tokens ever to be made to many people who now have incentive to help build, populate, and use a network.One could raise a bunch of speculative money for a network that does not yet exist. See failed Kickstarters in early days for a view into this.All of these might be called ICOs. (And the SEC certainly has opinions that are still early in being formed and/or made public.)When built and structured correctly, ICOs may accelerate technology development faster than has ever been possible—attracting investors, ecosystem contributors, and future customers all at once. Skin in the game matters. As the saying goes “no conflict, no interest.""4. Speculation is fundamentally more important than ever.Many folks are concerned about the amount of speculative capital flooding into crypto projects. While I question is there is a sufficient supply of to-be-successful projects to absorb the total amount of capital seeking access, I don't question the role of speculation.Speculation is actually more important than ever before in crypto.To expand on this point a bit - speculation is a key driver of the virtuous cycle / endogenous loop that creates network effects for crypto.This loop is as follows:Crypto engineers and entrepreneurs will build new monetary countries—some with higher returns than you can find anywhere else—and attract the capital and builders to their networks. Crypto will flow into every sector of the economy.Just as we trade and speculate on energy and food (as well as most other things that make modern life possible), expect speculation to attract significant risk capital to build these new specialized monetary countries. Wall Street firms (or their successors) may one day trade all kinds of things we'd never imagined. (Compute power, storage, bandwidth are a few likely early categories.)It's early. It's chaotic. It's far from the stable. There's probably a short-term correction coming. But the risk capital keeps rushing into the ecosystem.The most important applications may look like nothing we can even imagine here, today in 2017.5. Crypto technology may be more destabilizing to governments than the Internet ever could beThe Internet, while allowing anyone to publish and have a voice, still was constructed in a centralized fashion. Centralization in the telco companies that laid the fiber to carry the writing. Centralization around the platforms to find, discover, and follow writing (and its authors).When augment a network with the ability to transfer economic value, much of this centralization can be stripped away. Just look to the current events in the Catalan region of Spain—where the people are using censorship-resistant peer-to-peer software to organize a referendum for its independence.In Silicon Valley, it's well known that future power can come from uncertain and unlikely places. Now, we will watch this dynamic play on the world stage—and it may topple countries and empires along the way.--Disclosure: I invest (both personally and through Founder Collective) in crypto assets and startups. "

The viral success of applications like Etheremon and ...","Dec 22, 2017,08:36am EST",(ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/Getty Images),"Etheremon was just released and it’s already making waves across the crypto community. The game allows you to capture monsters and put them to battle. In less than 24 hours, there have been over 19,000 transactions.This game clogged up the Ethereum network, slowed down transactions, and caused transaction fees to go through the roof. If crypto assets truly want to move from being a speculative asset to a technology used in our day to day lives, the following five issues need to be addressed: scalability, interoperability, privacy, governance, regulations.ScalabilityEthereum currently handles 800k transactions per day, while Bitcoin is nearing 500k. The viral success of applications like Etheremon and CryptoKitties resulted in users complaining that their transactions weren’t being processed, or had to pay a much higher transaction fee. The current transaction limit for Ethereum stands at 15 transactions per second.Etheremon is a decentralized application built on the Ethereum network. It simulates a world of... [+] Ether monsters (Etheremon) where you can capture, evolve an Etheremon to defeat others. You catch an Etheremon using your Ether and earn Ether back whenever the same kind of Etheremon is caught by other.The ecosystem is exploring options to deal with this bottleneck. The Raiden network will allow transactions to be handled off-chain at higher speeds. Some of the scaling options for ICOs this year hoping to run their dApps (decentralized applications) on the Ethereum platform may be too late.Ted Livingston, CEO of mobile messaging startup Kik, which had an ICO for its Kin token network earlier this year stated they would abandon Ethereum for a different blockchain technology. He went as far as to call Ethereum the dial-up era of cryptocurrency.The most significant upgrade planned to address scalability for Ethereum is a technology called ""sharding""-- a technique which would split the network up into smaller pieces called ""shards"" to massively improve transaction speeds. Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum has however stated sharding for Ethereum may be three to five years out.Enter a new Singapore based blockchain startup called Zilliqa. This new blockchain will be designed with sharding in mind from the get-go. Test results show the network hitting 2,400 transactions per second (TX/S) with ambitions to hit Visa level throughputs of 4,000 TX/S. The team has a partnership with multinational ad agency Mindshare, who want to experiment with the technology.If the existing top dogs such as Bitcoin and Ethereum can’t find a solution to scaling issues, we will likely see more money flow into projects like these. InteroperabilityCoin Market Cap currently counts 1,360 different cryptocurrencies in existence. As the ecosystem expands, so does the need for these blockchains to be able to communicate with each other. A number of blockchains launched this year, with interoperability being the key issue they want to solve. Three of these projects (ICON, AION and Wanchain) saw the need for co-operation in the crypto scene and founded the Interoperability Alliance. This alliance will focus on the common goal of connecting blockchain protocols. ICON aims to interconnect individual blockchains without any extra intermediaries. They will be supported by 5 leading South Korean consortiums, including securities, banks, universities, hospitals and insurance companies.AION strives to become the common protocol these blockchain use and they signed a deal with defense contractor Moog.Wanchain will be a distributed financial platform that facilitates the execution of private cross-blockchain smart contracts. They have the closest ties with the Chinese market.Other projects that aim to connect blockchains include COSMOS and Polkadot, but the latter will only hit the market in two years.PrivacyThe distributed ledger technology most blockchains use allows for full transparency over transactions. For some blockchain applications, it is vital some information can’t be accessed by just anyone. The NuCypher project wants to give people the ability to safely share encrypted data with other parties. NuCypher integrates with big data platforms, enabling enterprises to shield data from unauthorized access and share data between organizations through cloud computing.RegulationsEmbracing self-regulation is key at the moment. It’s wild west days and many projects are letting anyone invest from anywhere in the world. Ensure transparency and auditability. Don’t skip KYC (know your customer) anti-money laundering regulations. Make sure your utility tokens comply with SEC regulation. Polymath and Tzero will both allow for securities to be traded within a regulatory approved framework.GovernanceBitcoin forks and proposed hard forks have caused a lot of uncertainty. The Bitcoin community was in a crisis after a debate of three years on improving the scalability of bitcoin. It looked like the leaders were going to upgrade to a 2MB blocksize, but plans were called off to keep the community together. Young projects may make mistakes on governance, but leaders are taking careful measures. Cypherium has a novel approach to multi-level governance. Changes to the protocol like block size and transaction fees are adjusted by voting. Decred takes a revolutionary approach allowing you to vote with tokens on upgrades to the platform."

GollanContributor. Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.","Nov 3, 2017,03:00pm EDT","Private jet cards sellers say their programs are the closest you can get to the experience of owning your own jet or a fractional share of a private aircraft without the commitments of doing so. The rationale is since each card program has its own sourcing standards and policies, you get a more consistent experience than on-demand charter. Brokers will tell you that you pay more for jet cards, although in my research I haven’t found that to necessarily be true. Of course, there is nothing to stop jet card members from shopping specific trips with brokers and getting the best of both worlds. Perhaps that's why the number of companies selling jet cards keeps multiplying, with over 30 by my count, more than half launched in the past decade.","On the eve of the Ft. Lauderdale International Boat Show, Air Partner announced you can now use your... [+] jet card to charter a yacht. (Photo credit: VALERY HACHE/AFP/Getty Images)The market’s growth has meant companies trying to stand out by offering variations and innovations. Previously, I’ve written about Airstream Jets, which uses miles instead of hours to calculate fees, and Executive Airshare, which sells its cards in increments of days. Last month wasn’t any different.Ecojets, which over the summer started offering rebates in the form of Mastercard and Visa debit cards issued to members, became the first jet card company to start selling via Amazon. It isn't the first provider to sell via non-traditional channels. WheelsUp has offered Costco cash cards to members through the big box retailer.You can now buy jet cards on Amazon thanks to Ecojets. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)The way you can pay for jet cards is also changing. Whereas wire transfers are still typical, last year Delta Private Jets began allowing members of Delta Air Lines’ SkyMiles programs to pay for jet cards with miles.  Last month Star Jets International announced it will accept bitcoin.Star Jets International announced it now accepts Bitcoin, a digital cryptocurrency, to buy jet cards... [+] and charters. (Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)You might assume that all or most private jets have WiFi.  You would be wrong. Executives at GoGo and Honeywell say less than half of private jets are connected. While it is estimated 80% of private flights are less than two hours, having WiFi inflight is becoming more of an issue.Jet card sellers such as NetJets, XOJET, Wheels Up, JetSuite and Vistajet, which own their fleets, have been able to offer WiFi guarantees. Nicholas Air and Flexjet likewise guarantee it on specific aircraft types, while Delta Private Jets, which uses a managed fleet to provide jet card inventory, made WiFi mandatory for owners to provide last year.However, brokerage jet card sellers as best I can tell have only offered guaranteed WiFi on an a la carte basis for a surcharge, but not as part of their off-the-shelf programs. That changed last month when Sentient Jet launched SJ25+, a 25-hour jet card in the Super-Mid jet category which includes the Challenger 300, Citation X, Citation Sovereign, Falcon 50EX, Falcon 2000, and Gulfstream 200. The new WiFi cards are limited and interestingly are priced below its existing Super-Mid cards.One truism about jet cards is they all have differences, not only in pricing and how sellers source aircraft and flight crew, but dozens of items that may or may not impact your choices, such as fees for bringing pets, service area, the minimum age for unaccompanied minors, peak days and peak day surcharges. Other variances include guaranteed availability and how much money you have to wire when you sign up. While many jet cards work like debit cards, where you are paying a set amount of money in advance ($100,000, $250,000, etc.), others charge a membership fee then enable you to pay as you fly. Skyjet, a sister company to Sentient and Flexjet, launched Skyjet Explorer earlier this week, filling a gap in its portfolio. It enables the group to offer solutions ranging from fractional ownership and leases to jet cards, membership and on-demand charter across its portfolio.Private Jet Services (PJS) Group has launched a co-branded jet card with Jackson Hole Ski ResortOne area that isn't new is partnerships. XOJET's deal with Canyon Ranch giving its members VIP perks is somewhat typical. Going a bit further, Netjets and Four Seasons announced they were joining together to offer custom designed travel experiences for their customers. And even deeper, Private Jet Services (PJS) Group announced a co-branded jet card with Jackson Hole Ski Resort. Then this week, Air Partner said it was marketing packages that include private flights with yacht charters via superyacht broker Camper & Nicholsons, starting at $67,500. You can use the balance in your jet card account to pay.Magellan Jets offers a ""Build Your Own Jet Card"" tool on its website.If you are a novice to jet cards or doing some serious shopping, the recently upgraded Magellan Jets “Build Your Own Jet Card” tool is fun to play around with, even if you are just dreaming. "

To further mainstream it, there are many new opportunities to consider for entrepreneurs and business owners.","ShutterstockI have no affiliation or connection with any of the companies listed within this article; they are simply good examples of how a new industry can be pushed forward in new and unique ways. Because I work with cryptocurrency and blockchain (the technology behind it) I am excited to watch the industry expand with these new opportunities. I believe it is valuable to share these opportunities because it will help my fellow entrepreneurs out there understand the incredible ways digital currency can be incorporated into business and our personal lives.Bitcoin IRAThis is a relatively new concept for retirement investing that illustrates how cryptocurrency should be seen as a viable monetary source. For example, Bitcoin IRA is a completely compliant company that helps people start a retirement account. Or, if you already have an IRA, you can transfer those funds into this and convert it into cryptocurrency, taking another approach to investing in this digital currency. This type of IRA must follow all the rules and regulations set out for these types of retirement accounts.There are minimal fees involved in having this type of IRA, which is an attractive benefit along with the potential to see your investment grow as cryptocurrency becomes more valuable. It also receives tax-deferred status like a regular IRA because a digital currency is now recognized by the IRS.Spending or withdrawing funds from an IRA account before you reach the retirement age of 59-and-a-half does lead to early withdrawal penalties just like a traditional IRA. Therefore, it becomes an ideal way to continue growing your retirement funds now.Bitcoin Teller MachinesThis is one of the coolest ways to think about mainstreaming cryptocurrency. BitAccess is one of the very first of these machines to become readily available and illustrate how cryptocurrency can become more accessible. The machines enable users to deposit cash. In return, they get a digital wallet that has the equivalent in bitcoin cryptocurrency. The machine also works the other way so that users can put cryptocurrency in and receive traditional currency in return.These machines are already out there and loved by people in the Boulder, Colorado, area, as well as in other cities around the world. It's also serving certain industries that had previously struggled to work with traditional banking structures like the cannabis industry.Social Media PaymentsKik is a messenger that now makes it possible to use cryptocurrency to accept payments through a social media platform. It's another example of how cryptocurrency is emulating all types of traditional financial processes. What Kik is doing is very similar to what Facebook and Instagram are doing with traditional currency payments.This allows more people around the world to transact this way without requiring them to have a regular bank account or move their money through a centralized bank. It also helps those using it to avoid having to undertake the cost and hassle of currency exchange when they want to pay others who live in another country and otherwise use a different currency.Money Transfer And PaymentsNow, Bitcoin is showing the rest of the world that banks are not necessary because it can handle many of the same functions -- only cheaper and more effectively. Much of this is on display in developing countries where its citizens make do without traditional bank accounts. Kenyan-based BitPesa works in a similar way to Western Union, but it does so in a much more affordable way. Customers in Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda and Tanzania receive cryptocurrency through wire transfer. Then, they can convert those bitcoins to local currencies via mobile money platforms.CashU is another example of an innovative payments platform that has been developed for people to pay their bills without needing a bank account or credit card to take care of it. This opportunity for payments also allows consumers in developing countries to participate in the online shopping experience.New Ways To Buy Old ThingsMany more items than ever before can be purchased with cryptocurrency. That also illustrates how it is growing in acceptance. And it's not just about buying a product online or a cup of coffee at the progressive coffee shop around the corner. It's big things like a house, too. MyCOINrealty.com is a listing service for real estate that can be bought with bitcoins rather than just traditional currency.If you are in the market for a Lamborghini, you can also take your bitcoin to Lamborghini Newport Beach in California and get yourself a new ride. Other companies like Tesla reportedly also accept cryptocurrency.MicrofinanceLending is an expanding new application for Bitcoin. While some companies have struggled to maintain their service in this niche due to regulatory pressures, others are emerging after addressing the legal framework. This includes Bitbond. Kiva is another company that does Bitcoin loans, helping entrepreneurs in countries all over the world get access to microfinance. Other options that are appearing are a blockchain-based SALT loan platform that is intended to leverage Bitcoin assets.Growing In NumbersAccording to Google statistics, interest in Bitcoin has increased in 2017 in many countries. Research from Coinatmradar.com shows that there are 1,718 Bitcoin ATMs across 58 countries with the most found in the U.S. and Europe. Adding to the interest are these new applications that could be behind the extraordinary increase in cryptocurrency value.A Fortune Magazine article stated, ""Bitcoin and its ilk are now worth $107 billion, six times their value at the beginning of the year."" The next stop could be to become a trillion-dollar industry, especially if these new applications grow. It's an exciting time to be involved in financial and non-financial technology."

miss the point of cryptocurrency because it was never about the money ...","Editors' Pick|Oct 18, 2017,03:35pm EDT",Vinay Gupta in London,"“Let's see, I'm 45, and this is probably career number five.”Vinay Gupta has not raised $257 million in an ICO. He is not yet a Bitcoin billionaire. He is not a Thiel Fellow, nor a Thiel Lad (to translate to his native Scottish vernacular). With Bitcoin reaching new highs monthly, the dominating headlines often miss the point of cryptocurrency because it was never about the money or the brand. It's about interesting people doing interesting things, and Gupta has quietly impacted the world in his own way, doing a lot of thinking over the years (136,000 tweets worth).Gupta helped coordinate Ethereum’s 2015 release, working as a project manager on strategy and communications. He worked as the strategic architect of Consensys, the leading crypto venture studio, and as the designer of Dubai’s National Blockchain strategy. In addition to being the Blockchain Fellow for Digital Catapult, a UK government-funded initiative to increase the amount of innovation in the country, he has two current projects.The first is Hexayurt Capital, a fund designed to invest in the Internet of Agreements, which is defined as the world enabled by smart contracts. It hopes to invest in companies that tackle real world problems like logistics and global trade. His second project is called Mattereum, billed as a court that understands the nature of cryptocurrencies, making physical property and intellectual property transactable on a blockchain. In a case where you buy a physical table using a fraction of a Bitcoin and the seller does not follow through, it is difficult to explain this to a judge in a small claims court. This is where Mattereum comes in, enabling technically competent arbitrators to make rulings in these cases instead of a judge. Gupta’s path to get here has been unconventional, to say the least.Before the dawn of crypto hedge funds and ethtraders, before the blockchain technology existed, before 23-year-old Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin was born, Gupta was witnessing the ideological foundations of cryptocurrencies brewing and marinating. The interdisciplinary nature of cryptocurrencies means it has drawn from a variety of schools of thought: game theory, cryptography, hacker culture, the open source movement and libertarian ideology to name a few.Unlike many of the ambitious young founders that dominate the future of the space “running around with their hair on fire,” as he says, Gupta is part of the older guard. He was born in 1972 in Scotland, growing up as he describes it in a very average Scottish household. His father came from India in the late 60’s but later settled in Scotland as a doctor. His mother was a Scottish nurse. When he was 13, he started getting into Computer Science and doing a ton of academic reading. By the time he was in university he hit the ground running majoring in Graphics. It was there that Gupta heard his first whispers of this idea called the World Wide Web.“I was in university, you know,” Gupta said. “Software was kicking around, I installed it, set up. Just like everyone else. Look, there's the web! It started with academics and military, and government. And slowly people began to learn how to use this new thing. In those days there was no search, there was only discovery, so you'd have to try and click around until you found something that you wanted to know. Credit card processing hadn’t been invented, so you couldn't make any money online. There were no ads because no one could buy anything. I remember getting the first piece of spam. Some elite lawyer spammed half the Internet with some kind of green card thing. And like the whole Internet got the same piece of spam.”It was from the Internet that Gupta first heard about a festival called Burning Man. “In those days, more or less everyone knew more or less everything that was happening on the Internet all at the same time,” Gupta said. “There was no sense that the Internet was too big to understand. There just wasn't that much stuff there.” In 1996, Gupta went to his first Burn. There were 8,000 people in attendance, with no street signs and a theme of corporate takeover. It was very wild and very weird to the kid from rural Scotland, but he liked it. Gupta kept coming back for ten years. “It was Burning Man. It was just the staggering, the amazing, the Burning Man. The Burn!”During this time, Gupta was an early adopter of the first popular digital currency: E-Gold. E-gold, brought down in 2009 by regulators, shared many similarities to Bitcoin ideologically. Oncologist Douglas Jackson founded E-Gold in 1996, convinced of the fact that gold was superior to paper money and frustrated with the United States’ dismissal of the gold standard in 1971. He envisioned a new monetary system that was not so reliant on banks, a private currency backed by gold that could cross borders. Despite being plagued by scams, blackmarket adopters, copycats, and problems of scale much like many cryptocurrencies today, E-Gold reached a peak of being backed by $85 million worth of gold reserves.Despite its failure, E-Gold offered a glimpse to anti-establishment individuals of a decentralized future. “For me, it was a civil liberties thing,” Gupta said. “I'm very well known for having strong political opinions. Unfortunately, they change over time. So in those days I was probably in the early stages of being a naive libertarian, and this idea of free trade, everyone can decide what they want, la la la la, all of that stuff made perfect sense to me at the time, because I was 25, and I didn't know any better.”While E-Gold was rising and falling, cryptography, open source, and hacker culture were also rapidly evolving. PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) was released in 1991 by Phil Zimmerman, providing increased encryption through the use of hashing, public and private keys, and data compression. Zimmerman released PGP in violation of patent law, wanting it to be open and for the people. “It was a huge topic of discourse on the Internet at the time, because it was this thing that people said would change the world one day,” Gupta said. “We expected it to be done in 5 years; 20 years later we're still waiting.” In 1997, Eric Raymond’s The Cathedral and the Bazaar was published, with 19 lessons for good open source development. In 1998 on April Fool’s Day, hackers rejoiced as the MIT homepage was replaced with a new page that announced Disney’s acquisition of the university.Of particular importance to cryptocurrency was the Cypherpunk mailing list, which Gupta was a part of. Founded in 1992, the list hosted futuristic technology discussion about a wide range of subjects, and had nearly 2000 members in 1997 with an average of 30 messages sent every day. “There’s this genre of literary fiction, called cyberpunk. Cypherpunks came along, looked at cyberpunk, and basically took that science fiction as a manifesto,” Gupta said. “The cyberpunk future was this kind of doom laden, corporate takeover, bad governance, environmentally polluting future. Which turns out to be more or less exactly where we are now. It's really predictive. You see people who have been into war in Iraq and Afghanistan with these very high tech artificial limbs, and it's kind of like that's sort of what they were talking about 40 years ago.  We really are headed into a world that resembles that fiction.”The Cypherpunks were a crypto Fight Club of sorts. In the Andreessen Horowitz podcast, “Why Crypto Tokens Matter”, a16z partner Chris Dixon and Fred Ehrsam of Coinbase compare crypto to “the side of the nights and weekends.” They believe that what employees read about after 9-5, what smart people tinker with on the weekend, what researchers are pushing the boundaries of, is what everyone else will be working on in ten years. The Cypherpunks spread local chapters in London, Boston, and Washington. In addition to notorious figures like Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, many of the precursors to Bitcoin were created by Cypherpunks: Nick Szabo of Bit Gold, Adam Back of Hashcash, Wei Dai of B Money, Hal Finney of RPow, and more loosely David Chaum of Digicash (Banking on Bitcoin). However, they were all a little too ahead of their time, unable to translate their ideology into a usable, scalable technology.Then, in 2008, the Bitcoin white paper was sent out on The Cryptography Mailing List by an anonymous Cypherpunk under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamato. Gupta saw Bitcoin in its early years but completely ignored it. “I was not interested in speculating or making money through speculating,” Gupta said. “I told all my friends if you want to make a lot of money buy some Bitcoin. I don’t think anybody did, but god damn it I told them. And I didn't really get interested in it because I knew from the E-Gold community that payments weren't enough. E-gold had payments and it didn't create any kind of new social structure.”Even now, compared to E-gold, Bitcoin has more volatility and higher transaction fees. It is unclear if Bitcoin can scale to the number of transactions that a network like Visa has. Yet at over $5000 a pop today, it is crazy to think that even extremely knowledgeable cryptography insiders did not benefit as much from Bitcoin as later players to the game. Though there are thousands of Bitcoin millionaires, there are millions of people who had every opportunity to invest but did not.“So in that sense I'm a bit of heretic inside the space in that I'm not sure that all of this stuff is actually progress,” Gupta said. “I think some projects are workarounds and maybe we just don't need those.” Gupta pivoted away from the Cypherpunks, immersing himself in other fields. He had careers in volume rendering and flight simulators, as well as defense. He picked up a heavy meditation practice after buying a book on the Internet written by an Australian named Paul Wilson called The Calm Technique. And soon he found himself involved in an unlikely field: disaster relief. Gupta’s biggest accomplishment to date is the design of the Hexayurt, a disaster relief tent that can be folded and transported. “A bunch of hippies asked me if I could figure out how to build a geodesic dome without waste. After I invented it I felt obligated to do something.”In 1995, a year before his first Burn, Gupta went to a hippie establishment called Gaskin’s Farm in Tennessee, which housed an assortment of environmental doomsayers. The hippies were building geodesic domes, hemisphere like structures, for disaster relief. However, when cutting complicated shapes out of 4’ by 8’ rectangular sheets, they were left with a ton of waste. Given his background in graphics, Gupta took a stab at the problem, but after 6 months of work, he had no results.Years later, in 2001, Gupta was at the Rocky Mountain Institute in Colorado, an environmental think tank. He was helping edit Small is Profitable, a well-regarded book about renewable energy economics that was one of The Economist's Books of the Year in 2002. “One day they said we've got this disaster relief gathering, and we came back with a request,” Gupta said. “Can someone design a shelter which can be packed flat, transported, and put back up again? So refugees can be given a reusable house. A tent that can be folded. And I sat down, with the back of the envelope, and 15 minutes later I had the Hexayurt.”The first model was built in 2003 at Burning Man, 6 feet high, 7 feet long, and 8 feet wide. Gupta tried for years to get the Hexayurt to be widely adopted for disaster relief, but was unable to get past the bureaucracy of NGO’s. Gupta then moved further into the resilience field, improbably winding up at the Pentagon advising them on large scale disaster management, as well as on how to use cryptography to protect civil rights. He continued this work at the UCL Institute for Security and Resilience Studies in the UK, working for the former UK Secretary of Defense, John Reid. Then, he jumped back into crypto fully, coordinating Ethereum's release in 2015.The biggest difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum is that Ethereum is not only a digital currency, but also a blockchain based platform. It has a Turing complete internal code, meaning that with enough time and computing power, anything can be built on top of it. This means it better supports this idea of smart contracts, introduced by Cypherpunk Nick Szabo in 1995, which are self executing pieces of code that can be used to build more complex applications on the blockchain beyond just payments, like exchanges of property or shares.Ethereum is younger, moves faster, and is friendlier to developers than Bitcoin. “All of the Bitcoiners were political first,” Gupta said. “And then they became technical. Whereas the Ethereum guys were very much technical first, and then became political. They got led in by the concept of smart contracts and all the decentralized politics built in around that. But I think that that emphasis, whether political first or technical first, is a huge driver. Because the Ethereum community generally speaking is pretty typical for nerds. It's much like a Linux user group. The Bitcoin stuff on the other hand is a very typical space for hard core libertarians.”The fact that Bitcoin was first an ideology has been huge driver of its success. With the mysterious nature of Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto and the hard core evangelists it has given rise to, Bitcoin resembles a religion. This is why it has stood the test of time and has been able to shake off events like the Mt. Gox hack. Yet this ideology first mentality is also crippling the community by causing so much division. The Bitcoin Cash fork, where a developer created a clone of Bitcoin’s source code with bigger block sizes, is an example of this.In some ways, Bitcoin and Ethereum are competitors. Though Bitcoin appears to be taking more of a store of value role like digital gold, and Ethereum a platform role with a variety of applications built on top of it, the two communities clash at times. “Bitcoin's competition was always the successor to Bitcoin,” Gupta said. “Not pressure from regulators. Ethereum's competition is pressure from the next system. But my gut thinking about this is I don't think that we are going to see extremely expensive tokens as a standard feature in the long run. The smart contracts on the other hand I think are going to be an increasingly huge deal. I think they are going to be immensely important.”Gupta is the earliest of adopters, motivated by intellectual curiosity rather than monetary gain. He is an example of a person who has been on the bleeding edge, part of a group of futurists and forward thinkers ahead of their time. “Cryptocurrency is a frontier, and it's a frontier that requires an enormous technical complexity to survive,” Gupta said. “As a result, what you get is very, very smart, very forward-looking, very risk-hungry technical people in huge numbers. And that's genuinely a unique environment, that doesn't happen very often, and when it does happen, you tend to get explosive breakthroughs in technology.” These futurists will one day be right; it is just a matter of when."

Shutterstock","The value of the cryptocurrency market has surged this year, rising more than 1,200%.The total market capitalization (market cap) of these digital assets rose to $230.9 billion today, according to CoinMarketCap.At this level, the total value of cryptocurrencies has surged as much as 1,204% this year, after starting out 2017 at $17.7 billion, additional CoinMarketCap figures show.As for what drove this sharp increase, analysts pointed to several factors.[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]Growing Interest In CryptocurrenciesMany analysts cited growing visibility as a major reason that the digital currency market has been rising in value.This increasing visibility is illustrated by Google Trends data, which shows that search interest in the term ""Bitcoin"" reached an all-time high on November 12. ""The buzz and hype in the market is increasing traffic as more of the public seeks to understand this market,"" said Matthew Unger, founder and CEO of iComply Investor Services inc.Amid all this hype, many people have been learning about digital currency and deciding to jump in, said cryptocurrency trader Marius Rupsys. ""I think the price rise and surge in interest fulfill and compliment each other,"" said Iqbal Gandham, UK managing director of social trading platform eToro.As digital currencies rise in value, their appreciation generates interest from market observers, and this in turn helps fuel further price gains, he stated. Surging InvestmentThe digital currency market has drawn some very robust inflows this year, and this in turn has been reflected in the total market cap of these assets.Several analysts noted that a rising number of institutional investors have been getting involved with cryptocurrencies.Rupsys said the following: Investments came from two types of investors: retail and institutional. First half of the year retail investors from China, Korea, and Japan were pushing bitcoin prices. The second half of the year institutional money started to come in, also heavy investments from US retail, ie Coinbase has now more than 12 million users alone.Jacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager, also commented on the growing presence of institutions.""The surging investment has particularly come from traditional finance: hedge funds, family offices, high-net-worth individuals and even, soon if not yet, the likes of banks, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds,"" he said. ""These groups have taken years to get comfortable enough to wade in, but they have correspondingly deep pockets,"" added Eliosoff. The Sharp Increase In ICOsThe rising number of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) has caused the digital currency market to gain value, doing so in two separate ways.First of all, these sales create new value for the cryptocurrency market, as tokens are sold and given monetary value.Second, participating in ICOs involves exchanging Bitcoin and Ether for newly created digital tokens, which in turn provides significant headwinds for these major cryptocurrencies.Bitcoin's price has surged more than 700% this year, and Ether has skyrocketed more than 4,000% year-to-date (YTD) at the time of report, CoinMarketCap figures show.Bubble ConcernsAmid all these positive developments, more than one expert voiced concerns about a bubble.""The history of cryptocurrencies has included plenty of wild price swings up and down (2011, 2013, ...), and many observers including me think we're in a big swing up right now: a bubble,"" said Eliosoff. He further predicted that ""A sizable portion of 2017's gains are likely to be given back in a crash within a year, on the way to further heights in the future."" Disclosure: I own some Bitcoin and Ether."

Indeed, when I covered the measurement of latency in the equities and exchanges space, it was always interesting to hear from one party or another claiming that their systems' trading latency was the fastest on the block.But it all rather depended on whether one was talking about end-to-end latency, point-to-point, from the moment the button a trade instruction was despatched to when it was received by the exchange matching engine, or from when it left one building and hit the edge of another building (i.e. an exchange data centre).Also we could throw in average and peak latency rates. And, it's one thing having the fastest latency but if the system is prone to downtime then things won't necessarily stack up. The words smoke and mirrors come to mind.“Waves-NG”, a next-generation technology and consensus algorithm designed and based on the Bitcoin-NG proposal made by Cornell Computer Science academics Emin Gün Sirer and Ittay Eyal.It increases effective bandwidth and speed of block creation, which is described as being “especially significant for businesses” using the Waves platform since it allows for conducting micro transactions - without any delays that are typical with traditional blockchain systems.Furthermore, it allows the platform to withstand high loads, such as distribution of tokens following crowdsales and airdrops of bonus tokens. The speed of processing trading transactions on Waves decentralized exchange (DEX) is increased as well.The prototype for the development of Waves-NG was Bitcoin-NG, a protocol developed for Bitcoin by Gün Sierer, Co-Director of the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts at Cornell.“In recent years, we have seen blockchain technology show the world its unique capabilities and amazing promise. As well, we have seen it hit a wall when it comes to scalability,” said Gün Sierer, who holds Ph.D. & M.S. qualifications at the University of Washington and B.S.E. from Princeton University.He added: “If blockchains are to conquer the world, they need to scale. The Waves team is at the forefront of this race to scale. And, with NG, Waves has adopted the cutting edge of blockchain protocols for on-chain scaling.”Physical version of Bitcoin (new virtual money) and chain. Conceptual image for investors in... [+] cryptocurrency and Blockchain technology. (Shutterstock).Current Blockchain SystemsThe problem with current blockchain systems is that in many decentralized systems, nodes are scattered around the world, and their synchronisation entails significant delays.So, for example, if you create a large block and start sending it, while waiting for it to reach the rest of the network’s participants, one of them may have time to create a new block. And, due to this problem, forks will occur. That is one of the reasons why, in the bitcoin community, there are constant debates about whether to increase block size.Waves explained that if one increases the size of a block in the bitcoin network by four times, “only 90% of participants will have time to download it before creating a new one. If you increase it to 36 MB, then only half of participants will have time.” Specifically, NG enables blockchains to minimize latency and maximize throughput. According to Gün Sirer the Waves team has shown that they have an “innovative platform that incorporates the best-known technology and is ready for challenges of the next generation of demanding applications.”NG is a protocol change that allows an increase in the number of transactions per block without increasing the number of forks.The information necessary to start generating the next block is delivered to all nodes quickly after the previous one is generated. And, only then does the miner send the transactions that will fill the block to the network, submitting them in several tranches (i.e. microblocks).Platforms ..............................Consensus                Block Time                 Actual ..............................Mechanism                   Target                   TPS maxArdor                              POS                              1 minute                        800Bitcoin                            POW                           1o minutes                  2,000Bitshares                        DPOS                           2 seconds              100,000Ethereum                       POW                           15 seconds                  2,000Heat Ledger                   POS/POP                  25 seconds                  1,000Steem                              POW                             2 seconds                  1,000Waves                             DPOS/LPOS             1-30 seconds               1,000(Source: Respective websites, Oct 2017).Bitcoin-NG Bitcoin-NG is a blockchain protocol, which serializes transactions in much the same way as Bitcoin, but allows for better latency and bandwidth without sacrificing other properties.The protocol divides time into so-called epochs. In each epoch, a single leader is in charge of serializing state machine transitions. And, to facilitate state propagation, leaders generate blocks.It introduces two types of blocks: (1) Key blocks for leader election, and (2) Microblocks containing the ledger entries. Each block has a header that contains the unique reference of its predecessor, namely, a cryptographic hash of the predecessor header - among other fields.   Traditional Blockchain Model Versus NG ModelIn a traditional blockchain model, blocks are discovered at roughly similar intervals and the most recent transactions are processed once a miner has earned the right to submit them to the network. As such, this places fundamental limits on the capacity of the blockchain. Bitcoin, for example, has a theoretical maximum of roughly 3 tps. By contrast, in the NG model, the next miner is selected in advance. The miner creates a “key block”, which is then immediately filled with microblocks containing transactions, which requires no further proof-of-work.Whilst maintaining the open structure of the protocol, it enables transactions to be confirmed “as fast as the network will allow.” Waves’ proof-of-stake approach is said to further improve speed, and thereby increasing capacity by a “factor of a hundred or more”, it is claimed.Alexander Ivanov, CEO and founder of Waves, commenting in relation to the development said: “As a platform of mass adoption, it is critical that we should be able to support a high throughput of transactions, whilst maintaining robust security. NG lays the foundations for our next phase of growth and a step-change in the size of the ecosystem we can support.” A word of caution though. We should be minded to take on board recent comments by a TechCrunch commentator that the crypto community has made a nasty habit of over promising and under delivering when it comes to projects that have real value for the world.And, with the price of Bitcoin hitting ever new heights, some pundits are predicting a big correction in the offing amid all the hype in the landscape of crypto assets - from the fund raising potential of ICOs to particular use cases for Blockchain technology.Brian Patrick Eha, a journalist and author of How Money Got Free: Bitcoin and the Fight for the Future of Finance based in New York, speaking earlier this week on a panel at the DECENT ‘Unchained’ Blockchain event in Hong Kong I attended, noted: “I think even the word Blockchain itself is at risk of becoming a mere buzz word, a kind fairy dust that shady entrepreneurs or even outright scammers can sprinkle on projects that will never pay off.”The public stress test for Waves, which began on November 8 2017, requires the community to help stress test it.

But once the former press officer for the White House began learning more about the cryptocurrency, she couldn't stop herself and was hooked.","Her trajectory is not that dissimilar to that of a lot of people when they first hear about Bitcoin. In fact, many people from traditional finance still think Bitcoin is a fad, a fraud, a bubble, a Ponzi scheme, etc. To address these misconceptions, in this week's episode of my podcast, Unchained (Google Play, iTunes, iHeartRadio, Stitcher or TuneIn Radio), Smith, who is now the global chief communications officer for Bitcoin hardware and software firm Bitfury and CEO of the Global Blockchain Business Council, along with Amanda Gutterman, the chief marketing officer of Ethereum venture production studio ConsenSys, rebut every common misconception about cryptocurrencies and answer all the most common questions about them.Jamie Smith, global chief marketing officer of Bitfury, and Amanda Gutterman, chief marketing... [+] officer of ConsenSysFrom a high level, Smith says the way she came to understand the technology and how she thinks about it now is, ""What we’re going to have in the years to come is, I believe, global wifi. I think almost everyone will have access to or own their own phone so, with those two components, now you have a system that allows people to move money or any asset they want peer-to-peer for almost free.""Gutterman explains Ethereum to others by relating it to an experience every person has had -- their computer slowing down: ""If you have a bunch of tabs open on your computer, eventually if you keep on opening tabs and opening tabs, your computer will slow down and not work, and in a similar way, Ether acts as an economic disincentive for the over use of the public Ethereum commons,"" she says.As for the perpetual question of how cryptocurrency can have any value, Gutterman describes the concepts of scarcity, fungibility, divisibility and transferability to show that cryptocurrency has a certain number of units that can be exchanged, divided and moved between owners. Smith talks about the need to keep data secure and how because bitcoin is based on a distribtued ledger, “you can’t just break into one house — you have to break into an entire town,” to hack a blockchain. Another value-related question we discuss is whether or not cryptocurrency is in a bubble. Smith described how, with one exception, every person who’s compared the internet revolution with the blockchain wave has said the current phase of development is similar to 1992-1993 in the internet. So, in terms of the value that will be created, it’s actually very early and quite small compared to what will come later. In fact, she had recently been listening to an interview with Jeff Bezos from the mid-1990s, and was thinking about what a long road he’s had from 1995 to 2017, but realized the same applied to blockchain technology: “When you have a vision and there’s a real desire in society for systems to change and become more efficient and you have a product that undoubtedly offers that, I don’t think you can stop that force.”Gutterman says a lot of the objections people have to cryptocurrency now are similar to the ones that naysayers made in the first internet revolution. “The same way people in the early days of the internet thought consumers will never use this, there will never be commerce on this platform, it’s too complicated for normal end users — boy, were those people wrong,” she says. “Once the salability and security issues were solved, eventually all those things happened.”Gutterman approaches the bubble question from the use perspective: “We see the utility. As more people are using what we call web 3.0 and need fuel in order to power their usage of those applications — that’s why a lot of people who are excited about Ether imagine it will increase in value.Tune in to the full episode (Google Play, iTunes, iHeartRadio, Stitcher or TuneIn Radio, web),  to find out how they explain what backs the value of cryptocurrencies, what things like mining and proof of work are, how they address perceptions that bitcoin is “criminal money” as Smith first thought, and what they say to people who think crypto is a Ponzi scheme.Finally, since the two have organized the most gender-balanced blockchain-focused conferences in the industry, they talk about how they accomplished that and whether or not the crypto space is really as male-dominated as it can sometime seem.Be sure to get Forbes' twice-weekly all things blockchain email newsletter, Crypto Confidential!

A complete list can be found here.Monero is currently the ninth largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of $3.5 billion; it has a price of $226.“As cryptocurrencies become more popular, it’s important that my fans have choices when it comes to how they buy my songs and merchandise,” said rap star G-Eazy in a statement. “Given Monero is one of the safest, most secure and most private cryptocurrencies, it’s one of the best options for my fans this holiday season — and just in time for my new album.”Monero will be accepted by 45 major musicians this holiday seasonThe inspiration for the initiative, called Project Coral Reef, came from serial entrepreneur and Monero fan Naveen Jain who has worked with many of the artists. “One of the big challenges I see with cryptocurrencies is lack of acceptance,” he said in an interview in San Francisco. “There’s a really significant Monero community that doesn’t have a lot of opportunity to spend their Monero on things that are really cool and exciting. This product solves that problem. There’s also a challenge of just raw awareness of Monero, so it’s the start of that initiative.”Riccardo Spagni (a k a “fluffypony”), lead maintainer of Monero, added, “If rabid music fans can get a unique item that they can only get with Monero or save 5% on their purchase, they’ll jump through the hoops to get that.”The initiative may mark one of the first times that stores appealing to mainstream consumers accept Monero, which is best-known for being used for dark web purchases. While many crypto investors believe privacy coins have the potential to become in demand, so far, one of their main constituencies is people who intend to purchase illegal goods.“Cryptocurrencies are fast becoming more popular to make purchases, but not all currencies are created equal and not all are as private and secure as people think. Project Coral Reef is a very important step towards the mainstream adoption of Monero,” said Spagni in a press release. “For the first time, consumers around the world can use Monero to securely and privately buy their favorite artists’ music and merchandise.”To make the initiative possible, the team had to work with ecommerce payment site Shopify which currently accepts Bitcoin.

profit-taking has seen it fall to just above $15,000 at time of writing. No 
doubt it ...","Dec 8, 2017,10:24am EST",The annual financial story at this time of the year nowadays centers on the successes or failures of Black Friday or how retailers are feeling about Christmas.,"This crazy five weeks defines what will happen in the next year as everybody in the ecosystem tries to understand what the data means. Are people spending? Are people keeping their hands in their pockets? What does it all mean? Does it make any sense?This year, the questions are all the same, but instead of focusing on retail and products, the mania is all about digital currencies, not least the fervour around bitcoin.The business and technology pages of the biggest publications and websites on the planet are constantly debating and discussing. What does it all mean? Does it make any sense?Earlier this week, the bitcoin price went up to $17,000 although profit-taking has seen it fall to just above $15,000 at time of writing. No doubt it will go up again, but nobody really knows.It would appear that this week of 2017 saw bitcoin hit critical mass, but perhaps other news will see a higher tipping point when it comes to the blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin.As usual, it’s nothing obvious or sensible, but it isn’t surprising that it is soccer that will take blockchain in the public mainstream. Even less surprising is that global football superstar Lionel Messi is the one to do it.Messi narrowly lost out last night in the battle to win the Ballon D’Or, the annual soccer award given to the best player on the planet. It was won by Cristiano Ronaldo, who has won it five times in the last 10 years.The other five times it was Messi who prevailed.He is one of the most famous people in the world, so when he puts his name to something, a lot of thought has gone into it, not least by the player himself, but those who surround his brand.Blockchain endorsement probably isn’t the first thing his advisors thought about marketing Messi, but right now it makes perfect sense. Where Messi goes, his disciples follow. When he says something’s good, the crowd come. His goals become theirs.Messi scores on the blockchain.Today he has become the official global brand ambassador for a company called Sirin Labs. Previously they were known as the company that sold smartphones for $17,000, a price set on the watertight security of that device.Now they have developed something more mainstream, but with security at its essence. It has made a blockchain that means those holding digital currencies such as bitcoin will be able to protect that investment on their smartphones.Sirin Labs describes Finney as 'the first open source, secure smartphone and all-in-one PC', that will run on a fee-less blockchain.It hopes that such a blockchain smartphone means that the so-called cool-crypto-kids will be able to carry around their cryptocurrencies without fear of being hacked.This threat was underlined yesterday when more than $75 million was stolen in a hack of around 4,700 bitcoins from mining platform NiceHash. As bitcoin’s value has appreciated, so the temptations and rewards for hackers have increased.While the furore about the digital currency has continued, the threat of theft and hacking has largely been forgotten, but it is a huge problem, especially when it comes to smartphones. It is bitcoin’s dark not-so-secret.Sirin Labs has scored with Lionel Messi.Sirin Labs also commences a crowdsale on December 12th when it launches the SRN token, giving investors the right to use and acquire Sirin products and services on the blockchain.""We are excited to have Lionel Messi, the best soccer player in the world as the global brand ambassador for Sirin Labs. We have identified the potential of blockchain technology and are developing SirinOS to improve the security and user-experience on the blockchain to encourage mass adoption,"" said Moshe Hogeg, CEO Sirin Labs.Whether Messi is currently the best player is a moot point especially after he lost out to Ronaldo in last night’s Ballon D’Or, but one thing is certain.Messi can probably unlock any soccer defence in the world, but in putting his name to a product and a technology that is locking out the hackers of the world, this is potentially very smart.The blockchain is going to be as omnipresent as Lionel Messi, everybody is going to sing its name. Messi knows that, his advisers know that and most importantly Messi’s followers will soon know that.The blockchain is now the mainstream, the soccer Gods have decreed it so."

Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]Following Bitcoin HigherLitecoin, which is very similar to Bitcoin except with a few alterations, has experienced robust gains this year as its digital sibling pushed higher.The prices of the two digital currencies have frequently followed each other, according to analysis published on CoinDesk.Litecoin was created as a hard fork of Bitcoin. Since Bitcoin's code is open source, developers have the ability to modify it and create new digital currencies whenever they want.Digital Currencies' Growing VisibilityCryptocurrencies have been generating more and more visibility, drawing the interest of both investors and the mainstream media.The interest of investors may be a bit easier to measure, as the total market capitalization (market cap) of digital currencies gives us a sense of how much funding market participants are putting into this particular space.The total market cap of these digital assets rose to as much as $305.4 billion yesterday, additional CoinMarketCap data shows.At this point, this figure has risen more than 1,600% YTD.What's Next For Litecoin?Even after hitting its latest high, Litecoin has another milestone in sight. After reaching its recent record of $93.29, the digital currency was less than 8% from reaching $100.Should Litecoin hit this particular milestone, it could draw greater investor interest and cause the digital currency to enjoy notable gains.On the other hand, Litecoin could suffer significant losses if cryptocurrencies are indeed in a bubble and that bubble bursts. In that case, the value of this altcoin could drop sharply.Disclosure: I own some Bitcoin and Ether. "

Surely, they’d be millionaires by now.But is the meteoric rise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies really an indication of true value?It seems that more and more people justify investing in cryptocurrencies — even at current record prices — by claiming that they’re an effective hedge against the instability of fiat currencies.But is it true?Sure, a fiat money system where central banks can and do literally print money at will has its weaknesses. That’s why hard assets like gold are so popular among smart investors: as real stores of value, they provide a safety net against currency depreciation.However, it’s doubtful that the same applies to cryptocurrencies. Despite what the crypto-evangelists will tell you, digital tokens will never and can never replace gold as your financial hedge.Here are six reasons why.The definition of “fiat money” is a currency that is legal tender but not backed by a physical commodity.Since the United States abandoned the gold standard in the 1970s, this has been the case with all major currencies, including the US dollar.Ever since then, U.S. money supply has kept increasing, and so has the national debt. In contrast, the dollar’s purchasing power has been on the decline.Take a look at this historical gold price chart.Source: Hard Assets AllianceThe huge spike in gold prices started right around the time when the Bretton Woods agreement collapsed in 1971 and U.S. paper dollars couldn’t be converted to gold anymore. A clear sign of the decline in the dollar’s purchasing power since the move into a pure fiat money system.It’s clear that cryptocurrencies partially fit the definition of fiat money. They may not be legal tender yet, but they’re also not backed by any sort of physical commodity. And while total supply is artificially constrained, that constraint is just... well, artificial.You can’t compare that to the physical constraint on gold’s supply.Some countries are also exploring the idea of introducing government-backed cryptocurrencies, which would take them one step closer toward fiat-currency status.As Russia, India, and Estonia are considering their own digital money, Dubai has already taken it one step further. In September, the kingdom announced that it has signed a deal to launch its own blockchain-based currency known as emCash.So ask yourself, how can you effectively hedge against a fiat money system with another type of fiat money?An asset is only valuable if other people are willing to trade it in return for goods, services, or other assets.Gold is one of the most liquid assets in existence. You can convert it into cash on the spot, and its value is not bound by national borders. Gold is gold—anywhere you travel in the world, you can exchange gold for whatever the local currency is.The same cannot be said about cryptocurrencies. While they’re being accepted in more and more places, broad, mainstream acceptance is still a long way off.What makes gold so liquid is the immense size of its market. The larger the market for an asset, the more liquid it is. According to the World Gold Council, the total value of all gold ever mined is about $7.8 trillion.By comparison, the total size of the cryptocurrency market stands at about $161 billion as of this writing — and that market cap is split among 1,170 different cryptocurrencies.That’s a long shot from becoming as liquid and widely accepted as gold.Many Wall Street veterans compare the current rise of cryptocurrencies to the Internet in the early 1990s.Most stocks that had risen in the first wave of the Internet craze were wiped out after the burst of the dot-com bubble in 2000. The crash, in turn, gave rise to more sustainable Internet companies like Google and Amazon, which thrive to this day.The same will probably happen with cryptocurrencies. Most of them will get wiped out in the first serious correction. Only a few will become the standard, and nobody knows which ones at this point.And if major countries like the US jump in and create their own digital currency, they will likely make competing “private” currencies illegal. This is no different from how privately issued banknotes are illegal (although they were legal during the Free Banking Era of 1837–1863).So while it’s likely that cryptocurrencies will still be around years from now, the question is, which ones? There is no need for such guesswork when it comes to gold.Security is a major drawback facing the cryptocurrency community. It seems that every other month, there is some news of a major hack involving a Bitcoin exchange.In the past few months, the relatively new cryptocurrency Ether has been a target for hackers. The combined total amount stolen has almost reached $82 million.Bitcoin, of course, has been the largest target. Based on current prices, just one robbery that took place in 2011 resulted in the hackers taking hold of over $3.7 billion worth of bitcoin—a staggering figure. With security issues surrounding cryptocurrencies still not fully rectified, their capability as an effective hedge is compromised.When was the last time you heard of a gold depository being robbed? Not to mention the fact that most depositories have full insurance coverage.Since the beginning of the year, the value of Bitcoin has more than quadrupled — a tremendous spike in value that has sent investors rushing to invest in cryptocurrencies. But could this be nothing more than a market bubble?One of the world’s most successful hedge fund managers, Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates, certainly seems to think so.In September 2017, he told CNBC, “It's not an effective storehold of wealth because it has volatility to it, unlike gold. Bitcoin is a highly speculative market. Bitcoin is a bubble.”The spike in Bitcoin prices seems to only lend credence to this view. With such an extreme degree of volatility, cryptocurrencies’ value as a hedge is questionable. Most people buy them for the sole reason of selling them later at higher prices.This is pure speculation, not hedging.Cryptocurrencies have been around for less than a decade, whereas gold has been used as a store of value for thousands of years. Because of this long history, we know for a fact that stocks and bonds have low or negative correlations with gold, particularly during periods of economic recession. This makes gold a powerful hedge.What little data we have on cryptocurrencies does not show the same. Consider this year alone: while the U.S. stock market continues to run record highs, the same goes for Bitcoin.It’s true that gold has also gone up, but the correlation has been very low and, during times of recessions, tends to swing to the negative side, as you can see in the graph below.Source: Hard Assets AllianceSince 2010, there have been 15 times where the S&P 500 has seen drops of 5% or more. Out of those 15 stock market downturns, Bitcoin has been down for 10 of them.How is that a good hedge?"

With so many different reports, it can be hard to make sense of the cryptocurrency landscape. One thing’s for certain—Bitcoin is just the tip of the iceberg. There are so many promising blockchain projects sprouting up with millennials leading the way. From 24-year-old Vitalik Buterin who founded Ethereum, now the world’s second largest cryptocurrency to 26-year-old Justin Sun, who seeks to reinvent how digital creators get paid for their online content with TRON.Our generation is shaping the biggest wave of innovation since the creation of the internet. And it’s just the beginning.I wanted to get to the insider’s scoop on the blockchain world so I invited Mel Gelderman and David Hoggard, the founders of TokenCard to join me on the Unconventional Life Podcast this week. These two twenty-somethings raised 16.7M in just 6 minutes during an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) crowdsale. TokenCard is a mobile app that works worldwide allowing token holders to use their digital assets in real-time, in the real world, as real money.Source: Tristan BejawnOn the fence about cryptocurrency? Check out what these insiders had to say about getting involved.1. Crypto Is The New Paradigm. Hoggard and Gelderman stress that there is an incredible amount of opportunity in the Blockchain space right now. “The barriers to entry are quite low. For people looking to do something interesting with their life, blockchain is such a staggering opportunity.” Hoggard says.If you want to begin learning the skills check out blockgeeks.com for technical tutorials and instruction on understanding cryptocurrency and the blockchain.2. Here’s How To Get Started. While Hoggard and Gelderman believe that TokenCard will be the easiest point of entry for someone looking to get started with cryptocurrencies, their project won’t be released for another 6 months.Alternatively, the best option right now is to sign up on Coinbase. They have an incredibly user-friendly interface that even beginners can learn to use quickly. One downside is your options are limited compared to the more complex cryptocurrency exchanges. Right now on Coinbase you can buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and most recently Bitcoin Cash3. Crypto Is Just The Beginning. Hoggard and Geldermann are betting big on the trend of tokenization. They see a future where anything that has value will be “tokenized.”This could mean that one day with TokenCard you’ll be able to hold any number of assets including cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, something physical like gold, shares of company like Apple stock, or even a fraction of the Mona Lisa.“We don’t think you even need to hold dollars or pounds in the future we think people will literally be spending with their Mona Lisa tokens or with their gold or with their Apple stock, only what they want to hold not what they think they need to hold simply because it’s the only thing that’s accepted. People will literally be able to walk into McDonalds and pay with their Mona Lisa tokens and that’s why we created this company,” Gelderman says4. Don’t Be Afraid To Fail. Gelderman and Hoggard say they’ve always sought out the cutting edge because it makes them feel alive. The prospect of doing something new and exciting can fill you with a deep sense of purpose.The problem with doing something new is that there isn’t a playbook. If you’re considering getting involved in this space, you’re going to make mistakes. The crypto market can seem unpredictable but there’s no denying that in the long-term it’s been steadily rising to exponential proportions.If you do decide to invest in cryptocurrency, you have to notice the opportunities in front of you and be willing to take a chance. Sitting on the sidelines might protect you from failure but it robs you from the chance to capitalize on this opportunity.5. Beware The FOMO-FUD Cycle. There is a ton of news and information being published 24/7 about cryptocurrency. How do you make sense of it all?It’s important to know that the newscycle switches between spreading FOMO and FUD. FOMO is the fear of missing out that causes people to jump in and invest. FUD is the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that gets spread around prompting people to jump ship and sell.People who have been paying attention to cryptos know that this FOMO-FUD cycle is common so they aren’t as easily swayed.Enjoyed this post?

Burniske previously worked at ARK Investment Management, which was the first public fund manager to invest in one of the only securities to offer exposure to Bitcoin, the Bitcoin Investment Trust.Recalling that time before the investment, Burniske says, ARK, as a fiduciary, first developed deep conviction in the technology and also in the price and the potential for its appreciation. ""But when we made the investment in September 2015 and put GBTC, the Bitcoin Investment Trust, into two of ARK’s ETFs, we drew a lot of fire — we probably had more negative reactions than positive fanfare. That was 'blockchain not Bitcoin' season. That was when much of financial services thought these native assets to be irrelevant, or a distraction at best. People were saying, you consider yourself a specialist in technology? It’s not about Bitcoin anymore. That’s so 2013. It’s about blockchain. That just led me to dig in my heels,"" says Burniske in the latest episode of my podcast, Unchained (Google Play, iTunes, iHeartRadio, Stitcher or TuneIn Radio).Chris Burniske, partner at Placeholder Ventures and author of CryptoassetsBut given all the speculation and hype, how does Burniske determine how much of a crypto asset's price is real value and how much is froth?  ""If we think of each protocol as an isolated economy, we can actually use the equation [MV=PQ] to map the flow of the crypto asset to provision the digital good or service [of] this crypto-economy,"" he says. M is the monetary base to support an economy -- $4 trillion for the U.S. economy, $75 billion (at the time of the recording) for Bitcoin. V refers to the velocity, or the number of times a currency will change hands within a particular time frame such a s year. P is the average price of a basket of goods, and Q is the quantity of the digital asset, which can be determined by looking at the supply schedule, or how many of the tokens will be released over time.In reality, a fair amount of tokens will be ""hodled,"" (hodl is a Bitcoin inside joke for hold based on a drunken, typo-riddled message on the Bitcoin Talk forum), requiring the tokens in circulation to move through the economy as a greater pace in order to make up for the tokens being held. That should help keep the price up, because otherwise, Burniske says, ""If the entire asset base is just whipping around and being used within this digital economy, you could make an argument that some of these protocols supporting hundreds of billions of dollars in economic activity but actually storing very little."" For instance, proof-of-stake systems in which asset holders have to stake or bond their tokens in order to secure transactions could create incentives for users to ""hodl.""In this substantive episode, we also cover how he chooses what figures to settle on for the assumptions in his equation and how one determines how much a crypto token might be worth a certain number of years in the future in a process called ""discounting."" (Hint: compared to high-growth equities, cryptos take discount rates about three times higher, to compensate crypto investors for the risk they take.)We also discuss the prospects for a Bitcoin ETF, why crypto derivatives will be important for the space, and why Bitcoin ETFs aren't really going to be that exciting compared to what can be created by public blockchains.

Tapscott ...","Editors' Pick|Nov 1, 2017,04:02pm EDT","NextBlock Global, a venture capital company investing in digital assets that is going public in Canada and raising $100 million CAD ($77 million USD), falsely named four blockchain stars as advisors in an investor document. ","The company’s chief executive officer, Alex Tapscott, is known for coauthoring, with his father Don, a book on blockchain technology, “Blockchain Revolution: How The Technology Behind Bitcoin Is Changing Money, Business And The World,” which was a Globe and Mail bestseller.NextBlock Global CEO Alex TapscottAn investor deck sent out by a broker via email Thursday, October 19, which touted its “access” and “unparalleled relationships” as its top selling point, listed eight advisors, including former U.S. Department of Justice prosecutor and current Coinbase Board of Directors member Kathryn Haun; serial blockchain entrepreneur Vinny Lingham, CEO of blockchain identity startup Civic and a shark on South Africa’s Shark Tank; Dmitry Buterin, father of Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin; and Karen Gifford, a special advisor for global regulatory affairs at Ripple who was previously counsel and officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. “I’m not an advisor and I never have been,” Haun told Forbes. “I’m not an advisor to his fund,” said Lingham by phone. Buterin confirmed he had been approached to be an advisor but had declined. Through a press representative, Gifford stated that she is not an advisor and that she never spoke with Tapscott about becoming one. The page of the NextBlock Global deck listing four advisors who never agreed to be advisors.When Haun found out Tapscott had listed her as an advisor and confronted him, she says he claimed that the deck listing her as an advisor hadn’t gone out electronically, though Forbes has learned of at least four investors who received it that way. He then promised her he would issue a correction to potential investors who had received the misleading copies. The following Monday, Tapscott forwarded to Lingham a deck labeled “final” that no longer contained the falsely identified advisors and at least one investor received that deck, but three investors who received the previous deck naming Buterin, Gifford, Haun and Lingham as advisors confirmed that they never received the updated version.When reached by phone and asked about the four falsely named advisors, Tapscott said, “None of those people have appeared in the deck with the exception of Kathryn Haun.” When told Forbes had a copy of a deck naming the other three, he said, “They were listed in a draft version of a deck.” The “draft” including them was labeled version 5 and was circulated just two business days before the final. Tapscott also told Forbes the inclusion of Buterin was “another misconception,” and said of the listing of Gifford and Lingham, “Karen and Vinny were in a draft version of the deck which never got used because I was not able to confirm with them. I had conversations with them. They seemed open to the idea but when I couldn’t confirm them, I took them out of the deck, I did not use their names to market my transaction.” As mentioned above, at least three investors never received a deck that didn't name them as advisors. Lingham confirmed he was approached, but as stated above, Gifford had no such conversation with Tapscott. The inclusion of Haun, the former U.S. prosecutor and Coinbase board member, was especially egregious because the San Francisco-based startup, which is backed by Andreessen Horowitz, the New York Stock Exchange and Union Square Ventures, is the first crypto unicorn and probably the most recognized brand in the space. A source in both the traditional investment and blockchain communities in Canada said, “You don’t know how many people I know who run hedge funds told me they were investing [in NextBlock] because he had someone from Coinbase involved. Canada is a very parochial market. On Bay Street — Canada’s equivalent of Wall Street — Coinbase and Kathryn have star power. The Canadian institutions said, Oh wow, this is the best deal because this guy has all these contacts. They invested based on that representation.” He said in Canada, Tapscott had an aura from his book and other blockchain activities that he had gotten close to crypto heavyweights in Silicon Valley and therefore had the best deal flow.An American crypto investor who received decks from three brokers but never received the “final” that did not include these four falsely named advisors said the four seemed carefully chosen. “In the case of Vitalik’s dad [Buterin, the father of Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin], it lends credibility that they’ll have access to exciting deals in the Ethereum ecosystem. In the case of Vinny Lingham, he is a well-known, celebrated entrepreneur in the Bitcoin ecosystem. In the case of Katie Haun, she is the former cryptocurrency czar at the Department of Justice, so it makes look like she’s affiliating and lending legal credibility. In the case of [Gifford], Ripple is the third most-valuable cryptocurrency. So they’ve got an ex-DOJ person, an Ethereum person, a Bitcoin person and a Ripple person. But all of it’s all false. It’s not OK to do that.” (Bitcoin and Ethereum are the top two crpytocurrencies by market capitalization.)When Lingham first emailed Tapscott saying people were asking him if he was advising the fund, Tapscott wrote back, “You are (obviously) not an advisor and have not been listed as one! So bizarre.”Lingham replied that he was looking at a deck that had his headshot and bio listed under advisors and wrote, “please don’t lie to me.” Tapscott responded that he had put Lingham in an early version of the deck after they had discussed the possibility of Lingham advising and then asserted he had removed Lingham. “Anyway mea culpa for listing you in the first place but I want you to know I am not raising money on your reputation or name and not misrepresenting you,” he wrote. Lingham told Forbes, “The irony is that I’m running an identity company, and my identity is being stolen.” Aside from two projects Propy and MetalPay, he said he does no other advisory work: “After Propy and Metal, I’ve stopped doing any ICOs because I have a large following and influence, and I don’t want to abuse that.”Tapscott told Forbes, “This is all so ridiculous, because I’m not raising money on the back of these advisors. I currently have an order book for this financing of $250 million. To me that’s really the big story. None of the folks have invested based on the people who are in the deck, including obviously the ones who agreed to be advisors to the company.”(However, the behavior about using others' reputations without their permission may be part of a pattern. After initial publication of this story, Forbes learned that when the Tapscotts announced their Blockchain Research Institute and listed Andreas Antonopoulos as ""proposed faculty,"" the well-known blockchain and Bitcoin author and speaker declared on Twitter, ""I did not agree and will not be part of the Blockchain Research Institute as ""proposed faculty"". The announcement saying that is false."" Tapscott did not immediately respond to requests to comment on this particular incident.)On Tuesday, the size of the raise was increased from $50 million CAD to $100 million. An email to investors with a section labeled Investor Highlights, had as its first bullet: “led by globally recognized Blockchain thought leaders and investors.”The banks underwriting the offering include Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) Capital Markets, one of Canada’s so-called “Big Five,” which refers to the country’s five biggest banks, and investment bank Cannacord Genuity, Tapscott’s former employer. The deck with the four falsely named advisors also stated Lingham had raised $100 million in an ICO, when he had, in fact, raised $33 million — a simple number to fact check. The banks did not respond to requests for comment by press time.The reverse takeover (RTO) maneuver NextBlock is using to go public, as opposed to a traditional initial public offering, is a shortcut that enables the company to become public with less regulatory oversight. An RTO starts with a capital pool company (CPC) — a shell company — that then gets listed on TSX’s Venture Exchange. (In the NextBlock Global RTO, the shell is called Nobelium Tech.) The CPC then identifies a company to acquire — in this case, NextBlock — and creates a document on that business for TSXV to review to ensure it meets the minimum requirements for listing. The deal typically closes with the CPC changing its name. Tapscott says he went with an RTO rather than an IPO for speed and cost.Both the deck containing the misrepresentations as well as the final begin with blurbs for the Tapscotts’ book, “Blockchain Revolution,” from Silicon Valley venture firm Andreessen Horowitz’s Marc Andreessen, another top VC, Tim Draper of Draper Associates and DFJ, Innovator’s Dilemma author Clay Christensen and Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak. Version 5 describes Tapscott’s credentials as a “world leading authority on blockchain,” a founding member of the IMF Fintech Advisory Board and World Economic Forum Blockchain Global Future Council, and advisor and investor in numerous blockchain startups, including one well-known ICO, Cosmos. In the deck with the misrepresentations, the first example of how NextBlock is different is called, “Access,” and then mentions the pre-ICO allocation it had for Lingham’s Civic token and says, “Alex and Vinny are both well known figures in the blockchain space and have remained close friends. As a result of our relationships, we were granted a guaranteed pre-ICO allocation for Civic tokens and so did not even need to participate in the highly competitive ICO.” The two met on Richard Branson’s Necker Island for the 2016 Blockchain Summit, which Haun also attended. Lingham called the assertion that they were close friends “a stretch.”A page from the NextBlock Global investor deck touting its relationship to Vinny LinghamAlthough the final deck does not list the four falsely identified advisors, it still makes access its main selling point. Under “Our Value Add,” the first bullet listed is “Business development/Commercial relationships: Access to our proprietary enterprise network of partners, customers and clients.” Under “Key Differentiators,” it boasts of “exclusive access,” “unparalleled relationships” with the “highest profile figures in blockchain around the world.” Update, Wednesday, November 1, 2017 at 6:55pm EST: This post has been updated to add that, after publication, Forbes learned that the Tapscotts had previously named Andreas Antonopoulos as proposed faculty for their Blockchain Research Institute and afterward, Antonopoulos declared that was false. The article also now includes an additional fact about RTOs, which is that the RTO typically completes with a name change of the CPC."

[+] value of a single bitcoin, and options to buy or sell, on an app for the digital asset broker, Coinbase, in London on November 20, 2017. (Photo credit: JUSTIN TALLIS/AFP/Getty Images)"," A new year brings the opportunity to take stock in yourself and make a resolution to become a more educated and informed investor. These are the apps I plan to use most frequently in 2018:(Disclosure: I have no financial stake in any of these companies and receive no compensation for anything in this article)1. CoinbaseEveryone (and their grandmother) is babbling about Bitcoin these days, driving prices up and causing pundits to talk about tulips.I'm wary of calling bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ""investments,"" as they seem to fit the classic definition of ""speculation"" (WWBGT -- What Would Benjamin Graham Think?).Graham said to never mix your investing account with your speculative account, so here's a solution: Coinbase is an easy way to buy and sell Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum in one account. The app has a very simple interface that allows you to track prices, and you can make transactions using a bank account or even a credit card. Make sure to read their fee structure first.Remarkably, Coinbase even hit #1 on the App Store for a few days.2. Personal CapitalPersonal Capital is a terrific finance tracking tool to help you manage your investments, especially if you have multiple accounts with different firms. Their trademarked ""You Index"" tracks your performance across all of your accounts and compares it to benchmarks like the Dow and the S&P 500.You can work with one of their financial advisors, if you're so inclined, for a reasonable annual fee based on managed assets. When I registered and linked my accounts, I received a free consultation with my assigned advisor, who had previously worked for Charles Schwab and Edward Jones. Since I manage my own investments, I declined this service.Personal Capital also has a budgeting tool, which is not nearly as robust as Mint's, but for keeping track of your investments, Personal Capital blows Mint out of the water.3. Yahoo! FinanceYahoo! Finance is still one of the best investing information resources available, and their app is my go-to for news and real-time data throughout the trading day. The ability to quickly and easily browse videos, read basic charts and view financials (all for free!) make this app stand out.They've recently added a feature allowing you to link your broker account so you can easily trade through the app, but I have not tried this out, nor do I plan on doing so anytime in the future.4. RobinhoodRobinhood seems too good to be true -- commission-free trading from your phone with no minimum balance, and a referral program that offers a free random share of stock for both you and the friend you've referred. Their Robinhood Gold program even allows you to trade on margin.So what's the catch? Well, the app is extremely basic and doesn't offer much in the way of research and analysis. For the time being, Robinhood is not available for the web, but the company plans to offer a web platform next year.I received an email from the company yesterday saying that they were planning to expand into free options trading, which could be a game-changer. If you're looking for commission-free trading with a no-frills platform, it's hard to beat Robinhood.5. StockTwitsThe so-called ""Twitter for investors,"" StockTwits is a community of traders exchanging ideas, news and complaints (so many complaints!). When you post a message, you're supposed to check a box indicating if you're bullish or bearish about the stock you're posting about, and it's fascinating to see how investor sentiment changes over time.The community seems to have a lot of day traders interested in technical analysis, but still holds value for fundamental investors. As always, separating the wheat from the chaff is a challenge, but I've been able to find breaking news here that's not being reported in Yahoo! Finance (specifically when it comes to analyst's upgrades or downgrades).They even have their own rallying cry: BTFD (""Buy the F'n Dip"") and an online store selling ugly Christmas sweaters.6. LearnIf your New Year's Resolution involves finally learning how to get started with investing, I highly recommend Learn. It contains clear, concise and easy to follow text and audio lessons about investing basics. Topics include ""What is a Stock?"", ""Balance Sheets"" and ""Mistakes to Avoid.""It's pretty basic stuff, so experienced investors would be better served sticking with a site like Investopedia.7. StockpileStockpile allows investors to buy fractional shares of stock. If the thought of buying a company trading at $1,000 a share scares you, you can buy $100 worth and get 0.10 shares. The app interface is similar to Robinhood's and also has limited research and analysis, but Stockpile charges $0.99 to make a trade and requires a $5 minimum investment.Stockpile doesn't allow you to buy companies trading below $6.00, so if you want to trade penny stocks, you should look elsewhere.One unique feature is the ability to send gift cards for stocks -- you can send someone shares (or partial shares) of a stock and the recipient can exchange that stock for a different one.I know I'd rather get a share of stock in my stocking than a lump of coal, but I'm not sure how excited my wife would be if I gave her a gift card for Tiffany's stock instead of a diamond bracelet."

The firm announced on Tuesday the launch of bitFlyer USA, a San Francisco-based virtual currency exchange for U.S. traders to buy and sell Bitcoin. The new platform, designed for professionals who trade at least $100,000 in virtual currency each month, will enable traders to place market, limit and other complex trade orders and give traders the ability to connect to the firm’s Japanese exchange.“Our expansion and upcoming cross-border trading addresses a huge unmet need in the U.S. by institutional traders looking to access large amounts of liquidity across multiple virtual currency markets,” said Bartek Ringwelski, bitFlyer USA’s chief operating officer, in the Tuesday statement. “Through our web interface or API, approved professional traders can be up and running and making trades in a matter of hours.”bitFlyer, which opened its San Francisco office in August, says its Japanese exchange has traded more than $100 billion in virtual currency so far this year. The firm's U.S. launch broadens access to cryptocurrency trading via exchanges in a market that’s been noticeably burdened by a complex regulatory environment (varying state-to-state) and, as a result, dominated by a few key players, including Coinbase's GDAX, Bitstamp and Bitfinex.As part of the Tuesday announcement, bitFlyer said it received regulatory approval over the weekend to operate its exchange in New York, becoming just the fourth company to be granted the New York State Department of Financial Services’ “BitLicense,” which allows those possessing it to engage in virtual currency business in the state.San Francisco-based Coinbase is the only other exchange operator to be awarded a BitLicense by the New York DFS. In a statement issued by the New York DFS when it approved Coinbase’s BitLicense in January, the department reaffirmed its rigorous review standards for such licenses, with New York’s Financial Services Superintendent, Maria Vullo, saying: ""Through the creation and promotion of strong state-based regulation, DFS continues New York’s long record of being responsive to technological innovation… New York is committed to fostering and encouraging the long-term growth of new industries throughout the state while enforcing all necessary safeguards to protect our markets and consumers.”By volume, Coinbase’s GDAX is one of the most popular exchanges in the world. Its latest 24-hour trading volume of $523 million is nearly half made up of bitcoin-to-USD trades. From its Japanese exchange, bitFlyer’s one-day volume currently stands at the equivalent of about $159 million, per CoinMarketCap.With the recent New York approval and another in Alabama, bitFlyer says it now has a regulatory green light to operate in 41 states and the District of Columbia, besting the count listed on Coinbase’s website of 37 regulatory approvals in the U.S.For bitFlyer's new exchange, granting U.S. traders access to Japan’s cryptocurrency market taps the liquidity of a country with a high concentration of Bitcoin trading. According to data from digital currency platform CryptoCompare, trade volume in Japanese yen leads Bitcoin trading among all fiat currencies. The momentum of yen-to-Bitcoin trading has exploded since late 2015, when it averaged about 10% of global volume. To compare, in the last 24 hours, Bitcoin trading in Japanese yen has made up more than 60% of total trading volume. Meanwhile, the figure for the U.S. dollar is about 20%. The national currency with the third-largest Bitcoin trading volume, at about 10%, hails from South Korea, where the popularity of exchanges has bolstered access to cryptocurrencies since around March of this year.And while exchange competition heightens, news of growing institutional trading options for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has come in waves over the past few weeks.Earlier this month, Coinbase announced it’s launching a digital asset custodian meant to provide financial controls and secure storage for institutional investors trading digital currencies. “An even greater number of traditional institutions are starting to look at trading digital assets (including family offices, sovereign wealth funds, traditional hedge funds and more). By some estimates, there is $10 billion of institutional money waiting on the sidelines to invest in digital currency today,” said Coinbase CEO and Co-Founder Brian Armstrong in a letter addressing the launch of Coinbase Custody. Meanwhile, J.P. Morgan has reportedly been eyeing the launch of CME Group’s Bitcoin futures, slated for release later this year -- in spite of CEO Jamie Dimon’s Bitcoin attacks just months ago.And while Dimon may not be alone in his bearishness, current trader sentiment is more riddled by polarization than outright defiance. Results from a poll of institutional traders conducted earlier this month by New York-based Triad Securities revealed that an overwhelming majority of respondents, most of whom reported buy-side employers, reported low or medium-level confidence in crypto-asset liquidity on U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges. Nearly half said that Bitcoin's a bubble due for an inevitable crash.But despite the negativity, nearly 70% said they had invested in, or considered investing in, cryptocurrencies, and nearly 40% said they see Bitcoin as a macroeconomic tool capable of hedging against monetary policy.Founded by two alumni of Goldman Sachs in 2014, bitFlyer has raised about $36 million in funding thus far. Fees for the U.S. exchange during a beta testing period ranged from 0.11% to 0.25% for both takers and makers, depending on volume -- in line with those at other exchanges. GDAX fees for Bitcoin transactions, for comparison, are up to .25% for takers and 0% for makers. bitFlyer said it’s planning to expand its support of U.S. offerings to include Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Litecoin and others within the next year while it works with regulators to offer global trading in the future."

""I think Jamie Dimon is wrong.""In September, Dimon set off the cryptocurrency community when the chief executive of JPMorgan called bitcoin and its fellow cryptocurrencies a ""novelty."" But to traditional venture capital firms like IVP, it's become an increasingly interesting item on the menu.When IVP led a $100 million investment into Coinbase in August, it valued Coinbase at $1.6 billion. The firm distinguished the leading cryptocurrency wallet and exchange from others because of a growth curve it deemed resilient to the rise (and risk of a fall) of two if its best known currencies, bitcoin and Ethereum. In the months to come, IVP will look to make more investments in the blockchain and its protocols, says Chaffee: ""Our thesis is it's here, it's real, it's growing and needs infrastructure.More cryptocurrency-related investments could prove one of the biggest shifts for IVP with its new $1.5 billion fund, the firm's sixteenth and $100 million larger than its previous largest fund raised in 2015. The 37-year-old firm writes check sizes of $40 million to $50 million, typically into companies that have already raised two or three previous funding rounds from venture capitalists. IVP's an investor in more than 20 startups valued at least one billion dollars besides Coinbase, including Domo, Dropbox, The Honest Company and Slack.Aside from the promotion of Tom Loverro and Roseanne Wincek to principal, IVP is returning the same partners for the new fund. They include Chaffee, Somesh Dash, Steve Harrick, Eric Liaw, Jules Maltz, Sandy Miller and Dennis Phelps. The firm had several exits in the past few months as the Series B lead investor in Snapchat maker Snap and Series D lead for AppDynamics, an enterprise company that was acquired in January for $3.7 billion.Despite what Chaffee freely admits is ""a lot of capital"" in the private tech company markets today, the investor says that the firm has seen entrepreneurs with better experience and financially healthier companies in the past few months than previously. ""It feels like we got a little ahead of ourselves in the hype and enthusiasm of 2013, 2014 and 2015,"" he says.With Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son and his Vision Fund the latest entrant to offer money to private companies at a multi-hundred million dollar clip, IVP doesn't expect a rush of companies to go public soon. ""What we hear is, we are doing great, so why go?""If Chaffee's right and tech's founders are getting more sophisticated, on average, with each batch, gaming the transition to public markets will be a problem they'll be glad to have. Hustling for IVP's bumper crop of unicorns, the investor says he welcomes a warming up of the M+A environment in months to come. ""If they're smart, they can extend the natural life of their company,"" Chaffee says. ""It's a little bit of a mystery as to why corporate development teams aren't a bit more aggressive right now."" "

These concepts have taken the world by surprise with their cutting-edge approach and multiple benefits, some of which include decentralized systems, saving money, no need for intermediaries and so on.If you aren't convinced, you should know that the market capital of cryptocurrencies was $185,182,008,333 at time of writing.However, there are mixed feelings when it comes to online money: Mainstream media views it as dangerous and volatile, while its enthusiasts claim it is a force for good.So, which is it? In order to answer this question let’s dig deeper into the matter.Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for security. Cryptocurrencies live online and are not controlled by any company or government. They also have a higher monetary value than traditional currency: The price of Bitcoin has doubled in a month and is up 180% since the start of 2017 because of the surging demand for cryptocurrency.The innovation behind most famous cryptocurrencies today is Bitcoin. Created in 2009, it is a worldwide digital payment system that transfers value as fast and as efficiently as data. The plus is that it is free from government interference and can be shared instantly online.The underlying technology Bitcoin uses is blockchain, which is defined as: ""a decentralized ledger that keeps a record of all transactions that take place across a peer-to-peer network. All online activities are organized into chunks of data named blocks, which are linked to one another forming a block chain. Through the use of miners that monitor, verify and record the transactions, every party involved in that business network can witness and access their log of transactions."" Yes, it’s pretty amazing.Moving further, an upgrade to Bitcoin is Ethereum. Since it was launched in 2015, Ethereum has gained in both popularity and in financial worth. Unlike Bitcoin, it is actually a platform, showing tremendous potential because you can run apps on its network. It has its own digital currency, Ether, which supports smart contracts.The Nomad Community is one example of a company that is playing it smart. It is based inside the Ethereum blockchain for the many benefits it brings. I spoke to the CEO, who shared that Ethereum incorporates ""a decentralized digital public record of transactions that are secure, anonymous, tamper-proof and unchangeable.""Why would anyone consider investing in cryptocurrencies?The answer is: smart contracts, share trading, speed of financial transactions and safety.Smart contracts: Smart contracts are a piece of code that facilitate the exchange of anything of value, including money, content, property and shares. Commercial transactions and agreements are conducted automatically without the need for a middleman, as the smart contract enforces the obligations of all involved parties.Share trading: It won’t be long until share trading will be impacted by the new technology. Blockchain technology has the potential to enable greater trade accuracy and a shorter settlement process.Speed of financial transactions: Transferring money has always been a long and expensive process, especially when it comes to cross-border payments. Blockchain technology not only makes the process faster and simpler -- it also significantly lowers cost.Safety: Blockchain is one of the most secure technologies that currently exists because it has defined financial rules and a clear process for verifying transactions. From healthcare giants to banks, most corporations are looking to implement this technology for safe use.""The blockchain keeps everyone honest, and a whole layer of banking bureaucracy is removed, lowering costs,"" says Paul Vigna in his book, ""The Age of Cryptocurrency."" This combination of increased honesty and security, as well as lowered costs, is why we will continue to see cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies taking the world by storm."

However, the focus of the new fund was on a then little known cryptocurrency called Bitcoin.","Dan KITWOOD / Getty ImagesBitcoin had recently been in the news because ~$450M worth had recently been stolen from a cryptocurrency exchange called Mt. Gox (abbreviated Magic: The Gathering online eXchange).  At the time, Bitcoin was little known outside of its status as the de facto currency for illicit online transactions.  Online marketplaces like The Silk Road were its only demonstrated use case, and the theft of almost half a billion dollars of the cryptocurrency from an ""exchange"" named after a fantasy-based card game did little for Bitcoin's credibility.In this environment, Pantera raised $150 million to launch a Bitcoin focused fund that would serve as a buy and hold vehicle for several institutional investors like Fortress interested in the space.Three years later, Pantera's Bitcoin Fund has returned in excess of 25,000% to its early investors.  For context, the best performing traditional hedge funds that SumZero tracks outperform the market by percentage points, not orders of magnitude.Mike Novogratz, now a billionaire on the Forbes 400 list, is reported as holding 20% of his personal net worth in Bitcoin and Ethereum.  He has said that ""[Bitcoin] is going to be the largest bubble of our lifetimes... you can make a whole lot of money on the way up, and we plan on it"".Kevin Harris from SumZero sat down with Paul Veradittakit, a Partner at Pantera, to hear his thoughts on the state of the crypto market, Bitcoin, and the active management of crypto assets.Kevin Harris, SumZero: Would you please briefly run us through Pantera’s history?  What was the catalyst for the fund’s pivot from a global macro strategy to the current exclusive focus on crypto?  Paul Veradittakit, Pantera Capital: Dan Morehead started the firm in 2003 as a global macro hedge fund.  Pantera eventually grew to manage over $1B under this strategy.  Prior to starting the fund, Dan was  CFO and Head of Global Macro Strategy at Tiger Management, one of the world’s largest hedge funds in the 1990s and run by the legendary investor Julian Robertson.  When the markets crashed in 2009, Pantera shut down its global macro hedge fund and sought to reposition itself.Dan came across the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2011 through his brother, who was mining Bitcoin at the time. Dan decided to buy a large amount  of Bitcoin as a speculative investment, and brought on partners to do so.  He worked with with Pete Briger and Mike Novogratz of Fortress Investment Group, Benchmark Capital, and Ribbit Capital and launched  the first institutional hedge fund focused exclusively on Bitcoin.  Dan went to Princeton with Pete and Mike, and they both have been investors and supporters in Pantera Capital.The fund initiated as  a buy and hold vehicle  exclusively  for  Bitcoin and was/is called the ‘Pantera Bitcoin Fund’.  The fund formally launched  in 2013 and bought into Bitcoin at  $72.  Currently, the fund has returned in excess of 25,000%.  This was the first of 6 different funds within Pantera, all exclusively focused on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies. Harris: What personally brought you into Pantera / crypto investing?  What is your role at the fund?  Veradittakit: I personally heard about Bitcoin in 2013 from my friends at Lightspeed Venture Partners, who  were making some early stage  investments in Bitcoin/blockchain startups.  Prior to that,  I had been a venture investor focused on investing in mobile apps and mobile infrastructure.  I had sourced and executed on my previous firm’s investment into App Annie, which later received funding from Sequoia Capital and became one of the leading data providers for mobile apps.  After reading the Bitcoin whitepaper and researching all I could about the currency and technology, I was inspired by the transformative power of the technology. .  I then came  across the opportunity to join the venture team at Pantera, and realized that there was no better time, team, and fit to join the crypto world.  I was very  fortunate to be early in two of the most disruptive spaces of the last decade, mobile and blockchain/cryptocurrency.  I am now a Partner on the investment team at Pantera and have spearheaded the Venture Capital Fund since 2014, and  helped  to launch both of our early stage cryptocurrency funds recently.  I split my time between our venture capital fund and ICO fund, doing sourcing, diligence, and portfolio management.Harris: Many emergent funds in the space were founded by teams with nontraditional finance backgrounds.  How has the more traditional hedge fund background of your founder and early partners impacted the fund?Veradittakit: The hedge fund experience of Dan Morehead and other members of the team has provided Pantera a clear edge in managing our cryptocurrency funds.  Our team has institutional hedge fund experience and that translated to expertise in starting up, executing strategy, and managing the fund.  Institutional investors appreciate Pantera approach to  the space. Our  management track record also acts as a source of credibility and trust for institutional investors who might otherwise be spooked at investing in such a volatile asset classThe Pantera team is extremely complementary, and also  makes our fund stand out from others.  Our team has hedge fund, venture capital, operational, and technical expertise.  The firm has 20 full-time professionals focused on the space, and is unrivaled in crypto active management.Harris: What have been the biggest challenges to managing a fund focused on crypto-based assets?  What advice do you have for other funds looking into entering the space?  Veradittakit: The biggest challenges we face relate to  security and regulation.  With security/custodian solutions still being developed by third party companies, and large banks not yet providing custodial  services, Pantera has had to create and manage its own solution.  Safeguarding our own assets is a very unique part of running a crypto hedge fund.  As to regulation, Pantera is partnered up with top law firms and regulatory experts to ensure that we stay abreast of new regulation and have an eye to the horizon for future decisions by the SEC. The advice I would have for other funds looking into entering would be to take your time in making sure that the right fund processes/operations are in place, particularly with regard to custody of your crypto assets.  Harris: Your fund is split between Bitcoin, ICOs, and Quant strategies.  Could you briefly walk us through the philosophy behind each strategy?Veradittakit: There’s in excess of $500M USD across Pantera’s different strategies, which are detailed below:Bitcoin – In Pantera’s first fund, we wanted to give investors exposure to cryptocurrencies. At at the time, Bitcoin was the only cryptocurrency that mattered.  We considered  making it more of an active fund instead of buy-hold, but our investors  wanted to buy and hold across a multiple year time horizon.    This obviously played out very well for them.  Venture Capital – We knew that killer use-cases of blockchain / distributed ledger technology would be a future driver of  value in the cryptocurrency space. Over the past few years, we came across many strong entrepreneurs entering  the space, and it made sense to invest into companies helping to facilitate the adoption and use-cases of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.  A list of these can be found on our website.  To date,  we have invested into companies helping people access/speculate on cryptocurrencies, cross-border payment companies, enterprise blockchain companies, new infrastructure blockchains, and token infrastructure companies. ICO – With our access and ability to evaluate projects at the earliest stage (team, whitepaper, tech), we implemented a fund investing into pre-ICO (presales) and helping projects through the ICO and beyond.Digital Asset Fund – Our tech team had strong backgrounds in machine learning / quantitative trading. We decided to explore several quant strategies, and to date they have performed remarkably well.    We feel that this fund will provide institutions the best way to get exposure to the entire space and the highest risk-adjusted returns.Harris: Very few crypto funds are currently running quantitative strategies.  Could you explain some of the opportunities that exist in the space? Veradittakit: The opportunities on the quant side are very appealing, especially if you have a team that is strong on both crypto, quantitative trading, and machine learning.  You can do arbitrage, long/short, etc.Our Digital Asset Fund is a well-weighted portfolio of high quality liquid assets we want exposure to, a set of good strategies we can generalize across markets, and a good execution system to drive both of those.  Execution in this market is extremely important because the market is so nascent, and you can’t simply pass your order off to a bank to execute like in the regular equities markets.We start with the algorithmic weighting of high quality crypto-assets, removing projects we believe are dubious or are based fraudulent technology, and getting us exposure to many market anomalies/factors such as size, betting against beta, low volatility, and momentum. Generally speaking, these are assets we would be happy to be holding long term.  With the Digital Asset Fund we’re aiming for consistent, reproducible, and rigorous quantitative strategies.Harris: Would you walk us through your view on the current state of the crypto market and the exuberant retail sentiment towards crypto?  Veradittakit: The crypto market became  frothy on the retail side during the summer, with up to  $1B going into ICOs a  month.  Now over $5B has  been invested  into ICOs this year.  After Segwit 2x, there has been a shift into Bitcoin, drawing  in  retail  investors because  of the resulting price hike. Positive news has also buoyed retail sentiment - ranging  from brand name companies like Square integrating Bitcoin, and the launch of Bitcoin futures.  These trends have also appealed to institutional investors, who now have more avenues to invest in the space.  In general, more money has been flowing from altcoins into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin over the past few months.  This has slowed the retail interest into ICOs relative to the summer, but we expect a rebalancing to more focus on ICOs.Harris: Based on your years of experience in the space, what crypto investing advice do you have for the general public?  What advice do you have for funds?Veradittakit: I would advise the public to only risk what they can lose. Do as much research as possible into the teams behind  projects before making an investment decision.  There have been many high profile ICO failures to date.  That being said, take advantage of being able to invest into these early stage projects as an unaccredited investor and back projects that you’re passionate about.  Prior to ICO’s, unaccredited investors were unable to invest in these VC style early stage projects, and the democratization of their financing, while risky represents a lot of potential for retail investors. I would advise fund managers to be patient with building up operations and to constantly be evaluating the fund thesis as the space changes rapidly.  We have significant operational experience, but still stay very nimble.Harris: What are your thoughts on the recent exponential price growth of crypto assets?  Have current prices exceeded your expectations?   Veradittakit: I think it’s great that the space is becoming more mainstream, but we’re still early in terms of realizing the potential impact of this technology on the world.  Even though prices have greatly exceeded my expectations, it’s important to recognize that we’re still very much still in the first inning. It’s important for people to stay hungry, build products, and execute, so that this ecosystem and prices can continue to rise in value the way that they have.Harris: Would you walk us through one of your early stage ICO investments? Prior to participating in the ICO/presale, how did you assign a valuation to the coin?  Generally, how reliable are your predictions as to performance? Veradittakit: I can talk about our investment process in general but  not specific investments.  Generally, we focus  on teams in what's close to  a VC framework.  The team is by far the most important factor in judging a potential investment.  We also look at the problems that are being solved, the product and its undergirding technology, and the strategies to scale the business.  In addition, we also look at the uses of the token and the token economics of the project.  A good example of this is the presale of Omisego (OMG), a Bangkok based venture backed company that prior to their ICO had raised $26M of funding.  They had proof of concept for an open payment platform, and were working with 8,000 merchants, including major brands like McDonalds.  Thailand’s Ministry of Finance had endorsed them, and they launched a ~$25M sale of tokens.  We were one of the bigger investors in the sale, and one of the only American investors.   We expected there to be a pop in the price of the tokens given the ICO price, but had no expectation of the ensuing 30-40x price growth over a short period. In terms of valuation, since we have exclusively focused on this space for years, we have a book comparable transactions that we look at. We also can compare any project we’re looking at to comparable projects that are publicly valued on an exchange.  So far, these tools have led to a very good track record of predictions. Harris: Which crypto assets’ performance have been the most surprising to you?Veradittakit: More generally, the performance of crypto assets has been more linked to community support and marketing more than I had expected.  Geographical support and marketing has been very important in this space, and as a result it’s good strategy to globally market crypto assets. Omisego’s performance surprised me. Harris: What do you think the most interesting ICO’s on the horizon are?  What emerging coins do you think have the highest upside?Veradittakit: Pantera has historically been most interested in projects where there’s a clear sense for decentralization and a strong call for the use  of a token.  Several large token based ICOs don’t have a strong call for the use of a token, and opportunistically are taking advantage of the frothiness of the market to fundraise. ICO’s that we look at have tended to be on the infrastructure side (with a focus on scalability), two sided marketplaces where intermediaries can be disrupted, and spaces where decentralization can expand the market through regulations or payments. Some of our recent investments fit this thesis:0x and Kyber – decentralized exchangesOrigin – decentralized sharing economyFunfair – decentralized casino gamesStream – decentralized content monetizationBloom – decentralized peer-to-peer credit-scoring and lendingHarris: What are the biggest problems you think are solvable through tokenization or creative uses of blockchain technology?Veradittakit: The biggest problems being solved revolve around the disintermediation  of rent-seeking middlemen, in a variety of industries. .  By providing the ability to perform trustless transactions, blockchain technology  removes the need for those rent-seeking intermediaries and other service providers.  Peer to peer transactions, facilitated through, and relying on blockchain technology is the future for any information based industry relying on middlemen. Harris: Could you walk us through Pantera’s valuation process for a cryptocurrency?  What commonalities are there between this and traditional equity valuation?  What specific metrics have you found to be most predictive of future performance? Veradittakit: I walked through our VC style valuation process above, but the actual valuation process is more similar to a traditional equity valuation than you might expect.  The biggest difference is that you are not just valuing the early stage company that you are implicitly investing in, but are also placing a value on the entire network of the token project at a very early stage.  This adds an extra layer of complexity to the VC model.  I believe that ICO funding structures will mature into a system based on multiple rounds of funding, bringing the valuation process close  to traditional VC equity investments. The metrics to be predictive of future performance remain to be seen.  I believe that it will be a combination of metrics that speak to the performance and usage of a product in combination with the strength of the community.Harris: If you were building a blind trust of crypto assets, what coins would you put in it?  How would you expect it to have performed come 2022? Veradittakit: I think that the space is too volatile to create any sort of blind trust.  I would invest into something like the Pantera Digital Asset Fund, where we have a quant-focused strategy that limits the volatility intrinsic to the space.  It would be investing into an equivalent of a smart index.  I think that will have performed very well come 2022. Harris: Where do you see the crypto sector in five to ten years?  What role will Pantera ideally play in its development? Veradittakit: I believe the crypto sector will continue to grow significantly over the next 5-10 years.  rices will be much higher, many more traditional top entrepreneurs will start  companies in the space, and projects/products will go  mainstream.  I believe that the future will be a world with a multitude of cryptocurrencies. Pantera will be the ultimate place to go for thought leadership, investment exposure to any desired strategy in the space, and a vibrant community of innovators creating this decentralized world. "

cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum and use leverage.","Nov 15, 2017,01:02pm EST","British financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), has issued a warning to consumers over what it has described as the “extremely high-risk” of buying Contracts for Differences (CFDs), speculative products that include financial spread bets, with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as the underlying investment that increasingly are being marketed to consumers.","The notice comes two months after the UK regulator issued a statement and consumer warning about the risks of Initial Coin Offerings (‘ICOs’). In a similar vein to the message earlier this week issued by the European Securities & Market Authority (ESMA), an EU financial regulator based in Paris, the FCA stated this September that ICOs are “very high-risk, speculative investments.”Cryptocurrency CFDs allow investors to speculate on a change in price of a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum and use leverage.The FCA expressed concern over the price volatility and value of cryptocurrencies, and therefore the value of CFDs, complex financial instruments that allow speculation on the price of an asset, linked to them. As such they are “vulnerable to sharp changes in price” due to unexpected events or changes in market sentiment, it stated. A case in point cited was the 30% decline in the price of Bitcoin late last week.Typically CFDs are offered with leverage, which means an investors only needs to put down a portion of the total value of the investment or contract. However, leverage also multiplies the impact of price changes on both profits and losses. The upshot is that one can lose money very rapidly.It noted that some firms are offering leverage, which multiplies your losses and potential profits, of up to 50:1. This can have a significant impact on fees and also places investors at risk of losing more than their initial investment.Furthermore, the FCA noted that charges in the space tend to be “significantly higher” than for other CFD products. Fees can include the spread (the difference between the prices at which a firm offers to buy or sell a CFD position), funding charges and commissions. While such fees many vary significantly between firms, they can impact the likelihood of making a profit or not.In terms of price transparency, the regulator stated: “When compared with currencies, there can be more significant variations in the pricing of cryptocurrencies used to determine the value of your CFD position. There is a greater risk you will not receive a fair and accurate price for the underlying cryptocurrency when trading.”Golden bitcoin and smartphone on wooden background as a cryptocurrency concept. (Image:... [+] Shutterstock).FCA RegulationWhile the FCA regulates CFDs, which means that when you trade cryptocurrency CFDs you have the protections offered by the UK’s financial services regulatory framework, these protections will not compensate an individual for any losses from trading.Under their framework:Indeed, the regulator stressed that you should only invest if you are an experienced investor with sophisticated knowledge of financial markets and you fully understand the risks associated with CFDs and cryptocurrencies.And, individuals should be wary if they are contacted out of the blue or pressured to invest quickly with returns sounding too good to be true. If a firm does not appear on the FCA Register of financial services firms, the regulator advised not to trade with them, transfer funds, or provide any banking details.In terms of ICOs and the FCA’s earlier consumer warning from September 12, 2017, where it labelled ICOs as “very high-risk, speculative investments”, it stressed: “You should be conscious of the risks involved and fully research the specific project if you are thinking about buying digital tokens. You should only invest in an ICO project if you are an experienced investor, confident in the quality of the ICO project itself (e.g. business plan, technology, people involved) and prepared to lose your entire stake.”ICOs: What are the risks? It was noted by the UK regulator that most ICOs are not regulated by the FCA and many are based overseas - with no investor protection. And, as with cryptocurrencies in general, the value of a token may be extremely volatile.“You are extremely unlikely to have access to UK regulatory protections like the Financial Services Compensation Scheme or the Financial Ombudsman Service,” the FCA stated.Furthermore, it was pointed out that some issuers might not have the intention to use the funds raised in the way set out when these early stage projects were marketed. There is, it said a “good chance of losing your whole stake” as the business models are experimental.Inadequate documentation was also referred to. Rather than a regulated prospectus, ICOs usually only provide a ‘white paper’. “An ICO white paper might be unbalanced, incomplete or misleading. A sophisticated technical understanding is needed to fully understand the tokens’ characteristics and risks,” the FCA’s consumer warning stated.Whether or not an ICO falls within the FCA’s regulatory boundaries or not can only be decided case by case.“Many ICOs will fall outside the regulated space. However, depending on how they are structured, some ICOs may involve regulated investments and firms involved in an ICO may be conducting regulated activities,” it was stated.The regulator highlighted that some ICOs “feature parallels” with Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), private placement of securities, crowdfunding or even collective investment schemes. “Some tokens may also constitute transferable securities and therefore may fall within the prospectus regime,” it stated.According to the FCA, digital currency exchanges that facilitate the exchange of certain tokens “should consider if they need to be authorized by the FCA” to be able to deliver their services.A number of other national financial regulators around the globe have issued bulletins or statements regarding ICOs in recent months, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Canadian Securities Administrator, the People’s Bank of China and the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong.Responses to the FCA’s Discussion Paper DP17/3 on distributed ledger technology (DLT) from April 2017 are currently being reviewed, with the regulator looking to publish its findings at the end of this year.For more information on how to protect yourself from fraud visit the FCA’s ScamSmart pages."

By expanding the universe of products to invest in this asset class, we think we’ll bring new investors in.""Zcash Investment TrustThe company chose Zcash for its third digital currency investment product because “we are excited about the potential for a privacy-focused digital currency and blockchain,"" said Silbert. ""There’s a lot of utility and demand for that.” The firm had also found high investor interest in a traditional security based on Zcash that could be held in IRAs and 401(k)s.As a passive investment vehicle, the Zcash Investment Trust aims to reflect the value of the amount of Zcash held by the Trust -- with each share representing 0.1 Zcash. At 4pm Eastern Time, it calculates that using the TradeBlock ZEC Composite Reference Rate published by the provider of institutional trading tools for digital currencies, and subtracts 2.5% for the Trust's expenses.To begin, purchasers of the Zcash Investment Trust (who must be accredited, meaning their income must be at least $200,000 for each of the previous two years or their net worth must exceed $1 million) will not be able to redeem or sell their shares on a secondary market.However, as Grayscale did for the Bitcoin Investment Trust, which trades over the counter on the OTCQX forum under the ticker symbol GBTC, the company intends to make it available for trading on a secondary market, where an investor could sell it after a year lock-up period.As seen with GBTC, the price on that market may diverge from the price at which the security is sold to accredited investors, because the limited supply may not be able to meet all demand. Over the course of its history, GBTC has traded at a premium to Bitcoin of as much as 100%, said Silbert.Packaging digital currencies into traditional investment vehicles has worked out quite well for Grayscale, which is likely one of the fastest-growing asset managers in history, growing from $164 million as of December 31, 2016 to $1.34 billion as of Wednesday -- a 717% year-to-date surge -- mostly fueled by the 765% rise in Bitcoin itself.The fund has already been seeded with $11.5 million, according to Silbert. After the fund was filed with the SEC, the price of Zcash, which had been around $220, jumped to about $250 per coin. "

For Utopia, Blockpool has teamed up with One Little Indian Records to build a crypto-checkout plugin for the label's online store, allowing users to pre-order Utopia using AudioCoin, as well as Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dashcoin.If you're new to blockchain, this might be a good time to take a look at these primers. If the increasing buzz around Bitcoin and Ethereum are any indication, it's not going anywhere—and the technology will touch every industry by revolutionizing much of how the Internet operates.For now, the simplest way to think about it is as a decentralized network where no one party ""owns"" the data. It's distributed among all participants; the network is the infrastructure. Cryptocurrencies are the currencies that operate on these networks.This isn't the first time an artist has incorporated a crypto play; this summer, RAC released his album, EGO, on Ethereum, and before that, Imogen Heap let users purchase her single ""Tiny Human"" with Ether (Ethereum's cryptocurrency).“People have done things with crypto and artists before, but this is the first time a global artist has done anything like this,” said Blockpool CEO Kevin Bacon in an interview with Musically. “While it will be interesting to see how the crypto community responds to this, Utopia is also a gateway for people to go into crypto for the first time. Björk is the best artist in the world we could imagine doing this.”When the news broke, an AudioCoin was worth about $0.0026. Three days later, it is up to about $0.0075—a net 3x jump in as many days. So we can immediately see how this news will benefit the blockchain community, hut how will it impact the music industry?We might be inclined to compare this move to Radiohead's ""pay what you want"" digital release of In Rainbows a decade ago. And while we can definitely see echoes in the subversion of expected revenue models by embracing emerging trends, it's arguable that Björk's move will have a greater (if less immediately obvious) influence on the music industry.This has to do with what blockchain technology embodies—and the relationship it can facilitate among fans and artists. Here are some of the major ways Björk's strategy will influence the music industry:Redistribute the wealthAt its core, blockchain is about decentralization. In facilitating a system that, by its very nature, has no single locus of power, this technology disperses that power across the entire network. Legitimacy is granted by shared belief in the system itself, rather than in a singular entity (ie. a bank). The collective is directly responsible for the growth of the system, and individuals stand to benefit from the growth of the system; if it finds success, the value of their assets (cryptocurrency) increases. By that measure, those who participate more (ie. trade the cryptocurrency, promoting awareness of the network), have the chance at generating more value for themselves.So, when an artist as well-respected as Björk throws her weight behind AudioCoin, she amplifies its legitimacy, driving general growth of the network. This incentivizes more fans to take the leap—especially ones who have been on the fence with blockchain tech. As they do, along with other artists, the system grows, which especially rewards the early adopters.This completely flips the existing model, where streaming companies charge fans a flat rate for participation with no incentive for their engagement, while simultaneously retaining a lion's share of the profits driven by the artists' work.Speaking of which, Björk's strategy points to a world where popularity and cult-of-personality can be used to drive revenue for artists. How AudioCoin fares in this instance will be an interesting example to refer to in the future.AudioCoin isn't some exclusive Björk cryptocurrency; you can buy it on your own right now. As aforementioned, its value has already increased three-fold in the past few days. Of course, the surge in general coverage is the driving force, but this also speaks to a general faith in the growth of the network. After all, you don't have to dig Björk to want to make some scratch. It will be interesting to watch how AudioCoin fares on and after Nov. 24. Will newcomers 'hodl' (crypto slang for ""hold"") their AudioCoins, or offload them right away? Will we see even more people coming to AudioCoin looking to make profit? Will the market remain dependent on the participation of other artists after the initial interest from the album launch fades?Only time will tell, but whatever the case, it's already clear that Björk has been able to singlehandedly tilt the scale, and she's just one artist. Imagine how this starts to get wilder when more artists join the charge, bringing their own fresh ideas into the mix. Björk also views blockchain as an ongoing strategy rather than novelty, claiming that fans will be able to unlock new crypto rewards by continuing to participate with the artist and her music, including her shows. This is important for broadcasting a longterm belief in the technology and the AudioCoin network.If AudioCoin takes off, it will create a totally new type of relationship between fans and artists. Assuming Björk isn't the last artist to incorporate blockchain in her strategy, a system like AudioCoin lets fans ""put their money where their mouth is"" in a way that isn't exclusively tied to one particular artist's success. Everybody involved is a ""player"" in the community, which turns the system into a reflection of the entire music industry. This also means that artists will be able to offer any number of different ways to engage via blockchain. Since there's no gatekeeper sucking up revenue, they can offer experiences (concerts, album release parties, engagements, et al) at a lower cost than ever before. In other words, fans will have more possibilities to participate with artists directly, building the ""relationship"" between them, while costing less for all involved. It takes the best aspects of Kickstarter and Indiegogo and turns this into an ongoing style of engagement—which in turn allows for smaller offerings that can be purchased as microtransactions.Given the above, there's no question that blockchain will revolutionize the music industry in a powerful way, and it's very possible that in a few years we'll look back on this moment as the pivotal intersection point. Only time will tell. In the meantime, catch up on all your favorite Björk hits to prepare yourself for Utopia."

They enable fundamentally new forms of social organization.These are bold claims. Once you “get” crypto, you’ll understand how crypto enables a new kind of social structure. I’ve tried to - and failed - to explain this concept to many people. Understanding the deepest and most profound implications of crypto can be difficult as crypto challenges many basic tenets of modern social structures and capitalism.BackgroundMany of the best businesses in the world claim to be peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. These networks connect supply and demand in ways that was never possible before.Obvious examples include eBay, Uber, AirBnB, the New York Stock Exchange and Facebook. But there many others: Apple connects developers to consumers, Amazon connects merchants with consumers, Google connects website owners to searchers, insurance companies and banks connect their customers through pooled capital.Networks that connect latent supply and demand are the foundation of the economy. These networks have created tens of trillions of dollars of economic value. These networks grow to be very large because of network effects. Once a network achieves critical mass, it becomes nearly unstoppable.But there’s a problem.These networks aren’t really peer-to-peer, even though they claim to be. Rather, they are mediated by network operators, who levy a tax on network participants. Some of this tax is absolutely necessary. Someone has to pay for eBay’s servers, for AirBnb’s insurance offerings, for Amazon’s customer support, etc.But one part of the tax isn’t necessary: profits (queue Uber jokes).In time, all network operators become rent seekers. Most are from day one.When crypto libertarians talk about “trustless” commerce, they’re talking about cutting out the middlemen and rent seekers: the network operators. They’re talking about connecting network participants to one another - both businesses and consumers - without middlemen extracting rents.This can be hard to imagine. Without a network operator, whose going to build the app? Who's going to run the servers? How are consumers going to connect together? Who defines the rules of the transaction? How do you ensure equitable payment? Who manages refunds, reviews, and customer service?The short answer: trustless, cryptographically bound network protocols.Huh?Let’s walk through four increasingly abstract examples to illustrate this.Decentralized CloudA significant majority of the world’s computing resources (compute, storage, bandwidth) are unutilized at a given point in time. Consumer and business hard drives lay mostly empty, and CPUs hum along at 3% utilization. Despite this, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, IBM, etc. continue to build new data centers. This is bonkers.Filecoin, STORJ, Sia, Swam, and SAFE are protocols that allow anyone to securely store files on other people’s hard drives. File owners can always retrieve files, and the people storing the files have no idea what they’re storing. At a high level, this is accomplished this in a remarkably simple way: using standard file encryption, Shamir sharding, and distributed hash tables for content-based addressing.Each protocol creates a market in which people with unused storage space and bandwidth can compete to store other people’s files and generate income. Because these protocols leverage people’s excess storage capacity that would otherwise sit unutilized and generate $0 revenue, these protocols will offer storage that’s much less expensive than that offered by large data centers who buy storage with the intent to rent it out. I won’t dive into things like enterprise-grade support in this post, but it’s worth noting that these protocols are designed to allow organizations to compete on value-added layers such as support.Each of these protocols is truly peer-to-peer. You store your content on other people’s hard drives. You don’t have to care about who stores them. No one stands between you and your files. There is no middle man, no rent-seeker. You store your files on the network and you pay the network.Golem and Elastic do basically the same thing but for compute rather than storage.For decentralized storage and compute, the mega opportunity is not “decentralized Dropbox.” Most people are on the free tier of Dropbox! The real opportunity for these protocols is in powering Internet applications. In time, most (maybe all?) apps – to do lists, note taking apps, chat apps, finance apps, etc. – won’t have to run in a private data center; rather, apps will run on the global mesh network of everyone’s computers.Decentralized Prediction MarketsAugur is a decentralized prediction market. What does that mean? Let’s contrast it with a famous centralized prediction market: Las Vegas sports betting.Vegas casinos take about 10% of total bet volume as a fee, called the take rate. They justify this fee by saying it’s necessary to arbitrate the outcome. You’re paying the casino 10% for three things: 1) to act as an escrow, 2) report who won the game, 3) and to distribute proceeds to the winner. This should not cost 10%. This is insanity.The problem with a decentralized prediction market is that if no one is in a room somewhere flipping a switch to say who won the game, how do you resolve the bet? You can’t just leave it up to a vote of market participants. If the odds on a bet are 9:1 and the 1 ends up winning, you don’t want the 9s to just outvote the 1s.What Vegas does for 10%, the Augur protocol will do for about 1%. Network participants in the Augur network, $REP holders, will be paid by the network to truthfully report event outcomes.How?The Augur network runs on smart contracts. In simple terms, smart contracts act as trustless escrow services that are bound by code (no human intervention) and release money based on some predetermined criteria. You will not stake bets in the Augur network using Augur’s native’s REP token. Rather, you’ll stake bets in other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether. Services such as Oraclize will automatically relay the outcome of the basketball game from nba.com to the Augur smart contract. With the score of the game, the smart contract will resolve the bet and distribute the funds to the winner.If anyone who was on the losing side of the bet believes that nba.com was incorrect (e.g. it was hacked) or that Oraclize manipulated the data, they can challenge the outcome by staking more money. At this point, the Augur smart contract asks REP holders to vote on the outcome of the basketball game. If REP holders vote in a way that overrules the challenger, the challenger loses the bond she put up to initiate the challenge. Additionally, REP holders who vote “incorrectly” - defined as those who vote against the majority of REP holders - also lose some REP. Thus, bet-losers are only incentivized to challenge the outcome reported by Oraclize if they believe a majority of REP holders will report a different outcome than that reported by Oraclize. The same is true of REP holders: they’re incentivized to vote in a way they believe all other REP holders will vote.This system works because REP holders are independent of market participants and because REP holders are global and pseudo-anonymous, making large-scale collusion nearly impossible. Bet-losers and REP holders cannot easily identify and try to coerce REP holders to collude to report a false event outcome. Even if REP holders did collude and intentionally misreported an event outcome, people would lose faith in the Augur network and the value of REP tokens would plummet, harming the colluders.All of this logic is handled by the Augur protocol, which lives on the Ethereum blockchain. No one in the world, including governments, can remove this smart contract or change the rules of the protocol. The protocol is like chemistry. You can’t break the laws of chemistry.Must Read: An Intrepid Investor's Guide To Buying Bitcoin And Other Crypto AssetsAugur is a true P2P prediction market. Anyone can partake in any prediction market – politics, sports, asset prices, hurricane severity, economic forecasting, anything. No one can prevent you from participating in any market, and no one can manipulate the outcome. Liquidity pools are global, there’s no counterparty risk, and the fees are dramatically lower than centralized alternatives.If you want to learn more about Augur, check out Multicoin's Augur Analysis and Valuation. TLDR: we’re bullish.Decentralized Record KeepingEvery company that’s regulated for compliance (financial services, pharma, food safety, oil and gas, supply chains, etc.) has to keep records. Occasionally, auditors ask these companies for their records. When this happens, the company has to find the relevant records, turn them over to the auditor, and prove to the best of their ability that they haven’t modified the records since they were generated (this is how Bernie Madeoff ran a Ponzi scheme for 20+ years; he modified records after the fact).Factom has designed a blockchain that allows companies to commit hashed records to a public blockchain. You can’t see the contents of the document by reading the blockchain.  The public can only see a cryptographic hash – a fingerprint of the record – on the blockchain.When committing records to the Factom blockchain, companies will still store their private documents on services like Box, Google Drive, or any of the decentralized storage protocols listed above. When auditors ask for documents, companies will turn documents over in the same way they always have. Auditors will then use software to compare each document against its cryptographic hash on the Factom blockchain. If they match, auditors will instantly know, with 100% certainty, whether the company has retroactively modified any document.When companies adopt Factom, auditing becomes orders of magnitude faster, cheaper, more accurate, and honest.As companies adopt Factom, the world will become a much more honest place. Pharmaceutical companies won’t be able to hide evidence of poor clinical trial results, the title-insurance business will collapse, supply chains will become transparent, and much more. By decentralizing record keeping, the truth will flourish.If you want to learn more about Factom, check out Multicoin's Factom Analysis and Valuation. TLDR: we’re bullish.Decentralized Money“I think the fact that within the Bitcoin universe an algorithm replaces the functions of [the government] ... is actually pretty cool. I am a big fan of Bitcoin.”- Al Gore, former Vice President of the United States.Decentralized money is the holy grail of P2P networks. It’s money that’s free from government control: no inflation, no capital controls, no bank account freezes, no undisclosed fees, no multi-day clearing times. Your money. Purely your money. No one can tell you what you can do with it.If you live in a country with a stable government, this may not seem like a big deal. What’s wrong with the USD? What’s wrong with Visa/Mastercard?But if you live in one of these countries, you might have a different perspective.Countries with hyper inflationThe countries in green have inflation between 10-20%. The countries in blue are >20%. These countries combined represent 780M people – more than 10% of the global population – and $2.1 trillion of GDP.If inflation is 20% and you have $10,000, then after one year it’s as if you have $8,000. After two years, it’s as if you have $6,400. Inflation is awful. It destroys value. It prevents people from thinking long term.That is the promise of Bitcoin. Bitcoin operates independently of governments. It is a true peer-to-peer money system, controlled by the people, for the people. In crypto, no politician can devalue your money.Challenging CapitalismIt’s not intuitive to think that centralization is a problem that permeates so many disparate facets of the modern world. Most people don’t think that modern Internet infrastructure is woefully inefficient and unnecessarily expensive. Or that prediction markets are materially worse as a result of centralization. Or that modern record keeping practices create opportunities for fraud and deceit. Or that centralized governments destroy the value of money.But as a result of the entirely natural evolution of capitalism over the last few hundred years, middleman have come to wield enormous power. Middlemen levy taxes on most economic transactions. We as a society have become so used to this that we’re generally blind to it. Debates about tax reform are incredibly myopic relative to the global scope of network operators levying taxes on network participants.Cryptographically bound networks will become more profound that anyone recognizes today. Consider the number and types of rent seekers. They’re everywhere:Crypto is going to change money not only by challenging monetary policy of governments, but also by challenging the structure of society as we know it. Every industry listed above, and many others, will be radically transformed by cutting out middlemen and connecting individuals and businesses to one another via crypto. Not all corporations will transform into blissful P2P crypto cooperatives. Earth will not become some hippie utopia in which all rules and money are governed by cryptographically bound protocols.Pooling capital and human labor will always exist. Not everything will become P2P. A P2P car factory doesn’t make sense. A lot of industrial processes won’t be directly impacted by P2P networks. Local service providers - dentists, barbers, etc - aren’t going anywhere. Crypto networks aren’t going to give you a massage, mow your lawn, or clean your house.Finding Truth In FictionIn Sapiens, Yuval Hurari argues that the defining characteristic of homosapiens vs all other species on Earth is homosapien’s ability to tell and believe in abstract and shared stories. He calls these shared stories “fictions” to make the point clear. All of the foundations of modern society are shared fictions: money, law, religion, and corporations, to name a few.People are bound by chemistry and physics. Corporations are not. They are purely abstract, and exist only within the confines of laws, which are themselves fictions. Green pieces of paper connote value only because the federal government tells us that green pieces of paper connote value.Corporations have produced nearly all of the incremental value for society in the last few hundred years. These corporations – these shared fictions – were absolutely necessary for the development of modern society. The Walmart corporation has created tremendous value for society by creating a shared fiction called Walmart that coordinates the actions of 1,000,000 employees who would be otherwise autonomous and independent. Each of these people understands their role within the broader Walmart fiction from the front-door greeter to the CEO.We finally have a way to coordinate large numbers of disparate parties trustlessly across the globe in real time through the use of economic incentives. This can be done without a shared fiction. This is possible for for the first time because of crypto.Cryptographically bound P2P networks provide a new mechanism for social organization. These networks are bound purely by protocols, which are themselves bound by math. Network participants can engage in protocol governance, as defined by the protocol. Through these protocols, billions of people will transact with one another For the first time in human history, they’ll do so without believing in any shared fiction other than the shared fiction of money itself.Everything that can be decentralized, will be decentralized. - Johnston’s Law.Must Read: An Intrepid Investor's Guide To Buying Bitcoin And Other Crypto Assets"

A 1031 exchange is a swap of one business or investment asset for another. Under the tax code, most swaps are taxable as sales. That's why the IRS says bartering is taxable to both sides, whether for goods or services. Section 1031 is an exception to the rule that swaps are generally fully taxable. If you can manage to come within 1031, you can change the form of your investment without (as the IRS sees it) cashing out or recognizing income. But can you swap one cryptocurrency for another, or for other property?","Gold plated souvenir Bitcoin coins are arranged for a photograph in London on November 20, 2017.... [+] Bitcoin, a type of cryptocurrency, uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks. (Photo credit: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images)The IRS says cryptocurrency is property not currency, so you might think you could qualify. But whether 1031 applies to cryptocurrency is debatable. Some tax advisers say no, while others offer more positive views, that in some cases 1031 can apply, provided that you are careful. But this debate may not be relevant much longer. Both the House tax bill and the Senate tax bill propose to restrict 1031 exchanges to real estate. The real estate industry is breathing a sigh of relief that 1031 exchanges are being kept for them.Most exchanges must merely be of “like-kind.” Surprisingly, you can exchange an apartment building for raw land, or a ranch for a strip mall. Classically, an exchange involves a simple swap of one property for another between two people. But the odds of finding someone with the exact property you want who wants the exact property you have are slim. For that reason, the vast majority of exchanges are delayed or “Starker” exchanges (named for the tax case that allowed them). In a delayed exchange, you need a middleman who holds the cash after you “sell” your property and uses it to “buy” the replacement property for you.This three-party exchange is treated as a swap. The intermediary must meet a number of requirements. That’s one reason delayed exchanges of cryptocurrency may not qualify. There are also two timing rules you must observe in a delayed exchange. Within 45 days of the sale of your property, you must designate replacement property in writing to the intermediary. Then, you must close on the new property within 180 days of the sale of the old.Until the law changes, what about 1031 exchanges of cryptocurrency? The IRS has been asked about this, but has so far remained mum. A simultaneous Bitcoin for bitcoin swap might be fine. But a Bitcoin for Ripple or Ethereum trade might not qualify. Section 1031 does not apply to trades of stocks or bonds, and the IRS could rely on this to nix any cross-species trade of cryptocurrency. In the past, some gold coin swaps have been OK, while silver for gold is not. So some observers think the IRS would consider different cryptocurrencies more like silver and gold.There are also reporting issues. You can’t qualify for 1031 unless you claim it. If you want to see what you have to report to the IRS on your tax return, check out IRS Form 8824. Both the House and Senate tax bills call for restricting Section 1031 to real estate. The two tax bills are filled with controversy, but not over this point. In that sense, the debates over 1031 exchanges of cryptocurrency may not be relevant much longer."

Bitcoin ...","Oct 20, 2017,01:13pm EDT","One of the best books ever written is Robert Pirsig's Zen And The Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance. Even after several rereads and three decades, the words remain vivid, coherent and relevant.","Essentially the book talks of madness and how motorcycle road trips can clear the mind and bring intelligent people back from the dead. It clarifies life and explains some of the darkest mysteries of the human mind.Such clarity is much-needed in the New Tech World of cryptocurrency and ICOs. The proliferation of technologies, so-called solutions and competing standards will take more than a motorcycle journey to understand.However, smart contract blockchain company Zen Protocol believes it can has the answers, not only to cryptocurrency 'maintenance', but also to the future of the technology.Namely, it makes secure and peer-to-peer finance possible on a public blockchain, obviating the need for intermediaries such as brokers and banks. Current financial systems are centralized, complex, and difficult to access. While established and experienced players can usually deal with the paperwork and bureaucracy, many businesses and individuals find the barriers to entry impossible to overcome. Potential trades and deals are lost, as these participants in finance are forced to use intermediaries to gain limited access to the system, without the ability to issue assets or even to trade in some asset classes.Zen allows anyone, anytime, anywhere to create and trade financial products on a platform secured with a proof-of-work blockchain. Zen provides users with an open marketplace for options, futures, digital currencies and all types of financial instruments.Unlike other platforms, Zen makes it possible to build smart contracts with real utility, making it viable for them to use real-world data and work without any intermediaries or central control. All assets on Zen are created by contracts, making possible decentralized, automated escrow; meaning that traders on Zen no longer need trusted counterparties.Zen wants to streamline cryptocurrency transactions.Zen miners can verify how much computation each contract requires, before ever running it. This allows Zen (unlike competing smart contract platforms) to work without a virtual machine or a resource counter, making contracts in the Zen Protocol as fast to execute as compiled system code.Additionally, Zen has first class tokens, assets that can be held and transferred without running their issuing contracts. Moreover, people can use any token to pay transaction fees (rather than being limited to Zen's native token), reducing complexity for consumers who just want to move around dollars and pay fees in dollars.This is a step forward in usability and compatibility from platforms that implement tokens as a second-layer protocol. With Zen, new assets are always usable by any existing or future contract.In an attempt to address some of the political issues seen in the Bitcoin space, where different interest groups try to promote and make changes to the core protocol level, Zen are implementing a system they call Multi Hash Mining.This distributes mining rewards to several hashing algos, while giving users (stakeholders) the power to vote on which hashing algos will receive the rewards. Zen believes this mechanism will create a fairer and more balanced discussion between miners and token holders.“Tokens are the incentive for mining. We believe in Bitcoin’s model of bootstrapping security via inflation, when the costs would otherwise be carried by the user base. We are focused on creating a fully decentralized finance platform that offers secure, scalable transactions,"" said Adam Perlow, CEO of Zen Protocol Development.The Zen blockchain is parallel to Bitcoin, but incorporates commitments to the state of Bitcoin’s blockchain. Every fully verifying Zen node is also a Bitcoin node. This close connection to Bitcoin makes it possible for contracts to sell assets on the Zen blockchain for bitcoins, for users to create pegged Bitcoin assets on Zen, and for the Zen Protocol itself to use any future sidechain support in the Bitcoin protocol.For those only remotely versed in the knowledge of Bitcoin and the blockchain, Zen may be on the next road to the future. Zen has also announced that it will be holding its token sale in November.Such journeys, as anybody who has read Zen And The Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance knows, are not without roadblocks, but smart people generally get there in the end."

Another concept that has re-emerged as a result is called triple-entry accounting. At a high-level, triple-entry accounting is an alternative method of accounting in which a third component is added after the global standard debit and credit. It’s an interesting concept, given that it would be a significant departure from double-entry accounting, which the world of business has relied on for hundreds of years. It does not, however, have anything to do with blockchain.","In order to explain, it’s best to provide a quick background on double-entry accounting, followed by blockchain and triple-entry accounting.ShutterstockDouble-Entry AccountingIn the late 1400s, merchants in Venice developed a new method for tracking their finances: double-entry accounting. Previously, they reviewed their cash balances at the end of each day and recorded the related transactions that impacted cash flows. The trouble with this approach is that cash flows don’t provide complete information about operations. Double-entry accounting takes into account the other side of the transaction, which drives profits or losses and changes in owner’s equity -- all of which are critical to consider when managing a business' finances.With double-entry accounting, you’re forced to assess the total impact of a transaction. Debits must equal credits, which requires you to determine the account coding for each side of a transaction. Every time a company purchases goods, issues stock or pays their employees, there are two sides to the transaction. In complex situations, the other side of the entry ensures the business has a firm understanding of the underlying nature of the transaction, as otherwise, they’d be unable record it.BlockchainA blockchain is a digital ledger that is distributed among multiple locations to ensure security and ease of access globally. Currently, the primary use of this technology is for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies but blockchain will entirely disrupt accounting processes as we know them -- it’s only a matter of time.The ability to utilize a blockchain that records all information related to a particular transaction in real time and between multiple parties is incredibly powerful. The applications for automating business processes, particularly around payments and controls, are seemingly endless. For this reason, a common misconception has come up that the writing of each piece of information to the blockchain is actually a third entry. It’s not.Triple-Entry AccountingTriple-entry accounting is a scholarly concept conceived by the late Yuji Ijiri, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University. It presents a framework for a new way to do accounting, replacing the standard accounting formula (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) with a more complex framework.Essentially, what Yuji has done is taken the familiar concept that the change in Wealth is equal to Income (effectively the same as the standard accounting formula) and added on some new concepts to provide more information about where the organization is headed. The idea is that accounting could be fundamentally tied to forecasting and, therefore, enable better strategic decision making.Whether or not it’s worth pursuing this alternative accounting method is up for debate, but it certainly isn’t currently being used in any significant way. In my opinion, even if regulators and companies could get over the monumental hurdle of moving away from double-entry accounting, it’s impractical to use a more complex system. It’s hard enough to get the accounting right when there are only two sides of an entry.ConclusionWhile triple-entry accounting isn’t the term for it, there are considerable benefits in writing transactions to a blockchain. Much like journal entries are currently recorded in an organization’s subledgers (e.g., Accounts Receivable) and general ledger, recording transactions on a blockchain would provide visibility into related transactions.For instance, a blockchain could be created once a contract is signed, then a purchase order could be issued against that contract, bills against that purchase order, payments against those bills, etc., tracking any issues that arise along the way. There would be a unique ID related to the contract/purchase order/bills in that chain to tie all of those separate pieces together.Having a ledger that easily shows the entire string of related transactions would not only provide excellent audit records, it would allow both parties to a transaction to have real-time status updates. Every time the blockchain is updated with a new record, both parties to the transaction are able to immediately see the update. Plus, with blockchain technologies such as Ethereum, you’re able to restrict access to the parties to the transaction. I look forward to seeing what’s next as this technology evolves and reaches widespread adoption. It’s just getting started."

A little over a dollar might not immediately sound like a huge change, but that's well over 400 percent growth in one month. Though we witnessed a major drop-off yesterday, wherein the overall cryptocurrency market cap dropped by as much as 20 percent, Ripple has been hit proportionately less than others, remaining above its yesterday mark.So what's causing this explosion in price? Here are 5 reasons.ShutterstockLate-November saw Bitcoin crack $10K, and shortly thereafter the announcements of bitcoin futures trading on Cboe and CME. The attention that ensued—both from the media and mainstream—has been unprecedented in the world cryptocurrency, drawing hordes of newcomers to the space.Many of these newcomers begin their crypto journey on popular brokerage Coinbase (more on this in a minute). For most of December, Coinbase only supported three cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC). Of those three, most investment has traditionally poured into BTC and ETH, but early this month, we saw consumers graduate to Litecoin, causing several major jumps, peaking at $390 before coming to rest around $320.Now that Litecoin has hit its initial resistance barrier, the natural impact has been that motivated participants have sought new avenues for investment. This has precipitated wild growth among many different cryptocurrencies, including: TRON (TRX), Cardano (ADA), Stellar (XLM), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), QTUM, Verge (XVG), and Reddcoin (RDD), among many others—bringing the overall cryptocurrency market cap to a record high of $611B before the Bitcoin drop-off we saw yesterday, which brought it back to $508B at the time of this writing.As one of the oldest, most established and time-tested cryptocurrencies, it's no surprise that investors turned to it early in their crypto investing.American Express Co. chip credit cards are arranged for a photograph in Washington, D.C., U.S., on... [+] Monday, Oct. 16, 2017. American Express is expected to release third-quarter earnings figures on October 18. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/BloombergAs a team of finance, technology and fintech veterans, Ripple has demonstrated a clear understanding that an emphasis on partnerships and customer acquisition is an invaluable way for emerging technology companies to thrive.Ripple now has over 75 commercially deploying customers—and over 100 currently on their roster. But more than just establishing a customer base, Ripple has used strategic partnerships to generate buzz. For instance, the recently announced partnership with American Express was many Americans' first encounter with Ripple—and immediately situated the brand as a reliable financial service, rather than a weird or intimidated new technology.While these efforts have generated organic press, Ripple is also clearly doubling down on its media effort—with coverage ramping up over the past month. More notably, last week the San Francisco company hired Tom Channick, the former corporate communications manager for Facebook's advertising and business integrity unit, as its head of communications.Asia plays a key role in this strategy. As Ken Rapoza pointed out, Asians are ""going mad"" for Ripple. This is not an unfounded claim; last year, Ripple partnered with SBI Holdings to launch SBI Ripple Asia to serve markets in China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and ASEAN countries by establishing a dedicated sales and engineering group tasked with selling and installing solutions for cross-border bank payments.""People feel comfortable with its name and the technology behind Ripple,"" said Trevor Koverko, CEO of Polymath, in an interview with Rapoza. ""A lot of people are beginning to realize how big of an opportunity there is between business and the blockchain...and that's making Ripple the early winner here.""A branded coffee mug is seen at the Coinbase Inc. office in San Francisco, California, U.S., on... [+] Friday, Dec. 1, 2017. Coinbase wants to use digital money to reinvent finance. In the company's version of the future, loans, venture capital, money transfers, accounts receivable and stock trading can all be done with electronic currency, using Coinbase instead of banks. Photographer: Michael Short/BloombergThe effect of this media boom is a major uptick in rumors that Coinbase will soon support XRP buying, selling, and trading on its platform. The widespread assumption is that if that occurs, a whole new crop of buyers will start investing in XRP.For perspective, Coinbase is adding around 100,000 new users per day and recently surpassing YouTube as the #1 app on the Apple App Store. The recent addition of Bitcoin Cash, which caused a media frenzy on Dec. 19, demonstrates the weight Coinbase holds in cryptocurrency worldwide.Many coins right now are bought and traded based on pure speculation—and there's nothing wrong with that per se; it's how many young altcoins with great ideas will flesh out their networks before they're fully operational. But it also means that those currencies are backed almost exclusively by ideas and public belief in those ideas, which is a dangerous position to be in when something like yesterday's drop comes into play.Positioned as a multi-pronged solution for major financial institutions (which aren't going away any time soon), Ripple is actually a useful product to its customers now—regardless of what it will or will not build in the future—and these customers happen to be some of the biggest financial institutions in the world. And it's speed (4-second transactions) and low fees also make it appealing to general consumers.This is also supported by how Ripple itself functions. XRP is a pre-mined coin, which has drawn criticism for going against the ethos of decentralization and the lack of mining opportunities that creates. Moreover, Ripple retains a full 20 percent of the total supply of XRP. While this too has upset some in the crypto community, it also somewhat immunizes it to the volatility we see in other coins. As Techno Rajji explains in an article written for Oracle Times last month:Due to this limited number of XRP coins, the currency may continue to flourish or at least hold its ground in the future if crypto prices fall.For better or worse, higher supply means lower volatility, and more centralization means more moderation of the market.So, will the current growth rate last? Current market trends indicate that we've touched the nearest resistance barrier after $1 ($1.25). According to Sam Bourgi on Hacked, the next major resistance barrier is $1.50. Taking the past few weeks as an example, we might expect to see a few weeks of trading in the $1.25-$1.35 range to solidify the base before another big jump toward the $1.50 mark. Of course, that's leaving out a sudden event such as a Coinbase announcement or a crypto market correction.On the other hand, in ""The Bear Case For XRP: Bitcoin Futures Edition,"" Kyle Samani makes the case for a less optimistic view, questioning the long-term validity of XRP's use cases against more a established coin like Bitcoin while acknowledging that XRP still might have a substantial amount of growth left:We maintain our position: in the long run, we’re bearish on XRP. We simply don’t see any series of events that can occur that would cause financial institutions to voluntarily adopt XRP over the global reserve. Having said that, given the state of crypto markets today, XRP could keep pumping. There’s really not a good objective valuation model for XRP given the intrinsic velocity problem that it faces, so it could 5x before our thesis is reflected in XRP price movements.Whatever ends up being the case, Ripple has proven itself as one of the most fascinating cryptocurrencies to watch.

Though a better word for ""returned"" may be '""redirected."" China's central bank banned ICOs on Sept. 4 and later banned all bitcoin exchanges from operating in the country. An ICO is a crypto-currency funding mechanism for start-ups.Xinhua news reported on Sept. 22 that 90% of the money had been returned to investors. They did not say how much had been returned. But between January and August, over $1.1 billion had been raised in more than 65 ICOs, according to government figures.""To understand what’s going on with ICOs and China you need to understand that fundamentally are two kinds of Chinese,"" says Anton Dzyatkovsky, CEO of MicroMoney, a global fintech blockchain company and lending services provider based in Singapore. He was speaking fresh off the Global Blockchain Summit in Wanxiang, where many bright-eyed Chinese are looking forward to a digital economy.""The first kind is afraid of everything, to the point that some execs didn’t come to the recent blockchain summit because the event had the word 'blockchain' in its name, and they feared that Chinese police would take their picture there and use that as evidence to repress them later on. The second kind of Chinese is the type that is not afraid of anything. And these are the ones who are re-registering their blockchain companies in Hong Kong and Singapore, and will continue operations shut down by the central bank,"" Dzyatkovsky says.One of the reasons regulators put the lid on ICOs was because of the Chinese penchant for gambling. It's one thing to gamble on regulated securities. Another to lose your shirt on a digital currency backed by nothing but the sellers good word and business plan. Pre-ICO roadshows featuring elaborate standing room-only presentations at 5-star hotels drew a diverse crowd, including grandmothers -- a likely tipping point for the People's Bank of China, Reuters reported.The crackdown came just weeks before the gathering of the people's congress of the Communist Party, a once-in-five-years event. Beijing has been waging a broader campaign against fraudulent fundraising, speculative investment, and corruption and bitcoin fits neatly in those cross-hairs.At least for now. China is a huge player in this market, with some of the biggest bitcoin miners located there.

There, the company founders would collect most of the money back from their investors in Hong Kong or Sing.Some Chinese players are still holding onto the money.One is NEO, a Chinese crypto-currency platform similar to Ethereum, which launched its ICO in 2016. They said they are not planning to return any funds unless individual token holders asked for their money back. It is unclear how many have done so at this time.""China remains open for business, so long as your company is headquartered elsewhere,"" says Dzyatkovsky, who is trying to bring MicroMoney to China.On Sept. 15, Chinese government officials informed two prominent exchanges, Huobi and OKCoin, that they would have to stop trading by October 31, 2017.""Governments fear that tokens offer a backdoor to circumvent their authority on currency control and regulation,"" says Los Angeles based attorney Katrina Arden for the Blockchain Law Group.

It's REP token has risen 2,000%. Here’s our quick take on Augur. Network: Augur | Token: Reputation | Ticker: REPCreatorsPomona college dropout and Pantera Capital co-chief investment officer Joey Krug and biophysics Ph.D. Jack Peterson founded Augur in 2014.What is it? Augur aims to create the most accurate prediction markets using the “wisdom of the crowd”—the idea that, when many people weigh in on certain outcomes, they’re more likely to create an accurate prediction. It runs on Ethereum, the decentralized ledger system that enables money to move quickly and cheaply and is second only to Bitcoin among blockchains whose coins have the highest asset value. Currently in its public testing phase, Augur lets users make prediction-markets bets for much lower fees than traditional betting systems. “On Betfair you’re paying 10%+ fees, on Augur it’ll likely be 1% or less,” Krug wrote this summer in a blog post. Augur’s creators argue that one problem with traditional prediction markets or betting platforms is that they’re centralized, so they can easily be shut down. Another issue is that they rely on one party to report how an event turned out, a setup that’s susceptible to mistakes or manipulation. Since Augur is a decentralized system, thousands of people can report on the outcome, making it more accurate. And those who predict the correct outcome get rewarded with Augur’s REP tokens. On Augur, anyone can create a prediction market by posing a question. “When will Avril Lavigne’s new album be released?” is one Augur market. Another is, “Who will win FIFA 2018 World Cup.""Crypto IntelligenceIn the new book “Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond,” Chris Burniske and Jack Tatar note industry insiders’ enthusiasm for Augur. Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, one of the largest digital currency exchanges, described Augur as an “awesome project with huge potential” last year. Vitalik Buterin, a cofounder of Ethereum, noted its potential when he called it “Uber for knowledge.” Augur’s largest competitors include Gnosis, followed by Stox, whose coin languished after its August initial coin offering and stood around $27 million in market value as of December 2017.

Crypto conversations in coffeeshops are now commonplace.Some talk of tulips, others of new reserve currencies and digital gold standards, but the juggernaut continues; nobody knows what will happen in 2018.What has become clear, however, is that the existing financial ecosystem is not turning a blind eye to the possibilities and disruptions of cryptocurrencies. The G20 group of nations is watching as well. At the behest of France, the G20 will discuss the ‘bitcoin problem’ at its next potlatch in April, 2018. That may be the time when regulation and decorum finally reach consensus and speculators turn elsewhere for their fast bucks.Whether it is bitcoin futures or stock market blockchains, a rapport is gradually being reached between centralized and decentralized systems, not least venture capital and how that institution will remain viable.Robert Bosch Venture Capital is getting serious with the distributed ledger.News comes today that those worlds are fusing together as Robert Bosch Venture Capital GmbH (RBVC), the corporate venture capital company of the Bosch Group, has purchased a significant amount of IOTA tokens. RBVC has made a strategic move in buying these IOTA tokens, one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the world. IOTA, which is the first distributed ledger technology to go beyond a blockchain, enables machines to securely transact data and money with each other.The IOTA Foundation is a non-profit foundation based in Germany focused on distributed ledger technology and permissionless ecosystem development. The news follows the successful launch of IOTA’s data marketplace, with more than 30 participants such as Accenture Labs, Deutsche Telekom, Fujitsu, Orange, Samsung Artik, TINE and many more.Established in 2015, the IOTA protocol is an open-source distributed ledger protocol for the Internet of Things, enabling scalable and machine-to-machine payments as well as the secure data transfer of sensors.In doing so, RBVC wants to intensify the collaboration with IOTA and help accelerate the technology to maturity by bringing it closer to Bosch’s global ecosystem and key partners.RBVC’s investment broadens the potential for new business models for IoT in several verticals and positions IOTA and Bosch as a significant force to take on the challenges of IoT. RBVC is now more than just an electronics company.The IOTA technology has already enabled more than $10 billion to be transacted and has been utilized for user cases including transparent value chains, secure Over-the-Air updates and 'feeless' micropayment-based electric vehicle charging, parking and more.“Distributed ledger technology will play an important role in the industry of tomorrow. We are one of the pioneers actively driving the adoption of  DLT in the automotive and IoT industry. ""The investment in IOTA’s token, the first ever token investment of RBVC, will help us work closely with the IOTA Foundation to explore the industrialization of this exciting technology,"" said Dr. Ingo Ramesohl, Managing Director at RBVC. The IOTA foundation has also announced that Dr. Hongquan Jiang, Partner at RBVC, will join IOTA’s advisory board, an appointment that will further meld the two organisations.“I’m very excited about IOTA’s technology, which could potentially become the standard underlying technology for trustless machine to machine communication, security and payment in the IoT space.“There will be much synergy between Bosch and the IOTA Foundation and I’m looking forward to seeing more industrial adoptions of this technology in the near future"", said Dr Jiang.This confederation of a product company, its VC arm IoT and IOTA's distributed ledger technology is an interesting one and appears more than mere speculation... it seems grown-up.While others in the cryptocurrency world are riding the bandwagon into 2018 until the almost-certain correction later that year, others seem to be playing a more nuanced long-game.For RBVC and IOTA, this is not just a token deal; it promises to be much more than that. "

For a while now, financial news has been dispersed with updates of how banks are experimenting with cryptocurrencies and this announcement is one of the most recent, after Bitcoin futures began trading.Unlike Bitcoin, however, Ethereum has always been spoken about in a more positive way and has become the second largest digital currency in two years. After being launched in 2015, the value of Ethereum’s currency, otherwise known as Ether, has increased by more than 6,800% since the start of the year, according to The Telegraph.With Ether being the third most valuable digital currency and the virtual currency with the second highest market value, ether has grown in popularity, especially during this cryptocurrency boom that we seem to be experiencing.Vitalik Buterin first explored the idea of the Ethereum blockchain in 2013 as a 19 year old with the aim of creating an improvement on bitcoin. ‘Like bitcoin, it is a decentralized payment network, with its own cryptographic currency, that allows anonymous payments to be sent across the internet without the need for a bank or other third party. Coded transactions are stored in a decentralized ledger, the blockchain, and are visible for everyone on the network to see,’ The Telegraph explained.Like Litecoin, speed is the reason why Ethereum has excelled in this space and is thought of to be more effective than Bitcoin, as ‘blocks’ or the record of transaction can be created much quicker. Alongside this, the Ethereum blockchain network allows third party applications to run on the network, not just Ether and not just money either - other forms of data can also be stored.When it rises, Ethereum always does in a steady fashion and this jump is something out of the ordinary, but the increase in Ether value could be because of the same happening to Bitcoin, and in turn, Litecoin. Due to more and fresh investments being undertaken into cryptocurrencies, Ether value was bound to increase, but when interest wanes, will the bubble burst? I think so."

Stellar is a somewhat different blockchain protocol than other cryptocurrencies, and often draws comparisons to Ripple. Like XRP, Lumens are digital tokens designed to help dissolve inefficiencies among financial institutions and consumers.Getting into the technology behind Stellar would take an article unto itself (like this piece in CoinCentral). In the meantime, the best way to start conceptualizing Stellar is to imagine how Venmo works today. You upload money and have access to it right away. When you transfer it, you do so easily and instantly (and pending it's through your debit card, free). If Stellar succeeds, it will create a similar system, but on a global scale—and for larger bodies like banks and corporations.In a practical sense, this means that you could pay your friend in Mexico with XLM and that friend could withdraw the money in pesos. Or, if you were traveling abroad, you could use XLM to pay without ever going through the process of converting your money to a foreign currency.At 7:49am PST Dec. 16, XLM sold for $0.193355 USD, according to CoinMarketCap. 16 hours later (midnight PST Dec. 17), that number was $0.297835—an increase of 54 percent. At the time of this writing, the price is $0.275539.It's also important to note that the Stellar team is invested in social impact and innovation. They promote companies and strategies aimed at banking the unbanked, and through their partnership program, they field proposals for the Stellar network that promote financial inclusion—offering grants of up to $2M USD worth of Lumens to selected partners. The Build Challenge, a quarterly program to reward ""to reward innovation and development in the Stellar ecosystem,"" doubles down on this initiative.Traders work in a trading pit at the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Monday, Dec. 11, 2017, in...

When their growth slows—as Bitcoin did last week and Litecoin did earlier this week—some of these users look to new coins for more explosive gains.Meanwhile, established investors are seeking places to park Bitcoin gains in hopes of compounding growth in coins that bring back a higher return. Despite seeming like it's undergoing insane growth, Bitcoin's daily growth has generally remained under 10 percent per day this month, while coins like XLM stand to make jumps like 54 percent in less than a day's time.The next big thing?All investors hope they'll be among the number backing the next cryptocurrency that really goes 'to the moon' like DASH, ETH, IOTA, LTC, NEM, and XRP did this year. Buyer psychology also may play a part; investors avoid coins regarded as ""expensive,"" even though this has essentially nothing to do with actual value. This tends to be especially true with inexperienced buyers who feel intimidated by crypto markets, and would rather hold ""whole"" coins than fractional slices of pricier ones.At just $0.19, the Lumen was likely an appealing option to these buyers—possibly leading to a higher volume of transactions, thereby driving up price.Partnerships with IBM and KickExIn October, Stellar announced a partnership with IBM and KickEx to ""develop a blockchain-based cross-border payments solution proven to significantly reduce transaction costs and increase transaction speeds."" The partnership is also designed to decrease cross-border transaction fees, lags in processing, errors and inefficiencies.Having the support of a major institution like IBM also generated a lot of media buzz around Stellar, which also likely precipitated earlier price increases in November.Emphasis on mission and functionality As demonstrated above, Stellar is a network rooted in a very specific purpose, targeted around solving a specific and ongoing problem. The recent surge in Ripple could be indicative of a broader move toward diligent, compliant cryptocurrencies with drilled-down applications—particularly in light of the SEC's recent action against PlexCoin.In a landscape that's often susceptible to hype and cult of personality, it's possible that Stellar Lumens felt like more reliable short- and long-term bet. Furthermore, the foregrounded social impact angle could be part of the draw for younger investors who prefer mission-driven companies.For more information on Stellar, including how to buy and sell Lumens, visit the official website.Editor’s Note & Disclosure: The author invests in cryptocurrency markets.

The goal of these interviews is to weave together the views of those professionals, as well as a recommended list of follows, reads, and listens from them.  This project arose from a series of discussions I had with my friend Ron Williams (starting with a lengthy conversation while awaiting the amazing TajMo concert on June 23, 2017 at the UC Theater in Berkeley, California), so naturally, Ron was one of my first interviewees. [See financial disclosure at the end of this column; nothing in this column should be construed as investment advice - this is a wildly volatile asset class, investors beware!]","Wendy Xiao Schadeck of Northzone, far right, guest-lecturing at the Venture Capital class the author... [+] teaches (along with Colin Kirby and Pooja Patel, both not shown) in the MBA program at Columbia Business School. Others shown, like Wendy, are alums of the course: Taylor Greene (in pink button shirt) and Meghan Cross (in white sweater).This series of interviews should become more interesting over time as it generates a bank of people answering a small number of basic questions.  The enormous rate of change in this sector should mean that the answers will shift over time and can be revisited (right/wrong/what happened).I posed questions to two friends in venture capital and tech during November.  The first was Wendy Xiao Schadeck, a venture capital investor at Northzone. Wendy’s investment focus emphasizes blockchain and crypto, but also covering fintech more broadly. Wendy's insights on blockchain and crypto appear on Medium and in tweets.Given the start of my conversations, I also wanted to formally interview Ron Williams who is a seasoned internet security executive with a background in gaming.  From 2008 through April 2011, Ron was the CEO and co-founder of Zeevex, which he describes as an “open digital currency platform for video game and online content providers.”  Ron was early to virtual currency and tokens, as TechCrunch reported on May 12, 2009: “By doing so, users create what Zeevex calls a ‘Digital Locker’, containing so-called Zeev Tokens…”  Zeevex was acquired by InnCom in March of 2010.The world of crypto moves so swiftly that I wanted to time-stamp the responses from Wendy (November 30, 2017) and Ron (December 14, 2017).Q: Which few projects do you find most interesting (and why)?WENDY XIAO SCHADECK: I think projects applying cryptoeconomic models to real world business models are interesting (Steem, Brave, Props, Orchid, etc.) because they’ll provide the first proof points of utility value. I also think necessary infrastructure/middleware are interesting because they’ll enable the really crazy blockchain-only use cases we can’t imagine yet (0x, Livepeer, 1protocol, Filecoin, ZeppelinOS and Truebit). However, the most interesting to me still are Bitcoin and Ethereum because the communities are the most evolved, and they’re the furthest progressed in experimenting in real time with decentralized governance at scale.Ron Williams (red fleece) with the author (black sweater) in Monforte d'Alba, Italy. Others shown:... [+] Roberto Conterno, Jennifer Erickson, K. Ryan Burke and Cindy Miller. (June 2017)RON WILLIAMS: Two favorite current cryptos for me are EOS and Ethereum (disclaimer: I own both).EOS may be the most successful coin launch to date with over $700M raised so far [Author's Note: see above regarding the date on which Ron submitted his answers] and it is tracking to raise well over $2B before the ICO [initial coin offering] closes in the Summer of 2018.  It’s being developed by an experienced digital currency team as a competitor to Bitcoin and Ethereum. The team has taken lessons learned from these two biggest currencies and are building a next generation blockchain platform focused on high transaction throughout at massive scale (a key current weakness in both Bitcoin and Ethereum). The ICO funds will be used to support developers who leverage the EOS platform to build blockchain apps so a huge amount of money is going to support adoption. EOS is also designed to be environmentally friendly which could be an important advantage as older generation currencies continue to gobble up huge amounts of power (Bitcoin consumes more electricity than some countries). Late 2018 is when we will probably see big changes in how many popular coins are mined with a huge global downshift in hardware and power costs.While it has competitors like EOS nipping at its heels, Ethereum leads the market in developer adoption by a wide margin and is currently the busiest blockchain by number of transactions volume.  Ethereum has a much more robust feature set than Bitcoin for building blockchain applications including a Turing complete programming language (so any type of application can be built) and the ability to create smart contracts (secure agreements between two or more parties that execute automatically on the blockchain when contract terms are met). Over 40 of the biggest 100 coins by market cap are built on top of Ethereum and the ethereum network earns fees when those coins are transacted.  Ethereum is also moving much faster on the innovation curve than Bitcoin which tends to have a fractious developer community that has slowed down progress for years.Q: Who are a few of the most interesting people to read/follow/hear on blockchain and cryptocurrency?WENDY: I follow a mix of skeptics, entrepreneurs, and investors: @jessewldn @arbedout   @petkanics @literature @prestonjbyrne  @NickSzabo4‏ @kevinakwok @MeherRoy @naval … and of course me (@wen_xs)! (shameless plug!)Many of the same people also write pretty great Medium posts, and it’s always good to look at their claps as well.Another good resource (…) is this slack group: https://coinfund.slack.comAnd Evan Van Ness publishes a good weekly summary in the Ethereum world.RON: While Reddit and Telegram are popular discussion outlets for hard core cryptocurrency fans, I find Twitter to be a great resource for staying up to date.

[+] Kitwood/Getty Images),"Crypto is in. There is a spotlight being shone on the world of digital currencies and blockchain technologies. In the first half of 2017 alone, the cryptocurrency market cap grew by 800%. This has been driven by the high incidence of ICOs, inbounding public excitement and accelerating profits realised by investors. Although there is opposing opinions to the market’s exuberance, the presence of such debate is indicative of market attention.This intrigue represents interest. And this interest dovetails into a signal for local startups to take notice.The adage goes that talent follows money. Financial incentives, although not the monomaniac driver of creativity, can be a leading indicator for innovation. Investors are drawn to opportunities where there is yield and this often creates a self-fulfilling cycle that draws in the necessary talent to realise this potential.Tellingly, cryptocurrencies are showing similarly seductive characteristics.The growth of the market in 2017 exemplifies a swelling investment enthusiasm. This seems to have a cascading effect. Through a herding psychology, where market participants follow the collective’s behavioural leads, the injection of new capital sends a signal that there is an opportunity. As new entrants follow this purported positivity, their investments catalyse greater enthusiasm from the majority, which consequently leads to more investments. This cycle repeats itself as the appetite for these digital assets gain momentum.But whether this optimism is justified or not is subject to time. Crypto assets are still an embryonic asset class, and despite an accelerating bullishness, there is a lack of precedent to which the market can be compared.Counterintuitively, this ambiguity is the opportunity for startups.If there are no definitive laws by which the boundaries of innovation can be restricted, startups therefore have freedom to create. Coupled with the availability of capital, entrepreneurs are rewarded for ambitious visions as a means to further develop a relatively infantile eco-system.Australia is showing signs of developing such companies.The following are Australian startups looking to capitalize on the rise of this new industry.CoinjarCoinjar was founded in 2013 and allows users to exchange and store Bitcoins — one of the industry’s most recognized digital currencies. The Melbourne based startup is considered one of Australia’s most well recognized exchanges, as they aim to simplify the trading experience for new users in the space.  Coinjar have over 70,000 customers and have processed over $100 million worth of transactions, which demonstrates the scale of their operation. The popularity of Bitcoin, having increased almost twenty-fold in price this year, appears to be advantageous for this Australian startup.Power LedgerPower Ledger is Australia’s first startup to raise money through an ICO. Based out of Perth, the startup allows businesses and households to trade excess solar power through the use of blockchain technology. They successfully raised $27 million in October via an ICO and have since seen an eight times increase in their market capitalization.In a recent interview, Jemma Green, co-founder of Power Ledger emphasized that maintaining the value of her startup amidst a saturating ICO market was important.“We’re honestly delighted with the market’s response. Many companies do ICOs with concepts when they haven’t actually developed the platform, where we have a platform with real-life applications.”BlockbidBlockbid is an exchange that aims to provide the largest spread of cryptocurrency pairings worldwide. Based out of Melbourne, the startup has identified the dearth of user-friendly exchanges that allow users to easily trade alternative coins other than the primary cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.With an ICO currently in progress, Blockbid director Gabriel Govinda expressed in a recent interview the problem he was hoping to solve.""In the crypto world there are really only two types of exchanges: ones that convert dollars into currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and ones that convert Bitcoin and Ethereum into various ‘alt coins’.""But ultimately, despite the market’s attention, this asset class is still being born.Relative to the size and scale of other markets, cryptocurrencies have much maturation remaining. The recent interest suggests an upward trajectory of optimism. Whether the utility proves ubiquitous or not is still an unknown. But irrespective, market winds are signalling change. And with this change comes an opportunity.Startups are being empowered to innovate and imagine value in a new, untapped market. A market which has proven to have a growing appetite for new entrants.(Disclaimer: I have investments in cryptocurrencies.)"

Started by Jeremy Rubin and Dan Elitzer at MIT, the project offered $100 ...","Nov 30, 2017,12:27pm EST",Ryan Robinson,"Cloud computing is a $247 billion dollar market that is dominated by the likes of Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. These major players offer centralized computing for a variety of uses ranging from backing up your company’s data to producing big data analytics remotely.  However, there has been an interest in decentralized cloud computing as a cheaper option for businesses that cannot afford the prices set by incumbent providers. In addition, the potential for  decentralized cloud computing can open up the doors to cryptocurrency mining for those who do not have the expensive computing infrastructure needed to ‘mine’ for these digital currencies such as Bitcoin.  Ryan Robinson, a recent graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has built a startup named Conduit to address these emerging needs in the cloud computing and blockchain markets, respectively.         At first glance, it would not seem that Ryan Robinson would be interested in cloud computing, let alone technology. The Miami-Dade County native always viewed himself as an artsy kid. His main interests were poetry, music, and writing.  You were more likely to find him reciting the works of Keats and Yeats than immersing himself in code. But Robinson never viewed the arts as separate from technology. He saw technology as a form of art, as expression resonating with you and fulfilling a need at the same time. Robinson’s held technology in its purest form as bettering mankind. His unfettered belief in technology driving positive change drove him to apply to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.         During his time at MIT, he indulged in his two passions, physics and literature. Robinson found inspiration in the legendary physicist, Richard Feynman. He read his biography, Quantum Man: Richard Feynman’s Life in Science, the summer before coming to the Institute. Feynman’s last major contribution to science was postulating the fundamentals of quantum computing, an area that Robinson was only beginning to take interest in. The idea of quantum computing was planted in his head, and would continue to grow as he nurtured his mind with knowledge of the topic through his studies. His pursuit of quantum computing was solidified after he aced an advanced physics class focused on the subject. Robinson went to go on to take graduate level physics courses as an undergraduate, further cementing his understanding of quantum physics and computing. He wanted to put his knowledge to practical use by figuring out a way to bring quantum computing to the masses through his startup, Conduit.         Surprisingly, his idea for Conduit came from an introductory biology class he took in part to satisfy his General Institute Requirements. The professor of that biology class talked about how computers played an integral role in advancing the field, such as the Human Genome Project. One of the issues preventing us from improving our understanding of biological systems was the computation power necessary for these discoveries. Centralized cloud computing was one of the main ways that research labs were able to obtain the necessary computing power to drive their work, but the immense costs of cloud computing were prohibitive. Another source of inspiration for Conduit was the MIT Bitcoin Project. Started by Jeremy Rubin and Dan Elitzer at MIT, the project offered $100 in Bitcoin to every undergraduate student with the firm belief that “giving students access to cryptocurrencies is analogous to providing them with internet access at the dawn of the internet era.” Robinson wondered whether quantum computing could help drive down the costs of cloud computing, and help democratize resources needed for cryptocurrency mining. He wanted to make computation useful and accessible. His startup, Conduit, aimed make affordable, distributed computation a reality.         Conduit aims to gather underused or unused computational capacity from your device, say a smartphone or personal laptop, and share it others who need it to perform computationally intensive calculations, such as crunching through large data sets. Robinson’s goal for Conduit was to demonstrate the power of collective action by sharing computational power from hundreds of thousands of devices and loaning that resource out to companies and the cryptocurrency community who both need large amounts of computational resources for data storage or Bitcoin mining. Robinson had a grand idea for a pressing problem, but faced difficulty building Conduit as an undergrad at MIT.         Working on Conduit as an undergrad at MIT was challenging for Robinson. He found it grueling trying to build his startup while staying on top of his classes as well. The largest challenge he faced was recruitment. Essentially, he was competing with the established career narrative of MIT graduates being pipelined from school to a big name tech firm. He struggled to convince others at first that making an impact through building Conduit would be better than just earning a paycheck at an established tech firm. The prior teams he built beforehand didn’t take the startup seriously, and they also lacked the skills to bring their idea into reality. Robinson learned that he had to make better choices in picking a core team to build the product. His struggles in the beginning taught him critical lessons and made him aware of his own deficiencies. He knows going forward, he would have to build a team to cover for his own weaknesses and combine together for their collective strength.         Now that Robinson has graduated from MIT, he is free from the constraints that academics placed on his time. Conduit is making progress in its goals as he’s managed to build a great team around him. He finds that his MIT experience has toughened him mentally and has taught him how to work as efficiently as a machine. The problem solving skills he’s honed over four years at the Institute has helped him in solving immediate issues in bringing quantum computing to the masses. One day, Robinson will be able to help companies afford cheap, distributed computational power via quantum computing, and allow individuals to make money by loaning out their spare processing power and mining for cryptocurrency. With this kind of technology in everyone’s hands, everyone can be a conduit to power a better future."

Where Ethereum's broad decentralized app (dapp) ecosystem might lead to popular games like CryptoKitties, for instance, Qtum's ecosystem is designed to foster lightweight, effective business applications that are compatible with other major blockchains. QTUM is the token of the network. For a deeper dive, visit this piece in Global Coin Report.At 9:14pm PST, Dec. 17, QTUM sold for $29.67 USD, according to CoinMarketCap.

157,https://www.forbes.com/,"Sep 23, 2017",Inside the Meteoric Rise of ICOs,https://www.forbes.com/sites/chancebarnett/2017/09/23/inside-the-meteoric-rise-of-icos/,"This process of selling new cryptocurrency tokens in an ICO results in 
funding received via cryptocurrency, most commonly in Bitcoin or Ether.","Sep 23, 2017,01:21am EDT","Initial Coin Offerings (""ICOs"") have quickly grown to account for more startup funding in blockchain-based companies than all of Venture Capital. Nearly $2.3 billion has been raised to date in ICOs, with the large majority of that taking place in the first half of 2017.","In 2015 there was a smaller market for ICOs, where a million dollar sale was a rarity. Only a few of the most visible projects were raising sums in the millions.Then in 2016 the DAO raised over $150M in a few days, though it was later plagued with security issues and determined to be in violation of securities laws by the SEC. However, the size and speed of the funds raised for the DAO helped bring further attention to ICOs as a sale/funding model.Fast forward to 2017 and we’ve seen a meteoric rise in the amount of funding raised monthly in ICOs. April was $103M. May $232M. June hit $462M. July $574M.How ICOs WorkRather than looking to traditional angel or venture investors to place capital as an equity investment, companies developing new blockchain-based products and services have turned to the cryptocurrency community to crowdsource the purchase and usage of their token in an ICO.ICOs are similar in some ways to a crowdfunding campaign, but instead of offering a copy of a product like on Kickstarter, or shares of equity in a startup like on Crowdfunder, what is being offered are digital “tokens.” This process of selling new cryptocurrency tokens in an ICO results in funding received via cryptocurrency, most commonly in Bitcoin or Ether.But there's more to it...Utility TokensMost ICOs being done today aren't intended to be securities offerings, as they don't offer equity or ownership in the underlying company the way traditional angel or venture investments do. Rather, a large majority of ICOs are intended as “utility tokens"" which allow buyers of the token to access and pay for usage of a blockchain-based software service.One example of a utility token in use today is the Ether token, as it relates to the Ethereum computing platform. Ethereum is the blockchain-based platform where the large majority of the current ICO’s have been developed. When using the Ethereum network, there are costs associated with the processing of blockchain-based transactions. These costs are paid in the form of the tokens used on Ethereum, called Ether. These transaction fees paid in Ether are called ""gas"" in the Ethereum network.In this way, the Ether token provides access to, and payment for, the computing and transactional functions of Ethereum. But beyond its transactional usage, Ether is also a cryptocurrency that is bought, sold, and traded on the open markets.And while some tokens may not be considered a securities offering (utility tokens), the recent SEC release put out in July warned investors about the potential for fraud with ICOs as unregulated sales. Specifically, the release outlined details of the SEC investigation into the DAO which raised over $150M in its own ICO, and reiterated its ongoing concerns that some ICOs may constitute securities offerings, like the DAO, while not being treated as such.No formal new rulings or restrictions on ICOs have been issued recently by the SEC, though China recently banned ICOs altogether.Are Securities Tokens The New Equity Crowdfunding?In contrast to utility tokens, some ICOs are already being done as registered securities offerings.  One example is longtime Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investor and entrepreneur Brock Pierce, who sees a bright future in ICOs with registered securities - meaning they may include equity or some form of an investment return in connection with the tokens sold in the offering.Pierce is arguably a pioneer of the ICO space as an investor in Mastercoin, the first ICO, in 2013. More recently, his venture capital firm Blockchain Capital did the first ever ICO for a token as a security (BCAP token), selling participation in their venture capital fund as a liquid cryptocurrency.As we saw with the JOBS Act and equity crowdfunding laws, broader regulation can help open up a new market while protecting investors with regulated processes. But regulations can also introduce overly-burdensome requirements that hamper innovation and capital formation, as has seemed to be the case with the weak adoption by startups of Title III of the JOBS Act.What’s Driving the Growth of ICOsWith an understanding of what ICOs are, and an overview of how they work, there is still the question of what’s behind their incredible growth.Here are several of the likely contributors to the growth of this market, along with thoughts on each from leaders in the cryptocurrency and venture investing space...1. The Massive increase in the Value of Cryptocurrencies The market capitalization of all Cryptocurrency has risen from $7 billion in January of 2016 to over $130 billion as of now in September 2017.Bitcoin has appreciated nearly 30X since September of 2013 ($135 USD per Bitcoin), reaching over $4,000 per Bitcoin in September of 2017. In part, this is due to Bitcoin’s role as the most widely known, used, and accepted cryptocurrency for payments.Ether has appreciated more than 100X since August of 2015 ($2.83 USD), reaching over $300 in September of 2017. In part, this has been due to Ether’s role as the core utility token of Ethereum - the most widely used blockchain-based computing platform for ICO’s / token sales.The early cryptocurrency buyers and holders have experienced massive gains and are now sitting on hundreds of millions, or even billions, in cryptocurrency value.ICOs are a way for some of these early cryptocurrency holders to diversify their holdings using the cryptocurrency itself, without taking their money out into fiat currency (offline bank-based dollars).Sam Englebardt, Managing Director of Private Investments at Galaxy Investment Partners, the family office of billionaire and large cryptocurrency investor Mike Novogratz, said...“It would be naive not to acknowledge that there’s something very bubbly about what’s going on here with ICOs, but it’s also the easy answer. While bubbles are sometimes fueled by nothing more than pure speculative mania and greed, most are actually rooted in something very real. Railroads were that way. The internet was obviously like that; the excitement was built on a legitimately transformative innovation and, when the dust settled, that innovation ultimately met and exceeded the initial speculators’ wildest expectations. I think the same is true with the blockchain — the underlying potential of the blockchain to touch and disrupt so many different aspects of our lives, on a global scale, is becoming apparent. Ideas spread fast these days and crowdfunding did a lot of the groundwork to make those ideas actionable. It can’t go up like this forever, but I’d say we have a long way to go before we hit the top.""2. The Power of Blockchain, Tokenization, and DecentralizationIn the last year we’ve seen an incredible move by startups and founders towards use of blockchain technology and tokenized models. Rather than building new products on centralized architectures and database structures, an incredible wave of new development and innovation is happening on blockchain technology to kick off new decentralized services and models.There’s a deep technical community running full speed towards a blockchain-based future, with experienced technology company founders jumping in to the fray with blockchain. A majority of the ICOs you’re seeing today are for new companies, who are yet to launch their products to the market.That said, with the tremendous interest and adoption from leading technologists and founders, it’s no surprise that we’re also starting to see a growing list of more traditional VC investors putting money into decentralized applications and blockchain-based approaches to traditional and existing businesses.We’re also starting to see the ICO and tokenization model start to catch up with more mature and established companies. Erick Miller, CEO of CoinCircle and investor at his venture capital firm Hyperspeed Ventures, said...“The invention of true peer-to-peer digital money was first just an experiment that has grown into a revolution. This digital money, which pairs blockchain technology with cryptocurrency, enables an unprecedented transformation in how we store and transmit value. We are now in the next phase of the experiment and it is one of the most simple but incredibly fundamental paradigm shifts in the history of currency. Today, we have peer-to-peer programmable money, decentralized protocols utilizing their own coins, and coins that execute unstoppable decentralized logic all creating an entirely new economic system. I believe what is happening in the space today will bring about an era of new technological connectivity.”3. Token Sale ROIAnother reason for the rise in ICOs are the incredible returns that some tokens have provided to early buyers. For example, here are some top ICO performers according to ICOstats.com (as of September 22nd, 2017):Ethereum: 84,720% ROI since ICOStratis: 54,038% ROI since ICOAugur: 2,720% ROI since ICOROI values since ICO : https://icostats.com/roi-since-icoWith this, it’s incredibly important to understand that price appreciation of a token in the short term might have little, if any, bearing on the medium and long-term sustainability of the token and the underlying company or project for which the token was created.Cooper Maruyama the founder of ICOstats.com shared…“I think there’s sort of a snowball effect kicked off by the success of Bitcoin and Ether. I think people see this all under the umbrella of “crypto” and want to be in on the next thing that will bring large returns. So they throw ETH/BTC at new tokens - which ideologically falls under that same umbrella of “crypto” - with the expectation of the same returns. Whether that will be the case is yet to be seen, but according to the data, buying more ETH on the same day of each ICO has seen better returns over time.""4. Token Sales As Community AcquisitionGreat ICOs aren't just for the money. New services that leverage blockchain technology and incorporate token-based models do so to use tokens as a mechanism for the exchange of information and value within their product. Which is why, the more buyers and holders of a token, the greater the potential for the usage of the token, and thus demand.In this way, a token sale represents a new model of crowdsourcing or crowdfunding, where the line between buyers and customers are blurred.As an example, imagine if 1,000 new participants sign up and buy tokens in an ICO. This not only provides funding for futher development and expansion, it also jumpstarts the underlying service with a community of users as token holders. One example of this was the Bancor ICO, which took in over $153M at the time, while the sale also resulted in thousands of token-buyers. These early and first buyers of the Bancor token are the most likely future users and adopters of the core protocol and services that Bancor provides.""We had one of the largest bounty programs in history with thousands of active participants working towards the success of the token launch, directly through our software's alpha demo,"" Galia Benartzi, CoFounder and VP of Business Development at Bancor explained.""While we ourselves were a small team, we had ambassadors all over the world translating, explaining and creating great content about the Bancor protocol. These contributors remain more motivated than ever to see the project succeed, as they own a piece of the open source network via their tokens. Rather than paying marketing or PR firms, we can share these resources directly with end-users in a distributed and still orchestrated way. The reach is a step function larger and also feels much more authentically aligned. This is inline with blockchain's promise to decentralize every aspect of business, including growth itself.""What’s Next In The Market The majority of ICOs launched to date have been for relatively new and upstart companies with little or no existing growth or revenue.However, we’re starting to see ICOs come to market from more established VC-backed companies who are tokenizing their businesses. One example is Unikrn and their UnikoinGold token sale, the first token sale backed by Mark Cuban. The company is a post-Series A and VC-backed company, and a leader in the esports industry with a growing online community.""We won’t be taking the funds from our sale and trying build something from scratch, hoping to attract users and get adoption,” said Rahul Sood CEO of Unikrn in his Medium post about UnikoinGold. ""This isn’t an investment; it’s a purchase of a product that we developed that has utility on our platform and ours users love and demand. We already have users and adoption, and now the UnikoinGold token will unlock even more functionality and value for our community.”Expect more mature startups and large existing businesses to continue to explore the ICO space. With serious tech Founders and deep pocketed VCs and Crypto investors moving full-steam ahead, Blockchain and tokenization is emerging as one of the most powerful new technological and economic movements we’ve seen since the birth of the Internet. The hype and the astronomical returns can't last forever, but the underlying innovations are transformative and here to stay.To keep in touch, follow me: Twitter, LinkedIn—*Disclaimer: I’m CoFounder of CoinCircle, Founder & Chairman of Crowdfunder.com, an investor in Blockchain companies, I hold Bitcoin and Ether, and was a participant in JOBS Act legislative and regulatory efforts in Washington D.C."

Software Developers",https://www.forbes.com/sites/ktorpey/2017/10/30/report-ransomware-authors-can-earn-double-the-salary-of-legitimate-software-developers/,"I've worked all over the Bitcoin media space -- from being editor-in-chief 
at Inside Bitcoins to contributing to… Read More.","Oct 30, 2017,02:03pm EDT",Shutterstock,"A recent report from cyber security firm Carbon Black says that software developers can make more money developing ransomware than at traditional software development jobs. The report also details the greater ransomware industry as a whole, which now involves billions of dollars of financial activity per year.In addition to the tax-free earnings from ransomware development, software engineers may also be enticed by the relatively low amount of risk of getting caught. The report indicates that the use of Bitcoin and Tor, combined with a lack of fundamental security measures implemented by large institutions, has led to an explosion in the ransomware market.“While ransomware has existed for some time, the proliferation of Bitcoin and Tor have lowered the barrier to entry as it relates to launching ransomware attacks,” says the report from Carbon Black. “Their emergence has allowed the underground ransomware economy to achieve massive scale anonymously, making attribution and takedowns by law enforcement extremely difficult. If takedowns do happen they happen over months [or] years of hard work. Also, Bitcoin and Tor have lowered the risk. Not only have the dark web marketplaces evolved to better support high-risk, low-trust transactions through escrow systems, but the requirement for ransoms to be paid over the Tor network has ensured there’s no centralized endpoint to investigate with traditional geo-based law enforcement approaches.”“It appears that law enforcement assistance is not coming anytime soon,” the report adds.Ransomware Pays BetterAccording to the Carbon Black report, there has been an explosion of ransom-related malware sales in 2017, amounting to an increase of 2,502% over last year. These ransomware products are sold on more than 6,300 dark web marketplaces, and Carbon Black found 45,000 product listings on various markets during the course of their research.Ransomware software can sell for anywhere from less than a dollar to thousands of dollars depending on the sophistication of the software. Ransomware products that sell for over $1000 tend to be more specialized and may even include the source code — if it’s a legitimate offering at all.“The higher asking prices suggest the sellers expect a high level of success for these specific products or are looking to take advantage of unsuspecting buyers,” says the report.While ransomware payments, which totaled more than $1 billion in 2016, usually grab the headlines when estimating the size and scope of this criminal industry, sales of the actual software can lead to high profits as well.According to the Carbon Black report, ransomware authors can earn $163,000 per year, which is more than double the average salary for a software developer working on legal projects (according to PayScale.com). When compared to pay rates in Eastern Europe, ransomware authors can make more than three times as much as legitimate software developers.In addition to income from the sales of ransomware, the developers behind this software also earn money by providing training and support services.Ransomware-as-a-ServiceAccording to the report from Carbon Black, ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) has replaced the traditional distribution model previously found in the industry. Some ransomware authors run their own services, in addition to those who purchase the malicious software from others.“This tier helps to minimize the distribution risk by sharing the risk and amongst participants,” says the report.The report outlines the ransomware-as-a-service process as follows:Much like traditional online marketing campaigns, those involved in the distribution of malware will use metrics associated with a campaign in an effort to make the next one more profitable.At this point, ransomware is a booming industry with job opportunities that are also found at traditional tech startups such as development, customer support, marketing, and management.“RaaS makes ransomware available to even novice criminals,” says the report.As the ransomware industry continues to evolve, some experts believe it will force society to become more conscious of the importance of IT security."

not very many people understand why. Today In: Tech ...","Sep 21, 2017,09:39am EDT",(Photo: ROSLAN RAHMAN/AFP/Getty Images),"How far are we from mass adoption of the blockchain technology? originally appeared on Quora: the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.Answer by Samantha Radocchia, Co-Founder & CMO at Chronicled, on Quora:The 2 Things Holding Blockchain Back From Large Scale AdoptionBitcoin and Ethereum are all over the news these days.The problem is that not very many people understand why.The vernacular used to describe the space is highly technical, and is deeply rooted in the financial space. In the same way acronyms like CDOs confuse everyday consumers looking to manage their money, words like “mining” in the crypto and blockchain spaces are equally confusing.This, in itself, is a huge obstacle for both cryptocurrency and the underlying blockchain technologies—the fact that its value cannot be easily explained. And the people who came up with a lot of the words we use to describe what’s happening in these industries are not necessarily marketers, but cryptographers who may not be the best spokespeople for introducing innovations to the masses.Which means, if people can’t understand the value, they won’t buy in.Education is the first obstacle.I am very involved in the blockchain community, and I know I’m not the only one who can see the knowledge gap. I frequently attend events and watch presentations on use cases for blockchain technology, and it’s fairly obvious why most people haven’t been able to grasp many of these new concepts. How do you explain to someone what it means to “create a new block” on the blockchain? What is a “block” in the first place? What’s actually happening?For those of us who believe wholeheartedly in the future of this technology, it’s up to us to figure out how we can best explain what’s actually happening and why it’s important. For example, I recently spoke at the 100x Blockchain Online Summit, and it was enthralling to dive into such deep use cases and talk through specific problems that blockchain can solve, one of which was counterfeiting in big pharma. But to an everyday consumer, or even someone with a strong tech background, the terminology alone creates some roadblocks.The biggest reason education is the first obstacle is that you have to consider who really needs to buy into using blockchain technology in order for it to scale. It’s not just theorists and coders. It’s CEOs, heads of marketing and business development, even investors who are going to decide to foot the bill—or invest in the Ethereum platform, period.It’s worth noting, too, that this doesn’t mean every single consumer needs to fully understand how to build a block on the blockchain, for example. Just like everyday tech users don’t really know how the Internet itself “works,” but they have enough working knowledge to be able to use it—and use the programs built on top of it.That’s all that needs to happen. We just need a language understandable enough.Scaling the technology is the second obstacle.The second obstacle has less to do with everyday understanding, and more to do with how the underlying technology will scale as mass adoption begins to occur.From what I’ve seen so far, the problem is being approached from a few different angles. Right now, there are mostly public ledgers with a handful of permission ledgers—but a permission ledger, at the end of the day, is starting to feel very similar to a database. This poses the question, “How special is it then if every company or every industry has their own permission ledger?”That’s no different than the pharmaceutical industry in Europe, which operates on one big database controlled by the government.Blockchain is supposed to be the opposite of that. The idea is to be decentralized, not a newer form of centralized technology.The real roadblock, then, is to have the public ledgers store data so that it’s giving the promise of inner accessibility, while also being able to anonymously store and transfer data—which is where SNARKs and Zero-Knowledge Proofs can help tremendously. Being able to anonymously transfer serial numbers is really important in terms of leading to large-scale adoption of blockchain.However, on the Ethereum public ledger, the ‘gas’ prices are so high that for one individual asset to be registered to the public chain, it is three or even five dollars, which isn’t scalable. The platform can’t handle the transaction volume of even, say, all the serial numbers transferred in the pharmaceutical industry per day, let alone every potential industry that begins implementing blockchain technology.One way we are looking to solve for this second obstacle here at Chronicled, is in creating a common command language and global protocol through the Trusted IoT Alliance. The idea is to create open source methods to allow for compounding growth in the blockchain space.Neither one of the above obstacles will be solved overnight. It takes time for new technology, especially something as foundational as blockchain, to weave itself into the fabric of modern society. When we look back at the early 90s, these were the same obstacles that confronted the Internet. People struggled to understand it, and others questioned how such complicated tech would scale to mass adoption.Look where we are today.I’m confident that blockchain will overcome these same obstacles.This question originally appeared on Quora - the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.

Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg News,"Ripple prices have surged in the last few days, building upon their recent gains to rally more than 90% over the last 24 hours.The price of XRP tokens has climbed to as much as $0.8661, according to CoinMarketCap.By reaching this level, the digital currency has risen roughly 91.9% in the space of 24 hours and upwards of 300% from the weekly low of $0.2222 it reached on December 8, additional CoinMarketCap figures show.[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]Many of the major digital currencies - including Litecoin, Ether and Bitcoin - have generated compelling gains this year as the digital currency market surged higher.However, Ripple's year-to-date (YTD) increase of more than 11,000% takes the cake.As for what has caused Ripple's price to surge lately, analysts pointed to a few factors.Investors Seek DiversificationSeveral market observers asserted that Ripple's XRP tokens have been pushing higher as investors seek to diversify their portfolios with alternative protocol assets or ""altcoins.""Jeff Koyen, CEO of 360 Blockchain USA, a subsidiary of 360 BlockChain, agreed with this point of view.As mainstream investors rush into crypto, they're looking for bitcoin alternatives — either as a hedge or because bitcoin appears overbought. Litecoin lit up first, then it was Ethereum. These shoppers are working their way down the top-10, looking for safe, familiar names. Ripple fits the bill perfectly.Yazan Barghuthi, project lead at Jibrel Network, offered similar input, stating that the major altcoins have been positioning themselves to draw investment when Bitcoin suffers an inevitable correction.Crypto LockupSome analysts pointed to Ripple's recent announcement that it completed the cryptographic lockup of XRP tokens that it had promised to do earlier this year.In May, the company revealed plans to place 55 billion XRP tokens in a cryptographically-secured escrow account in order to help ensure the stability of total supply.Ripple revealed that it plans to create 55 smart contracts that will hold 1 billion XRP each. Every month, one of these contracts will expire, making the associated digital tokens available for use.Barghuthi asserted that XRP has gained as investors responded to this news. ""Ripple recently locked up a large amount of their unfrozen token supply in smart contracts,"" he emphasized. ""While the lock up had implications on price, it is more likely that the uptick in price is the market reacting to this move.""Sean Walsh, a partner at Redwood City Ventures, also spoke to the key role played by this move:In our opinion, there is just one factor responsible for Ripple's recent rise. It is Ripple's Dec 7 followthrough on their May 2017 promise of locking 55 Billion XRP into a time-release escrow. This is over half of their total token supply. This step instantly nullified a key criticism of their network. The first of the six fundamental characteristics of money is that it should be Scarce (SDDRFT).Disclosure: I own some Bitcoin and Ether."

Is it digital money? The new gold? A medium of exchange for the black market? Now, after the meteoric rise in ICOs and Bitcoin prices, we can say for certain: speculation.And this isn’t a bad thing. The majority of trading in financial markets is not for the exchange of goods and services but for speculation. In the FX market, the most liquid in the world at $5T exchanged daily, over 80% of trading is speculative. Without speculators, markets would be less liquid and would function poorly.We believe that the blockchain may be one of the greatest technologies for speculative trading in history. Not since the development of formal property systems 300 years ago, and the invention of writing 3,000 years before that, has there been a technology so capable of reducing friction to trade and creating new financial markets.It is so powerful that we now see thriving speculative markets for assets that just a few years ago would have been unimaginable. The largest ICO to date, Filecoin, raised $250M for a coin that represents the right to store files on a stranger’s computer. The second-largest cryptoasset, Ethereum, isn’t even a currency: its token represents the right to power a web application on a decentralized virtual machine.Granted, it was possible to purchase these “assets” before blockchains. Amazon sells you the right to store your files on their cloud with an “API key”, but has never let you trade that API key or exchange it for a Google API key. Today, this digital resource and many more are traded on global marketplaces with billions of dollars worth of daily volume, thanks to the blockchain.What makes the blockchain such an incredible technology for speculation? Let’s first examine what makes a good speculative asset and see how blockchains help.Desirable Properties Of Speculative AssetsIf you can’t be sure that the asset you’re trading is real, you will be reluctant to buy.Resistance to counterfeiting is the most important prerequisite for asset speculation. In fact, it is why governments got involved with money in the first place: powerful central organizations are needed to establish a uniform system of weights and measurements, verify that measurement with an irreplicable but recognizable stamp, and punish fraudsters.The anthropologist David Graeber, in his history of money and trade, shows that governments maintained financial systems of records even before coins existed, back when Sumerian Temple bureaucrats inscribed their city’s entire transaction history on tablets. And when governments were overthrown those tablets were the first to be destroyed, marking the end of a regime.More readily counterfeited assets are still speculated upon, but not easily. With art, speculators must consult expensive authenticators or deal with established auction houses, which is one reason that only the very wealthy can speculate.But cryptocurrencies cannot be counterfeited. They can certainly be stolen, but someone cannot spend a coin sitting in your wallet or “print” fake coins. This is the key technical breakthrough behind blockchains: they are immutable ledgers of transactions, stored not in Temple vaults but on the computers of “miners” across the world. The Bitcoin blockchain is the first scalable solution to the Byzantine Generals Problem, a long-standing problem in computer science, and the first decentralized solution to the double-spending problem. It is a remarkable achievement.Most assets, like dollars or gold bars, need to be stored physically, which makes it difficult or prohibitively expensive to transport, especially across borders.Bank accounts let you hold more portable representations of those assets, but 2 billion people are unbanked, mostly in the developing world. That’s one reason why two-thirds of U.S. cash is held overseas.Cryptocurrencies are held in a digital wallet and accessible by anyone who knows its private key, a random string of letters and numbers. Private keys can be stored any way you like: in your head, on paper, or a computer. You can cross borders or flee your house in the middle of the night without fear of losing your wealth.Any physical asset must be exchanged in person. Others, like stock certificates and gold ETFs, can be transferred digitally on exchanges and in certain geographies, but with restrictions. Only about 150 “members” can trade on the New York Stock Exchange, all of which are large banks and brokers.There are hundreds of crypto exchanges around the world that accept traders after basic identity checks, but exchanges are not even necessary. Anyone can transfer a cryptoasset from one wallet to another at any time, just by knowing the wallet’s public key. No intermediaries necessary.One problem with exchanging gold bars in person is that you’re never sure if the other person will rob you. This counterparty risk makes it difficult to trade large quantities, which is essential for speculators.The Western world has a pretty good solution, what the economist Hernando de Soto calls a “system of formal property” that allows you to turn your physical assets into paper or digital representations, like stock certificates and land titles. A vast network of institutions and procedures ensures the security of your representation: public record-keepers, escrow agents, appraisers, title insurance firms, custodians.Instead of trading bullion in person, gold traders take representations of their right to bullion to the Chicago commodities exchange and sell it in bulk, without having to move the asset. There is still some counterparty risk if the exchange doesn’t deliver the gold, but it’s much less than before.With the immutable ledger and public-key cryptography, transferring cryptoassets 1:1 carries virtually zero counterparty risk. You must use intermediaries if you want to trade with many people at once, though. Generally, these exchanges are less sophisticated than intermediaries in U.S. financial markets, which is a meaningful security gap that must be improved upon over time.The largest speculators prefer to transact anonymously, through Cayman entities and behind Swiss bank accounts.Cryptocurrencies vary in their privacy levels. Bitcoin, with its public ledger of transactions, is in many ways less anonymous than cash. But now there are new “privacy coins”, like Monero and ZCash, that incorporate breakthrough cryptography to make transactions untraceable.For the Western world, privacy may be crypto’s greatest improvement over existing speculative assets. It is so difficult to hide your transaction history that only the mega-rich even try. Even so, it doesn’t always work — see the Panama Papers, or the New York Times exposé on the foreign billionaires buying up Manhattan real estate.Subdivision is an underrated but essential ingredient for speculation. Most people can’t buy whole factories or companies but millions of people own Apple stock. The explosive growth of U.S. financial markets in the ’80s was largely due to securitization, a process for dividing up, tranching, and repackaging assets that previously could only be traded in their entirety.Cryptocurrencies are infinitely divisible. They are just bits, after all.People love speculating on contracts even more than assets. Consider a basic speculative contract: if the Yankees win the World Series, you give me $100. Today you cannot make this bet in much of the world and enforcement is difficult.With cryptoassets, contracts can be programmed directly into the asset itself, called “smart contracts."" Non-crypto assets can only be items in a contract, such that traders need offline contract enforcement regimes like court systems to fulfill “if this, then that” bets. Smart contract technology is still new and will take time to develop, but for speculators it is one of the most exciting promises of the blockchain.Note that our list says nothing about “intrinsic value”. Many skeptics argue that cryptocurrencies will fail because they have no fundamental demand — no government backing, no inescapable reason to hold the asset. That may be necessary for an asset to become “money” (although the jury is still out), but it is not necessary for speculation. Things like baseball cards, Beanie Babies, and even gold have little intrinsic value.Where In The Arc Of History?The biggest criticism of cryptoassets is that they are only good for speculation. That’s not true: there are many reasons to buy the underlying assets, like for computing power or to transact privately. But it is true that blockchains are unusually good for speculation. The mere fact that Bitcoins are counterfeit-proof makes it better than many existing speculative assets, like the $50B art market of which 10–70% are forgeries or the Zimbabwean dollar.And speculators have noticed. With millions of retail investors across the globe holding cryptoassets, it is one of the biggest investment trends of the millennium. On the institutional side, cryptoasset-focused funds are popping up every day. The two earliest, Polychain Capital and Metastable, are attracting capital more quickly than perhaps any first-time fund manager ever. A top ex-Fortress macro trader, Mike Novogratz, is raising a $500M fund. Goldman Sachs is allegedly starting a crypto trading desk.But we suspect it is only the beginning. Blockchains may be just as transformational as the last major trading technology, the Western formal property system that spurred on the Industrial Revolution. As De Soto writes:Just as a lake needs a hydroelectric plant to produce energy, assets need a formal property system to generate value. Without formal property to extract their economic potential and convert it into a form that can be easily transported and controlled, assets are like water in a lake, high in the Andes — an untapped stock of potential energy.It was the property system that converted physical assets into capital, a thing that could be quantified, traded, and used to generate further production — what Adam Smith called the true wealth of nations. The property system drastically lowered the barriers to trade and speculation, ushering in our era of liquidity and global capital markets. Blockchains may do the same."

encrypted, ...","Nov 22, 2017,01:28am EST",The potential for blockchain technology to bring about widespread change has been predicted since 2011 and the emergence of Bitcoin. But it was this year when the concept really started to capture people’s attention.,"Perhaps spurred on by the meteoric rise in price of Bitcoin – the first tangible example of a blockchain technology – hype grew around encrypted, distributed ledgers in the financial sector.ShutterstockBlockchain-focused financial services startups raised $240 million in venture funding during the first half of the year. However, its potential was beginning to be recognized across other sectors and industries.2018 is likely to see a continuation of this trend of innovation and disruption. Here are the five key ways this is likely to happen.While it’s implications for the financial sector might seem most apparent, any industry or organization in which recording and oversight of transactions is necessary could benefit. In healthcare, IDC Health Insights predicts that 20% of organizations will have moved beyond pilot projects and will have operationalized blockchain by 2020, so 2018 should see significant progress in that direction.In recruitment and HR, blockchain CVs have been developed which will streamline the selection process by verifying candidates’ qualifications and relevant experience.Legal work which involves tracking transfer of ownership – for example intellectual property law, or rea estate deeds – will also be made more efficient through implementation of distributed ledgers. Next year we should expect to see inroads by innovators in the legal field making this a reality.Meanwhile in manufacturing and industry, the Blockchain Research Institute, the founders of which include IBM, Pepsi Co and FedEx, say it expects blockchain to become the “second generation” of the digital revolution following the development of the internet. It has highlighted work by electronics manufacturer Foxconn to use blockchain to track transactions in its supply chain.Though this sounds like a clash of the buzzwords, serious thinking is going into how these technologies could be made to work together to improve business processes, and day-to-day life.Security is one reason they are a good fit – blockchain’s encrypted and trustless nature makes it a viable option when it comes to keeping the ever-growing number of connected devices in our homes and offices safe. Research envisages that blockchain compute power that is used to “mine” Bitcoin could be put to use safeguarding our smart homes from a new generation of cyber-burglars looking to break in and steal our data.Another proposed use is that the cryptocurrencies built on blockchains would prove ideal for automated micro-transactions made between machines. As well as recording machine activity on the ledger for record-keeping and analytical purposes, machines could effectively “pay” each other when smart machines operated by one organization interact and transact with those owned by others. This is likely to be further down the road, but it is likely we will see research and breakthroughs in this area in 2018.“Smart contracts” are another possibility brought about by blockchain – the idea is that contracts will execute automatically when conditions are filled, meaning payments will be made, or deliveries dispatched, or anything else in business which is typically defined by a contract.Blockchains make smart contracts possible because of their consensus-driven nature. Once agreed-on conditions are met, then the contract is filled. This could mean paying bonuses when targets are hit, or despatching an order once a payment has hit your account.Insurers AIG are piloting a blockchain smart contract system to oversee the creation of complex insurance policies which require international cooperation, and we should expect more to follow in their steps next year.ShutterstockPutin was the first – with the recent announcement of the “Crypto Rouble” – but it was inevitable that politicians would at some point start to consider the advantages of blockchain-derived currencies. In the wake of Bitcoin, it has often seemed that nation states have been lacking in their enthusiasm for this particular application – and probably with good cause. Bitcoin was after all envisaged as a way of creating a tradeable currency which couldn’t be manipulated by governments. Some such as China have been outright hostile – refusing to allow exchanges to operate in their borders and issuing warnings about the high risk of investing in cryptocurrencies. 2018 however could be the year that governments finally get on board the blockchain bandwagon – as its potential for creating efficiencies in both financial and public services become more apparent.Blockchain undoubtedly has the potential to be revolutionary. But like anything revolutionary it can be dangerous – in this case, mainly because rushing in without clear expectations of what you want to achieve is likely to be a costly waste of time.With any hyped technology (and blockchain is certainly hyped) there is a danger that the compulsion to avoid missing out can prompt action which is overly hasty or badly conceived. The important thing to remember is that, as with AI and Big Data, it is something which will change the world forever, but it is likely to be a gradual process. Without a doubt, every aspect of business is constantly affected and reinvented by technology, but there are always false starts and failures along the way.Those who avoid this fate will be those who set out with a clear understanding of what they are trying to achieve, and a strategy in place for getting there."

Healthcare companies, tech innovators and the rest of the healthcare industry are grappling with what’s possible now and what blockchain could solve in the future.","The overall vision for blockchain to disrupt healthcare in the future would be to solve many issues that plague the industry today to create a common database of health information that doctors and providers could access no matter what electronic medical system they used, higher security and privacy, less admin time for doctors so there’s more time to spend on patient care, and even better sharing of research results to facilitate new drug and treatment therapies for disease.ShutterstockWhat is blockchain?While blockchain principles were first applied in the financial world as the technology that allowed Bitcoin to operate, it has applications for many industries including healthcare. Blockchains are distributed systems that log transaction records on linked blocks and store them on an encrypted digital ledger. There is no one central administrator, but it has unprecedented security benefits because records are spread across a network of replicated databases that are always in sync. Users can only update the block they have access to, and those updates get replicated across the network. All entries are time and date stamped.What are potential uses of blockchains in healthcare?Although there are some incredibly exciting ways blockchains can enhance healthcare operations, it won’t be a cure-all for the industry today, but it would certainly be a step in the right direction. The healthcare industry is drowning in data—clinical trials, patient medical records, complex billing, medical research and more. Adoption and implementation of blockchains will be an evolution over time as blockchains applications are vetted and adopted as well as the industry coming together to determine collaboration and governance issues. As it always is with new technology, the full possibilities of what may transpire in the future is unknown at this time. However, as quoted in a Wired article, “Now is probably the right time in our history to take a fresh approach to data sharing in health care,” says John Halamka, chief information officer at Boston-based Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.Here are the most likely applications:Medical Data ManagementMedRec, one prototype using blockchains, is intended to improve electronical medical records and allow patients’ records to be accessed securely by any provider who needs it solving the waste of time, money and duplication in procedures, confusion and sometimes even life-threatening issue of records being distributed across many different facilities and providers. The goal with MedRec is to give patients and their providers one-stop access to their entire medical history across all providers they have ever seen. Additionally, if patients wish to grant access to their personal medical records to researchers, their data would be provided anonymously to be used in research which could make medical breakthroughs possible faster than they are now. This pioneer in the field shows the potential for how dramatically things could change in healthcare by deploying blockchains.Drug Development and Supply Chain IntegrityNot only could blockchains facilitate new drug development by making patient results more widely accessible (if the patients give their permission), it could help reduce the counterfeit drug implications that currently cost pharmaceutical companies an estimated $200 billion in losses annually.ShutterstockClaims and Billing ManagementMedicare fraud caused more than $30 million in losses in the United States in 2016, and blockchain-based systems could help minimize it. In addition, it could reduce admin costs for billing by eliminating the need for intermediaries with automated activities and more efficient processing.Medical ResearchCentralizing the results of clinical trials and patient outcomes for new treatment protocols can improve care and patient outcomes. Currently, with all the diverse and disconnected systems in play, there is no way for a human to process all the data that is generated and recorded in disparate systems for future treatment possibilities. Blockchains could provide the access to make medical innovation quicker.Data SecurityBetween 2015-2016, 140 million patient records were breached according to Protenus Breach Barometer report. With the growth of connected devices and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), existing health IT architecture is struggling to keep systems secure. Blockchain solutions have the potential to be the infrastructure that is needed to keep health data private and secure while reaping the benefits of connected medical devices.Although blockchain technology is currently changing the healthcare industry, keep in mind this is a marathon, not a sprint. Healthcare organizations and entities are testing and vetting how blockchains can better support their operations while future applications will inevitably be discovered along the way. It will be an fascinating process to watch."

analysts, Blockchain may finally find its place in 2018. Gartner ...","Sep 26, 2017,12:02pm EDT",Shutterstock,"Even though we haven’t quite hit the final quarter of 2017, you could say it’s been an eventful year in digital transformation. Just as I predicted last year at this time, user experience (UX), big data, smart machines — and of course, change itself—have proven big players in the business landscape this year. As we round the bend to 2018, we get a sense of what’s ahead in the digital transformation—barring any unexpected disruptions, of course.1-4. The IoT Will Push Us To The Edge — Literally (IoT, Analytics, Edge, 5G)One thing I noticed in putting this list together is that the IoT kept popping up, repeatedly. This is why it has found its way to the top. Gartner estimates more than 8.4 billion ""Things"" are on the internet today, up more than 30% from just one year ago. However, IoT alone is just the start. It isn't so much about the things, but rather what we do with these things once they are connected and supplying us data. Three of the main trends I see — the analytics revolution, edge computing, and 5G cell processing—are all driven by the IoT at their core. In fact, IDC predicts that up to 40% of all compute will happen at the edge in just the next couple of years. This is why trends 1-4 all rest with IoT.• Analytics (2): If you’re maxing out on data and analytics in 2017, just wait. The mass amount of information being created by the IoT has the power to revolutionize everything from manufacturing and healthcare to the layout and functioning of entire cities — allowing them to work more efficiently and profitably than ever before. One company, for instance, found that it was able to reduce the cost of managing its fleet of 180,000 trucks from 15 cents per mile to just 3 cents. That same kind of efficiency can be exercised in almost every industry, from retail to city planning. Tech giants such as Microsoft, IBM, SAS and SAP are all heavily investing in Analytics, more specifically IoT Analytics as they are seeing the power of this combination in driving new business insights across a vast array of industries and applications.
• Edge Computing (3): If you think you’ve already been pushed to the edge when it comes to digital transformation, look out: you haven’t seen anything yet. Just when many companies are finally beginning to move toward cloud computing, edge computing — driven by the sheer volume and speed of information produced by the IoT—is jumping to the forefront of the business scene. Industry leaders such as Cisco and HPE have made huge hardware, software and service bets on this movement, which I look at as strong validation of this trend. As smart drones, autonomous vehicles, and other AI-powered smart devices seek to connect and communicate instantly via the IoT, the matter of sending data “all the way” to the cloud will become highly impractical. Many of these devices will need real-time response and processing, making edge computing the only viable option. For those of you who have just jumped into the cloud generation: don’t fret. Though edge will continue to be the go-to choice for processing real-time data, it’s likely that the most important and relevant data will still head cloud-ward.• 5G (4): Just as the amount of data produced by the IoT will force data to the edge, it will also force mobile providers to move faster than ever — toward 5G. The level of hyper-connectivity expected by users today leaves little room not to move forward on the 5G path, but don’t get too excited. The move to 5G won’t happen overnight, and it will likely be patchy at best throughout the coming year. This year we are seeing  Gigabit LTE (the stepping stone between current LTE and 5G) making leaps with devices from Samsung and Sony leading the way. Today much of the Gigabit LTE movement is being powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon technology, but others will certainly seek to become involved in this rapid growth market for mobile.5. Blockchain Finds Its WayWhile its more popular cousin Bitcoin continues to blow away stock market analysts, Blockchain may finally find its place in 2018. Gartner shows that as of February this year, blockchain was the second top search term on its website, increasing 400% in just 12 months. To me, it’s no surprise. While the financial industry will be the first to begin utilizing this amazing tool, numerous others — from healthcare to entertainment to hospitality — will not be far behind. Granted, the move to blockchain will not come overnight either — just 20% of trade finance globally will use it by 2020. But once it finds its sea legs — most likely this year — there will literally be no turning back.6. AI Goes From Newbie To Mainstream“Yeah, yeah, I know — artificial intelligence.” That’s likely the response you’ll get when talking about AI in 2018. With everyone from toddlers to seniors using Alexa, Siri, and customer service chatbots, it’s no wonder AI may soon begin to feel like old news—at least to mainstream users. On the business side, however, so much power remains in AI — in everything from customer service and robotics to analytics and marketing. Companies will continue to use AI to surprise, connect, and communicate with their customers in ways they may not even appreciate or realize. This includes faster, cheaper, and smarter automation of everything from emails and content generation to industrial manufacturing. I believe we are still only at the beginning here, but we have seen the likes of IBM Watson, SAP Leonardo, Salesforce Einstein and other major software companies all launching embedded AI right into their platforms. This is a sign of what is to come.Top 10 Digital Transformation Trends for 20187. VR Goes From Hero To ZeroPoor VR. Just yesterday, tons of us were getting excited about buying our first set of VR headsets — and out of nowhere, AR has pushed it out of the way. Why? At least for now, it’s simply cheaper and easier to use, especially in a professional context. By using 3-D visualization, companies can better train, pitch, and envision new products — without the same expense of VR. This isn’t to say VR won’t have its day. Just not in 2018.8. Failure As A Service?Just as we saw the as-a-Service market continue to grow with software, infrastructure, and — just about everything else — failure will soon be a service on the aaS menu. The reason: failing fast is one of the most important elements of success in today’s quick-moving digital transformation environment. Failure-as-a-Service (FaaS) will provide visualization, rapid prototyping, and other fast fail methods that will help companies strategize fast for greater success. It’s a bit speculative to say it will be called “Failure-as-a-service,” but the ability to more quickly recognize when something isn’t working and move on will be a key differentiator between the winners and losers of digital transformation.9. Culture Remains a HurdleBad news: If your company is battling culture issues in digital transformation, they will struggle even harder in 2018. As the pace of change continues to increase — and the number of new technologies continue to grow — it will become even more imperative that companies move fast while moving forward toward growth. Companies that don’t embrace agility, or fail to knock down silos, will have an even more difficult time next year. You often hear that a leopard can’t change its spots, well culture isn’t that permanent and successful transformation are nearly impossible in a resistant culture.10. Digital Transformation Becomes a MustLast, whereas digital transformation may once have been just a buzzword in some (lagging) boardrooms in 2017, 2018 will force many companies to realize DX is no joke. It’s an imperative in today’s business market. Disruption will continue to be an increasingly common occurrence in the next few years, and companies unable or unprepared for those changes will quickly fall to the bottom of the pack.Indeed, if there is one thing that’s clear in digital transformation, it’s that all the technologies above are working together to push one another forward, creating a swell of change that simply cannot be resisted. The strength of the whole is already too strong to fight against. The companies that succeed — and survive — 2018 will be the ones that learn to go with the flow. This isn't to say there aren't other trends. No doubt security is heating back up as consumer privacy is at stake, but people continue to forgo privacy and security for experiences; this likely won't change even though it seems that it should. So what other trends do you see out there? Let's keep the conversation going below as we know Digital Transformation will stay hot in the year to come. "

Hence the proliferation of crypto hedge funds seen this past summer.","But not everyone who wants to invest in a basket of crypto assets can afford the minimums or fees of a hedge fund, and nor do all such investors want to hold anything more daring than a basket of the top coins.Enter Bitwise Asset Management, which is launching the HOLD 10, a new passively managed index fund of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by inflation-adjusted market capitalization.“It’s too hard to conveniently and securely own a portfolio of cryptocurrency,” says cofounder Hunter Horsley. “We felt [what] needed to exist was a robust index that tracks the large cap cryptocurrencies and the market as a whole.”Hunter Horsley and Hong Kim, cofounders of Bitwise Asset ManagementThe HOLD 10, named for a common saying in crypto (and Bitcoin in particular) to hold one’s coins rather than sell, will be sold as a traditional security to accredited investors who must meet income or net worth minimums ($200,000 a year in income or $1 million net worth). In that respect, it will be less similar to an ETF and more like the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), a private placement investment also sold to accredited investors that enables one to have exposure to Bitcoin in traditional financial accounts. The HOLD 10 will only have a management fee of 2-3%, and not the 20-30% performance fees of a hedge fund. It will also be available in some tax-advantaged (non-ERISA) accounts such as IRAs.Though Horsley and his cofounder Hong Kim do not have backgrounds in either crypto or traditional finance, they have secured some big names as investors/advisors, including Naval Ravikant, cofounder of AngelList, crypto hedge fund MetaStable Capital and CoinList, a sort of AngelList for early-stage tokens.“One thing I feel bad about with Metastable is it’s million-dollar minimums, we can’t take many investors, we’re basically full,” says Ravikant, adding that a lot of hedge funds charge high fees but only purchase top coins anyway. “I think a low-cost index solution makes sense where an investor can buy in with $50K or $25K and have an index that they wouldn’t have to worry about. It would hopefully be low-cost and constantly rebalanced. It also takes case of the custody problem.”As for the 26-year-old Horsley, who worked at Facebook and Instagram, and Kim, also 26, who worked on security software in the Korean military and interned at Google, Ravikant says, “I think they’re top-notch entrepreneurs. I’ve been circling them as a team for a while. As an early stage investor, I bet on teams that are unproven. That’s literally how I make a living. If a bunch of stodgy guys from JPMorgan were to walk in and say they were doing this, I probably wouldn’t invest in them.”Other investors and advisors include Elad Gil, cofounder of Color Genomics and a former Twitter vice president; Avichal Garg, part-time partner at Y Combinator; and Diogo Monica, security  lead at Docker.The index will hold and weight the top 10 cryptocurrencies by inflation-adjusted market capitalization, taking into account the supply inflation schedules for the next five years, in contrast to the more common ranking by current circulating supply on sites such as Coinmarketcap.com.Eligibility requirements include that a coin needs to trade on multiple exchanges, its monthly trading volumes must exceed 30% of circulating supply for the last three months, and it must have a free-floating price, not one pegged to another asset.As of September 26, the 10 coins the HOLD 10 contained based on the eligibility requirements and selection criteria, were Bitcoin, Ether, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, NEO, Zcash, Monero and Ether Classic. Prices will be pulled from Bitfinex, Bitstamp, GDAX, Gemini, Kraken, Poloniex and Bittrex and weighted by volume.Because it uses an inflation-adjusted market cap rather than one based on circulating supply, the main way it differs from the Coinmarketcap ranking is by the inclusion of Zcash (of which Ravikant serves on the foundation board), and the elimination of NEM and IOTA, whose trading volumes don’t meet the eligibility cutoff.The fund will be rebalanced monthly. By press time, Bitwise had not finalized its custodian for the 10 assets.“It’s an underserved area, and there’s a tremendous amount of demand for that type of product,” says Brian Kelly, CEO and founder of digital asset management firm BKCM, of the HOLD 10.“Having an option like this that charges 2% with plain vanilla exposure to the top 10 makes a lot of sense,” says Spencer Bogart, head of research at blockchain startup and token venture firm Blockchain Capital, who was previously an analyst at ETF.com. However, he cautioned that the industry from mutual funds, which the HOLD 10 approximates, is “hyper, hyper competitive … so it’s not just that people try to undercut each other’s fees the whole time, but it’s very much a game of scale. You need the same back office for one fund as you do for 100 funds, so you’re way more efficient at providing it for 100 funds than with one, so that will be a challenge for them. … If we start to see ETFs really emerge, this fund would struggle.” However, he acknowledges, it’s not clear if or when that would happen.And since Bitwise sees this as the first product in a line of investment vehicles, it may already be positioning itself to address that. Plus, as Horsley noted via email, ""In constructing portfolios many investors care about the specifics of the funds they hold, and so there's demand for lots of different products with nuanced differences.""Be sure to get Forbes' twice-weekly all things blockchain email newsletter, Crypto Confidential!

He responded that it was “the fear of missing a trend.” I suspect the leadership at great technology companies are similarly vigilant; the last thing they want is some new kid on the block disrupting their business models.In the last 20 years, it's hard to think of a single revolutionary technology that Amazon, Google, Apple, or Facebook did not experiment with. Cloud technology, artificial intelligence, big data, voice assistants, augmented reality, self driving cars, machine/deep learning … all of these have been embraced (even pioneered) by these companies. But when it comes to blockchain, these firms don’t seem fazed by (or bothered with) it.I don’t buy the argument that blockchain is just not relevant to these firms, because it’s not difficult to imagine scenarios where it could affect these companies. This article cites a few examples.“Yes, I could absolutely imagine a decentralized Amazon,” Lubin replied. “We’ve seen the pieces. They’re not all connected to one another. They’re not all but out or remotely mature, but I could imagine an open platform of many different actors with different roles.”The same could be done with Facebook, said Lubin, who is also founder of ConsenSys, a Brooklyn-based studio that develops Ethereum-based projects. “We could stand up a decentralized platform that offers same services.”The silence of these companies with respect to blockchain is therefore conspicuous for sure.The esoteric nature of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology makes it difficult for regular people to separate the wheat from the chaff. However, Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook have consistently attracted the best engineering talent and researchers from the top universities in the world. These folks understand Computer Science better than most, and if blockchain did in fact have the technical merits that people claim it does, it’s unlikely that the technologists at these companies would seemingly care so little about it.If you look back at the last five years, you can classify most people promulgating the values of blockchain technology into two buckets:If you look closely at what private blockchains are, it’s not apparent what’s technically novel about them. Princeton University’s Professor Arvind Narayanan, who offers what is perhaps the only reliable MOOC in this space, published a blog post that goes as far as saying that “Private blockchain” is just a confusing name for a shared database.Even the decentralization promised by public blockchains, while utopian in theory, is not without its fair share of problems. Firstly, there’s the issue of performance. Bitcoin, which uses blockchain in its pure form, has an abysmal throughput of 3–7 transactions per second. Compare this to a traditional system like Visa which can easily process over 25000 transactions per second [1]. Secondly, blockchain is still a solution in search of a problem. It doesn’t have a single application so far that’s either gone past the proof-of-concept phase or where it’s been definitively proven that the proposed blockchain-based solution performs better than the incumbent technology.Therefore, given that companies like Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple are not doing much with blockchain, even in the face of ever-increasing frenzy surrounding this technology, one could not be blamed for doubting blockchain’s potential as a game-changing paradigm.Disclaimer: I make the statements above in a personal capacity. They should not be seen as a reflection of my employer’s view on the topic.Footnotes[1] Bitcoin and Ethereum vs Visa and PayPal – Transactions per second - Altcoin TodayThis question originally appeared on Quora - the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.

Cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Lightcoin have seen unprecedented growth in 2017, despite remaining extremely volatile. While digital currencies across the board have divided opinion between financial institutions, and now have a market cap of around 175 Billion USD, the crypto sector coninues to grow, as it sees wider mainstreem adoption.

It is the disruptor of every industry and could change the world. Its touted benefits may include lower cost, risk, and capital requirements, faster transactions, more transparency and reliability, improved privacy, and unparalleled security, to name a few. In fact, my colleagues recently laid out their thoughts on unlocking the blockchain’s potential value for the public sector. Not bad for an idea that’s only eight years old.(By way of definition, blockchains are distributed, immutable ledgers of economic transactions. Each blockchain platform (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger) has a so-called scheme for verifying and recording transactions (e.g., Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, Proof of Time and Space, etc.). These schemes help to ensure the security and immutability of every entry. Blockchains can be public, permissioned, or private, each of which has distinct advantages and constraints.)For comparison, the traditional method of managing data (and the primary alternative to blockchain) is the centralized database. These can be relational (e.g., Oracle, SQL Server) or unstructured (e.g., Hadoop, MongoDB). Both types are capable, robust, and scalable, and in the near-term should be the default choice for many enterprise data management use cases.All the trials and triumphs of building a business – delivered to your inbox.To be sure, blockchain may indeed impact all manner of industries. Many of the benefits ascribed to it may be realized, but those benefits bring important limitations that cannot be ignored. It is crucial to recognize that blockchain is not the ideal solution to every data problem; it is a different rather than a better way to address data or transaction management. Under the right circumstances, blockchain could be transformative, but without careful planning it could also become a costly misadventure.As with most technology decisions, the blockchain question introduces a series of trade-offs. As to whether blockchain is needed at all, a number of journalists, academics, and platform providers have begun to address the issue, and we will avoid retreading this ground. Instead, we evaluate the criteria that matter for enterprise data or transaction management, as they are key factors when weighing blockchain against other alternatives. These are the key trade-offs organizations should pay attention to when evaluating Blockchain against centralized databases:No Guarantees on Better Enterprise SecurityBlockchain’s structural security and immutability have been discussed at length, and appear to offer real advantages over traditional datastores. High-profile hacks of blockchain systems have been attributed to the applications running on the blockchain rather than the architecture itself. Hybrid architectures, utilizing blockchain in combination with robust relational databases, appear even more promising, such as the keyless signature infrastructure used by the Estonian government.However, vulnerabilities at the application and user levels can diminish blockchain’s security improvements. In many organizations, the biggest vulnerabilities may be poorly-designed applications, phishing attacks against untrained users, or unpatched firmware on edge devices (picture medical devices in hospitals or smart sensors on an electrical grid). In these cases, blockchain may provide advantages without improving the security of the system as a whole. After all, the strongest lock does nothing if a window is left open or a thief is handed the key.Advantage: Blockchain has structural security advantages, but may or may not improve overall security.Improved Transaction Speed is Not a GivenBlockchain has been proposed for many use cases with real-time transaction requirements, from IoT applications to battlefield communications. Yet many of today’s public blockchains running Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus schemes, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, support far fewer transactions per second than legacy financial systems. Permissioned / private blockchains may be faster than public options, but often slower than what enterprise databases can achieve.On the other hand, digital contracts in blockchain could offer order-of-magnitude improvements in the speed of complex, multi-stakeholder transactions. Faster transactions would not be enabled by the technology per se, but by new processes that make use of blockchain’s architecture and features (e.g., transparency, immutability, traceability, etc.). Prime examples are real estate and intellectual property transfers and some financial transactions, where changes must be verified by numerous parties across siloed systems, thus taking a long time to execute. But digital contracts will depend on trusted, online proof of assets changing hands, and on the ability to support claims through the legal system. This requires that assets be identifiable (for instance, a house on a plot of land or a patent number for intellectual property).Smart contracts could further improve transaction speeds for programmable, rules-based interactions. In addition to the caveats above, however, the inputs for the rules must be trusted by all parties and accessible online. This could be a source of time, weather information, or sensor data (showing a certain amount of electricity being delivered to a house, or a car arriving at a particular location). This introduces another third-party source of data that must be trusted by all parties, and adds another vulnerability to the system. Nonetheless, if these caveats can be addressed, smart contracts could be a significant opportunity in the future.Advantage: Centralized databases are faster from a technical perspective, but new frameworks and processes that leverage blockchain’s features could offer improvements for certain types of transactions.Stewardship and Governance Still MatterOne important question an enterprise must ask before implementing blockchain is who will steward the solution over time. The nascent blockchain industry remains fragmented, with a wide array of platforms and vendors. Even early leaders such as Bitcoin and Ethereum remain in flux, with bitter disagreements over design decisions and the direction of the platform. This creates inherent risks that must be taken into account.Governance is another critical issue, particularly if control over the platform and its underlying data are held by a broader set of stakeholders or the general public. The flowcharts provided by the IEEE, IACR, and others are helpful for determining whether a blockchain is needed at all based on trust and access requirements. But even if one is needed, many questions remain: Who will fund and own the platform as well as the data? Who will ensure that it continues to meet evolving requirements? Who will be responsible for upgrades and maintenance? It is not a given that the parties responsible for writing to the blockchain and validating transactions will also ensure its continued relevance.Advantage: Stewardship and governance remain important even if responsibilities will be transitioned to trusted third-parties or the general public. In many cases relational databases will be the safer choiceMaintenance and Supportability Cannot Be IgnoredRelated to the question of stewardship, organizations must consider maintenance as they evaluate the viability of any technology. For blockchain, the fragmented platform landscape means there is limited support for any particular platform, and no guarantee that the provider will exist in the future. There has also been less time for the support landscape to develop, including strategic advisors, systems integrators, and managed service providers. In-house talent will be hard to find, and all the more important given blockchain’s inherent complexity. Contrast this with the decades of experience of traditional database vendors such as Oracle and Microsoft, and the dichotomy becomes apparent.Advantage: Centralized databases, both structured and unstructured, appear to hold far lower maintenance risk than even the most mature blockchain solutions.Scalability is a Crucial Challenge to AddressToday’s centralized databases can scale almost limitlessly as cloud computing and virtualization become commonplace. For many blockchain platforms, scaling remains a daunting challenge. Much has been written about the tremendous energy requirements of Bitcoin, and even Proof of Stake schemes may be problematic at scale, as blockchains grow larger with every subsequent transaction. This would be exacerbated if new data types such as images were added, which might necessitate much greater block sizes than those that are predominant today. Storage, networking, and computing limitations would be amplified as block sizes and transaction volumes increase.Permissioned blockchains with alternate consensus mechanisms and lower computing requirements may address this problem in part, though this will have implications for trust and transparency and may diminish some of blockchain’s most compelling features. The Hyperledger Performance and Scalability Working Group announced in June shows that the scalability challenge has yet to be solved.The solutions being proposed to scale blockchains are exceedingly complex, and well beyond the scope of this article. Suffice to say, enterprises should be cautious about building a data management infrastructure on a blockchain without a clear path to growth in the future.Advantage: Blockchain’s energy costs and storage requirements, as well as the uncertainty that accompanies any nascent technology, make it a far less scalable solution than existing databases.Cost is a Question MarkThe cost of blockchain relative to centralized databases appears to be contentious and ultimately unproven. Some industry-watchers believe blockchain can lower costs when compared with the hefty licensing and support fees charged by database giants such as Oracle. One notable example is the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) moving its credit default swap platform to a permissioned blockchain, which is expected to save 20-30% over the existing architecture.On the other hand, a business case for blockchain must account for a host of potential costs beyond hosting, licensing, and implementation. Hiring or outsourcing for talent to maintain the system could be significant. Energy costs may rise tremendously as the transaction volume increases. On top of all this, a buffer for unknown-unknowns and perhaps a “complexity premium” should be added. Small-scale prototypes or proof of concepts should be conducted wherever possible to validate expected cost savings relative to existing systems.Advantage: The full cost to an enterprise of sustaining a blockchain remains an unknown. Blockchain Bottom LineWhat does this mean for decision-makers considering the future of their data or transaction architecture? Blockchain’s potential requires that leaders make an investment in understanding the technology and necessary outcomes, with a focus on evaluating the trade-offs and characteristics of their specific use case. Simply put, a clear picture of the risks and the rewards should be drawn before critical systems are moved to a blockchain. But, at the same time, new opportunities made possible by blockchain should not be dismissed.If budgets and expertise allow for it, experimentation is an appealing way to avoid a sense of falling behind without betting the farm. Prototypes and duplicative, in-place systems may be a valuable tool in measuring trade-offs without putting critical data at risk. Participating in consortia or other partnerships may be another way to test the water. Those incremental steps may allow delay of significant investments until the technology and business environment has reached greater maturity and the potential gains become clear.Chris Haley is a Corporate Strategy Director at ICF, a global consulting firm.

In an ICO, early investors motivated by potential returns get a percentage of the cryptocurrency they invest in, and buy distributed cryptocoins, or “tokens” using fiat or virtual currency.  Similar to a traditional crowdfunding campaign, or an IPO in principle, the ICO offers digital “tokens” to its backers instead of an actual product or shares of equity.  Selling these tokens in turn leads to funding in cryptocurrency, usually in Bitcoin or Ether.Owing to the lucrative opportunities ICOs present -- the popular cryptocurrency Ethereum alone has a ROI of 84,720% since its ICO -- they’re gaining widespread appeal among celebrities hoping to cash in. Hilton backed “LydianCoin,” a startup providing digital marketing services to blockchain, while Mayweather took to Instagram to promote Stox’s ICO. Stox is an open source prediction market platform which has raised $30 million from its ICO as of August, which will enable everyday people to predict events ranging from finance to politics.Stacks of bitcoins sit near green lights on a data cable terminal inside a communications room at an...

So What Is Blockchain? Blockchain is a database or public ledger that maintains a list of data records or transactions that cannot be altered in any way unless group consensus is given . This makes the blockchain infinitely more secure, removing the need for a central authority to approve transactions. The upsides of this decentralized solution for businesses are many. For one, it creates a proof of history and auditable trail, while decreasing audit and litigation costs and improving trust among partners.No one understands the outsize benefits of blockchain better than serial entrepreneur Brendan Blumer, whose Cayman Islands-based company Block.One aims to help businesses streamline their operations by leveraging blockchain. Block.One developed the blockchain platform EOS, which has EOS tokens as its native cryptocurrency. Among its other differentiating factors,  EOS is the only blockchain platform with parallel processing, which brings continuous scalability. It also aims to solve major issues that existing decentralized applications pose. Speaking at this year’s Forbes Global CEO Conference in Hong Kong, Blumer demystified blockchain with a simple analogy.  “ If the Internet was mass, scalable, insecure data transfer, [then] the blockchain represents mass, secure data transfer, and everything that comes with it. ”While EOS will have its own blockchain, Block.One’s ICO is currently conducted on Ethereum, where profit generation comes from holding EOS tokens slated to appreciate in value. Earlier in July, Block.One set a new ICO fundraising record by raising $185 million in ether -- Ethereum’s native token -- in just five days, beating out the previous record of $153 million held by competitor Bancor. Block.One’s crowdsale, which is another term for an ICO, began in June this year and will continue for 314 days until June of 2018, meaning participants can buy the platform’s EOS tokens anytime within that period. Its crowdsale comes at a time when other blockchain startups have typically released much shorter week-long or month-long token sales.Floyd Mayweather claims he's going to ""make a $hit t$n of money on August 26th.""Paris Hilton announced her backing of LydiaCoin in September, but has since removed the Tweet.“We felt an approximately year-long token distribution was the best method to ensure people receive fair market value for EOS tokens,” Blumer told Crytocoin News. The longer crowdsale period also prevents the network from congesting as investors flock to this opportunity -- which is what happened during Bancor’s ICO. A longer window also prevents quick sell-out and levels the playing field by giving small investors a chance.The Anti-Cryptocurrency Camp While some celebrities have been quick to champion ICOs, this enthusiasm is not universal. Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of J.P. Morgan, recently took a hit when he called the bitcoin mania a fraud, causing the price of bitcoin to plummet as much as 24%. A few days later, his firm was found actively buying Bitcoin XBT, a Stockholm-based bitcoin tracker fund. Taking a more sympathetic stance towards Dimon, Blumer reasoned, “What would you say if your business was entering its extinction phase? There’s not much of a choice for him [Dimon] and the stance that he’s taken… I think more banks will take an anti-cryptocurrency stance as they realize the threat it represents to their organizations.”On the other side of the Pacific, China’s ban on ICOs in September this year remains a major roadblock to cryptocurrency’s global fundraising efforts there, and there is speculation that other countries like South Korea will soon be following suit. But Blumer was unfazed. “Hopefully the outcome of this approach will be informed regulation that will foster more mainstream adoption of these projects, that also takes into account consumer protection.”CEO of Block.One, Brendan Blumer, speaks to FORBES at the 2017 Global CEO Conference."

But the global expansion of virtual currencies is facing some challenges, as China and South Korea have both banned initial coin offerings (ICOs), according to a report by The Verge.","With countries backing away from ICOs without further regulation, the use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies seems to have an uphill battle as a commonplace currency in the market. Will more countries follow suit and ban initial coin offerings?ShutterstockNine members of Forbes Technology Council weighed in on the impact these ICO bans will have on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Here is what they had to say:1. The Crypto Bubble Will BurstAs Asian regulators become more bearish on cryptocurrencies, the cyrpto bubble in Western markets (especially Silicon Valley) will become stretched ever more tightly. Just before the first major cryptocurrencies experience a flight to better-founded securities investments (bitcoin will probably be the first), the SEC will muster conviction to regulate, and the bubble will burst hard and fast. - Carson Kahn, Volley.com2. Other Countries Will Not Follow SuitWhen more countries don't follow suit and begin to utilize cryptocurrency more, this will help combat these bans and show these countries what they are missing in terms of opportunities. It may take a while, but it's a battle worth fighting to ensure this type of alternative transaction system continues. - Chalmers Brown, Due3. Government Attention Offers ValidationWe'll certainly see more questions about credibility and viability. But the fact that government bodies are paying attention offers validation. ICOs and cryptocurrencies are here to stay; these short-term setbacks will only propel the space forward in the long run. The evolution is unprecedented, and this is only the start of the decentralized, dis-intermediated financial market of the future. - Adnane Charchour, Exous4. Nothing Has Really ChangedSince China’s ICO ban, we have even seen the markets resurge. And as a blockchain-based startup, we continue seeing growing interest. We had many investors from China with mutual investment agreements for M. Now all of these investors will plan to register funds where it is legal for them to participate. So, nothing has really been changed. - Alex Bessonov, BitClave5. The Bans Will Likely Be DroppedWhile Chinese and South Korean regulators have banned ICOs, this is only temporary. Within one month of that event, Japan's Financial Services Agency stepped up as a leader in the region by officially endorsing 11 companies as operators of cryptocurrency exchanges with no plans to ban ICOs. China and South Korea are likely to drop their respective bans on ICOs, only after establishing their policies for regulation. - Justin Lundy, Evident.io6. Cryptocurrencies Are Here To StayICOs are used to raise funds, and like any fundraising strategy, they can be abused. The technology itself isn’t flawed, but there’s been little time for regulations and norms to develop around ICOs, so nations are acting to protect investors and their perceived economic interests. The bans may impact the value of cryptocurrencies in the short term, but the long-term outlook is positive. - Vik Patel, Nexcess7. Trust, Cost And Convenience Are KeySome exponential technologies are unstoppable yet are still in their linear or deceptive stage. Neither regulation nor public resistance will stop this kind of progress. As long as the trust, cost and convenience factors are met, it’s here to stay. - Avi Reichental, XponentialWorks8. Cryptocurrencies May Be The Future Of The Financial IndustryWith tech markets around the world continuing to invest in cryptocurrencies, it is doubtful that innovative countries such as China will allow themselves to fall behind. Thus, the banning of ICOs in select countries will not affect cryptocurrencies too much. Cryptocurrencies are being researched as a potential option for the future of the financial industry, and soon we may see countries legitimize them. - David Lefever, The Mako Group9. Governments That Adapt First Will Reap The BenefitsThis isn't the first time China has done this. It's banned and unbanned bitcoin so many times that I think people are starting to become immune to its policy changes. Cryptocurrencies are here to stay, and the governments that adapt first will reap the benefits later. - Thomas Griffin, OptinMonster"

It was a high-profile mention for the Signapore-based LydianCoin Pte. Ltd., which aims to raise $100 million through its still-unscheduled token sale. The endorsement was a boon for the little-known firm -- at least until Hilton deleted her tweet a few weeks later. (After publication, a Hilton spokesperson said she is no longer involved with Lydian.)While a $100 million initial coin offering is almost run-of-the-mill these days, the LydianCoin ICO is noteworthy for both what it had—high-power celeb endorsement—and what it lacks. Tokens that might be worth investing in typically represent some sort of technological advance, but LydianCoin itself states that its tokens aren’t much more than a way to pre-pay the company for the services of its parent company, ad tech firm Gravity4. And, like many tokens entering the market, LydianCoin faces uncertainty around which types of tokens the Securities and Exchange Commission might rule to be securities, and thus subject to a raft of SEC regulations.Further complicating matters are the ongoing legal issues facing the head of Gravity4 and LydianCoin, Gurbasksh Chahal — an Indian-American Horatio Alger who sold his first company at age 18 for $40 million (or possibly $25 million). In 2014, he pleaded guilty to abusing his then-girlfriend. Now, he not only faces possible jail time for violating probation — after allegedly kicking another woman — but he is also being sued by at least four former employees for harassment and discrimination. Three of those lawsuits name Gravity4 as a co-defendant, citing harassment in the workplace. Chahal has called the allegations against him “baseless” and “frivolous.”Chahal’s entrance into crypto assets — with or without Hilton’s tweeted endorsement — is part of a new digital gold rush, in which separating real companies from scams and get-rich-quick schemes can be increasingly difficult. Right now crypto is a lightly regulated space in which the foolhardy are going into debt to buy new tokens — a few of which have seen their values rise 1,000- to 5,000-fold since their ICOs, but which carry significant risk.Gravity4 and LydianCoin CEO Gurbaksh Chahal (Charley Gallay/Getty Images for Fox)[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]According to CoinDesk, all-time funding from ICOs, also called token sales, exceeded $1.8 billion by the end of August, up from $295 million at the start of this year -- and the pace is only quickening. And TokenData, which has catalogued 625 ICOs in 2017 in total, says four closed in January, 15 in April, 65 in August, and by month’s end, 132 will have completed in September. In the frenzy, the savvy and the imprudent are transacting with both visionaries and the unscrupulous.Fundraising on Borrowed TimeThe video LydianCoin uses to advertise the company shows the highlights of Chahal’s life, from smiling with Barack Obama to sitting on Oprah’s couch to audience applause.What it omits are his mug shots after the tech mogul was arrested twice for alleged violence against women. In 2013, Chahal was caught on video hitting his girlfriend 117 times. After he was charged with 47 felonies, a judge ruled that the video was not admissible as evidence because of how police collected it. In April 2014, Chahal pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges of battery and domestic abuse. He was sentenced to three years of probation, along with 25 hours of community service and ordered to attend a domestic violence training program. By October of that year, he was arrested again for violating his probation after another woman alleged that he had kicked her multiple times. A representative for Chahal called the police report on the incident “false” and “baseless.” In August 2016 Chahal was sentenced to a year in jail for violating probation, a ruling he immediately appealed.Now a year later, Chahal is running the LydianCoin launch on borrowed time as he awaits a court decision on the appeal for his probation case. If Chahal fails to win the appeal, he will be taken into custody or have a time arranged for his surrender, a San Francisco District Attorney’s Office spokesperson told Forbes. (Chahal and Gravity4 did not respond to requests for comment.)More Legal Hot Water?According to LydianCoin, owners of the tokens, named for the first civilization to use coins, get exclusive access -- but only for a limited time -- to products under development by Gravity4, including MonaChain, described as “a blockchain-driven anti-ad fraud system,” and MonaBrowse, which will provide an ad-free web browsing experience. But the main purpose of Lydian tokens is to pay for Gravity4’s marketing services and products -- which could be done in, well, dollars. As the LydianCoin white paper puts it, “Why Use Lydian To Purchase Services Available for Purchase with Fiat Currency?” (The response is a bunch of words that do not contain the answer.)Chahal’s personal legal challenges aside, his company is now diving into an area where regulations aren’t entirely clear. The rules around the issuance of digital tokens and when they classify as securities are currently being formulated in the U.S. Those classified as securities would be required to register as such with the SEC and include all proper disclosures for investors.Whether or not Lydian tokens are securities would be determined by a judge – and that would happen only if LydianCoin is ever sued by an investor or the SEC. In July, the SEC issued a report declaring a now-defunct token called DAO tokens securities. Prior to that, in December 2015, it sued Josh Garza, GAW Miners and Zen Miner for a fraud that included an announcement to launch of Paycoin as a way of prolonging their fraud. (The SEC declined to comment about LydianCoin.)What is known as the Howey test is often used to determine whether an offering is a security; it was cited in the SEC’s main guidance thus far on crypto assets -- the July report on DAO tokens. Peter Van Valkenburgh, a lawyer and the research director at cryptocurrency advocacy organization Coin Center who is well-versed in how securities law applies to these new types of assets, said the LydianCoin could meet all four of the Howey test’s prongs, which would classify it as a security. The four prongs are that the offering be (1) an investment of money in (2) a common enterprise (3) where there is an expectation of profits (4) that comes only from the efforts of the promoter or third party.LydianCoin seems to meet these criteria, said Van Valkenburgh, because, “the economic realities of something with promotional materials like LydianCoin is people believe they’re going to get rich based on the efforts of the person selling them the tokens. The purpose of the [LydianCoin] is to raise money by offering this liquid asset. And it is suggested heavily by the marketing materials that the value of the asset will skyrocket relative to the efforts of the third party. And you should buy them now in order to get in on the ground floor.”Lawyer Stephen Palley of Anderson Kill said of the LydianCoin white paper, “They use the word utility token more than once, and the talismanic usage of a word like utility token doesn’t necessarily mean it’s legal.” A utility token is a coin that has a function beyond just speculative value, similar to the way someone purchasing a Manhattan condo is likely to profit from its value going up, but they’re buying it presumably because of its utility as a habitat. “I’m not saying this thing is legal or not illegal,” said Palley. “I’m just saying that using words like utility token doesn’t guarantee anything.”However, maybe because of the risk that it could be deemed security, even compared to other coins, the Lydian token is carefully structured to obtain what is called safe harbor under rule 506 of Regulation D (and the white paper states they are making this offer “in a manner substantially similar” to that exemption). Under Reg D, the issuer makes an offering that would typically be considered an unregistered security but does so in accordance with certain strictures, such as requiring that U.S. buyers be accredited investors with a net worth of over $1 million or an annual income of $200,000. The risk Chahal runs is, if the company fails to comply with all conditions of the safe harbor provision, he could be found to be issuing an unregistered security. The penalties for that could be as little as a few thousand dollars and as severe as 20 years in jail. And someone found issuing an unregistered security could also be required to hand over all profits from the offering.A Bad Deal For Buyers?Assuming Lydian meets the conditions for safe harbor, what Lydian token purchasers may not realize is that buyers purchasing securities under safe harbor cannot sell them for a year — a fact not mentioned in the Lydian Coin white paper, though it does ask every purchaser to “represent in writing that it is acquiring the Lydian tokens … not with a view to resell or distribute such securities.” Since many token buyers participate in ICOs in order to sell on secondary markets and turn a profit, this restriction could make Lydian unappealing to them.But even for those buying and holding (or “hodling” in Bitcoin parlance), there isn’t an obvious value to the token. “The promo materials are absolutely vague as to the actual underlying purpose or technology or anything to do with the fundamentals of the project,” said Van Valkenburgh. “From looking at the promotional materials, the fairly nonsensical white paper and the personal history of some of the people involved, I would be extremely skeptical about whether there’s any technology here or just an attempt to raise a lot of money off the hype of the ICO bubble.”As Marco Santori, a partner at law firm Cooley who specializes in law concerning blockchain technology but had not read the LydianCoin white paper, said, “Why would I give you my dollar today for the promise of a hamburger tomorrow, if I can just pay for the hamburger tomorrow?” he said. He also noted that the secondary market for such a token would be rather flat. “If I just sell a gift card at a dollar for a dollar, like store credit, I don’t know what the investment use case is there,” he said.Palley agrees. Noting that purchasers need to provide identification and verification of their accredited investor status to buy tokens, he concludes, “It’s not the most ridiculous thing I’ve seen. What I come back to is I’m just not sure why you need a token to do this.“If Gravity4 succeeds in raising money this way, it will create $100 million of liability on its books. And if the company’s founder loses his appeal and ends up serving jail time, and Gravity4 has to pay damages in any of the pending employment-related lawsuits, the company’s ability to deliver the services it has already promised could be in question.A Risky Endorsement While Chahal may have nothing to lose by further tarnishing his already besmirched reputation, being associated with LydianCoin might not be a good look for anyone who endorses it.That may be why Hilton deleted her tweet and now says she is no longer involved with the new venture by Chahal, a violent criminal whose past was more thoroughly revealed in a Daily Beast article, “Silicon Valley CEO Called Employees the N-Word and Hit Three Women, New Lawsuit Claims,” last week. Plus, as Fortune noted in a story on celebrity-backed ICOs, Hilton and other big-name backers of cryptocurrencies do so at their own legal risk.And considering the possibility that Chahal could serve jail time, the four lawsuits hanging over him and the narrow tightrope the offering may be walking trying to comply with securities law, LydianCoin investors also bear risk, but of a different kind.Stay informed and ahead of the crowd with Forbes Crypto Confidential, a free e-letter delivered to your inbox twice a week.

It has all ...","Oct 4, 2017,10:20am EDT","Crypto currencies have surged exponentially over the last few months to collectively reach close to US$150 billion in market capitalization. This has started attracting attention from fiat investors and regulators from around the world. And, everyone has their own opinion about whether these currencies are in a bubble or not.","As the ""Big Daddy"" and largest crypto currency by market cap, Bitcoin represents around 45% of the entire crypto currency universe. It has all the characteristics of a currency and aspects of being a commodity and a technology. It has limited supply, with less than 21 million Bitcoin ever being issued, can be used as a means of payment and a store of value.But what is striking is the lack of investment vehicles available to crypto currency holders. Currently, they have the choice between holding crypto currencies and jumping from one to another - directly or through some dedicated funds - or invest in private equity/crowdfunding through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).The first option, however, does not allow for significantly large volumes to be traded as the cryptocurrency market is still very fragmented. According to Stéphane Ifrah, CEO of French-based NaPoleonX, dubbed the first algorithmic crypto-asset manager, the second option is quite risky and “a large number of ICOs should fail - if we take the internet revolution as a benchmark in 2000’s.”In the asset management industry there have recently been quite a number of ICOs, some of which have proved very successful. These include Blackmoon, Cindicator, DIGIX, Enigma, ICONOMI and Melonport to name a few.A first category are those that are providing the infrastructure to launch crypto funds, while a second group are offering services to asset managers such as providing financial data. And, a third category in the shape of hedge funds, which have specialized in crypto currency trading. However, not all these ICOs allow for the possibility to bridge the gap with the real world.In the case of Blackmoon, it is touted as enabling the gap between crypto and real investment to be bridged, which was the main reason for this particular project to exist. As such asset managers will be able to have funds that will help to invest in both worlds.“We believe that in order to continue to attract new investors from the fiat world, more conventional investment vehicles will be required. They will need to handle large amounts of investment and bear a more reasonable risk level,” asserted NaPoleonX’s Ifrah, who started developing algo strategies over 10 years ago at BNP Paribas and headed an investment team until 2013 managing c.€4 billion (c.$4.7 billion today).(Image: Shutterstock).A graduate from the École Polytechnique (EP) in Paris, one of France’s most prestigious grandes écoles, and who holds a Data Science certification from EP, Ifrah subsequently participated in the launch of a hedge fund before becoming involved with the crypto currency world. He is joined in NaPoleonX’s project by co-founders, Jean-Charles Dudek and Arnaud Dartois, who have each more than 15 years of finance sector experience.Tokenization Of Real AssetsWhat has been observed of late is the tokenization of real assets. This is a clever way to reduce liquidity concern and alleviate risk considerations. Gold and now real estate have been the first real assets to be tokenized.However, Ifrah, who spoke yesterday at the BECON (Blockchain Ecosystem Network) conference in Barcelona that runs from October 3 to 5, pointed out that there is “one drawback” in that funds tokenizing real assets have had to sell their crypto currency and buy those real assets. Given the exponential run of the crypto currencies over 2017, these tokens have also performed badly on a relative basis.Take the price in Bitcoin (BTC) and US dollars for the tokenization of Gold by DigixDAO (DGD), which ranked the 45th highest cryptocurrency by market capitalization as October 3 2017 and reached a year high of $103.53 on June 12 (equivalent at the time to 0.034754 BTC).This was before it declined to $47.50 (0.023969BTC) a month later on July 17 and thereafter rebounding to $99.20 (0.021456 BTC) by the end of August. Today (12.34 UTC) it was trading at $72.60 or the equivalent of 0.016948 BTC. So, while the price of DGD in US dollars between June 12 and has seen a decline of almost 30%, its value in BTC terms has halved.Many ventures in the blockchain and crypto space also claim they have some special kind of mousetrap and they are the first to initiate X or Y. But can one believe all the bluster and hype?Well, in this environment there is perhaps one project, NaPoleonX, which could potentially offer an interesting solution that is claimed “ticks all boxes” according to the protagonists behind it.The Paris-based firm has specialized in low frequency quantitative trading on liquid assets through futures only. This allows it to handle very large amounts and provide regular returns. For example, at the market close it is possible to trade $300m plus fairly easily in just one click on the futures markets according to the firm.The concept behind the NaPoleonX project is explained as: “An investment solution dedicated to cryptocurrency holders, through the creation of an open online computer driven asset management platform selecting quantitative strategies (trading bots) from world class traders. [This is] where each crypto-fund dedicated to a specific asset class shall enhance the traditional model by improving its governance through smart contracts’ implementation.”Now because NaPoleonX is also able to use derivatives to hedge crypto currency fluctuations, they claim that they will be able to “transpose” the strategies’ performance into crypto currencies directly.This, it is asserted “will give birth” to the first crypto currency plus funds that can handle large amounts - in the region of $200m or more according to Ifrah.And, given that quantitative strategies have started to expand exponentially over the last ten years in the traditional asset management universe, this is a proposition that should “please traditional investors” the firm posited.But while these investors may be tempted to invest some of their assets in the crypto universe, they would need reassurance that it is undertaken by following well-known investment techniques and for sizeable amounts.Nick Ayton, CEO and founder of Chainstarter, a second generation ICO platform, who attended and also spoke at the same Blockchain conference in Barcelona, commenting in relation to NapoleonX’s attributes said: “When our team evaluated the NapoleonX project in recent months it looked robust to us and seemed like a good concept that we liked. It also comprises a management team that hold a number PhD’s.”He added: ""That said, with algorithmic trading being applied to the cryptocurrency space, one won't exactly know whether it will work until after it launches and seeing the subsequent performance of the algorithms. And, that will hinge on the code used, which would probably require a computer scientist to understand it.” By way of background, Chainstarter has been set up specifically to help technology-inspired entrepreneurs raise ethically sourced crypto-funding for blockchain start-ups and established businesses alike.Traditional Asset Management Industry NapoleonX’s whitepaper makes reference to the asset management industry having been dominated in an “oligopolistic manner” by large banks or financial institutions for ages and that they want to “bypass” the traditional asset management system.Between them such institutions have accumulated huge amounts of fees while delivering poor performance - and on the back of investors – “who are the real risk takers” it was noted by the French firm.Trading bots, which are very cost effective today, have started challenge the aforementioned institutions. The NapoleonX whitepaper stated that over time: “Algorithms will become smarter and more efficient. They will reduce all these undue expensive management fees down to more acceptable levels.”Highlighting the exponential interest in quantitative strategies in recent years, the graph below depicts the growth in assets under management for systematic strategies called Smart Beta (see the plain black line).Graph showing growth in assets under management for systematic strategies called Smart Beta .Source: Morningstar, Wells Fargo Investment Institute Global Manager Research, May 2017.Decentralized Autonomous Funds (DAFs)Behind NaPoleon’s project is the concept of Decentralized Autonomous Funds - or DAFs for short. Conceived as smart contracts that are able to invest in financial markets through trading bots, DAFs were first introduced by the firm last December in its 20-page paper.Essentially a trading bot is an algorithm that buys or sells a given underlying asset class (e.g. Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), S&P 500, etc.), in order to generate absolute performance.A DAF will empower its owners to choose:(1) Those trading bot(s) to utilize among a select list provided by Napoleon Crypto; and,(2) The appropriate leverage level. It is understood that this initial “bot allocation” will be reviewed by its owners in the course of a regular voting process. (Note: Napoleon Crypto has developed a range of performing trading bots and will offer them for the first DAFs to be created).The interesting point about quantitative strategies is that they are highly compatible with smart contracts since everything can be completely automated. And, given that everything is stored on the Blockchain, proof of performance will also be easy to achieve. Madoff-style or Ponzi-scheme funds should “not be possible to exist in this universe”, Ifrah contended.Over the long term, investors in the fiat world and in the crypto currency universe will be the same.“We believe that as Blockchain technology will become mainstream in the future…the associated crypto currencies will too in order to operate them. This is just the start of this revolution,” he said.So, the sooner the “gap is reduced” between the two universes as he ventured, the quicker the emergence of the crypto currencies. Bitcoin or Ethereum should become just as widely used as other currencies - and not exotic products that few of us barely understand. “A revolution has started, and we should all embrace it,” argued Ifrah.NaPoleonX’s Initial Coin OfferingNaPoleonX will launch its ICO by issuing NPX tokens, with the goal of raising 40,000 Ethereum (ETH) that will be donated to Napoleon Crypto. The ICO will be declared successful provided a minimum amount of 25,000 ETH is raised. (One hundred Napoleon Coin (NPX) token will be issued for 1 ETH: 100 NPX = 1 ETH). Should the minimum amount of 25,000 ETH not be achieved at the end of the ICO period, any subscriber may order the redemption of the smart contract and every subscriber will receive back their contribution (excluding gas spent for subscription and reimbursement).Proceeds raised will be used amongst other things acquire or rent the required licenses to launch DAFs, to develop a platform to publish indices based on proposed strategies for performance monitoring, promote the NPX tokens and the DAFs’ creation and performances, and finance research and development to create new performing trading bots.NaPoleonX’s crowdsale will commence in mid-November 2017 and last for one month, with a pre-sale starting early next month. For details on their roadmap see this link. For a series of step by step guides to buying and storing the most popular cryptocurrencies refer to getcrypto.info. It should also be pointed out that investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment. "

but as their values have soared, so has interest from John ...","Oct 10, 2017,03:32pm EDT","It is said that money makes the world go round or in the words of 1970s pop group Abba, ‘Ah, all the things I could do If I had a little money’.","Over the past 20 years, obtaining a little money has been relatively easy. Credit card providers were happy to offer people the world, often on the back of lazy credit checks and to people who were young enough to pay it back.This system created a culture of ‘buy now, pay later’, something that came to a grinding halt with the financial crash of 2008. Suddenly, credit was not so easy to come by and the world stopped turning.Of all disruptions often mentioned in the tech world, the financial crisis was the greatest of them all. Legacy systems were rocked to their core and  millennials began to look elsewhere for currencies. Wall Street financial institutions could no longer be trusted.Almost a decade later,  the way we view  money has been transformed. Cash is dying out, digital money and remittances have been completely disrupted and even credit card providers are losing business.Alternative technologies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum were once laughed at, but as their values have soared, so has interest from John Millennial Doe. Why use a traditional credit card when there are other ‘modern’ alternatives?So, step forward, Celsius, an ethereum-member based lending platform that wants to disrupt the consumer credit industry by enabling quick and easy peer-to-peer loans. These loans will pay higher interest to lenders and charge lower interest to borrowers by splitting the bank profits between the members of the community.The Celsius founders want to change the world for millennials.The idea is simple. Millennials in the US are the generation encumbered with highest amount of student and consumer debt, a trap that can be impossible to escape. This has been exacerbated by historically low interest rate on savings because the Federal Reserve had to bail legacy financial institutions by lowering interest rates to zero.In the US, an astonishing $ 1 trillion, more than 50% of all the consumer credit issued worldwide,is currently controlled by six of the largest US banks. Centralized financial institutions like to offer credit to many of their richest clients - those who have well-established and pristine credit histories, but ignore 'riskier' millennials.This trend means that younger customers are often not approved for consumer credit and general purpose loans because they have limited credit scores, are in debt from student loans or are spending most of their income on rent in major cities.Celsius’ team of 25 blockchain developers and marketing experts are  building the protocols governing the future of consumer credit by migrating credit scores and legacy data to the blockchain and incentivizing millennials.They can build a new digital identity and credit score that promises to rely heavily on their social and digital footprint as a more accurate representation of their income and ability to repay.This process leverages the fast growing global digital currency  movement and the creation of a community of lenders and borrowers with lower loss factors and higher on-time payments, enabling greater credit limits at lower interest rates.These benefits translate into higher interest paid to lenders and lower interest charged to borrowers taking away the banks profits and distributing them to the membership -- the 21st Century version of Robin Hood.Celsius allows its members to lend to other members and earn five to ten times more than what their bank is willing to pay for such US dollar deposits.Members can also borrow money from their peers, whether it be for a short-term loan, to help pay off existing credit cards or student loans at much lower rates than existing credit cards..A borrower shares with the community his hash representing his credit score based on information in his/her digital profile to obtain the loan; however, the more information one provides, the lower the interest rate and higher the credit they will obtain.In addition, Celsius incentivizes on-time payments by continually lowering interest rates for good borrowers, unlike the big banks, which offer higher interest and larger monthly payments when a payment is late.The more on-time payments a user has, the more members want to lend -- which lowers his/her interest rates and increases their credit limit is automatically through the Celsius Protocols.“The banking industry fails to offer any real solutions to the low saving rate pandemic they have contributed to,  not to mention the current consumer credit and high-interest student debt crisis they fuelled. Banks have no incentive to fix the problem, as the majority of their profits come from these loans,” said Alex Mashinsky, founder of the Celsius Foundation.Celsius appears to be putting its money where its mouth is with the founders contributing seven figures in seed capital. It will hold its Token Generation Event (TGE) for its Degree token in January, 2018, but the company has already initiated its pre-sale of $30 million from accredited investors.During the TGE, users will be able to join the membership and use the platform with a small purchase of Degree tokens. The money collected in the TGE will be used to form a general pool of money, with other funds coming from accredited investors to cover development costs and create a base of capital lending for the organization.After the TGE, Celsius will be able to tap the same low cost capital sources banks use to raise additional capital to leverage its base of capital to increase the loans issued to its members.The token will be used as a utility or membership token, rather than for security or trade. Upon joining, members applying for loans or willing to lend will use the token to activate the Celsius  smart contract with the credit limit approved by Celsius and a low interest rate scored by the Celsius Protocol within minutes of applying.Celsius is raising the temperature when it comes to offering millennials an opportunity to earn real interest and use new ways to deal with old money. It will be interesting to see whether its strategies, both for P2P lending and an TGE, prove to be successfu"

Equifax
 dropped the ball on keeping your identity safe, but now to add insult to injury, the IRS has announced it’s placing a $7.5 million dollar order “for third party data services from Equifax to verify taxpayer identity and to assist in ongoing identity verification and validations.”","Of all the companies the IRS should trust with taxpayer identity information, you’d think Equifax would be at the bottom of the list, not at the top. What’s going on here?Relics of pre-digital identityWho ‘Owns’ Your Identity, Anyway?If you’ve applied for a bank account, credit card, or car loan over the last few years, especially if you have done so online, you’ve run into the service that the IRS wants to purchase from Equifax.Remember the step in the application process where the site presents a multiple-choice quiz about past addresses or who financed your last car or some such? That’s an identity verification service that Equifax or one of the other two credit bureaus provides to lenders and others.In addition to the elephant in the room – that Equifax’s security practices mean it can’t be trusted with our identities whatsoever – this identity verification service has multiple other flaws.People forget old addresses and car payment amounts. Much of the information the credit bureaus maintain is inaccurate. And one I’ve run into myself – in many cases, the questions are about someone else entirely (in my case, half the questions are invariably about my ex-wife, whom I divorced a decade ago.)There’s got to be a better way of protecting consumers’ identities while still verifying information about us for bona fide purposes.The Identity Tipping PointThere’s a reason we’ve gotten ourselves into this predicament. Throughout the history of digital identities, some centralized party has to step up to the plate to maintain and manage them.Whether it’s Equifax or the DMV or a federated identity provider like 
 
Facebook
 or 
 
LinkedIn
, some company has to maintain a database with consumers’ names, passwords, identifiers like Social Security Numbers, as well as claims – that is, what the company knows about you as well as what privileges you have.We poor consumers, then, must rent our identities from such companies, often by paying a fee directly, by signing up for a paid service that includes identity management, or by trusting an advertising-funded third party with such information – even though we’re never sure we can trust any of them to keep our information safe.The obvious solution, of course, is to put individuals in charge of our own identities so that no one can take that control away – what the industry is now calling self-sovereign identity. In fact, I called for self-sovereign identity (without knowing its name) in my 2012 article, Turning Identity-as-a-Service Inside Out. However, efforts to figure out how to make self-sovereign identity actually work never went very far, because it was in the financial interest of the companies that maintained identity information to remain in control of such information – and profit off of it, as Equifax does.With the Equifax breach – as well as recent news that the earlier Yahoo! breach impacted every single Yahoo!-maintained identity – all the big companies who manage identities on our behalf are having second thoughts.Perhaps the risks inherent in maintaining so many identities exceed the rewards. It may be time, they are thinking, to move to a self-sovereign identity mechanism that lowers risks all around, so they can get out of the dangerous identity business once and for all.When I wrote my article in 2012, however, nobody knew how to build a distributed self-sovereign identity platform that didn’t require a centralized controller.As luck would have it, somebody does now.Evernym and the Sovrin Platform: Better than BlockchainActually getting self-sovereign identity to work is what we like to call a wicked hard problem – and in reality, it’s several wicked hard problems rolled into one. Tackling most if not all of these challenges is Salt Lake City-based Evernym. Evernym is the creator of Sovrin, the global public utility for the decentralized exchange of verifiable claims.Wicked hard, perhaps – but there’s no question that we need to solve this problem, and solve it fast. “Self-sovereign identity for people, organizations and connected devices is the one problem everyone wants to see solved,” explains Jamie Burke, CEO of Outlier Ventures, an investor in Evernym.In a courageous yet shrewd move, Evernym has open sourced Sovrin, making it freely available to anyone – realizing that for self-sovereign identity to get off the ground, the underlying platform can’t belong to any one party.At the heart of Sovrin is a distributed ledger, similar to a blockchain. With Sovrin, “no one can take away your identity,” says Timothy Ruff, Co-Founder and CEO at Evernym. “This was not possible before blockchain.” Without such technology, self-sovereign identity would have been a non-starter.If you’ve been following my articles for Forbes, you know I’m a skeptic – primarily around Bitcoin, but for blockchain as well. Why, then, am I writing an article on Evernym?First, Evernym started by focusing on a hard problem that needed to be solved – unlike most blockchain startups who begin by asking the question ‘what can we do with blockchain?’ Many such blockchain startups end up targeting problems that have simpler non-blockchain solutions than the one they propose.Not so with Sovrin. Furthermore, there is far more to Sovrin than the distributed ledger component – but without that piece, the whole idea wouldn’t work.Most importantly, however, many blockchain implementations have technical issues that may be insurmountable. The Bitcoin blockchain is the most familiar example of a blockchain plagued by such issues, explaining part of my skepticism around the cybercurrency.Sovrin, in contrast, doesn’t actually qualify as blockchain, because Evernym took a different approach to distributed ledger technology – a decision which has proven to be an essential foundation for self-sovereign identity.Bitcoin, you see, is permissionless, meaning that anyone can mine Bitcoins. Such mining is Bitcoin’s only source of intrinsic value, but eventually becomes impractical as electricity costs explode, with the secondary effect of driving up transaction costs over time.Furthermore, Bitcoin’s permissionlessness presents another show-stopping shortcoming. “Permissionless blockchain systems like Bitcoin have rampant correlation between sessions,” Ruff explains.Session correlation essentially means that the technology leaves breadcrumbs as people go from one Bitcoin transaction to another. These breadcrumbs are a boon to law enforcement, as they give officials a way of penetrating Bitcoin’s flawed anonymity – but it limits the privacy of participants, which would be a deal-killer for self-sovereign identity.The Sovrin web site explains the difference. “Sovrin utilizes a ‘public permissioned’ distributed ledger — not a blockchain — that provides public access for identity owners while permitting only known, trusted, vetted entities to serve as nodes,” according to the site. “This provides the greater transparency — and higher comfort level — some applications and industries require, while still not relying on any intermediary or central authority.”Surviving the Network EffectPerhaps the most insurmountable roadblock to the success of any distributed ledger-based business model, blockchain or no, is the network effect: the more individuals participate, the more valuable the platform is. Until such time as enough participants join in for the platform to reach its tipping point, however, there is insufficient motivation for anyone to participate.For better or worse, Bitcoin has long passed its tipping point, but most blockchain startups will never achieve this do-or-die threshold, and thus will fail to reach viability. The big question for Evernym and Sovrin, therefore, is whether they will make it over this hump.Indications are positive so far. “We’re now working with Homeland Security, the entire credit union industry, the country of Finland, and many more,” Ruff says. ‘Working with’ doesn't always mean a paying customer, of course, but Evernym is still in its early days. For the Sovrin open source effort, on the other hand, building a community is top of mind.First order of business: make sure there are more contributors to Sovrin than Evernym itself. “The ultimate goal for Sovrin Foundation and the network is self-sustainability,” explains Phil Windley, the Sovrin Foundation’s inaugural chair. “Sovrin must be in a position where it is self-sustaining so that it can remain free from outside influences that might rob it of its independence.”Government agencies have shown broad support for the effort. The Department of Homeland Security has put some money into the project via a Small Business Innovation Program (SBIR) award. “A better, more secure method is needed to safeguard the identity and privacy of web-users,” says Acting DHS Under Secretary for Science and Technology William N. Bryan.The State of Illinois is also on board with its Illinois Blockchain Initiative (IBI), which recently announced a partnership with Evernym for putting birth certificates on Sovrin. “To structurally address the many issues surrounding digital identity, we felt it was important to develop a framework that examines identity from its inception at child birth,” explains Jennifer O’Rourke, blockchain business liaison for the IBI. “Government has an important role to play in the development of any digital identity ecosystem.”Many hurdles remain. The technology is coming along, but there’s always the risk of an unknown deal-killer. Sovrin has taken an early lead in the self-sovereign identity space, but there’s always the chance a competing effort will overtake it. And then there’s that pesky tipping point to cross.Speaking as a blockchain skeptic, however, I’m excited to see a real distributed ledger-based business model targeting a real problem we all know we need to solve. I, for one, have high hopes for Evernym and Sovrin.This article was updated to remove some confidential information.Intellyx publishes the Agile Digital Transformation Roadmap poster, advises companies on their digital transformation initiatives, and helps vendors communicate their agility stories.

Digital transformation isn't a technology trend; it's a customer experience trend. In short, businesses are evolving because customer expectations are evolving. Either we are revolutionizing experiences through our own innovation or we are using data to iterate and innovate along with what the customers want. In some cases, we are doing both. However, new technologies like blockchain and AI are certainly setting the course for digital transformation at the speed of customer experience.Created as the technology architecture for Bitcoin in 2008, blockchain solves some of the immediate issues of digital economies. The security, data preservation, and networking capabilities of blockchain can circumvent traditional cybersecurity barriers and enable the information-sharing requirements of contemporary business. Due to the regulatory, processing, and connection efficiencies available with blockchain, Santander Bank estimates $20 billion a year in savings from using the technology. But while blockchain can streamline the processing of fees, payments and costly intermediaries, as well as the network exclusions inherent in financial systems, the applications for the technology are capable of larger cultural and political shifts. All forms of commerce and anything of value is set to be changed by blockchain, allowing consumers the protection they require in a new economy.The role of the individual and consumer is already shifting  in the digital marketplace. With the support of machine learning, connected devices and analytics, consumers are more connected, with fewer barriers, than ever before. The risks for these types of interactions are impossible to overcome without the beneficial structure of blockchain to address and mitigate the threats. Allowing this level of intimacy without the traditional risks is one reason blockchain is the key to widespread digital transformation.
Addressing The Threats To Digital Transformation As I mentioned in Companies Killing It in the Digital Transformation, even though market leaders like StubHub, JetBlue, and Domino’s are making the most of digital opportunities, only 18% of businesses consider their own strategies “very effective.” While some of this hesitation is a barrier of perception, without the infrastructure of blockchain technology to enable efficient networking, it may be impossible for some enterprises to fully capitalize on digital opportunities.For example, the Internet of Things (IoT) already represents 6.4 billion devices in use worldwide, with 25.5 million new things connected every day. But the security risks to privacy, and easy access for hackers, are growing along with the adoption of this technology. As stated in Blockchain 101: How This Next Big Service Will Change The Future, blockchain picks up where cloud technology leaves off by creating highly secure venues for information sharing— far better than the cloud alone. In order for the full potential of the IoT to be realized, blockchain needs to be the underlying architecture.The same holds true for all cloud and machine learning applications. HIPAA laws, regulatory issues, licensing, data validation and security risks are barriers to digital adoption. Only with blockchain as a base can health care, finance, commerce and digital economies realize the potential of digital transformation. Consumers and businesses alike balk at adoption with the current downside of this level of access.Blockchain As Integration: Beyond The Consumer The appeal of Blockchain technology for financial-services industry applications comes from the security, efficiencies and data validity inherent in the technology. Blockchain can leverage efficiencies beyond contracts and financial calculations and will enable more efficient relationships in automation and industrial applications as well.As Shelly Kramer describes in How Blockchain and Bitcoin Tech Will Fuel the Industrial IoT, Machine to Machine Communication (M2M) that uses blockchain technology can operate autonomously with the full support of historical data. Using the example of smart devices connected to oil lines, Kramer notes that “with the data stored from past years, blockchain technology could automatically adjust or reroute oil flowing through the line based on weather patterns or the current need for the oil.” Understanding the ability of blockchain architecture to support and integrate cloud, M2M and IoT applications reveals seemingly endless industrial, commercial and consumer-driven possibilities. While blockchain is essential to support these digital tools, its role as integrator brings additional benefits for innovation.Setting The Scale Of Blockchain Setting the scale and potential impact of blockchain technology requires a look at some of the fundamental vehicles that enabled the start of today’s second wave of digital transformation.Harvard Business Review draws a very real parallel between email technology (through TCP/IP) and blockchain as the next market disruptor. Just as networking, communications, culture and business were fundamentally altered with TCP/IP, blockchain is set to move beyond technology and change our basic architecture of connecting.Many businesses, governments and thought leaders are just starting to recognize the broad impact of the technology, beyond blockchain’s necessity as a vehicle for enabling digital transformation. In “The Truth About Blockchain,” Marco Lansiti and Karim R. Lakhani state that blockchain “has the potential to become the system of record for all transactions. If that happens, the economy will once again undergo a radical shift, as new, blockchain-based sources of influence and control emerge.” Regardless of the scope of the shift, the need for the underlying architecture of blockchain shows the possible magnitude of this technology as the new standard for networking and data validation in the years to come."

By contrast over the same period in 2016 there were 203 transactions that in aggregate raised $624m.Marcus Treacher, Global Head of Strategic Accounts at Ripple, which touts a frictionless experience in sending money globally using the power of blockchain, speaking earlier this week at an SEB roundtable in London on digital disruption and technology, said: “By using blockchain technology it is possible to cut through huge swathes of complexity.”Referring to a question on blockchain technology and what role it could play in the area of trade finance and banking, Treacher added: “It creates a model whereby as business services are exchanged - the value around the world - the record of who owns what and who is lending, who is borrowing and who is financing, is baked into the supply chain and stands as an irrefutable record and untamperable. And, the impact it will have on the industry I believe will be seismic.” But it will also depend on trust.How blockchain inspires trust is through the notion of decentralization. As a distributed ledger, transactions are transparent since they can be verified by members of the network. In addition, records become immutable since it is difficult to change data without the peers on the network detecting tampering. Users can have confidence in the permanence of records.Decentralized implementations of blockchain also mean that there is no single organization or company dictating how things should work. Blockchain-driven cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum allow developers to build their own decentralized applications, without being dictated or constrained by the Ethereum Foundation and core team.This decentralization is designed to give blockchain a wider appeal, yet the technology is yet to gain wide consumer acceptance. Average consumers still perceive it to be new and risky.And, overcoming this perception means stakeholders should go beyond blockchain’s features like decentralization and improve on other aspects to become a more trustworthy platform.Blockchain start-ups are using varying approaches on how to maximize what blockchain offers to build trust in online services. For instance, exchange service Legolas, uses a hybrid approach. It combines a centralized platform while using blockchain for transparent record keeping, while decentralized data marketplace Datum, gives users the choice on how to monetize their personal data. Each approach has its advantages.Hacker hacking cryptocurrency in blockchain concept. (Image: Shutterstock).Must Read: An Intrepid Investor's Guide To Buying Bitcoin And Other Crypto AssetsCentralization RisksUsers entrust their data with companies every time they use apps and services. While most of the time, these quid pro quo (‘something for something’) arrangements with these centralized authorities work, there are also instances when trust can be broken.For example, companies often change their terms and conditions and users often just have to agree to with little to no recourse if they want to continue using these services.Centralization can also leave data exposed to breaches due to a single point of failure. Just recently, consumer credit reporting agency Equifax suffered a data breach that affected some 143 million users in the US. Attackers were able to get hold of names, social security numbers, dates of birth, and addresses of users, which can all be used to fuel activities like fraud and identity theft.The Equifax breach is a clear reminder of the risk users take when entrusting centralized authorities. Decentralization is one way such issues can be prevented. Combined with encryption, blockchain can make breaches more difficult for attackers since it eliminates the single point of failure.“Datum utilizes a special algorithm powered by smart contracts for shifting data across storage nodes and its users,” explained Roger Haenni, CEO and co-founder Datum.The Swiss serial entrepreneur based now in Hong Kong added: “With this distributed storage infrastructure, once you upload everything to Datum and do not share the private keys to anyone, there is no way for anyone to retrieve your data. Even if you envision each grain of sand being the most powerful supercomputer it would take three times the age of the universe to break that encryption.”The Swiss co-founders of Datum, Roger Haenni, Gebhard Scherrer and VC Tran (left to right) in their... [+] offices in CyberPort, Hong Kong. (Image: Datum).Another company, Civic, has been working on an identity platform that uses a decentralized authentication model. Specifically, it is building what is described as an ecosystem that is designed to facilitate on-demand, secure and low-cost access to identity verification (IDV) services on the blockchain.“We are considering future partnerships with market disruptors such as Civic,” said Theo Valich, Head of Growth at Datum, who has over twenty years’ experience in technology - from GPU to supercomputer design.He added: “Civic’s approach to securing digital identities is a complementary approach to enable end users to take back the ownership of the ‘digital you’.”Civic’s token sale earlier this year was one of the most widely-distributed sales at the time with over 50,000 prospective purchasers and approximately 8,000 successful purchasers worldwide.Decentralization LimitsThis said, fully decentralized approaches also have limitations. Take the case of cryptocurrency exchanges. There has been a surge in interest in cryptocurrencies given their tremendous rise in value.Bitcoin is now more than four times its worth from the start of the year - albeit with recent price volatility - and outperforming other forms of investments like stocks. As such, there is a huge rise in interest trading cryptocurrencies.Yet, there is still a lack of platforms that allow bigger players like institutions to participate in cryptocurrencies. Coin exchanges have had a history of hacks such as the case of Mt. Gox and Bithumb. Mt. Gox and Bithumb.Add to that it is currently difficult and expensive to perform large conversions to and from fiat currencies. It is also currently impossible to have cross-chain transactions such as directly exchanging bitcoin for ether using fully decentralized means.As an alternative, Legolas uses its own centralized platform to offer a premium exchange for institutional cryptocurrency trading. The platform can perform cross-chain transactions and facilitate high value fiat currency exchanges. It continues to leverage decentralized blockchain protocols so that transactions can still be auditable and are thus transparent. This ‘hybrid’ approach essentially bridges the gaps between both approaches.Frédéric Montagnon, CEO of Legolas, who is based in New York, commenting in relation to this hybrid debate said: “In the debate pitting proponents of centralized versus decentralized governance, both sides tend to ignore the middle ground: a hybrid system in which the central authority operates fully transparently.”Frenchman Montagnon, who studied at the Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse (INPT), added: “With our hybrid model, Legolas is able to offer the same level of service as a centralized exchange, i.e. cover all types of trades, with the same level of trust inherent in a fully decentralized exchange.”Frédéric Montagnon, CEO and Co-founder of Legolas Exchange. (Image: Legolas).User Choice & ControlTrust is a two-way street. For the longest time, a centralized approach placed much power on companies particularly on what they can do with user data. And, most services today require broad rights over customer information and user generated content and this could be disadvantageous to users. Now that data has become a valuable resource, companies are making money from user data.Trustworthy systems should be able to factor in what users allow companies to do with their data. Datum is among a select number of start-ups that seek to do this. It uses blockchain to provide secure and anonymous storage of structured data. Users can then choose to selectively share their anonymized data to trusted entities for compensation. In this way users can decide how their data can be used and monetized.Blockchain has also given rise to decentralized autonomous organizations or DAOs for short. DAOs are entities that are run using rules encoded in blockchain smart contracts. Decisions in DAOs are voted upon by token holders, giving users the power to drive directions.But regardless of a centralized or decentralized approach, what is critical is for users have a voice in agreements. It is this power of choice that inspires trust.Building TrustBuilding trust between users and online services takes work as well as time. As a technology, blockchain offers inherent features such as decentralization that promotes trust and transparency. However, depending on the implementation, decentralization may not be enough to guarantee a fair and equitable relationship among stakeholders.Developers must continue to address the gaps between ideal and real-world scenarios as seen in the case of cryptocurrency exchanges. Users must also be given a clear voice in agreements and transactions.By knowing that users have the power of choice, they can place more trust in the system. In Deo speramus - as the Latin phrase goes - and all others we watch (alia vigilemus)."

Horizon State aims to use blockchain technology to provide unprecedented trust with their decision-making platform in the form of a secure digital ballot box that cannot be hacked, results cannot be altered and voter identities are protected. This is set to be a global gamechanger and will soon be adopted by political parties, multinational enterprises, global NGOs and communities in developing countries. I spoke to Horizon State Chief Product Officer Jamie Skella about how he set up the company, case studies and transforming the technology behind Bitcoin into something that offers democracy.Madhvi Mavadiya: How is HorizonState revolutionising the voting system?Jamie Skella: Horizon State is utilizing distributed ledger technology, otherwise known as blockchain, to deliver a digital ballot box that cannot be hacked. Sharing all of the technological benefits that makes Bitcoin possible - being verifiable transactions of value without a bank - we are using blockchain transactions as votes, while still maintaining anonymity of the voter. The end result is a system that is quicker to orchestrate than traditional voting methods, more convenient for voters which reduces apathy, and far cheaper than centralized, physical voting processes. What is costing Australian tax payers AUS$122 (USD$95) for a marriage equality postal vote would cost in the vicinity of AUS$2 million (USD$157,000) using our system. This equates to a cost per eligible voter of less than $1, instead of $7, or more. Mavadiya: What was the reason behind creating your product?Skella: I waited until I was quite old, relative to enrolment age of most voters, before I registered to do so. I could never stomach the idea that I get to vote once every few years, for entire packages of policies. I wanted to be able to vote per policy, and ideally, as those policy issues arose. While the internet could theoretically enable this, there was no viable option to secure the vote digitally. Blockchain changed that, so I got to work on a solution that leveraged it for an Australian democratic movement named MiVote, who had similar aspirations to be able to engage a national constituency with immediacy, and with frequency - asking the public to vote on matters that affect them, as those matters arose.Mavadiya: Did you recognise a gap in the market for this form of service?Skella: Our blockchain voting system has been in use since February, for MiVote. Since then, they’ve ran four nationally inclusive votes with their Australian membership. We are now engaged with global NGOs, multinational enterprises, national governments, and city councils around the world about the adopting of our technology. It has applications for everything from AGMs, to electing officials, and polling international memberships on sensitive matters such as use of funds.Mavadiya: Could you explain how the system works?Skella: In a similar way that a Bitcoin transaction is cast to a network of nodes that reach consensus on the details of that transaction, before setting it in stone on the network, we do this with votes. The post-unforgeable integrity of distributed ledger technology means that once a transaction is verified by the network, be it a Bitcoin transaction of value, or a Horizon State transaction representing a vote, this is now irreversible. In the case of Horizon State, the result is a perfectly secure ballot box, where the results can never be changed, and can be recounted with the same result every time, in perpetuity.Mavadiya: How secure is the system and would it prevent high-level hacks?Skella: For the foreseeable future, distributed databases such as the ones that underpin Bitcoin, Ethereum, and indeed Horizon State’s platform, are entirely secure. There is theoretical speculation that a quantum computer would be able to compromise blockchain networks such as Ethereum, yet even if this speculation is grounded in real possibility or probability, practical quantum computers are many, many years away. Of course, with quantum decryption, comes quantum encryption - so it may be a moot point, regardless.Mavadiya: What's next for e-voting?Skella: The future of e-voting isn’t merely improving centralized, physical methods of vote collection. The technology now exists to deliver the opportunity to vote conveniently, and securely, from the modern technology we are all so used to in every other facet of our lives. Driverless cars now exist, yet our democratic processes and tools are a comparable horse and cart. The way we govern our societies is a relic; the way collectively make decisions has not changed in centuries."

Today it is best known as the breakthrough technology behind virtual currency Bitcoin. But it has implications for any industry which relies on recording, storing and tracking transactions.ShutterstockThis week, APPII launched what it calls the “world’s first blockchain career verification platform” – leveraging blockchain’s function as a “trustless” system to give employers confidence that the candidate sitting in front of him is who he or she say they are.APPII MD Gary McKay first came across blockchain while working in financial services, and quickly concluded that it had huge implications which reached far beyond his sector.“I thought – hold on a second – this can be applied to any broker industry where trust is required to exchange value between two parties – so that could be real estate, or recruitment.“In the case of recruitment, it’s the exchange of a candidate between one party that sources the candidate, and an employer,” McKay tells me.APPII’s platform allows candidates to create Intelligent Profiles – recording details of professional achievement or educational certification on the distributed ledger, where it can be verified and then permanently recorded.It then allows organizations such as businesses or educational institutions to verify the “assertions” that candidates make during applications. By recording on a candidate’s profile that an assertion has been verified, there is no need for it to be checked again in the future.It also uses facial recognition technology to verify the identity of candidates, by asking them to take a picture using the mobile app and comparing it to a photograph on official identification documents such as passports.McKay says “In high-risk industries, it’s imperative for employers to undertake due diligence – in financial services if you’re providing your money to someone to invest, you don’t want that person to have got their job by falsifying their CV. It’s the same if you go to see a doctor or nurse.”With vetting and verifying identity and CV details taking an average of four to six weeks in the public sector and financial services, there are obviously huge gains to be made by streamlining and removing redundancy from the process. But the system also has clear uses in today’s increasingly globalized employment market, where candidates can search online for opportunities continents away from anyone who knows or has heard of them. There are also savings to be made in fields such as IT where contracting is commonplace, with some professionals beginning new contracts three or four times a year.The system is now available to users of the Technojobs service, which caters for candidates seeking employment in IT and technical roles.As well as employers, McKay is keen to stress that the platform offers advantages for candidates too – giving assurance that their application will be judged on their merit rather than the style or format of their CV. Of course it also levels the playing field for the third of the population which is honest, by exposing the exaggerations or half-truths of the other almost two thirds.“It makes candidates far more employable because they can use the blockchain to verify their career history, and have it trusted, and it benefits employers by diminishing time and cost to find talent,” McKay says.Anthony Sherick, director of Technojobs, told me “From an employer’s perspective, they can invest a lot of time in trying to hire an individual and then potentially lose out – it’s a massive amount of wasted time because they are generally checking credentials at the end of the recruitment process. By doing it up front there is a massive time and cost saving, and they are reassured about the integrity and quality of the information.”Plans to enhance the service next year include rewarding both employers and candidates for participating in the service. Tokens will be issued toorganizations which verify assertions, and to candidates who submit their CVs for verification. It is planned that these tokens will be exchangeable for courses and education.It’s certainly very exciting to see blockchain starting to be put to use in some innovative ways, and making it possible for us to do things we just wouldn’t be able to do before. The concept of a distributed and encrypted ledger has obvious implications in finance - where many are speculating it can replace many of the traditional functions of a bank. But beyond that, I believe it can effectively and innovatively be put to use for just about any function which involves recording, verifying and tracking data.Bitcoin may have been the first “gold rush” kicked off by the emergence of the blockchain concept, but it is certain to be far from the last."

of ...","Nov 17, 2017,07:30am EST",Shutterstock,"Blockchain may have gained fame due to its role as the underpinning technology of Bitcoin, but its potential uses extend far beyond the world of cryptocurrency. Its ability to improve privacy, increase security and help build decentralized networks has made it the talk of the town in recent times, although many businesses remain unaware of the great promise this technology holds.Blockchain is hurtling into the mainstream, however, and it’s easy to envisage a not-so-distant future where it forms an integral part of almost all businesses. So how can businesses today keep ahead of the curve and use blockchain to their advantage?Accepting Cryptocurrency As PaymentIt’s no longer possible to ignore the meteoric rise of cryptocurrency. With Bitcoin currently sitting pretty at close to $6,000 in value (up from a sixth of that a year ago), it’s clear to see that this is likely to have a big impact on the way money is exchanged in the future.Blockchain technology underpins cryptocurrency and is responsible for its truly decentralized nature by storing details of all transactions on digital ledgers that can’t be altered by any third party.There are a ton of reasons for businesses to get on board the crypto train, not least of which because it signals awareness of digital trends and a forward-thinking outlook. It also allows for far lower transaction fees -- less than 1% compared to 3% with credit and debit card payments.In addition, it makes cross-border payments smoother, easier and cheaper by removing the need for currency exchange.To start using cryptocurrency, businesses need a digital wallet (which can be set up fairly easily) and some way to process payments. Fortunately, there is plenty of software available to help businesses through this, and a lot of it can even be used with brick-and-mortar businesses.Using Distributed Apps To Enhance OperationsDistributed apps are another area where businesses can use blockchain to get ahead.In basic terms, these are software applications that are spread over lots of different computers in a network. There’s no centralized server, and blockchain’s decentralized nature makes it easier to achieve this.These apps have a number of truly exciting functions, and identity management is one example. A person’s identity is a complex and multi-layered thing, made up of lots of sensitive information like their financial details, address and health records.These are things that most people don’t want to become common knowledge, but as events like the recent Equifax breach have proved, it’s becoming tough for third parties to guarantee privacy.Blockchain’s immutable ledgers can store data in a way that avoids tampering, allows for easy verification of records and easily prevents unauthorized parties from gaining access. The data is distributed across a network of various bodies like banks and hospitals, with no central body holding all the cards.Distributed computing is another example. This is where the components of a software system are shared between several companies, allowing them to save on data costs and increase efficiency. Services like Golem are already offering this, and blockchain could revolutionize how it works.Another way in which decentralized apps can benefit businesses is through file storage. This is an area where security is especially important, with 27.8% of users having uploaded sensitive information to file-sharing services.Blockchain can help to create distributed storage services using blocks of encrypted data spread across the network. This removes the need for a central server, making it extremely hard to corrupt or steal the stored information.In digital advertising, there are many issues with the way things are currently done. Right now, centralized middlemen post ads in exchange for payments from sellers and aim to collect as many clicks as possible from potential buyers. It’s a pretty clunky system; the ads are often both poorly targeted and highly expensive, meaning businesses pay huge sums for relatively ineffective ads while customers are bombarded with frustratingly irrelevant promotions.At BitClave, we are using blockchain technology to allow sellers to target their customers more directly without relying on a centralized body. This saves costs and removes many of the worries people have about their personal data being collected by third parties for marketing.Custom Blockchain AppsServices like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Qtum and Hyperledger can all help businesses to move some of their existing processes onto blockchain.In essence, they can create their own blockchain to allow smoother networks of buyers and sellers, create their own decentralized markets and make processes within the business more efficient.This can also ensure confidentiality between different links in the business chain and help keep sensitive data more secure."

(ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/Getty Images)","How should investors think about cryptocurrency as part of a broader diversified portfolio? I spent most of the past four years working for the University of Chicago endowment where we had to consider into which ""bucket"" investments would fall. Is cryptocurrency best thought of as venture capital? Absolute return? A potential inflation hedge like gold or real estate? An average investor may not be bound by the buckets above, but should still carefully consider the role cryptocurrency plays in the context of a complete portfolio.Some investors view cryptocurrencies primarily as currencies or commodities that may appreciate in value as they compete with fiat currencies or gold. For these investors, a passive investment or an index hugging manager may provide an attractive investment that is best thought of as similar to a commodity allocation. A more active manager may add alpha to this approach by identifying those cryptocurrencies most likely to win the competition to become censorship resistant money or “digital gold."" In addition to hoping for both a positive return and a low correlation to the existing portfolio, these investors may also anticipate that the investment will act as an inflation hedge, or at least a currency depreciation hedge similar to gold.Other cryptocurrencies are best thought of as equity in an open-source software project. For example, to compete with Amazon Web Services, developers have created open-source decentralized file storage systems that incorporate a cryptocurrency to pay for storage space. The value of these cryptocurrencies are ultimately connected to the usage value of the network, and a successful network may produce an attractive return to the holders of the cryptoasset. Accessing this opportunity set can be done via investment managers that invest in exchange-listed cryptoassets, or in venture capital style funds that try to identify successful projects earlier in their life cycle with lower entry prices.Lastly, as in all other asset classes, opportunities exist for market makers, arbitrageurs, and quantitative traders. While cryptocurrencies bring many unique challenges and risks, short-term trading strategies from traditional asset classes can generally be applied to cryptocurrency.All of these investment approaches share one major similarity – unusually high barriers to entry that may explain the exceptional returns of the past seven years to both active and passive investment. Storing cryptocurrency is currently difficult from both a technological and regulatory perspective. Exchanges present unusual levels of counterparty risk. The newness of most investment managers in the space makes due diligence difficult. And the relatively small total market capitalization and lack of scale available to some of these strategies makes them unattractive to many existing traditional investment managers and large institutional investors.For many investors, underwriting these unusual risks is difficult. The risks are real - high volatility, counterparty risk, complexity, operational and security challenges - but they are idiosyncratic and can be diversified away by sizing cryptocurrency investments to a small percentage of the total portfolio, or by diversifying across cryptocurrency investment managers. Cryptocurrency markets are capturing tremendous value creation from technological innovation and disintermediation of existing financial services. The nascency of these markets provides active managers with an unusual level of inefficiency to exploit."

As Bitcoin soars past $7,000 the blockchain token based world is starting to consider what the future of cryptocurrency looks like. TokenUnion is part of that future, one in which we once again learn how to save our money, in whatever form it's in, instead of operating in a hyperactive, reactive mindset when it comes to cryptocurrency.To explain how TokenUnion works you have to first understand how a traditional bank works, then forget that, spin around five times with your nose on the bat and run to first base. TokenUnion, despite the name, is not a bank at all. Instead it is a non-custodial holding system for your cryptocurrency tokens, stored on the blockchain in a smart contract you deploy yourself. So if you have some Ethereum tokens, you'd move them to TokenBnk like you'd move your cash to a savings account. But.. but.. TokenUnion is not a bank so what's the catch?Also see: Detective By Charlie Is The AI Tool That Enhances And Speeds Up Your Research TimeThere's no catch. Once I gave up reading the white paper and just asked the question, the gist of TokenUnion is that you get rewarded for just keeping your cryptocurrency tokens on blockchain. Say you have some Ethereum laying around, just increasing in value — why not earn some interest on it as well? That's what TokenUnion does. When someone withdraws from TokenUnion (as can be predicted by the volatile nature of any financial market), they pay a fee of one TokenUnion coin (based in Ethereum). That coin gets distributed among all users based on the percentage of the Total Network Value (TNV) their savings contract constitutes. So in a year you might gain a percent point of the tokens you have, in whatever coin they are in. Or less, or more. Depending on all the variability of withdrawals versus your TNV. The point is, anything gained is better than nothing gained on currency that itself is constantly growing in value.If you leave your BTC or ETH sitting in Coinbase (or in my case, a single lost Bitcoin in a wallet on a phone several years gone) it does nothing. It has a value, but that value is market derived and the coin itself sits at whatever number of coins you have. TokenUnion rewards the patient cryptocurrency holder, by adding on what amounts to the equivalent of interest on the actual coin, not the value of the coin. We rarely hold traditional currency without expecting some sort of rate of return, or return on investment — so why not expect some sort of yield from cryptocurrencies? This means that yes, Cryptoeconomics is now a thing.""Blockchain applications can never be deleted or taken down like centralized websites or apps; they are what’s called immutable,"" says TokenUnion founder and CEO Shayne Coplan. ""Due to this immutability, it is necessary to take certain precautions when designing a decentralized system’s architecture in order to guarantee the dApp will always functions as intended; this is where cryptoeconomics comes in.""Cryptoeconomics is all about creating dApps with inherent financial incentives that, in theory, ensure the dApp will forever function as intended. One achieves this by programmatically rewarding users for correct behavior, and sometimes even penalizing unintended behavior. In the case of TokenUnion, the correct behavior is to hold long, and that’s where the rewards come in.""Millennials are having a hard time saving money, but that doesn't mean they have to treat the tokens they are collecting the same way as traditional currency. There is more opportunity to save, since the perception of a digital asset is completely different from a physical one. Eventually everything, all transactions, will be decentralized. Eventually we'll all be dealing in smart contracts and blockchain-based capitalism. If you are holding Bitcoin or Ethereum, you are already ahead of the curve. Saving it for a rainy day — when the rest of the world is scrambling to catch up — while it increases in quantity and value is the smart move.Sure, you can be an aggressive trader and hope that ROI pays off, but there is probably some antiquated anecdote about patience and saving. ""I was in the Ether presale back in 2014. Everyone I know that was involved at that time has regrets of ever trading the markets,"" Coplan points out. ""In hindsight, the buy and hold strategy massively outperformed even the most successful of traders. With the new wave of tokens arriving in the market over the next few years, hopefully TokenUnion can help token holders avoid making that same mistake."""

article is more than 2 years old. Share to Facebook Â· Share to Twitter ...","Editors' Pick|Nov 21, 2017,11:05am EST",Shutterstock,"There's a lot to learn if you're a blockchain entrepreneur or have a startup and are thinking about using an Initial Coin Offering to raise capital for your project.  When sorting through the technical complexities and regulatory pitfalls, don't forget about the potential tax consequences of raising money with an ICO.Here's a few things you should keep in mind:1. The money raised in an ICO is taxable income. Unlike conventional methods of raising capital, ICOs do not qualify for tax-free treatment under the Internal Revenue Code. This means that the proceeds of your ICO will be considered taxable income by the IRS. To figure the amount of the taxable income, use the fair market value of the cryptocurrency received from the ICO on the date it ended (or when you otherwise were able to take control of the proceeds). It does not matter if you hold this cryptocurrency and do not convert it to fiat. In the eyes of the IRS, the receipt of valuable property is taxable income, regardless of whether it is ever sold.2. You might be personally liable for the taxes. Unless your startup has formed a corporation to conduct the ICO, you will be personally responsible for paying the taxes on the proceeds. If you have co-founders and no formal business entity, then your startup is likely a ""partnership"" for income tax purposes and will need to file a partnership tax return to report the income from the ICO.As a partnership, each co-founder is responsible for the taxes on an equal share of the net-income, regardless of whether he or she actually received any money from the partnership. This can result in each co-founder having larger tax bill than they can afford to pay. Known as ""phantom income,"" this is a particularly harsh (yet common) result of partnership taxation. Failure to file the partnership tax return and pay taxes on the ICO income can result in civil penalties and criminal prosecution.3. You should establish a business entity prior to conducting an ICO.  There are many different types of business entities, but a corporation is probably the best choice if the primary concern is avoiding personal liability for the taxes on the ICO income. As a corporation, the income from the ICO is taxed at the corporate level, instead of passing through to the individual co-founders. Just keep in mind that the corporate tax rate is higher than most personal rates. Regardless of what entity you choose, it must be established prior to the ICO to have any effect.4. Conducting your ICO early in the year can help reduce taxes. An easy way to reduce the amount of taxes due on the income from your ICO is to spend the proceeds on tax deductible expenses. These would include operating expenses like salaries, office rent, and equipment purchases. In order to reduce your taxes as much as possible, you should consider conducting your ICO early in the year. This will give you more time to spend the ICO proceeds on tax deductible expenses before the year ends.5. Offshore entities offer some potential for tax savings, but have many potential pitfalls. Many blockchain startups use an offshore entity to conduct the ICO in order to avoid U.S. income taxes. This is easier said than done. The rules applicable to offshore entities are exceedingly complex and definitely require professional tax advice to navigate. Here are a few takeaways:At the end of the day, establishing a foreign corporation is relatively easy, but laying the proper groundwork and making sure your foreign corporation accomplishes its purpose takes very careful planning and legal advice.6. Don't forget about state or local taxes. While tax conversations tend to focus on just federal income taxes, don't forget about taxes at the state or local level. Most states piggy-back off of the IRS, so if your ICO income is taxable at the federal level, it is probably taxable at the state level as well. Some states have tax rates of over 10%, like California and New York, that will need to be factored into your startup's budget.For questions about cryptocurrency taxation, email me at tyson@bitcointaxsolutions.com.

Because of their decentralized nature, they do not fit within existing regulatory frameworks, are difficult to monitor and control, and introduce new trade-offs in terms of speed, flexibility and energy consumption into what could otherwise be a seamless process of transaction reconciliation across organizations. Private blockchains, they say, can deliver all the benefits of this new, exciting wave of technological change without disrupting how businesses run their operations.The catch is that permissioned blockchains take advantage of only one of the two, key costs affected by blockchain technology: the cost of verification. In and of itself, being able to cheaply verify the attributes of a specific transaction (e.g. who is involved, their credentials, etc.) without incurring additional costs or performing an extensive audit can be extremely valuable to society. For markets to thrive, buyers and sellers need to be able to trust the information they use to decide when and with whom to transact. Whenever the asymmetry of information between buyers and sellers is too large, markets unravel, and beneficial trades do not take place. Blockchain technology, by lowering the cost of verification, can make markets more secure and efficient, and expand the types of transactions we are willing to engage in.(Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)Many of the systems used today across the globe to settle and reconcile transfers of value and digital assets could theoretically be made more efficient with a distributed ledger. Of course, for verification costs to actually drop, the data recorded on a blockchain needs to be accurate to begin with. While this is easy to achieve when all the information needed is generated and updated digitally (as in Bitcoin), when a distributed ledger is used to track offline events, the question of how to port such analog information back into the digital space is an unresolved one. This “last mile” problem constitutes a sizable entrepreneurial opportunity for startups and incumbents that realize that blockchain does not necessarily remove the need for intermediaries, but instead changes the nature of intermediation. Third-parties can still add substantial value to marketplaces (e.g. through curation), but a revenue model simply based on processing transactions is unlikely to be sustainable in the long run.Where permissioned blockchains fall short is in taking advantage of the other, key cost impacted by the technology: the cost of networking. When combined with a native token, a permissionless blockchain can be used to bootstrap a digital platform without the need for a central intermediary. Driven purely by the incentives embedded within its protocol - which need to be carefully designed! - permissionless platforms enjoy the benefits of a shared network infrastructure, without the main cost it typically involves: market power.As a result of network effects and economies of scale, the digital platforms that shape our lives today have accumulated a high degree of market power. In fact, they often act as the default, “shared infrastructure” within their industry vertical. While this may not always be visible through higher prices for consumers (as many of these products are given away for free), it is typically reflected in adjacent markets (e.g. advertising), and in the amount of data these businesses have accumulated relative to everyone else competing with them. Beyond the privacy risk of exposing large segments of our digital lives to a small number of players, data concentration has implications for competition - not just today, but also in the future. For instance, if we want a competitive market for artificial intelligence applications, we will need to unlock these data monopolies so that more than a handful of players can generate high quality predictions.So How Can Blockchain Increase Competition And Lower Barriers To Entry?To ensure a higher degree of competition, permissionless blockchains can be used to create digital marketplaces without assigning control - both over prices and access to data - to a single operator. When entrepreneurs and developers in this space talk about “censorship resistance”, it is important to realize that censorship is simply an expression of market power. By allowing individuals and firms to transact without assigning market power to a central intermediary, the digital platforms built on top of permissionless ledgers can turn concentrated markets into substantially more competitive ones. This can lower barriers to entry for startups and lead to new products and services.By lowering the cost of networking, permissionless ledgers also allow for a fine-grained definition of digital property rights, including rights to the underlying data. While on current digital platforms the operator by default has access to all information exchanged, in this new regime, users and businesses will have substantially better control over digital privacy. New data licensing and monetization models will also be possible.Of course, we could have achieved this before by developing an industry standard to ensure interoperability and low barriers to entry. The key difference is that with a native token, digital platforms can reward contributions of talent, capital and resources (e.g. computing, storage etc.) in a fundamentally novel way. Instead of having to price everyone’s contributions during the negotiations for the standard, this can all happen in an automatic fashion as the network organically develops.At the same time, like industry standards, permissionless blockchains will have to develop substantially more reliable and effective forms of governance. For a platform to thrive, it needs to be able to evolve and adapt as new needs emerge. It also needs to address the risk for underinvestment in aspects of the technology that generate a positive externality between participants.Possibly even more important, permissionless networks will have to identify problems individuals and organizations need solved. Only by addressing a real customer need, will these platforms be able to move from the investment and speculation phase, to actual growth. Permissioned blockchains, possibly because they are solving more narrow problems within a framework that businesses understand, have shown that there is demand for the ability to verify and reconcile transaction attributes at a lower cost. Now it’s on the permissionless camp to prove that if you also take advantage of the reduction in the cost of networking, you can actually design a better incentive, governance and innovation system that can outpace alternatives and create a substantially more competitive market."

Another token-related AngelList offering is Republic Crypto, which enables ICOs that are both compliant as well as open to all investors -- not just to wealthy investors who meet certain income and net worth requirements.Naval Ravikant, chariman of AngelList, venture partner of MetaStable CapitalRavikant also serves on the board of the Zcash Foundation and backed a crypto index fund, Bitwise's HOLD 10, Blockstack (who were also on the podcast) and, through an AngelList syndicate, Numerai, a hedge fund that uses a cryptocurrency called the Numeraire, among other blockchain-based businesses. Ravikant, who doesn't manage his private crypto holdings himself, invests with crypto hedge funds such as Polychain Capital and MetaStable Capital, the latter of whose investments in the space include storage token Protocol Labs/Filecoin and Basecoin, which is a project attempting to create a stablecoin.When asked about his crypto investing philosophy, he says, ""I definitely have a distinct point of view, which is that for the most part, I’m looking at money or money like tokens."" For instance, he is interested in tokens that can serve as a means of exchange, unit of account, store of value, or ones that can power financial contracts.His history on both sides of the funding model for startups -- he founded Epinions and with other cofounders later sued some of their own venture capitalists -- gives him a unique perspective on how ICOs are upending the traditional VC funding model. Noting how seed-stage investments are getting bigger and entrepreneurs are then turning to ICOs, he says, ""I think the VC model really is in danger of getting squeezed down to a very small space.""Acknowledging that this has allowed the pendulum to swing in favor of entrepreneurs, he says, that will likely lead to failed projects and bad ideas getting funded, which will lead to a crash and a cry for the government to step in. ""If the government doesn't step in and do something, I think that's a little better because then the market will correct and learn,"" he says, adding that heavy-handed regulation could cause the innovation to flee overseas.Mentioning that we're in the very early days of blockchain technology development, Ravikant observes that Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two crypto leaders, have not figured out scaling or governance yet. About the Bitcoin scaling debate, which has revealed the challenges in governing a decentralized project, he says, ""I think it's better for Bitcoin to be extremely conservative.""He is still hopeful that the decentralizing potential in blockchains will be fulfilled even though many believed the internet would be a decentralizing force and, as Ravikant has said, instead it's introduced us to ""new overlords"" -- Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Twitter, etc.He lays out a possible path for blockchain technology to become used more by governments, makes his short-term predictions for trends and events in crypto and even has a few ideas on how to make ICOs more favorable to investors.Definitely tune in to this jam-packed episode of Unchained (on Google Play, iTunes, iHeartRadio, Stitcher or TuneIn Radio), and hear why Ravikant thinks tokens present unique challenges for regulators, why he says that now, with blockchains, ""money and speech are the same thing,"" and why he believes we'll only end up with one to five winners among money-like protocol tokens.Tuesday, November 28, 2017, 5:10pm EST: This article has been updated to clarify that some of Ravikant's crypto investments are not personal ones but were made through MetaStable.   "

[+] December 18, 2017. Bitcoin has soared in recent weeks, breaking numerous records, and has risen more than 20-fold since the start of 2017. / AFP PHOTO / Anthony WALLACE (Photo credit should read ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/Getty Images)Because of its REG A+ status financial details on Longfin are scarce at best, and it has yet to be disclosed whether Longfin was able to raise the $50 million in equity capital (10 million shares at $5 per share) that were comprehended in the company's offering circular.  That circular discloses an existing share base of 72.9 million shares of common stock, so assuming the company fully completed the 10 million share IPO before its listing--Longfin would have only had to raise $6 million to meet the listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market, the exchange's lesser board--that would have meant that at some point Monday the stock market was valuing LFIN at $10.8 billion.I have seen all sorts of different figures quoted in the financial media for the size of LFIN's crypto-inspired bounce, but again, that's the problem with manias.  People rarely check the numbers, and with a Reg A+ offering, there aren't that many numbers to begin with.So, LFIN paid Mr. Meenavalli 2.5 million common shares for Ziddu.com, a price that as of yesterday's close would have valued that asset at $170 million.  The difference between the post-IPO value for LFIN of $410 million (assuming full completion) and LFIN stock's valuation high-water mark of $10.8 billion cannot be explained by the addition of that particular asset.  So, the market can create $10 BILLION DOLLARS in valuation for a company that had not even 1/20th of that valuation the day before? Yep, it happened.  That's bitcoin-mania at it finest. "

Technologies like Bitcoin and Ethereum and their predecessors have used the performance capabilities of the GPU for a long time, but with new cryptocurrencies like Render Token, you start to combine so many different technologies and capabilities that it gets extremely interesting. Render Token may offer a future where the cost of rendering assets in VR or AR − or any 3D medium −  is significantly lower than it is today and should challenge how we think of the cloud.","There were other distributed computing projects like Folding @ Home and SETI that used people’s CPUs and GPUs for good. But those came before cryptocurrencies and those who participated only received points for their contribution. Let’s just say I’ve wasted my fair share of GPU and CPU cycles to help the Stanford team fold proteins. Why did I take you on such a tangent? Because Render Token is going to be the first cryptocurrency that provides a real value to the tokens generated.The value of Render Token comes from the fact that every token is generated by performing a certain graphical work load sent to the user by the Render Token network, operated by OTOY. Essentially people get paid in tokens to render others’ 3D models, holograms, VR scenes, etc. You essentially have unlimited compute power at your disposal with the combination of tens of millions of gaming graphics cards in the world.  OTOY’s Octane GPU renderer works on both 
 
AMD
 and 
 
NVIDIA
. OTOY’s move is brilliant because it democratizes their renderer as the standard for this type of distributed GPU rendering system at the same time as making themselves the center of this new network. This distributed GPU network also allows OTOY to reduce the amount of cloud infrastructure they deploy for their cloud rendering platform because it essentially serves as their new cloud network.The reason why Render Token just might become the currency of the Metaverse is because a lot of virtual worlds are being created right now in VR and AR. The Metaverse is a virtual world or series of virtual worlds that many expect to exist once enough users start to embrace VR and use it regularly. Someone is going to need to render all those virtual worlds. More importantly, people are going to need to create those models and, to create them, you’re going to need compute power like Render Token offers. With this Render Token distributed rendering network, we could see things being made faster for the Metaverse in a much more cost-effective manner. This is because Render Tokens would cost less than utilizing expensive cloud rendering infrastructure.A few dozen of the many cryptocurrencies are based on the Ethereum (ERC-20 token standard) cryptocurrency and serve different purposes. One of the biggest hurdles for cryptocurrencies is that many people who seek to understand them fail to see an intrinsic value in the currency.  This fundamentally comes from the perception that you aren’t doing anything valuable when you mine the cryptocurrency and you’re allegedly just wasting electricity and the cost of hardware.I see a future where we have a digital currency like Render Token or Bitcoin (or a mix of both) where we pay for digital goods in virtual reality or augmented reality. Bitcoin is already used for such transactions. But it is expensive to obtain and doesn’t technically have any real value to it. Bitcoin, like nearly every currency on earth today, is based on the trust and faith people have in the currency itself. Bitcoin is still highly speculative, but it has proven that a cryptocurrency can survive multiple booms and busts and still retain the trust of its users.  I think Render Token might be a little early for its time because VR and AR aren’t quite at the level of maturity where their value could be higher. Perhaps Render Token can grow with the VR and AR industry and serve as a catalyst for its growth by enabling content creators to accelerate development and time to market. But I’m trying to be measured with my expectation. OTOY’s Render Token ICO is called RNDR and will be going live on October 5.Disclosure: My firm, Moor Insights & Strategy, like all research and analyst firms, provides or has provided research, analysis, advising, and/or consulting to many high-tech companies in the industry, cited or related to this article.

Boom.""It sounds nice because it means you don't have to work hard or spend a lot of time figuring out how to create and build wealth. Just pick the one thing that will take off for you.This does happen. That’s why it’s so tempting to think we can do this too. We know people who have done it; we’ve seen it happen.And we think, “why not me?” Surely there’s nothing stopping you from duplicating that same kind of investing success. You just need to know the right piece of information.But this isn't realistic. It's random. And you shouldn't be fooled by randomness when it come to investing wisely.Randomness and Chance Events Can Tempt You Off Your Strategic, Planned PathThis comes up a lot recently with Bitcoin. I see people getting really excited over this new investment opportunity.A recent Bloomberg article shared how ""Nearly a Third of Millennials Say They'd Rather Own Bitcoin Than Stocks."" Yikes!Personally, knowing that so many people in their 20s and 30s would rather dump cash into Bitcoin scares me. But not because I have an opinion on whether or not Bitcoin will do well, or because I don't believe that putting money in the right stock could make you rich.It's frightening because the chances of finding that ""golden investment"" and buying in at the right time are so, so incredibly slim, that you're essentially gambling.You might as well go to Vegas. You might face better odds than randomly picking a single investment. (And you'd at least have some fun with your money this way.)Don’t Randomly Chase Down Hot Tips and Insider SecretsMany people waste a lot of time and energy seeking out the one investment to solve everything. It’s really tempting to think if you can just unlock a secret that only rich people know about, you can be wealthy too.And again: Yes, sometimes you can “strike it rich” if you just happen to luck out and pick the right stock or the right investment.That’s not a good reason to deviate from a strategic, long-term, rational investment plan, though. It’s usually just a distraction from your goals.For one, the odds of managing this probably sound better than they really are.People remember their wins and love to talk about that one time an investment gamble paid off. At the same time, they minimize the memories of all the other times they lost money, or made a mistake, or wound up worse off than they would have been had they just stayed the course… and they certainly don’t share these negative experiences even if they do remember them.And two, chasing financial success that way is kind of like saying you’re going to run a marathon. Then you spend the months leading up to the race searching for the absolute best running shoes available.Don’t be surprised when you don’t actually make it to the finish line in that race.If you don’t put in the work and do the training, taking those consistent actions over time that align with your overall strategy of managing to run 26.2 miles, the best shoes in the world can't do you a bit of good.Don’t Be Fooled By Randomness. Stick To The ProcessJust like training for a marathon, financial planning is a process. It requires a strategy made up of small, consistent actions taken over time.And randomness and chance don’t really play much of a role in either process.Nope, it’s not sexy or flashy. Nor is one magical thing going to allow you to breeze your way to your goals without work or effort.What will allow you to achieve your financial goals and create the life you want?Creating good financial habits. Making smart, strategic, deliberate decisions with your money. Taking the right actions consistently over a period of time.When you follow a structured process, you see results.Investing isn't about choosing that one great stock. It's about designing a prudent investment strategy and turning up your savings rate to achieve growth over time.This is how most people who aren't already independently wealthy can create and grow wealth and reach financial freedom. We all want to believe there's an easy way to riches, but most of us won't get lucky randomly gambling in financial markets.Don't be fooled by randomness.

It depends on the application. So, whatever they’re used for, it’ll fall under the appropriate regulator — and sometimes the inappropriate regulator,"" says Marco Santori, who leads the blockchain technology team at Cooley, on the latest episode of my podcast Unchained (on Google Play, iTunes, iHeartRadio, Stitcher or TuneIn Radio).Marco Santori and Joshua Ashley Klayman lead the blockchain technology teams at Cooley, and Morrison... [+] and Foerster, respectivelyOur conversation took place before SEC chairman Jay Clayton on Monday released a statement on cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings that reaffirmed the agency's earlier statements that whether or not a token sale constituted a sale of securities would be based on a facts-and-circumstances-based test. However, Santori and Klayman stated views in line with his statement.The SEC has already indicated that the so-called Howey test, which arises from a case, SEC v. Howey, would form the basis for whether a token would be considered a security. An offering passes the test if it meets four prongs: being an investment contract in a common enterprise with an expectation of profits dependent on a third-part promoter. However, Klayman added, ""You could have a token that might not on its own have the characteristics of a security, but if it’s being promoted as being a great investment as being a great investment that will increase X%, and they’re marketing that token as a security many believe that will have impact on the overall facts-and-circumstances test as to whether the token is a security."" This was in line with Clayton's statement.The two debated a proposal Santori made in the fall along with Protocol Labs, which held one of the biggest ICOs this year -- Filecoin -- called the SAFT Project, which proposes a way to issue a token in compliance with existing securities laws. The framework entails selling a security known as a simple agreement for future tokens (SAFT) to wealthy investors in accordance with regulation before the network launches, using that money to build the network, and then selling tokens that have utility and whose success is no longer dependent upon the issuers to the general public. ""The idea being, at that point, the thing works, it’s more of a product, it’s more a commodity if anything, and the people who are buying it aren’t taking on enterprise risk anymore. It’s product risk, which is what the public is supposed to take on according to U.S. laws,"" he said.However, Klayman disagrees with applying this as a cookie-cutter approach. ""Many founders were seizing upon this form and deciding this was the answer and this settled in stone,"" she said. ""So people would come to me and say, we’re going to do a token sale and we’re going to do a SAFT first, and if you would start questioning things or probing, they would say things like — and it was said to me — 'You need to get smart on the SAFT!'"" She and some other lawyers wrote a rebuttal called, ""Not So Fast -- Risks Related To The Use Of A 'SAFT' For Token Sales.""Tune in to this episode (on Google Play, iTunes, iHeartRadio, Stitcher or TuneIn Radio) that covers the very cutting-edge of blockchain-related law to hear Santori and Klayman speak about the ways other agencies such as the IRS are handling crypto and to get their predictions for how regulation will play out in the coming year.

ShutterstockYou know what else is everywhere?Ad fraud.BuzzFeed News recently released a nearly 5,000-word exposé detailing a scheme between adtech companies, agencies and ad networks that cost major brands millions of dollars in fraudulent spend. The outlet exposed 41 websites and key players, including “a model and online entrepreneur who played Bob Saget’s girlfriend on the HBO show Entourage.”Pixalate, a fraud prevention and detection company, outed Monkey Frog Media as a front for committing fraud by session hijacking and refreshing browsers hundreds of times per user session. The SadBotTrue team released their 12-letter domains report that exposes Tomasz Klekot of PopAds for hundreds of billions of fraudulent ad views across hundreds of fake, randomized 12-letter websites. Marc Pritchard has been preaching about ad fraud on the stages of Dmexco, ANA Masters and 4A’s to demand solutions and accountability from adtech firms, agencies, brands and the tech giants. Ad fraud is obviously a problem, with an estimated price tag over $16.4 billion and growing. With nearly $30 billion spent on digital advertising this year, it’s estimated that 29% of programmatic and 12% of direct buy traffic comes from invalid sources (aka ad fraud). From agencies to adtech companies, everyone’s hands are a bit dirty, and no one is sure if (or how) they can be washed. How Can We Solve Ad Fraud?Every article seems to be exclaiming ""blockchain!” in unison. Somehow this term has become the be-all and end-all of solving advertising fraud. In theory, it works. But before we address that, a brief timeout here for those not too familiar with the very basics of blockchain technology. My favorite simple and concise definition comes from Fortune's Robert Hackett: ""The blockchain is a way to structure data and the foundation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This coding breakthrough --which consists of concatenated blocks of transactions -- allows competitors, suppliers and buyers to share a digital ledger across a network of computers without the need for a central authority. No single party has the power to tamper with the records: The math keeps everyone honest.""In advertising, the relationship is built around advertisers, publishers and users (or viewers of the ad). Advertisers bid for ad placements, publishers accept the bid, the ad impression is delivered, the ad is filled and the user’s ID is matched with that ad impression ID. Sounds pretty foolproof, right? Math keeps everyone accountable. Sorry, folks.It’s not going to happen.Why Blockchain Won’t Solve Ad Fraud The first problem is how fast the technology works ... or how slow it works, depending on your level of pessimism. Ethereum’s blockchain technology, which is more advanced than Bitcoin’s, can only process maybe 13 transactions per second. For this use case, a transaction is every time an ad is viewed. With millions of ad impressions being delivered every second, the technology simply can’t keep up with processing that much information. The transaction load is heavily based on the number of nodes on a network, so to even get to 20 transactions per second, there’s got to be a lot of computing power behind the system.Second, who should create this? Blockchain’s premise relies on decentralization or the fact that no one individual or company controls the data. The math creates trust in a trustless relationship between parties. Over 60% of all digital advertising occurs on Facebook and Google. Should these giants be held responsible and accountable for their products? If this Russian debacle goes even further down the rabbit hole, they might finally be forced to take some action, but blockchain technology won’t be their first solution.There are dozens of companies working to solve ad fraud, and many are using blockchain technology to do so. Will it be opt-in or opt-out? Who holds the keys to the ledger itself? Is it private or public? There are too many variables to completely erase ad fraud and put that $16 billion back into brands’ pockets. So If Blockchain Won’t Solve Ad Fraud, What Can?Advertising fraud is just like email spam: It can be decreased dramatically, but it will never be annihilated, especially when we have both “errors of omission and errors of commission,” as Mike Zaneis, CEO of Trustworthy Accountability Group, put it in the Buzzfeed piece. OK, there might be one small hope for blockchain solving ad fraud. Advertised on its website as “fast, cheap, scalable token transfers for Ethereum,” the underlying technology of Raiden Network could boost the computing power of Ethereum’s network to potential scalability to start combatting ad fraud. However, this would probably only work if, let's say, it was required that all the DSPs and SSPs, major publishers, publisher networks, and consumer and industry protection agencies like IAB, NAI, DMA, etc. operate Raiden nodes and maybe incorporated some micropayment tax in there for processing power used. If this was the case, you could potentially scale enough to process millions of ad impressions every second. This is all unproven and highly speculative, especially for any near-term solutions. At least the industry is finally admitting there is a problem, as we’ve seen across conference stages. Pritchard has called for a four-prong strategy: • Adopt one MRC viewability standard• Implement MRC-accredited third-party measurement verification• Get transparent agency contracts• Prevent ad fraud Pritchard believes, “One reason [ad fraud has been overlooked] is our tendency to chase shiny objects. It’s a lot more fun to talk about virtual reality and artificial intelligence than bot fraud.""I agree, Mr. Prtichard. Blockchain has become the new shiny object for defeating ad fraud. "

Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]December 2017 has been an unprecedented month for cryptocurrencies. After cracking $10K, Bitcoin is nearing $20K after the launch of Bitcoin futures trading on Cboe and CME. In the aftermath, altcoins like Litecoin, Ripple, TRON, Cardano, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, and Qtum have experienced massive growth to hit record highs.Another coin that has been 'mooning' this past week is Verge (XVG).Verge Currency is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency known for its emphasis on being secure and anonymous—built with a focus on privacy and everyday use. It uses multiple anonymity-centric networks (ie. Tor, I2P), which obfuscates IP addresses to make transactions untraceable.According to the official website, Verge's mission is to:...empower people around the world by bringing blockchain transactions into everyday life. Verge currency makes it possible to engage in direct transactions quickly, efficiently and privately. With Verge currency, businesses and individuals have flexible options for sending and receiving payments. With the flip of a switch, we offer helpful integrations and tools that enable them to handle large scale transactions between merchants and small scale private payments.As we've seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum the past month, wherein transactions speeds have lagged considerably under new strains, Verge uses 'Simple Payment Verification' (SPV) technology to keep confirmation times to around 5 seconds on average.Verge foregrounds a policy of ultra-transparency and openness. Unlike many blockchain-based cryptocurrencies/projects, Verge is not a private company funded by pre-mined coins. It is an open-source platform, and the development team maintains an open-contact policy with the thousands of members of the Verge community to field, support, and implement new ideas about the Verge network.At 2:14pm PST, Dec. 12, XVG sold for $0.009336 USD, according to CoinMarketCap. At 12:34pm PST Dec. 19, that number was $0.074720—an increase of 800 percent. At the time of this writing, the price is $0.073867.The Bitcoin surge of the past month has impacted cryptocurrencies across the board. New investors are flooding the market, particularly through popular cryptocurrency brokerage Coinbase, which is adding around 100,000 new users per day, recently surpassing YouTube as the #1 app on the Apple App Store. A natural outgrowth is that many investors are starting to understand the current weak spots in Bitcoin investing and trading. In particular, the frustration with lagging transaction times might be sending these new participants to coins trusted to move faster—which is also a possible cause for recent spikes in Litecoin and Ripple.It's likely that Verge's emphasis on privacy is appealing to investors—particularly in times of global political turmoil.Unlike some of the other privacy coins, Verge emphasizes ease and usability alongside privacy measures. Verge also offers a host of secure wallets to amplify security for its users. Among them is the Tor Android Wallet for mobile anonymity, a unique offering in the community.The recently announced 'Wraith Protocol' also allows users to seamlessly alternate between public and private ledgers on the Verge Blockchain.For more information about Verge, visit the official website.

Initial Public Offerings, successfully marketing an ICO can be as 
complicated as ...","Sep 20, 2017,11:47am EDT",Shutterstock,"As cryptocurrency becomes increasingly popular among startups and established companies, alike, we’ll be seeing more companies positioning themselves for Initial Coin Offerings, or ICOs. An ICO is essentially a fundraising process for startups building cryptocurrency businesses. Through a crowdsale early supporters receive a percentage of the startup’s crypto-currency. Often, the currency used to facilitate an ICO is bitcoin. Similar to Initial Public Offerings, successfully marketing an ICO can be as complicated as it is rewarding. Although ICOs are relatively new, many startups and technologists believe they will become increasingly prevalent in the near future as more burgeoning startups explore application and implementation of cryptocurrencies.Here are 6 tips to market an ICO successfully.1. Figure Out Your MarketICOs are not for every company. Although the concept is new and exciting, not every industry is embracing the implementation of cryptocurrency. Many cryptocurrency supporters believe blockchain systems can and will impact every major industry, for the better. However, this impact likely won’t happen overnight.  One of the first questions you should ask yourself if you’re toying with the idea of an ICO is how you will integrate digital tokens into your business model. If the inclusion of digital currency won’t inherently add value to your product or service offering, then the IPO route may be more suitable for your venture. ICOs are still largely relegated to the blockchain world, but that doesn’t mean that more verticals won’t soon test the water.2. Learn The RulesFor years, cryptocurrency was seen as the Wild West in the startup investment world. But as it becomes more mainstream, it is actually becoming more regulated. In July 2017, the SEC ruled that some digital coins are actually securities.  Securities law is thick and complicated, but you need to make sure you at least know the basics. You should definitely have an attorney for the more advanced rules and regulations, but a basic knowledge of the rules will you make sure your company is ready to be in full compliance with the law from the start. This first ruling is largely viewed as a sign of what’s to come: the SEC will not let ICOs fly under the radar. If you want to position your company for a successful ICO, you have to educate yourself on the SEC’s criteria for what constitutes a security in the digital coin landscape.3. Know Your AudienceThe cryptocurrency world is still largely shrouded in confusion and misunderstanding. As you approach your ICO, you will most likely be speaking to two distinctive audiences: those with a breadth of digital currency knowledge, and those who really don’t understand the difference between Bitcoin and blockchain. This second group likely understands the growing status of cryptocurrency, but they may not understand the technicalities.It is your responsibility to create marketing and PR materials that speak to both sides of the spectrum. Through thought leadership, social media, and more traditional PR hits, you have to carefully define and tailor your messaging to support the experiences and interests of your target audience. For example, if you have the opportunity to provide a statement to a fintech centered outlet you have the freedom to offer deeper analysis and insights into how you’re leveraging digital tokens, because the audience of this outlet is (likely) already well versed in the topic. 4. Tell Your StoryIn addition to offering unique insights towards your marketing strategy, offer your insights to your potential investors. Come up with a sincere story about your company’s purpose in order to compel a desire to support your cause. A recent example of this is UTRUST, who has recently gotten notoriety for its socially responsible goal of boosting emerging economies through an easy-to-use, secure, and accessible banking system.You want to give investors a reason to give your company money and you can do this by providing them with the story behind your mission statement. 69% of Millennials want businesses to better facilitate customers getting involved in social issues, and many investors do, as well.5. Update Your WebsiteIn addition to social media, make sure your website is up to date and current with all of your company’s latest news. As CEO, you’re going to get pulled in many directions during your ICO so it’s important to have a central source of updates for potential investors who want to research your company. Communication, even digital communication, is considered today’s most important skill.6. Offer Your DataData is important; there are 2.7 zettabytes of data out there today. Trends and statistics are crucial components of demonstrating the value of an investment in your company. Investors want evidence — and by offering your data to analysts throughout your offering, you’re giving them concrete proof that your business will excel. Moreover, you’ll gain additional exposure simply by the fact that your company will be reported on regularly as long as you’re offering your data to reporters and analysts.Executing a successful ICO is no easy task. A lot of preparation and coordination goes into making sure a newly public company can secure as many investments as possible.What are some other tips you have for successfully marketing an ICO?"

The bank was alarmed when the ...","Nov 1, 2017,02:11pm EDT","Ripple used its own parallel Swell event at Swift’s Sibos conference to begin answering the questions of what the company is up to, and is it for real. Its program combined shock and awe — former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke in a chat with Gene Sperling, national economic advisor under two presidents, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the Steve Miller Band — with more mundane but pointed content from traditional payment users and Ripple pioneers.","Gene Sperling and Ben Bernanke at Ripple's Swell Conference.Ahead of Sibos Ripple had announced that more than 100 financial institutions, including Credit Agricole, Currencies Direct, RAKBANK and TransferGo, had joined its enterprise blockchain network, RippleNet.During a panel at Swell, a Ripple event held about a mile from the Toronto convention center where Sibos was running, several Ripple users described their experiences with the company’s blockchain for payments.Richard Bell, blockchain innovation lead at Santander, said banks in London were offering international payments that would settle in 8 to 14 days.“That was quite incredible in 2015,” he noted. Users couldn’t be sure how much they would receive after fees, and fintech companies were active in offering better service. The bank launched a Ripple iOS payment service for Apple phones to 9,000 employees across Europe, allowing them to pay with British pounds or US dollars. They could tell in advance how much a transaction would cost and when it would arrive, which was either same day or next day.Employees were quickly using it to pay mortgages in foreign accounts; one got a speeding ticket in Italy and was able to pay it immediately.“When we tried to close the pilot there was a lot of opposition,” he said. The bank received an award from Accenture for the project. After the pilot, the bank spent three months investigating the Ripple stack for compliance, account controls, scalability and information security. In January it decided to move ahead and is now using Ripple in four major markets for retail, corporate and wholesale payments.SBI Remit, part of the SoftBank group in Japan, partnered with Ripple in January 2016, creating SBI Ripple Asia to improve remittance payments, starting with Siam Bank in Thailand to serve the estimated 40,000 Thais living in Japan.Nobuo Ando, representative director of SBI Remit, said that with its aging population Japan will need more foreign workers.“Foreign-born people in Japan is around 1.2 percent while in Europe it is 13 to 14 percent.” The country’s foreign born population is too small for its labor requirements, he said.“Foreign people sending money home want to send it safely, speedily and economically. Banks are difficult for foreign people to step into, and banks cannot make money out of it.”SBI Remit started with 43 transactions in December 2016, its first month, and now handles 143,000 transactions per month. He expects the number of foreign-born will increase and with it the remittance business. The company plans to launch next in Korea.“Ripple is lightning quick, six to seven seconds to settle.”On the other side of the globe, SEB in the Nordics is using Ripple’s blockchain to speed corporate payments from Sweden to New York. Paula da Silva, head of transaction services at the bank, said the bank started to explore blockchain with Ripple in 2014.“Once it became clear that bitcoin and blockchain were not the same thing, it was an easier ride,” she said.The bank was alarmed when the first payment simply disappeared for 30 minutes, she recounted.“We couldn’t understand what had happened, but it turned out to be a bug in our AML system which we had never previously discovered because payments took days or weeks. With Ripple the payments are now down to nine seconds"" once the AML bug was fixed.More customers want to move to the blockchain but the bank has to figure out how to migrate off its legacy systems so it isn’t running a parallel platform any longer than necessary.Collaboration with Ripple was fantastic, she added.In India, YES Bank is working with Ripple on in-bound remittances from North America, the Middle East and the UK.According to the World Bank, Indian migrants send home about $70 billion a year, said Dharmesh Desai, group EVP at the bank. The remittances are individual retail payments, mostly for family maintenance.Typically payments take three or four days to reach India. Payments on a weekend can take two days more, a hardship if an Indian family has an emergency on a Saturday. India has had instant clearing for three years, so once a payment arrives it moves to the recipient immediately.YES Bank is working with regulators to make clear that blockchain is not the same as crypto currency, added Desai who had a meeting with regulators scheduled for the week after Sibos. He expects it will be two or three years before regulators take a position on crypto currencies. Meanwhile banks can find a good value proposition to start with blockchain without getting into crypto currencies. Cross border payments have to deal with two banks and two regulators, he added. That can take time."
192,https://www.forbes.com/,"Dec 6, 2017",When Is A Currency A Share?,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemmagreen/2017/12/06/when-is-a-currency-a-share/,"The mining process of bitcoin is reminiscent of that. You need raw 
computing power, time and electricity which is a little like effort in the 
salt ...","Dec 6, 2017,03:11am EST",In the 13th century this was how you mined coin. Farming for salt western France. (Photo by:... [+] Education Images/UIG via Getty Images),"What exactly is a currency anyway, and why the regulation?Many centuries ago, if you wanted a way to pay your soldiers or your workers, you would look no further than your local salt mine or sea shore.For all the transactions that were too rapid or small for gold or silver, salt worked well. It had a certain intrinsic value in that people needed it to preserve food through the winter.Salt also had two other more important properties that made it suitable for paying people.The first was that there was a potential for it to be an expandable, quasi-limitless source of token. That’s important, because as your economy grows you will need ever increasing amounts of the whatever you’re using. If you run out, you push people into IOUs or micro divisions of the unit. Which isn’t good.So while the currency needs a certain scarcity value, you also need to be able to expand the currency in volume or you cramp the style of your wealth creators.The other element that makes a currency work is that it is tied to a certain amount of labour to retrieve it. Whether it was a salt mine or the sea, in the absence of any industrial processes, creating salt wasn’t easy. So some labour needed to go into creating it. And therein lay its value.The mining process of bitcoin is reminiscent of that. You need raw computing power, time and electricity which is a little like effort in the salt mining process. If there’s a faster way with less effort involved the currency would start to founder.To that extent there’s nothing particularly different between currencies of old and cryptocurrencies. True salt, gold and silver started with some intrinsic value, and crypto currencies had to bootstrap themselves into that position, but a modern bank note like the US dollar has no intrinsic value. The fundamentals of exchange of value don’t seem to change that much when intrinsic value disappears.You could even argue a tally stick where someone recorded a payment or event was a primitive source of blockchain. The notches that lined up before the stick was split down the middle guaranteed authenticity, and would have been very difficult to forge.The notion of the state controlling the issuing of coinage or currency isn’t new.17th Century England prohibited setting up other currency systems, and America bore the brunt of the resultant coin shortage. Lots of people trading value, but a lack of coinage or currency with which to do it. The fledgling continent was left to barter. This urge to control currency hasn’t gone away.So perhaps it was predictable that some organization would try to control the new generation of currency.  In the last few months the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is starting to have a lot to say about cryptocurrencies and whether it should regulate them.One of the questions its asking is whether they are a currency or a share (they’re about eight centuries too late to limit the use of salt as a currency).The key question they’re posing is this: Do cryptocurrencies have immediate value or some notional deferred value to be delivered at a later date?If the value is deferred, then what you have is a share. If their value is immediate then you have a currency. If it’s a share, things get complicated, and regulated very quickly.So, is a cryptocurrency immediate or deferred? Well, the first bitcoin transaction bought two pizzas in Jacksonville, Florida. Other cryptocurrencies are to buy things that are shortly to become on offer but are at the moment part of an Initial Coin Offering. The SEC might see these as deferred.But in any event, money has always been a store of value which could be spent in the future.Perhaps cryptocurrencies are attracting more attention because of their mystique. After all, they’re still strongly associated by many as part of the underworld.It’s worth asking how the rules might apply to other currency-like things and seeing if these older forms of value got off lightly. Air miles are issued by airlines and function a lot like a currency, controlled originally by a syndicate of airlines. Is the value immediate or deferred?The same question to credit card and reward schemes like Nectar, fly buys and even Starbucks loyalty stamps which behave in many ways as if they were a currency.The SEC doesn’t control these.Even the fiat currency which is no longer useful for buying the original gold it was linked to, is tied now only to a promise that the nation state that issues it will stay prosperous.If the nation state goes under so does the currency. But who would argue the dollar is a share certificate?Such arguments sound rather philosophical. But at the heart of this is a question about how much we allow an enterprise to create tools to control their own destiny? To what extent do we allow them that freedom and what protection should the public have?Airlines whose air miles for years have been a neat way of managing and controlling finances are a good example. They can introduce a little inflation, or quantitative easing by issuing more air miles. They can do things the way they like because it’s their scheme. The same is true for supermarkets and organizations that are creating instantaneous trading platforms by using cryptocurrencies.Is the public protected? Well, corporations are not at liberty to take too many liberties.If they get it wrong people lose out, but they can only break trust a limited number of times. Air miles has disappointed its user base and this has cost them dear. It has also resulted in lawsuits.Whom do you sue when it goes wrong?Which brings us on to the question that’s really bugging the SEC: Whom would one sue if there was something that went wrong with a cryptocurrency?Although the distributed nature of the modern currency makes it seem impossible, you only have to look at the way authorities have ultimately made Uber and Airbnb responsible for the things that they saw as external to their operation.Just as Uber was held responsible for its distributed driver network, so cryptocurrencies may be held accountable even if you don’t at first know where to point the finger.Cryptocurrency looks like the wild west but legislation isn’t far behind. Let’s hope those who legislate remember the value of freedom to innovate.Register Now: A Beginner's Guide To Bitcoin And Other Cryptocurrencies Free Webcast"

Rather than wait for outside investment, many startups, particularly in the esports and gaming spaces, are now turning within for the funding they need to build.The idea is startlingly simple; the company creates its own cryptocurrency and then offers investment in that coin through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). These ICOs are quickly replacing traditional VC funding  models, effectively cutting out the middle man by allowing companies to raise their own funds directly.In the first half of 2017 alone, start-ups have raised a record $1.27 billion, selling stakes in cryptocoins, according to research from Autonomous.The trend does not seem to be ending any time soon, with prices of existing cryptocurrencies continuing to excite potential investors as the market reaches new record highs. On November 2, Bitcoin breached the $7,000 mark for the first time.“The crypto market is growing for several reasons,” writes investment analyst Charles Bovaird. “A steady supply of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), a rising number of [hedge] funds that trade cryptocurrencies and the sustained interest of investors are all contributing to this trend.”With the ease of entry for new ICOs, and a growing public awareness of the potential upsides to cryptocurrency, Bovaird believes the positive momentum will continue to attract new money into the system. And all of this, ironically, makes ICOs incredibly attractive to the very same venture capitalists who are being “shut out” of their traditional funding role. As venture capitalist Cyril Bertrand notes, ICOs are a threat to the traditional VC model.“Clearly, ICOs may save a lot of headaches to entrepreneurs, compared to the usual VC fundraising processes,” he explains, citing shorter time to market, no SEC compliance, no liquidity clauses, etc. It is basically the Wild Wild West of investing. And some VCs are climbing aboard, eager to be a part of this brave new financial segment.So what does a VC look for when investing? I looked to several industry thought leaders for insights, and also had a chance to interview two investors in DCoin, a new cryptocurrency issued by DMarket, for some specific input.Blockchain Industry Thought Leaders Speak OutThe crypto industry knows it faces a bit of an image problem, with Bitcoin and the rest often viewed as part of the dark web. The U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently increased its involvement in the space, even issuing a statement that encourages investors to be ""wary of investment opportunities"" that may sound too good to be true.While blockchain technology itself limits technical fraud, there are plenty of fraudulent or half-baked ICOs out there.Denis Dovgopoliy, founder at venture investment group GrowthUp, says it is important to look at what the proposed coin will actually do – beyond funding the project for the owners. He is an early investor in DCoin, a currency for the massive online gaming industry that is being offered through DMarket and has raised close to $11 million as of now.“The blockchain technology is being used in many projects these days, even in those where it doesn’t bring any value,” Dovgopoliy explains. “The hype around the ICOs is the main reason for that. Nevertheless, there are industries in which the blockchain technology gives a strong advantage, for example, services to confirm the ownership’ rights. I am pretty convinced that the businesses in this segment will drive the industry.”Samantha Radocchia, co-founder and CMO at Chronicled, sees strong potential in the world of supply chain management.“Blockchain is one of those defining technologies that will change and improve many industries, particularly the supply chain space. And it’s set to enter that phase where implementation moves quickly,” Radocchia says. “It’s already happening as we speak, and the implications are enormous.”There is even an industry rising up to support ICOs.  Starbase, for example, offers founders a pre-built platform on which to issue tokens and run their own ICOs, connecting any project to rapid crowd funding potential, without some of the usual challenges.""One of the challenges founders face when looking for funding is access,” explains Starbase founder Tomoaki Sato. “In 2016, the number of Venture Capital firms in the U.S. declined from 1,009 to 798. With the hundreds of thousands of new businesses starting each year, it’s very difficult for a founder to create a partnership with a VC.”Sato explains that once you find the right VC, founders go through several stages to secure funding, and when it is all said and done, VCs fund less than 3% of the companies they review.One way to overcome this VC gap is to create your own funding through an ICO or, as Sato explains, by using a crowd funding platform like Starbase, where a community of investors and members come to together to support a common project, using the existing platform to run the ICO.Sato believes this kind of crowd sourced approach removes even more barriers to funding successful projectsBeyond the Hype, What Will This Do?Oren Klaff of Intersection Capital and author of Pitch Anything says there are four critical questions to be asked in this much-hyped space.“First, is the proposed technology just an improvement, or will it change an entire industry? Second, has the Team delivered a software product before? These technologies are easy to talk about, but very difficult to implement and this is not a good industry for beginners,” he insists.“Third, you have to read the company's White Paper and ask yourself, is this ‘cold fusion’ (eg. an impossible technology) or is it really possible to deliver the product? Is the engineering plan properly described? And, last, but not least: Is there an actual demo or beta version of the product to understand the vision?""When viewed through this lens, it becomes pretty easy to spot the bad bets and the ridiculous currency ideas. Like the aptly named Titcoin, billed as “the official porn currency.” With a current price of less than one cent, it is unlikely to see any big rise out of this one.Then there is Trumpcoin, the currency that wants to “make cryptocurrency great again.” With a current market cap of less than $300,000, that mission is probably not going to be accomplished any time soon.The Importance of the Team Like any business venture, the team behind the ICO is the primary driver. A solid team with the experience to get the job done is imperative.As VCs look toward ICOs as the next iteration of investments, there will probably weeding out of the projects that have what it takes to give the undertaking the serious attention it requires. While initially a way around VC funding, many ICOs are now welcoming these venture capitalists into the fold. They are accepting what they offer beyond just the money and looking to their wealth of experience to help them growth.Darren Heitner is the Founder of South Florida-based HEITNER LEGAL, P.L.L.C. and Sports Agent Blog.

Incrementum, as you may know, is responsible for publishing the annually-updated, widely-read “In Gold We Trust” report, which I’ve cited a number of times before.","Gold looks like a bargain just in time for ChristmasDuring his presentation, Stöferle shared the fact that his wife prefers to do her Christmas decoration shopping in January. When he asked her why she did this—Christmas should be the last thing on anyone’s mind in January—she explained that everything is half-off. A bargain’s a bargain, after all.This is very smart. Here we are several days before Christmas, and demand for ornaments, lights and other decorations is red-hot, so be prepared to pay premium prices if you’re doing your shopping now. But mere hours after the Christmas presents have been unwrapped and Uncle Hank has fallen asleep on the couch with a glass of boozy eggnog, stores will begin slashing prices to get rid of inventory.Gold bullion and mining stocks are currently in the “January” phase, so to speak, according to Stöferle. The Barron’s Gold Mining Index, which goes all the way back to 1938, recently underwent its longest bear market ever, between April 2011 and January 2016. And as I already shared with you, the World Gold Council (WGC) reported last month that gold demand fell to an eight-year low in the third quarter.Barron's gold mining index bear markets since 1942“Most people get interested in stocks when everyone else is,” Warren Buffett famously said. “The time to get interested is when no one else is.”The same logic applies to Christmas decorations, gold and mining stocks.As of my writing this, gold is trading around $1,280, up 11% in 2017. That’s off 5% from its 52-week high of $1,351 set in September. If it stays at its present level until the end of the year, the metal will end up logging its best year since 2010, when it returned 30%.Gold traded up on Friday as the U.S. dollar weakened following news that former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations he had with Russian officials last December during the presidential transition. It’s possible that the details Flynn might provide as part of a plea bargain could help special prosecutor Robert Mueller advance his investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election.But back to gold. Considering it’s faced a number of strong headwinds this year—a phenomenal equities bull run that’s drawn investors’ attention away from “safe haven” assets, lukewarm inflation and anticipation of additional rate hikes, among others—I would describe its performance in 2017 as highly respectable.And yet if you listen to the mainstream financial news media, gold is “boring” and “flat.” Speaking to CNBC last week, Vertical Research partner Michael Dudas called the gold market “eerily quiet.”Dudas was specifically describing gold’s volatility, but even here the facts tell a slightly different story. In the table to the right, you can see the 10-day standard deviation for a variety of assets, using data from the past 12 months. Gold traded with higher volatility than domestic equities, the U.S. dollar and global emerging markets. Of those measured, only oil and bitcoin showed higher volatility.Based on volatility alone, it’s stocks that look pretty “boring” and “quiet” this year, but you’re not likely to hear a pundit or analyst describe them that way.And with good reason. The S&P 500 hasn’t fallen more than 3 percent from a previous high for more than 388 days now, the longest stretch ever for the index. And for the first time in its 120-year history, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has reached four 1,000-point milestones in a single year—with a whole month left to go. It’s possible that excitement over the Senate’s tax bill will be enough to push the Dow above 25,000 sometime before the ball drops in Times Square. The drama involving Flynn, however, could threaten to derail those chances.Dow Jones Industrial average made history againWhat this means is that, compared to domestic equities, gold is highly undervalued right now. The gold-to-S&P 500 ratio, a time-tested trading indicator, is near 50-year lows. I see this as a strong buy signal, especially now as we await the Federal Reserve’s decision to lift rates this month. If you recall, gold broke out strongly following the December rate hikes in 2015 and 2016.Gold is a bargain right now compared to stocksIn his December outlook on precious metals, Bloomberg Intelligence commodity strategist Mike McGlone writes that “gold is ripe to escape its cage soon,” adding that “prices just don’t get as compressed as they did for gold in November, indicating a breakout soon.”So what are the catalysts that could trigger a breakout? Stöferle mentions two: a possible recession and stronger inflation.“I think the odds are pretty high that a recession might be upon us sooner or later because we’re in this rate hike cycle, and as always the central banks are way behind the curve,” he said.What Stöferle is referring to is the strong historical correlation between new U.S. rate hike cycles and recessions. Going back more than 100 years, 15 of the last 18 recessions were directly preceded by monetary tightening.Recessions have historically followed U.S. rate hike cyclesThe Federal Reserve isn’t just raising rates, remember. It’s also begun to unwind its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, which was built in the years following the financial crisis. This carries historical risk. The central bank has embarked on similar reductions six times in the past—in 1921-1922, 1928-1930, 1937, 1941, 1948-1950 and 2000—and all but one episode ended in recession.“Quantitative tightening will fail,” Stöferle predicted.Obviously, there’s no guarantee that this particular round will have the same outcome as past cycles, but if you agree with Stöferle, it might be prudent to have as much as 10 percent of your wealth in gold bullion and gold stocks.Inflation is a trickier thing to forecast. A lot of people, myself included, had expected the cost of living to show signs of life this year in response to some of President Trump’s more protectionist and policies. But nearly 10 months into his term, no major legislation has been passed or signed.That might be about to change with the highly anticipated tax reform bill, which the Senate passed late Friday night. If the bill reaches Trump’s desk, it will be the first time in a generation that the U.S. has amended its tax code.But will the $1.5 trillion bill, as it’s currently written, lead to stronger economic growth and pay for itself, as its most vehement supports insist? My hope is that it will. As I’ve been saying for a while now, it’s time we begin relying more on fiscal policies to drive growth, especially now that the Fed is beginning to tighten policy.In the spirit of staying balanced, though, there are troubling signs and forecasts that the bill could actually end up being a disappointment. After reviewing the bill, the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates that its enactment could lead to a whopping $1.4 trillion increase in the deficit between now and 2027. Even if we factor in economic growth that might come as a result of reforms, the JCT says, we’d still be looking at a $1 trillion shortfall.Many economists are also skeptical. A recent University of Chicago Booth School of Business survey of economists from Yale, MIT, Princeton, Harvard and other Ivy League schools found that over half did not believe the current tax bill will “substantially” grow GDP. Only 2 percent thought it would, and more than a third were uncertain. Additionally, nearly 90 percent believed that if the bill is enacted, the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio will be “substantially” higher a decade from now.And then there’s the Kansas experiment from five years ago. In May 2012, Governor Sam Brownback signed a sweeping state tax reform bill that in many ways resembles the Senate’s current tax bill. It slashed personal and business income taxes, consolidated the state’s three tax brackets into two and eliminated a number of credits and exemptions. Hopes were high that the reforms would kickstart economic expansion, help taxpayers and attract new business to the state.Instead, none of that happened. Following the bill’s enactment, Kansas GDP growth remained stagnant, trailing the national growth rate as well as that of neighboring states and even its own rate from years past. This year, the nonprofit financial watchdog group Truth in Accounting gave Kansas a failing financial grade of D, citing its inability to pay its debts or balance its budget.Kansas' 2012 tax cuts failed to spur growth - a lesson for the U.S.?In June of this year, Kansas’ Republican-controlled state legislature voted to raise taxes for the first time since reforms were enacted and eventually had to override Governor Brownback’s veto. Many of those state legislators who initially supported the Kansas tax cuts are now warning federal lawmakersthat similar outcomes could occur on a nationwide scale.I’m not sharing this to discredit tax reform—in fact, I’m strongly in favor of it. However, I believe it’s important to highlight the fact that nothing in life is guaranteed. Hope for the best, prepare for the worst. What steps can you take now in the event the tax reform bill doesn’t accomplish what it’s designed to do—or worse? This type of uncertainly has historically made gold shine the brightest.At conferences I’ve attended and spoken at recently—the Silver & Gold Summit in San Francisco and Mines and Money in London among them—the suggestion has been made by a few big-name investors and money managers that bitcoin’s meteoric rise is to blame for the market’s apparent disregard for gold and gold stocks right now. With bitcoin up more than 1,050 percent since the beginning of the year, even after a 21 percent dip last Wednesday, many market-watchers might simply be too star-struck by the newness of bitcoin to be bothered by the “barbarous relic.”I happen to think this is a mistake. As much as I believe in the value of bitcoin, gold and gold stocks still play a crucial role in the modern portfolio.As I told Kitco News’ Daniela Cambone at the Silver & Gold Summit, bitcoin isn’t responsible for dismantling gold. Although both assets are currencies, I don’t see them at odds because they serve very different functions. For one, gold is more than money—it’s worn as jewelry, widely used in dentistry and can be found in art and even some high-end foods. It’s been traded around the world for millennia and, unlike bitcoin, does not require electricity. Indeed, it conducts electricity, which is why you can find it in your iPhone and GoPro camera’s circuitry.Bitcoin is more than money as well. It’s the most influential spokesperson, if you will, of blockchain technology, upon which the currency is built. Speaking with SmallCapPower’s Angela Harmantas at the Mines and Money conference in London, I made the comparison that bitcoin is to email as blockchain is to the internet. In the earliest days of the internet, few people truly understood what it was or could predict the implications of this new technology—but email they understood. It’s what woke people up to the idea of using the internet. Bitcoin is doing just that for blockchain.But blockchain’s utility goes far beyond finance. As a decentralized, highly encrypted ledger, it has untold potential to change the way we run our lives, businesses and governments. Among other tasks, the technology can help manage digital rights to intellectual property, bring transparency to supply chains and reliably track the spending of public funds. It can even be used as a tamper-proof voting system, whether you’re voting for a new chairman of the board or president of the United States. One day soon, we might all be e-voting from our smartphones and tablets, reassured that our vote cannot be compromised.All opinions expressed and data provided are subject to change without notice.

And, indeed there is a lot of money sloshing around in the space with ICOs having raised around $2 billion so this year, with a plethora of ventures from across the industry spectrum tapping the market.The SEC’s Enforcement Division and Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations is encouraging investors to be “wary of investment opportunities” that sound too good to be true.“We encourage investors to research potential investments rather than rely on paid endorsements from artists, sports figures, or other icons,” it added. The SEC noted that celebrities and others have recently promoted investments in ICOs.Citing their Report of Investigation (July 25, 2017) concerning The DAO, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization created by Slock.it and Slock.it’s co-founders, the U.S. financial regulator warned that virtual tokens or coins sold in ICOs may be securities, and those who offer and sell securities in the United States “must comply with the federal securities laws.”As such the Commission stressed that: “Any celebrity or other individual who promotes a virtual token or coin that is a security must disclose the nature, scope, and amount of compensation received in exchange for the promotion.”Failure to disclose such information constitutes a “violation of the anti-touting provisions of the federal securities laws.” And, it said that people making these endorsements may also be “liable for potential violations of the anti-fraud provisions” of the federal securities laws, for participating in an unregistered offer and sale of securities, and for acting as unregistered brokers.Golden Bitcoin money on computer concept. (Image: Shutterstock).As Charles Hoskinson, formerly an Ethereum co-founder who in 2015 founded IOHK, a leading blockchain R&D company, said to me in relation to ICO’s recently: “Once people realize they can make money through this mechanism [ICOs] many people are going to try. It’s a value transfer mechanism.”The American from Boulder, Colorado, whose IOHK team over the past two years designed Cardano, an “industrial-strength” blockchain, added: “It does not, however, replace basic business principles such as due diligence, use of funds, who comprises the management, what is the business plan and how the entity in question is going to execute on its plan.”He added: “An ICO - a token - has to have a right to exist, it has to perform something and have some form of a utility. It cannot be used to capitalize an endeavour.” But people often forget about such things. One could even talk about the merits of Sci-fi ICOs and real ICOs as well as the question as to how of these ICOs will succeed at the end of the day.In respect of the SEC’s 18-page statement on DAO from July, Hoskinson noted: “The SEC was very careful in their reading [of the landscape] and every word it used was carefully chosen. What they said in relation to the DAO, if it was a ‘normal’ vehicle like a venture capital fund or an equity offering, all the facts and circumstances would say you would have absolutely register with the SEC.”But ICO entities or offerings effectively saying that because they are decentralized and they are somehow immune from regulation won’t wash. The SEC’s opinion was that such an approach cannot be taken. As Hoskinson pointed out using an analogy: “If you call a duck a rooster, it doesn’t change the fact that it’s a duck.”However, at the time of the SEC’s statement they did not take a position “on the meat” of what is going on in the cryptocurrency space according to Hoskinson. For example, they did not comment on utility tokens. So it leaves the door open to more positions and statements coming in due course.Investor ProtectionThe SEC said it will continue to focus on these types of promotions in order to protect investors and to ensure compliance with the securities laws. Its mission is after all to maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets as well as facilitate capital formation and promote a market environment worthy of the public's trust.It minded investors to note that “celebrity endorsements may appear unbiased, but instead may be part of a paid promotion.” Therefore, investment decisions should not be based solely on an endorsement by a promoter or other individual.“Celebrities who endorse an investment often do not have sufficient expertise to ensure that the investment is appropriate and in compliance with federal securities laws,” the latest statement added. The need for research to be conducted before making investments, including in ICOs, was underlined by the Commission.“If you are relying on a particular endorsement or recommendation, learn more regarding the relationship between the promoter and the company and consider whether the recommendation is truly independent or a paid promotion,” it said.Why the U.S. regulator has waited until now to issue a statement on this issue given the bubble developing in terms of the number of ICOs, token sales and crowdfunds makes one wonder. At least they are upping the ante.And, who knows if this will be the precursor to fines, litigation against market participants in the crypto space and prison sentences down the line for those who transgress. This is against a backdrop of the number of ICOs showing no sign of slowing down in what might be described as a feeding frenzy.It all rather reminds me of a quote by Dr John Bates, a fintech and Big Data pioneer and CEO of Testplant, who referred to “regulators chasing Ferrari’s on bicycles.” He wasn’t at the time referring to ICOs, but rather high frequency trading (HFT) and algorithmic traders in that space.For more information, an Investor Alert from the SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has been issued regarding celebrity endorsements.The SEC has also provided additional resources including an Investor Bulletin: Initial Coin Offerings, an Investor Alert: Public Companies Making ICO-Related Claims, and an Investor Alert: Social Media and Investing - Avoiding Fraud. "

But with such growth, it’s perhaps more important than ever that startups in the blockchain space are managing themselves in the correct way and with the utmost integrity – for their own good and to the benefit of their customers and investors, as well as the blockchain movement as a whole.Indeed, the market may be steaming hot, but this does not mean that every startup will succeed. Several leading names in the blockchain and crypto ecosystem, as well as some of the most exciting new ICO projects, came together to share advice, innovation and inspiration at a recent meetup hosted in Barcelona by CryptoFriends.The likes of Brock Pierce, Jason King, Eyal Herzog and Eric Benz – all experts in the blockchain space – gave the audience plenty of food for thought, and if you are seriously looking to launch a startup with an ICO, you should consider heeding their guidance.1. Weak external regulation requires strong self-regulation Brock Pierce, chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation and co-founder of Blockchain Capital. Photographer:... [+] Alessia Pierdomenico/BloombergSome are predicting that we are seeing signs that led to the dotcom bubble of the late 90s and early 2000s. Whether or not we are going to experience a big crash will depend on the ability for self-governance, self-regulation or, better yet, best practices. According to Pierce, co-founder of Blockchain Capital, “the entrepreneurs doing the next ICOs should remember the Japanese term ‘Kaizen,’ which means continually upgrading always. If we keep elevating the bar and keep using better practices; whether it be vesting schedules, milestones where tokens go back or all these sorts of things, giving people securities and rights in some instances, I think the market will stay strong.”“It’s very easy sometimes, when you see all this money and the opportunity to make compromises and to do the wrong thing because you want to make easy money. This is going to be a big family and a system built in transparency. Operate with absolute integrity and you’ll always be part of that larger family,” he said.2. Be prepared to fail Jason King, a co-founder of the Academy School of Blockchain at Kingsland UniversityWith so much excitement in the market and a host of incredible success stories, it might be tempting to think that it’s impossible to fail right now. But that simply isn’t the case and there are many reasons why your startup might not make it. As King, a co-founder of the Academy School of Blockchain at Kingsland University warns, “nine out of ten startups will fail, but that’s just startup culture. A business is not going to be magical just because it has blockchain involved in it. But some of these small startups today will be huge breakout companies. They will be the Google’s, Facebooks, Twitter and Snapchats of tomorrow, making a huge impact on the world.” Some of the best technology never sees the light of day because of poor marketing. Equally, there are some projects that talk a good talk but haven’t developed the technology enough to deliver on their promises. In the end, it comes down to assembling the right team. Be honest about where your lack of knowledge or resources lie and seek out the right people. And you don’t necessarily need big budgets either. If someone believes in your project enough, they may even work for future equity.3. Consider offering security tokensIn the current market, most ICOs are offering utility tokens, but groups such as Blockchain Capital are starting to see the benefits of tokenized securities. As Pierce, explains, “everything to date has been utility tokens so, with Blockchain Capital’s third fund, I did the first ever ICO of a security. And in doing so, I was able to offer something that almost no one can, which is right to my users, opportunities to have access to ownerships or actual royalties, dividends, things of that nature. I think a lot of these deals would be better served doing this. Not to say that utility tokens are bad, but a lot of these deals, I think, should be done as a security token. The market is changing rapidly. Whatever deal you’re doing, you should be considering a security token.” 4. Meet the blockchain community “At CryptoFriends we try to bring people throughout the blockchain world together, but we aren’t the only ones. At the moment the whole ecosystem is relatively small, with only around 10-20 million people actively involved, so now is an amazing time to be sharing with and learning from everyone you meet. Seek out events in your area or, better yet, start your own. The more the ecosystem continues to grow, the more this incredible blockchain phenomenon will advance,” told me Benz, managing director of Cryptopay, who hosted the event.Bancor Protocol co-founder and head of product Eyal Hertzog speaks onstage during TechCrunch Disrupt...

It’s not just about making money, it’s about making a better world, and people here truly believe this tech has potential to make the lives of everyone so much better,” said Hertzog."

The impact of blockchain technology will be enormous. Because it is changing the foundation of our economic and social systems, full integration into our infrastructure will likely take years if not decades. Since there’s been a tremendous amount of hype—negative and positive—about blockchains, we’re going to break it down into what it is and what you need to know.ShutterstockWhat is blockchain?In the simplest of terms, blockchain is just a new form of decentralized database.You can think of blockchain as the “internet of value.” It’s a real-time ledger of anything that can be recorded (financial transactions, contracts, physical assets, supply chain info, etc.) but there is no one person or organization in charge of the entire chain. In fact, it’s open and everyone in the chain can see the detail of each record—what’s known as a block. Each block is time stamped and encrypted; the only person who can edit a block is the one that “owns” it. Owners gain access to their block through a private key that only they have. When there are changes to an individual block, everyone’s distributed blockchain is updated and syncs in real time.There are several benefits of blockchain technology that promise to revolutionize business and finance. Blockchain technology establishes a peer-to-peer network within one system, so it cuts out the time and costs of intermediaries (the “middle man”) and the complexity of using disparate ledgers and processes throughout the lifecycle of any transaction. As one example, a stock purchase that’s transacted in a blockchain would settle in minutes. There would be no need to have another entity process the transaction or be required to wait for them to do so. Every transaction goes into a block, and each block connects to the one before and after it which amps up its security. While nothing is fully hackproof, blockchain is significantly more secure than anything else we have today.Everyone should know these 14 things about blockchainsI’ve pulled together a list of things that I believe everybody should know about blockchains. These facts will not only help you make better sense of this new technology, but it may even equip you for your next trivia hour or business exchange.It’s time to learn all you can about blockchain technology and get your team working to figure out what opportunities it will create for your organization."

Forbes also has learned of further misrepresentations both in the NextBlock Global final investor deck as well as for a previous initiative by NextBlock Global CEO Alex Tapscott with his father Don.Emails to investors from Sid Ramanathan, whose email signature states he is CIBC's executive director of Equity Capital Markets – Global Investment Banking, and from Chung Kim, whose email signature identifies him as executive director, Institutional Equity Sales, included one line: ""CIBC has withdrawn as an agent from the NextBlock Global Limited private placement."" CIBC declined to comment. Additionally, the photo of an advisor, Dino Angaritis, CEO of SmartWallet, who was listed in both version 5 and the final investor deck, was not of Angaritis. The Globe and Mail reported (paywall) the photo ""appears to be that of Luke Carman, a published fiction author in Australia, whom the Sydney Morning Herald deemed the Best Young Novelist in 2014 for his novel An Elegant Young Man.""Angaritis confirmed to Forbes by phone that he had previously agreed to be an advisor to NextBlock, and that he had asked for his photo not to be used in the deck. However, he had not signed any documents formalizing the advisor role, nor seen the investor presentation until the Forbes article Wednesday. Alex Tapscott has not yet responded to requests for comment.Crypto venture capital firm NextBlock Global is going public with a $100 million CAD ($77 million USD) raise on the Toronto Stock Exchange through a maneuver called a reverse takeover that does not involve an initial public offering. Tapscott is known in the blockchain and crypto community for coauthoring, with Don, a book called ""Blockchain Revolution,"" which was a bestseller in Canada. His firm is one of a slew of crypto investment firms, many of which are hedge funds, which have arisen in 2017 to capitalize on the token craze which has generated $3 billion in capital for new blockchain-based projects in so-called initial coin offerings; NextBlock is unusual in that it plans to go public.NextBlock Global CEO Alex TapscottThe Forbes article Wednesday revealed that NextBlock had listed four crypto stars as advisors in at least one version of an investor deck. All four confirmed to Forbes that they had never agreed to advise. The four include Kathryn Haun, a board member of Coinbase, Vinny Lingham, CEO of Civic and shark on South Africa's Shark Tank, Dmitry Buterin, founder of BlockGeeks and the father of Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, and Karen Gifford, a special advisor for global regulatory affairs at Ripple who was previously counsel and officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Tapscott initially told Forbes to have only listed one, Haun, in a ""draft"" of the deck. Then when told Forbes had a copy listing all four-- which was labeled version 5 and circulated just two business days before the final -- he claimed to have had conversations with all of them. Three confirmed to Forbes they had been approached but had declined. However, Gifford said she and Tapscott never spoke about the matter.Another major underwriter, Canaccord Genuity, which is Tapscott's former employer, sent out another email to potential investors Friday morning with a new deck that listed no advisors at all. ""Please find attached a revised investor presentation for the NextBlock offering,"" it said. ""Please note that we have removed the page related to the Select Advisors (formerly page 21). Given that there is no contractual relationship with these advisors, an investment decision should not be based on their involvement. Note that the select advisors as represented in the previous version has been reconfirmed by NextBlock, with the exception of Chami Akmeemana who has decided to no longer act as an advisor. Please use the attached final presentation to make an investment decision and disregard any previous versions."" Akmeemana is the former director of regulatory solutions at ConsenSys, a blockchain venture studio for Ethereum. The ""previous version"" referenced was the ""final,"" which was did not include the four falsely identified advisors and was circulated after Haun and Lingham confronted Tapscott about their inclusion in version 5. Forbes has uncovered further misrepresentations in a previous initiative by Alex and Don. When they announced their Blockchain Research Institute in March in CoinDesk, four of the ""proposed faculty"" listed in the article had never agreed to be proposed faculty. Jason Brett, a former regulator from the FDIC during the financial crisis, told Forbes in an email, ""Not only did I not agree to be listed as proposed faculty, I was not even asked.""Haun, who was then the United States Department of Justice prosecutor and digital currency coordinator, confirmed to Forbes that she had been approached but had never followed up or accepted.Pindar Wong, cofounder of blockchain research network BSafe.network, wrote via email that he had not formally agreed to participate in the BRI until months later. And, as reported by Forbes Wednesday, after being named as proposed faculty in the CoinDesk article, Mastering Bitcoin author and global speaker Andreas Antonopoulos declared on Twitter in March, ""I did not agree and will not be part of the Blockchain Research Institute as 'proposed faculty. The announcement saying that is false.""Don Tapscott told Forbes via email, ""As we were conceiving the Blockchain Research Institute we selected some candidates that we knew and respected as exemplary of the type of person when intended to engage as faculty. At no time did we ever represent or even suggest to anyone that these individuals would in fact become faculty.""Update Friday, November 3, 2017, 3:15pm EST: This story has been updated to clarify which deck the Canaccord email was referencing."

[+] (Photo credit Bloomberg)","Dubbed as the “city of the future”, Dubai, which plans to have robot cops, flying taxis and autonomous vehicles on its roads in coming years and appointed a minister in-charge of Artificial Intelligence recently, is planning yet another transformation: to become the world’s first blockchain-powered government. By 2020, the emirate wants all visa applications, bill payments and license renewals, which account for over 100 million documents each year, to be transacted digitally using blockchain.According to Smart Dubai, which is conducting government and private organization workshops to identify services that can be best enhanced by blockchain adoption, the strategy could save 25.1 million man hours, or $1.5 billion in savings per year for the emirate. Much of this enhanced productivity will stem from moving to paperless government.Given the untamperable data record provided by the technology, real estate hasn’t escaped blockchain disruption either. Aiming to radically transform how people, buy, sell and lease real estate, Dubai Land Department (DLD), the government agency tasked with overseeing land purchases and approving real estate trades, in October, launched a blockchain-powered system to help secure financial transactions, electronically record all real estate contracts, and connect homeowners and tenants to property-related billers, such as electrical, water and telecommunications utilities. “Our aim is to unite all real estate and department services on a single platform,” said Sultan Butti bin Mejren, director general of DLD, in a press statement. ""This initiative is still in a stage of infancy. In the near future, we will see many partners joining blockchain to improve their client services, including banking, mortgages, and utilities and maintenance operations.""Gain confidence of global investorsThe introduction of blockchain in real estate is significant for a city that is ranked fourth in the world with the biggest inflow of high net-worth individuals, according to Knight Frank’s 2017 Wealth Report. According to DLD, the technology, with its fraud prevention and transparency capabilities, has the potential to affect thousands of global investors in Dubai each year, gaining their confidence.The emirate's property sector is projected to see a ramp up in 2018, thanks to adoption of blockchain, launch of a series of mega projects and a growing demand for new apartments ahead of Expo 2020. Earlier this year, apartments in a development in Dubai started selling for Bitcoin.The adoption of blockchain in real estate, however, is only a first step. In October, the emirate also launched its own blockchain-based cryptocurrency, called, emCash, that people can use to pay for government and non-government services. “A digital currency has varied advantages – faster processing, improved delivery time, less complexity and cost,” said Ali Ibrahim, Dubai Economy deputy director general, in a press statement. “It will improve ease of business and quality of life in Dubai.”More on Forbes: Supercar Blondie: The Female Supercar Driver Whose Instagram Account Is Rocking DubaiRole of startups and tech giantsHowever, Dubai’s blockchain strategy presents challenges due to lack of technical skills and infrastructure to support all the technology's functions. To address these challenges, the city will have a shared platform, called Blockchain as a Service, to help Dubai government agencies use blockchain in various projects.Additionally, local startup ArabianChain is helping to move inter-governmental paperwork onto the blockchain, and Dubai Future Accelerators, a program that pairs top technologies and businesses with partners in the emirate to create breakthrough solutions together, has few blockchain startups such as CrossVerify, Loyyal, Luther Systems, Otonomos and RSK Labs for rapid deployment of blockchain across Dubai.Earlier this year, Dubai government partnered with U.K. startup ObjectTech to bring blockchain-based security at Dubai International airport and develop digital passports to eliminate manual checks. Dubai Customs and Dubai Trade are also testing blockchain for trade finance in partnership with IBM.Tech giants such as  Microsoft, SAP and Cisco who are part of the Global Blockchain Council, a body of 32 government entities and private global companies launched in 2016, are also working on blockchain applications in Dubai. “The Global Blockchain Council’s role is to ensure that Dubai remains ahead of the curve and to provide ideas and guidance on how blockchain can benefit market participants, and ultimately contribute to Dubai’s economy,” said Ahmed Bin Sulayem, executive chairman of Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) Authority.Earlier this month, the UAE’s central bank announced it was undertaking a joint project with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority to use blockchain technology to issue a digital currency accepted in cross-border transactions between the two countries. With government, startups and global tech giants feverishly working, Dubai's ambitious blockchain plans, though still in its early stages of adoption, may well come to fruition rather sooner than expected."

 ","Today marks the seventh day of Hanukkah, and in only seven days, many families across the world will be celebrating Christmas. Not only is it the season of giving, but it’s also time to reflect back on the past 12 months and look ahead to 2018.5 big questions for 2018Below are five questions to help guide your thinking when making investment decisions in the new year.U.S. Presidential Cycles and StocksNext month marks President Donald Trump’s first year in office and the beginning of his second. How have markets responded to his pro-growth policies, including pledges to lower taxes and slash regulations?The answer: Overwhelmingly. As of my writing this, the S&P 500 Index is up 19% year-to-date, far outperforming the historical returns we’ve seen in the first year of a president’s four-year term.In the second year, returns have traditionally been lower than the first. From 1928 to 2016, such years produced average market gains of just above 4 percent, making it the weakest year.The reason for lower returns in the first two years, according to CLSA analysts this week, could be that “an administration looks to put as much bad news and painful actions into the first two years to form a good bias for getting reelected or paving the way for the predecessor of its own party.” Recall that President Bill Clinton didn’t hesitate to hike taxes after getting elected—he signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act just eight months into his first term.But Trump has taken a different strategy. As CLSA puts it, “all the good news is being front loaded in the first half of this presidential cycle.” Right out of the gate, Trump placed major executive and legislative agenda items on the docket, from an Obamacare repeal to deregulation to sweeping tax cuts.Not all of these efforts have borne fruit, of course. Even last week, his tax overhaul appeared to be imperiled after serious concerns were raised by moderate Republican senators such as Marco Rubio, Bob Corker and Jeff Flake.I remain optimistic, though, and I see no reason at the moment to think that 2018 won’t be an encore of 2017. We’re nine years into the current equities bull market, the second-longest in U.S. history, but there could still be plenty of “gas in the tank,” according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch report this week.So with only a month remaining to Trump’s first term, it’s important to remember the words of Warren Buffett a day before the president was sworn in. Even though Buffett backed Hillary Clinton in the election, he said that “America works and I think it’ll work fine under Donald Trump.”S&P 500 Index could report record-level earnings per share (EPS) in 2018Earnings per share (EPS) growth is one of the most reliable and closely monitored indicators of market health. It’s one of the key metrics we use to find the most growth-driven and profitable companies.As my good friend Alex Green said in an interview back in August, “if you look back through history, you’d be hard-pressed to find a single example of a company that increased its earnings, quarter over quarter, year after year, and not see its stock tag along.”Except for a slight dip from 2014 to 2015, when EPS for the S&P 500 Index fell from $119.70 to $117.55, earnings have been rising steadily since 2009.As of today, EPS for 2017 stands at $133.73, a new record and up nearly 13% from last year.Next year we could see them climb even higher, if estimates prove to be accurate. In a report last week, FactSet analysts predict EPS by year-end in 2018 to reach $143.17, a 7 percent increase from 2017.In other words, the American stock market is poised to continue its record-setting bull run in 2018.U.S. small-cap stocks head higher as optimism hit a near-record high in NovemberThe short answer here is: Yes, they can—but not by much before a new all-time record is reached.For the past 44 years, the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) has taken a monthly survey to measure the optimism of small-business owners, and in November, the index climbed to a skyscraping 107.5. That’s the second-highest reading ever, after the index hit 108.0 way back in July 1983 on the hopes of additional Reagan tax cuts.If we drill down into the various index components, we find that owners are most optimistic about the next three months, with 27 percent saying it will be a “good time to expand,” up from only 11 percent one year ago. They’re ready to unleash capital, buy new equipment and increase labor.In their monthly commentary, NFIB economists William Dunkelberg and Holly Wade wrote: “There is still much uncertainty about health care and taxes, but it appears that [small-business] owners believe that whatever Congress finally comes up with will be an improvement and so they remain positive.”That positivity is shared by small-cap stock investors, who’ve driven up the Russell 2000 Index more than 12 percent since the beginning of the year.U.S. Dollar Forecast to complete a seven-year cycle in 2018As of Friday, gold was up more than 9 percent for the year. If it stays at its current price level, gold will log its best year since 2011, when it returned 10 percent.The yellow metal has faced a number of significant headwinds in 2017, including surging equity markets around the world and rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Under the circumstances, I would describe its performance as highly respectable.Potential tailwinds in 2018 could help the yellow metal crack the $1,300 level and head higher.That includes a weaker U.S. dollar. CLSA analysts this week noted that the dollar has traditionally risen in seven-year cycles. Between 1978 and 1985, it gained 68 percent; between 1995 and 2000, 41 percent. The current bull market so far has seen the dollar rise 35 percent, which has been a challenge for gold, commodities and U.S. exports.That might be set to change in 2018, when we could see a completion of the seven-year cycle. As CLSA writes, “our tactics through 2018 would be to sell U.S. dollar strength in anticipation of break below 91-92 support.”Other possible tailwinds include geopolitical risks, negative real interest rates across the globe, continually expanding global debt and overvalued equities.On Monday, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) raised concerns that Russia has developed a ground-launched cruise missile system that might violate a 1987 Cold War pact banning such weapons. It’s believed the missile system would be able to strike Europe on very short notice. Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department is working around the clock to dissuade North Korea from continuing its nuclear weapons program. As a store of value, gold has historically performed well in such uncertain times.Meanwhile, two-year government bond yields in a number of European countries—the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Belgium, France, Spain and more—are below zero. As I’ve explained many times before, negative real rates have traditionally been constructive for gold in that particular country’s currency.Finally, there’s some concern that too much money is flowing into equities right now. According to Bloomberg, the total market cap for world equities is now just a “whisker” away from hitting $100 trillion—a monumental sum, to be sure. Should there be a correction, the investment case for gold and precious metals will become stronger than ever.Bitcoin trading thrives wherever regulators crack down mostBitcoin made some people a whole lot of money this year. One year ago today, the cryptocurrency was trading in the $770 to $780 range. On Friday, it briefly broke above $18,000. That’s a phenomenal return of 2,200 percent. The total market cap of all cryptocurrencies has already crossed above $500 billion and is well on its way to $1 trillion.So is there anything that could stop its progress?The most obvious answer might be regulations, but remember, bitcoin made these unexpected gains even as several countries clamped down on the digital currency. Venezuela, which will introduce its own government-sanctioned cryptocurrency, is scheduled to begin regulating bitcoin, but as the bolivar loses more and more of its value, residents have had to rely on bitcoin to survive.It’s not surprising at all to see that bitcoin has undergone the greatest surge in peer-to-peer trading in countries that have imposed some of the most stringent regulations on cryptocurrencies. This is a currency, after all, that does not require any third-party involvement to trade. It’s able to bypass governments, central banks and borders with ease.As I said last week, this is precisely why bitcoin is appealing to many investors. And according to Metcalfe’s law, more investors could mean higher ask prices.Bitcoin might be very appealing right now, but it’s important to keep in mind that this has been a very volatile market. If I didn’t readily have the money to buy bitcoin, I wouldn’t go into debt and certainly wouldn’t mortgage my house to get my hands on it, as some people are reportedly doing.All opinions expressed and data provided are subject to change without notice.

But as the financial technology (or fintech) revolution encroaches on Wall Street, it’s becoming increasingly clear that traditional firms must embrace technology or risk going the way of the ticker tape machine. (For full list of 10 Most Powerful Women In Finance, see next page.)Adena Friedman, who was elevated to Nasdaq CEO in January, is clear-eyed about the challenges facing her 46-year-old trading exchange. Last quarter, revenues from new listings at Nasdaq took a 1% hit as businesses are increasingly opting for private funding over public offerings. And among the stocks that are on Nasdaq, trading hasn’t been robust. Without a boost from acquisition and currency adjustments, revenue in market services — which includes trading in equity derivatives, cash equity, fixed income and commodities — was down 2% in 2016 and is off another 1% so far this year.
Abigail Johnson, Lubna Olayan, Mary Callahan ErdoesSee Full List: 100 World's Most Powerful WomenTo offset these trends, Friedman looked at what else Nasdaq can offer and realized her company can help investors who are desperate for data and analytics. As artificial intelligence and machine learning go mainstream, investors are increasingly looking for ways to gain even a small edge through data analytics. Nasdaq is sitting on a treasure trove of capital market data. So, Friedman turned to Nasdaq’s Innovation Lab, a virtual workshop launched in 2016, to figure out how to transform its reams of raw data into statistical gold.Last year, the lab introduced Nasdaq Trading Insights, a suite of software that lets traders compare their performance against their peers’. In May, it launched Analytics Hub, which transforms data — ranging from social media chatter to central banking statements — into signals to determine whether investors should buy or sell. A few months later, Nasdaq acquired eVestment, which can help Nasdaq attract asset managers by generating proprietary statistics on 74,000 investment instruments. The exchange is even wooing private companies with Nasdaq Private Market, technology to handle the administrative details — share buybacks or tender offers — that go along with maintaining liquidity.""These technological innovations will provide incredible opportunities to Nasdaq,” says Friedman, “and to all of our clients as they interact with the capital markets.""Friedman is just one of the female finance leaders who are embracing technology. Her efforts helped boost her 11 spaces on this year’s Forbes Power Women list to No. 20.Although it might seem obvious that finance needs to move to the cutting edge of technology, not everyone sees it that way. Jamie Dimon, head of JPMorgan Chase, has scoffed at one of the biggest tech innovations changing the financial landscape: cryptocurrency. He recently referred to the decentralized cryptocurrency bitcoin as a “fraud,” comparing its popularity to the tulip bulb craze in 17th century Holland. ""It's worse than tulip bulbs. It won't end well. Someone is going to get killed,” he warned at a conference this fall.Though his bank is actively investing in the technology that underlies cryptocurrency, known as blockchain, Dimon worries about bitcoin because there is no central organization controlling the currency’s value, thus protecting investors from a meltdown.Abigail Johnson, CEO of Fidelity Investments, who ranks No. 7 on our list, is taking a bolder approach to bitcoin. The $2.26 billion mutual fund company’s research arm, Fidelity Labs, is working on ways for clients to view their portfolios in cryptocurrency through digital wallet provider Coinbase. Fidelity Charitable has accepted more than $7 million in bitcoin donations. And Johnson herself is a vocal supporter of wider use of blockchain. She recently urged regulators in Washington to create a cohesive policy to streamline digital currency. She proclaimed at a blockchain conference in New York this spring that she “loves this stuff.”See Full List: 100 World's Most Powerful WomenIn Europe, Banco Santander’s Ana Patrica Botin (No. 9 on our list) is leading the charge in fintech through her bank’s InnoVentures private equity fund. Since its launch in 2014, the $200 million portfolio has seeded notable disruptors such as Digital Asset Holdings, Ripple and Kabbage. InnoVentures reaps the financial rewards when its holdings increase in value and at the same time they get first dibs on commercial partnerships with some of fintech’s strongest technologies.For instance, Santander UK offers online lending services to small and mid-size businesses through a digital platform created by Kabbage (founded by No. 98 on our list, Kathryn Petralia). Digital Asset Holdings founder Blythe Masters serves as a senior advisor to the bank on blockchain platforms. Santander recently helped spearhead a consortium of 70 Spanish companies to create Alastria (formerly known as Red Lyra), a semi-public blockchain network intended to capture blockchain’s efficiency within the safety of European Union regulations.Leaders like Johnson, Botin and Friedman have learned that shying away from new technology — no matter how unnerving — is not an option. That’s what ruined the music industry 15 years ago when record producers balked at digital distribution. With their leadership, finance has a chance to do better.10 Most Powerful Women In FinanceNo. 1: Abigail Johnson, CEO, Fidelity InvestmentsNo. 2: Ana Patricia Botin, Chair, Banco SantandarNo. 3: Adena Friedman, President-CEO, NASDAQNo. 4: Ho Ching, CEO, TemasekNo. 5: Chanda Kochhar, CEO, ICICI BankNo. 6: Mary Callahan Erdoes, CEO, Asset Management, JPMorgan ChaseNo. 7: Lubna Olayan, CEO, Olayan FinancingNo. 8: Marianne Lake, CFO, JPMorgan ChaseNo. 9: Kathryn Petralia, Cofounder & Head of Operations, KabbageNO. 10: Anne Finucane, Vice Chair, Bank of AmericaSee Full List: 100 World's Most Powerful Women"

So says just about everyone minus the perennial bears out there.Okay, maybe bitcoin loses 75%.Another year, another record breaker. Contrarians can't cut a break. Chinese hard landing aficionados...lose again. Bitcoin was supposed to crash once Beijing and Seoul banned their exchanges and/or initial coin offerings, instead, it fell for about a month and then rose over 300%. In March, the 10 year Treasury yielded 2.6%. It now yields 2.3%, meaning more money is pouring into government bonds even though everybody and their mother knows that the Fed is going to hike by around 75 basis points next year (three, not four). Interest rates will be even higher. So what? Investors are still buying bonds at a premium, locking in a lower yield than they can get in just a few short months from now assuming bond prices at par.The European Central Bank (ECB) will announce its taper plans on Thursday. The ECB is already spending (or perhaps wasting) less money buying toxic debt with almost no yield. Next year, they will spend even less. If all goes bad, the bond market will implode and European banks will be in trouble. If all goes horribly wrong, maybe a major bank will go belly up. (Not Deutsche Bank. It's Germany's Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. It gets saved.)Everything about bubble poppings is based on investor memories of 2008-09. People are trying to forecast the fallout, a fallout some consider will be massive when it comes. If it comes. It won't come this week from the European Central Bank.""The European Central bank is likely to sound less dovish on Thursday while the market is largely expecting that the bank would be rather dovish with its approach,"" says Naeem Aslam, a chief market analyst for ThinkMarkets in London. He thinks the euro gains against the dollar heading into 2018. ""The euro is without a doubt the best performer among major currencies this year and a surprise by the ECB could make for a very Merry Christmas for the euro bulls. The euro has the potential to move well above the 1.20 mark in 2019 because the market hasn’t priced in the prospects of the ECB actually increasing interest rates.""Face it, the bulls are killing it. The bears can't growl loud enough above this stampede and next year, barring a surprising war, or perhaps an impeachment of President Trump if the Democrats win both houses in the mid-terms, it's status quo for the U.S. economy with some minor upside, and major upside for beat down markets like Brazil.Bigger media mergers like Disney and Fox, corporate profits, the continued potential for tax cuts... [+] and an infrastructure bill coupled with solid global growth all trump the naysayers who believe global markets are due for a mighty correction. Next year is as good as any. But next year might end up being even better than this one for investment portfolios. Photographer: Michael Nagle/BloombergPotential Bubble Popping TriggersHow will markets react to rising rates in the U.S. and Europe? What happens when the ECB shuts down the life support system it runs for the European bond market?""Investors may well ask whether these problems have been deferred or whether markets will again take them in their stride,"" says Peter Harrison, CEO of Schroders, a London-based global money manager. ""One area of the equity market likely to stand out is value. After the longest period of underperformance in over 40 years, the catalyst for a turnaround could be a rise in inflation and therefore interest rates. Assuming policymakers can successfully juggle sustaining the recovery by controlling inflation, global bonds should not experience much downside,"" he thinks.No bubble popping in bonds, Schroders calls it.Click to enlarge. ECB balance sheet of mostly toxic debt is slightly larger than that of the Fed's.No bubble popping in U.S. equities either. Janus Henderson makes the call.""The options market does not believe that the equity market has to self-correct just because we’re a decade into the expansion, while the average business cycle lasts six years. We’re in the camp that this expansion can continue,"" says Ashwin Alankar, head of global asset allocation and risk management for Janus Henderson.Click to enlarge. The Federal Reserve is expected to raise rates three times this year and continues... [+] to unwind its securities portfolio of mostly toxic assets stemming from the 2008-09 financial crisis.Although this is a rear-view look, Morningstar analyst Janet Yang said that not one of the 200 funds they reviewed in the month of November got a downgrade by their North American and global ratings committees. They reaffirmed positive views on 125 funds, upgraded 10 funds, and put seven funds under review. Yang called it ""an unusual month"" because not a single fund was downgraded.There are trigger warnings, depending on how you look at the market. Technical warnings include high valuation and relative strength, but each time the big index ETFs bust through 70 RSI on a chart, there's a quick sell-off of maybe 5% to 10%, and it comes right back again.Consensus is that the big central banks of Japan, U.K., Europe and the U.S. will be prudent.Bitcoin might pop and go from $16,000 to $8,000 or less. But making that call is as easy as saying it will go to $50,000 or higher. More companies are allowing for bitcoin payments, meaning this is becoming a real currency. Other smaller cryptocurrencies that do not get the press like bitcoin, ether, and litecoin, may vanish from the scenes, but these are puny in comparison to the big three. They are akin to watching a few unprofitable startups no one has heard of go to dust.Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, still has the (mostly) full trust of... [+] investors. / AFP PHOTO / Daniel ROLANDNo one is listening to the China hard landing story anymore. It is over. There are credit concerns and housing concerns, but China is not a full market economy. The People's Bank of China has more money in reserves than the entire GDP of Brazil. If it wants, or needs, to throw money at a problem it can do so. If it wants to curb capital flight, it will. These are variables that many in the market discount, often treating the No. 2 economy as if it is as transparent as the E.U.Mexico is at risk because of politics. Brazil too. Russia is coming back alive, and the collusion story seems to be falling apart. This could change sentiment on Russia next year, even as Vladimir Putin is expected to win the presidency for the fourth (and final) time.Big picture geopolitical risks that may affect asset allocation are mostly tied to Trump trade talks with Mexico, Canada and China; North Korea going ballistic; and Saudi Arabia escalating its fight with Iran.In the meantime, emerging market stocks and bonds are expected to be an outperformer again next year.Alex Wolf, senior emerging markets economists with Aberdeen Standard Investments says strong external demand and improving domestic demand will help countries like India, which seems to be his favorite within the BRICS. ""We are in line with the consensus for 2018 Indian growth at 7%, but slightly below consensus on China expecting 6.2% growth in 2018,"" he says.Contrarians waiting for drama and a return of high volatility may be disappointed.  The Fed can deliver the three hikes in 2018 and still have a sizeable majority in favor of gradually higher rates for 2019 if the inflation call is right. The market has not been shocked at all by the Fed raising rates three times this year as told, even though many doubted forward guidance by the central bank and to get just one.  It is unlikely the market will be shocked by a re-occurrence of three hikes next year. However, any surprise by the Fed, ECB, BoE or BoJ on this front would be viewed as both a shock and a philosophical change, warns David Bloom, head of forex research at HSBC Bank in London.Such a move would come with ""with immense implications for currencies and the low volatility world we are now living in,"" he says.There's a trigger warning, right there."

What they have in common is a belief that many technological revolutions are starting now—and there are identifiable companies that will profit.Trend No. 2: Greenback Slump Spurs Emerging Markets (19 Funds)It’s no secret that the US dollar has had better times. After a bull run through 2015 and 2016, the greenback has given up a lot of those gains to emerging market currencies, the euro and even the post-Brexit pound. If you bet on a stronger dollar through, say, the PowerShares DB US Dollar Bullish ETF (UUP), you probably aren’t happy:Dollar Droops, UUP Dives
On Wall Street, a lot of analysts and traders made the mistake of betting on a dollar recovery in the middle of the summer. Boy, were they wrong! And while that’s not good for Americans looking to vacation abroad, it’s been great in other parts of the globe, particularly emerging markets and Asia.So great, in fact, that many China- and emerging market–focused ETFs are up over 50% and a few are close to that mark. This emerging-market strength has also benefited Germany, whose euro currency is getting stronger; the country also sells lots of technology to China.Source: ContrarianOutlook.comA ton of winners here, so let’s list them:Columbia India Small Cap ETF (SCIN) EMQQ Emerging Markets Internet & Ecommerce ETF (EMQQ) First Trust China AlphaDEX ETF (FCA) Global X China Consumer ETF (CHIQ) Global X China Materials ETF (CHIM) Guggenheim China Real Estate ETF (TAO) Guggenheim China Technology ETF (CQQQ) iShares MSCI Austria Capped ETF (EWO) iShares MSCI Brazil Small-Cap ETF (EWZS) iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI) iShares MSCI Germany Small-Cap ETF (EWGS) iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF (SMIN) iShares MSCI Poland Capped ETF (EPOL) KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB) PowerShares Golden Dragon China ETF (PGJ) SPDR S&P China ETF (GXC) VanEck Vectors Brazil Small-Cap ETF (BRF) VanEck Vectors India Small-Cap ETF (SCIF) WisdomTree China Ex-State-Owned Enterprise ETF (CXSE)There have been so many foreign-ETF winners that it’s been tough to pick a loser! All you had to do was see that the dollar’s recent gains couldn’t last after an unprecedented run.Trend No. 3: Fear Is Disappearing (3 Funds)The third big trend is, paradoxically, the one that has scared a lot of people. And that’s because a lot of people aren’t scared.Confused?It’s an old belief that’s the cornerstone of contrarian investing. The idea is simple: bubbles form when everyone gets greedy, no one is fearful, and asset prices get too pricey. The market has definitely moved away from fear. No evidence of that is clearer than the VIX.The what?The VIX, or the CBOE Volatility Index, is a measure of S&P 500 price fluctuations. A higher number represents more uncertainty—that is, more fear. A lower number represents more confidence that a crash is unlikely.The VIX is currently at 9.95, far from 13.75 a year ago, really far from its long-term average of 18.7 and even further from its all-time high of 67, in the midst of the financial crisis.The VIX: A Picture of Tranquility
While a lot of pundits have spent 2017 warning that the VIX is due to rise “any day now,” anyone betting that the opposite would happen has made out like a bandit. Just behind bitcoin, the best performing ETFs of 2017 have been short volatility:Source: ContrarianOutlook.comNever heard of the ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures (SVXY), the BetaPro S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Future Daily Inverse ETF (HVI.TO) or the REX VolMAXX Term Short VIX Weekly Futures Strategy ETF (VMIN)?Don’t feel bad. These are obscure funds usually used for short-term trading, not long-term investing.But that doesn’t mean they haven’t been great holds this year! Of course, what goes down must come up, so the decline in the VIX is unlikely to last. No one knows when it will recover or what will start the rebound, but you can bank on a change in the wind here.Disclosure: none"

 ","The world is changing fast right now in ways that many investors might not easily recognize or want to admit. This could end up being a costly mistake. If you’re not paying attention, you could be letting opportunities pass you by without even realizing it.5 agents of change investors should know aboutWith that in mind, I’ve put together a list of five agents of change that I think investors need to be aware of and possibly factor into their decision-making process.1. Xi JinpingAt China’s 19th National Party Congress, Xi Jinping’s political thought was enshrined into the country’s constitution, an honor that, before now, had been reserved only for Mao Zedong, founder of the People’s Republic of China, and Deng Xiaoping. It was Deng, if you recall, who in 1980 established special economic zones (SEZs) that helped turn China into the economic powerhouse it is today.But back to Xi. His elevation to Chairman Mao-status not only cements his place in the annals of Chinese history but also makes him peerless among other world leaders in terms of political and militaristic might, with the obvious exception of U.S. President Donald J. Trump.But whereas Trump has been criticized by some for setting the U.S. on a more isolationist path—shrinking the size of the State Department, just to name one example—Xi sees China emerging as the de facto global leader by 2050. To get there, his country is spending billions on the “Belt and Road Initiative” and other massive infrastructure projects, opening its doors to foreign investors, reforming state-run enterprises, weeding out corruption, investing heavily in clean energy and public transportation and expanding its middle class. And let’s not forget that the Chinese yuan, also known as the renminbi, was included in the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) basket of reserve currencies in 2015, placing it in the same league as the U.S. dollar, British pound, Japanese yen and euro.During his three-hour speech before the congress, Xi made reference to the “Chinese dream,” adding that the “Chinese people will enjoy greater happiness and well-being, and the Chinese nation will stand taller and firmer in the world.”Xi has his own detractors, of course, who see China’s rise as a threat to established world order. But if his vision is to be realized, it might be prudent to recognize and prepare for it now. China’s economy grew a healthy 6.8% in the third quarter year-over-year, helping it get closer to meeting economists’ target of 6.5% for 2017. And although manufacturing expansion slowed in October, falling from 52.4 in September to 51.6, it was still well above the 50 threshold.Chinese manufacturing expanded at slightly slower pace in OctoberCiting these indicators as well as strong medium and long-term bank lending to nonfinancial corporations, research firm BCA recommended that investors overweight Chinese stocks relative to the emerging market aggregate. 2. PolandBesides China, another region I’m keeping my eye on is Poland. Already one of the fastest growing economies in Europe, the country was just upgraded from the “advanced emerging” category to “developed” by FTSE Russell, effective September 2018. This will place Poland in the same company as, among others, the U.S., U.K., Japan, Germany, Singapore and South Korea, the last country to have joined the club of top-ranking economies. Poland is the first Central and Eastern European (CEE) country to receive “developed” status.Among the decisive factors behind the upgrade were the country’s advanced infrastructure, secure trading and a high gross national income (GNI) per capita. The World Bank expects Poland’s economic growth in 2017 to reach 4%, up significantly from 2.7% in 2016, on the back of a strong labor market, improved consumption and the child benefit program Family 500+.Poland one of the fastest growing economies in the Euro areaEconomists aren’t the only ones noticing the improvement. Young Polish expats who had formerly sought work in the U.K. and elsewhere are now returning home in large numbers to participate in the booming economy, according to the Financial Times. Banks and other companies, including JPMorgan Chase  and Goldman Sachs, are similarly considering opening branches in Poland and hiring local talent.This represents quite an about-face for a country that, as recently as 1990, was languishing under communist rule.One of U.S. Global’s analysts, Joanna Sawicka, has seen the dramatic transformation firsthand. A native of Bialystok, Poland, Joanna has vivid memories of waiting in line for hours just to buy food and school supplies. After returning to the U.S. from a visit to her hometown in 2015, though, she was singing its praises:“I saw big changes. There’s now a small business on every street corner. A lot of my old friends own businesses now. Poland is the largest beneficiary of European Union funds, and people are clearly taking advantage of having more money and better opportunities.” 3. BitcoinOne of the most influential agents of change right now is bitcoin, and indeed the entire digital currency market. Cryptocurrencies are challenging underlying notions of the global monetary framework, upending the way many companies raise funds and disrupting the investment world.All this from an asset class nobody even knew about 10 years ago.For the first time, bitcoin traded above $7,000 a coin, bringing its 2017 gains to around 650%. Some are calling this a bubble, but I recently shared with you a chart that shows that, when placed on a logarithmic scale, bitcoin doesn’t appear to have found its peak yet.Bitcoin broke above $7,000Bitcoin can no longer be called a curiosity or niche investment. Large brokerage firms and financial institutions, including Fidelity and USAA, now allow clients to use their websites to check their holdings of bitcoin and other digital currencies alongside their more traditional assets. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) announced it will be offering a bitcoin futures contract by the end of the year, giving investors an easier way to trade cryptos.Following the announcement, Coinbase, a leading digital currency broker, saw a record number of people opening new accounts on its platform. Within a single 24-hour period, as many as 100,000 new users opened accounts, helping to double the number of Coinbase clients since the beginning of the year.This explosion in interest hasn’t come without consequences in other markets, however. The U.S. Mint reported that this year’s sales of American Eagles, the popular gold coins, have fallen to their lowest level since 2007, presumably as investors who otherwise would have bought bullion have instead put money in bitcoin as a store of value.4. U.S. Tax ReformIt’s been at least a generation at least since the U.S. has had meaningful tax reform. That might be about to change, though, as Congress and the president unveiled their plans to overhaul the tax code and deliver the “biggest tax cut in U.S. history,” according to Trump.If passed and signed, the plan would consolidate the number of income brackets, currently at seven, down to only four, while also eliminating a number of tax credits and exemptions, including the alternative minimum tax (AMT). The fourth bracket, with a rate of 39.6 percent for the nation’s top earners, was added at the last minute to address concerns the new code would blow up the deficit. Many savers are no doubt relieved to learn that 401(K)s will be left alone, ending rumors that annual contribution caps would be lowered.As for corporate taxes, the plan is to slash them from 35 percent—the highest among any country in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)—to a much more competitive 20 percent. This change would be both immediate and permanent.Right now, as much as $2.5 trillion or more in cash is estimated to be held overseas by multinational corporations to avoid having to pay the steep rate. Lowering it would allow these firms to bring profits home and reinvest them in workers, new equipment and more. It would also encourage American companies to relocate operations back to the U.S., as we saw with semiconductor manufacturer Broadcom (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:AVGO).After failing to repeal and replace Obamacare, both Congress and the president need this win if they expect voters to give them another term.5. Jerome PowellFor the final agent of change, I’m picking someone whom some readers might not agree reflects real change. Jerome “Jay” Powell, the person Trump has tapped to replace Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen—assuming he gets Senate confirmation—is being described as someone who’ll mostly hold to the status quo established by his two immediate predecessors, Yellen and Ben Bernanke. Powell appears to be dovish and supportive of the cautious interest rate hikes we’ve seen during Yellen’s tenure, which will come to an end in February 2018.Federal reserve chair Janet Yellens tenureThere’s one huge difference, however—one that likely convinced Trump a change was needed, despite his previous acclaim for Yellen’s handling of the job. Whereas Yellen has expressed support for the raft of financial regulations that were introduced in the wake of the financial crisis, Powell generally seems to be in favor of deregulation, in line with Trump’s own agenda. On numerous occasions I’ve written that our industry needs more streamlined rules and laws, so I see this as very constructive. Although Powell, as head of the Fed, won’t have any policymaking authority to alter or reverse such rules, at least he’ll serve as an ideological ally of Trump’s.On top of all this, Powell’s appointment will set new precedent. He’ll be the first Fed chair in decades not to hold an advanced degree in economics—he’s a former investment banker with the Carlyle Group—and he’ll also be the first in nearly as many years to replace someone before the end of their full 14 years.In any case, I speak for everyone at U.S. Global by wishing Powell the best, once confirmed, and hope his policies can help the U.S. economy continue moving in the right direction.All opinions expressed and data provided are subject to change without notice.

this blockchain receipt, I can prove to the world I gave you this coin. 
It's pretty ...","Editors' Pick|Dec 12, 2017,06:02pm EST","Hackers/Founders' Jonathan Nelson recently launched a new fund called Hack on the blockchain: ""I... [+] have 99 problems. Finding great tech companies is not one of them.""","Jonathan Nelson has had an odd career path that’s allowed him to see things in a different way: A former emergency room nurse, he founded Hackers/Founders in 2008 to gather engineers and founders together for drinks. The movement grew, and today some 300,000 people have attended Hackers/Founders events in 47 countries and 55 companies have participated in its accelerator program. Now Nelson, who is 44 and is a member of the SEC Advisory Committee on Small and Emerging Companies, has launched Hack, a venture-capital fund on the blockchain that will use digital share certificates to get funding to early-stage startups. It’s a high-risk investment idea  – in the U.S. only wealthy accredited investors will be permitted to put their money in – but it’s an intriguing way to get seed funding to startups. Nelson’s hope is to invest in 30 companies that already have products and at least $100,000 in annual revenue for every $10 million raised. In an interview that has been edited and condensed, he spoke about why he thinks venture capital fails startups and how Hack can help.Amy Feldman: Tell me a bit about your career path.Jonathan Nelson: I am a strange child. Mom and dad were missionaries so I was the only white kid at the end of a dirt road in rural Honduras. After we moved to the States, I was planning on becoming a missionary, but my dad wanted us to get a trade. I went to nursing school, and worked as an ER and trauma nurse in Chicago, New England, Los Angeles and Fresno. I loved computer programming, and eventually I went back to school for software engineering and ended up in Silicon Valley. Three nights a week I managed 700 people on the night shift at a hospital, and on my four nights off I programmed and worked on my startup project. Then I started this meetup group called Hackers and Founders. I’ve had a lot of conversations with founders about what sucks at their companies.Feldman: What did you learn about the problems of getting capital to startups?Nelson: The only way you make money investing in startups is if the company gets sold or there is an IPO. There’s a liquidity problem. There isn’t an easy way for an investor to sell their stock to someone else. So I am convinced that how we are doing this is broken. If you have a tech company in Peoria, no one is going to buy stock in your company, and it’s worse yet if you are in Buenos Aires, Bangladesh or Nigeria. So earlier this year, I was working on what it would look like to take a venture fund public on the Nasdaq.Feldman: So you looked into doing a ’40 Act mutual fund?Nelson: Yeah, a ’40 Act fund that essentially invests in startups. To do what I wanted to do, you’ve got to do a bunch of backflips, and it was going to cost me $5 million to get it off the ground and $1 million a year in maintenance. I was so convinced we needed it that I was going to do it. Then some friends said, “Jonathan, I think you’re overthinking it. You need to look at what’s happening in this blockchain space.”Feldman: What did you then have to do to set up Hack?Nelson: Building this thing has cost me about $200,000 in software development and marketing. I am launching it, and I will report with audited valuations as if it were a public fund on the Nasdaq. I can put it on the blockchain so that it is guaranteed I haven’t tampered with it.Feldman: How will that actually work?Nelson: Blockchain is essentially a receipt, and it’s a receipt that I can print but cannot erase and cannot cut or tear because it is encrypted and if I try to do that the entire thing breaks and it is obvious it is broken. So if I give you this little bit of code, this bitcoin thing, that goes on this blockchain receipt, I can prove to the world I gave you this coin. It’s pretty straightforward for me to say this is a stock and it represents ownership in this group of companies that I am going to build, and people can buy or sell these digital blockchain certificates built on top of this ethereum receipt. The advantage of ethereum is that I can put in additional rules. So, for example, I can have rules like, “If Jonathan Nelson tries to sell this stock certificate before this date he can’t.” It will be computational impossible for me to sell coins out of my wallet for four years. The compliance, enforcement and regulation get written into the computer code.Feldman: Does the SEC regulate this?Nelson: Yes. This is a security. If I sold this to unaccredited investors in the United States, I would be selling an unregistered security and that would be illegal. So I am not. All the investors in the U.S. are accredited.Feldman: And globally?Nelson: I can offer a digital stock certificate for sale on a website and people can buy it using digital money. There are probably 30 or 40 coin exchanges where people buy and sell these things all the time. So liquidity is built into this thing. I am talking with four exchanges now. When the computer program says we are done with our initial coin offering, then people can buy and trade our digital stock certificate online.Feldman: What’s the advantage for a company to raise money this way versus doing its own initial coin offering?Nelson: This way I can invest in a company but I don’t have to force my company to get acquired or to IPO. If I build a portfolio of 100 companies that are growing revenues 50% year over year, the value of my portfolio should grow 50% year over year. My job is to find companies that could grow and help them grow quickly.Feldman: How do you do that?Nelson: I have 99 problems. Finding great tech companies is not one of them. We are one of the biggest organizations of tech entrepreneurs. These are my friends.Feldman: What kind of companies do you want?Nelson: We will score the company on how likely it is to do $250,000 revenue or raise $500,000. If you’re a photo-sharing app, I’m not going to be interested. But if you are actually selling things, or helping other businesses sell things, then I am. That’s easier than trying to figure out which company gets acquired by Google in five years or which company is going to be the next Uber.Feldman: So these are all super-early-stage companies?Nelson: That’s the low bar. Our largest company, Tripping.com, did over $500 million in gross bookings last year. I have a number of companies moving to Silicon Valley from overseas doing more than $1 million in revenue, and they are more than happy to give up a few percent of their company for the help.Feldman: How many companies do you expect to have in this new portfolio?Nelson: I am hoping for 30 for every $10 million raise. The weird thing about this type of fundraising is I don’t know how much we will raise.Feldman: Do you have a goal in mind?Nelson: I’d be really happy if we do $10 million. If it goes viral, I can probably put $20 million to work in my existing portfolio companies and not overwhelm them. My plan is that this will be one of a series of funds, and as we get closer to finishing this fund we will start raising for the next one.Feldman: Do you have businesses that are interested in raising money this way?Nelson: I have four lined up already, including the largest email and text messaging company in Latin America called Doppler. They’ll do $2 million in revenue, and they’ve never raised outside money.Feldman: Do you make all of the investment decisions yourself?Nelson: Mak Gutierrez, our director in Mexico, and I have ultimate yea/nay say on our founders for our respective programs. We try to be very process- and score-driven to remove bias.Feldman: Is there a minimum investment?Nelson: The minimum is $1. I want 10,000 people retweeting the success of my companies.Feldman: There’s been a lot of talk of a bitcoin bubble. What happens if all these cryptocurrencies tank?Nelson: Oh sure. People should not be investing anything they cannot lose. They should not invest more than 1% or 2% of their net worth in these things. There is a risk of failure. I am trying to mitigate that by saying I am going for as much diversity as possible, and I want all these companies to have revenue. The chance of 30 or 300 companies going to zero is relatively small. The price of bitcoin has been skyrocketing, and its market cap is around $200 billion, but only 1% of bitcoin has been diversified into ICOs this year. This is a very young, very immature market. Is it a bubble? Is it the birth of a trillion-dollar industry? I don’t care. I’m using the digital stock certificates for real assets.Feldman: The SEC recently brought a fraud case against an ICO.Nelson: It’s ugly, and it’s messy, and yes, there’s going to be some fraudsters and scammers, and let’s arrest the fraudsters and scammers. But these Eastern European countries where these ICOs are coming from have brilliant engineers who have been capital-starved. This is capital that is coming from people who got rich buying bitcoin and ethereum.Feldman: Is your focus more on companies outside the U.S. than here?Nelson: I am much more excited about what is happening with startups in emerging markets than in Silicon Valley. There is a huge amount of innovation there, and these countries don’t have the financial infrastructure.Feldman: Have you invested personally?Nelson: I am contributing $1 million of my own stock into the fund.Feldman: Does that represent a big piece of your personal portfolio?Nelson: Yeah, everything that I own is wrapped up in my startup portfolio. The million bucks are probably 5% of my net worth, give or take.Feldman: That means you’re worth $20 million?Nelson: Yeah, my personal portfolio on paper is probably worth $20 million. A big chunk of that is the parent company, Hackers and Founders. It’s high risk, but it is what I believe in. I can only join the middle class in Silicon Valley and buy a house if this really works.Feldman: You might be the only former nurse helping tech startups raise money.Nelson: Most of my time is spent helping sick and hurting startups. My favorite questions to ask entrepreneurs are, “What hurts?” and “How can I help?” I spent 20 years walking into patients’ rooms asking what hurts. It is all strangely familiar to me. I wouldn’t be here had I not been a preacher’s kid who became a nurse and was obsessed with solving what sucks for my friends, which is raising money for startups."

Technological ""Tipping Point"". This market could therefore be crucial in ...","Sep 29, 2017,12:30pm EDT","A joint venture between Swiss-based blockchain content distribution platform DECENT and Venaco Group, an independent ""best-in-class"" SAP advisory, innovation and implementation services firm, has revealed the formation of a blockchain platform and marketplace for “businesses of all sizes,” called SophiaTX. The business behind the venture plans to launch an initial coin offering (ICO) in the next few months.","SophiaTX is a project led by Equidato Technologies AG, a Swiss based joint stock company, which has been formed for the venture by veterans of ""best-in-class"" SAP integration experience.The joint venture is touted as making them the “first open source platform” ever to primarily integrate blockchain technology with SAP, allowing both users and integrators to use blockchain.Venaco Group, headquartered in Lupfig, Switzerland, leverages its delivery centers in Kuala Lumpur and Bratislava, Slovakia, the latter where DECENT’s co-founders, Matej Michalko and Matej Boda, hail from.It is claimed by Venaco that it has “proven capabilities” for complex SAP programs in variety of assignments and disciplines - including global transformations and roll-outs, lean implementations, recovery and turnaround situations, mergers, restructurings, carve-outs, lean operations (i.e. management practices to reduce waste, improve cycle times, efficiency, etc.) and support.Integrating SAP and blockchain offers enormous potential for both users and the global economy, it is claimed by the protagonists behind the venture.Indeed, according to Accenture around 90% of the major banks in North America and Europe are exploring blockchain technology. And, given the proliferation of smart devices creating greater and greater digital transactions from more sources, traditional transaction processing systems cannot keep up. Some have posited that blockchain is nothing less than the ""second-generation"" of the Internet and will impact and change every institution.Around 87% of global businesses and 98% of the top 100 most valued brands in the world use SAP software, which touches some $16 trillion of consumer purchases and almost three-quarters (74%) of transaction revenue worldwide every year.Stock market of cryptocurrency and bitcoin concept. (Image: Shutterstock).Technological ""Tipping Point""This market could therefore be crucial in blockchain achieving - and possibly exceeding - published estimates that it will enable 10% of global gross domestic product (GDP) to be stored on stored on blockchain technology by 2027 according to the World Economic Forum.In its report titled ""Deep Shift Technology Tipping Points and Societal Impact"" (Sept. 2015, see page 24), it was stated that 58% of respondents expected the “tipping point” to have occurred by 2025. This finding followed a survey by the Global Agenda Council on the Future of Software & Society of over 800 executives and experts from the information and communications technology sector. Of course that report might seem like eons ago given technological progress since.In terms of the SophiaTX platform it can considered as three components, namely as follows:(1) It consists of a blockchain built on DECENT’s proprietary blockchain technology, specifically developed and enabled to power a B2B transaction engine; (2) A development platform with integration APIs to SAP and other enterprise applications; and, (3) A marketplace for a global community of experts, consultants, and developers to buy and sell apps. It is open source, and tailored to allow traditional enterprise applications to be extended to more robust, collaborative and decentralized blockchain-enabled business models.Details on DECENT’s proprietary blockchain technology mentioned above in point 1 to power a B2B transaction engine are currently confidential, but are to be explained in a white paper due to be published this October.Jaroslav Kacina, CEO of SophiaTX and Equidato Technologies AG based in Zurich, commenting said: “Integrating blockchain with SAP allows businesses to deliver efficiencies, better collaborate along the value chain and even shape their business models. Integrating blockchain with SAP and other business applications is inevitably the next frontier for blockchain and for business applications.”SophiaTX Blockchain & PlatformIt is understood that earlier this year, extensive studies to detail and commercially assess a number of non-financial use cases for the technology around SophiaTX were undertaken. Following that process, several of the use cases and transactions were prototyped to determine the architecture and required business features for SophiaTX.“Prior to the ICO, we are also expecting to be able to release a small demo,” says Kacina, who worked previously at McKinsey. “However, the platform will require further development and testing, and we plan to deliver ‘live’ SophiaTX blockchain, along with an initial set of applications and connectivity tools, by the end of Q2 2018.""Initial Coin OfferingLater this year the business will hold an ICO (initial coin offering), although no precise date has yet been disclosed. Further details on how the proceeds of the fundraising are to be deployed will be published next month in a paper on the project. But I understand that funds raised will be spent on three key areas.Firstly, it will involve developing the blockchain platform and marketplace and building an initial set of STX applications to complete the offering. A spokesman said: “It is likely these initial applications will focus on storage, private key recovery, IOT connectivity and enhanced encryption.”Secondly, sharing knowledge and supporting adoptions. This encompasses developing knowledge and learning sharing initiatives for the global business and IT/SAP community.Legal and regulatory support will be the third key area. This is in terms of supporting the regulatory [framework], mainstream adoption of blockchain technology through participating in and contributing to the wider blockchain technology ecosystem.For its part, DECENT, a blockchain-based digital media designed distribution platform, seeks to bring greater transparency and fairness to the media industry.As a company, with offices besides Geneva in Bratislava and Shanghai as well an R&D Blockchain hub in Yerevan, Armenia, they have assembled a team in software development and architecture together with an extensive community of ambassadors and advisors from across the globe, allows artists to efficiently distribute any form of content online without having to wait for payment or pay hefty fees.Their purpose-developed cryptocurrency (DCT) aims to revolutionize data distribution, saving content producers money and giving them more control without compromising on security.Illustrating DECENT endeavours since, ATMChain, a third-party application and open platform ecosystem focused on the media advertising sector in China and based on the blockchain network being developed on the DECENT Protocol, initiated an ICO in August 2017. This project had secured around 7,000 intelligent media screens all over Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing and Hangzhou to display advertisements.DECENT’s own ICO was initiate back in September 2016, which raised 5,881 bitcoin (BTC) and equivalent of $4.2 million at the time. Those funds were earmarked to finance product development costs, marketing, organizational and legal expenses needed to prepare for the launch of DECENT Network late this June."

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which are often used to buy into ICOs.","Dec 18, 2017,11:29pm EST",Photographer: Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg,"Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), exploded onto the scene in 2017, going from a relatively unknown fundraising method used in the blockchain community, to raising over $4 billion YTD. ICOs have allowed blockchain startups to crowdfund their projects through the blockchain by issuing digital tokens, which the user can then trade, spend, and use within the blockchain platform. One main difference between an IPO and an ICO is that token holders do not own any equity in the company that they’ve invested in, therefore the company has no real obligation to the investor to deliver on their promises.The Early DaysUp until this year, ICO companies that raised over a few million dollars were a rarity. Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency at present, raised $18 million in 2015 due to its innovative smart contracts. This was topped later by the DAO in 2016, which raised $150 million in a matter of minutes, and was then later stolen and thousands of people lost their money.Related: A State-Issued Coin Could Unleash Untapped Potential For CryptocurrenciesTwo Geeks And A WhitepaperSince the days of these early ICOs, the concept has taken off in 2017. According to the ICO rating website, ICOdata,  there has been nearly $5 billion in ICO funding since the beginning of the year. Most this funding came between May and October, with November being the most active month with over $900 million in funding.ICO funds raised in 2017ICOs are unique because they can crowdfund their fundraising campaigns with little or no regulatory oversight, and without the need for an MVP (minimum viable product), client base, or any semblance of financial statements or proof of an actual company existing. This attracted all kinds of scrupulous characters who were drawn to the anonymity and perceived ease of raising funds. Not all ICO founders have poor intentions, but this perceived ease of raising capital has led to the trend of people on the internet creating a blockchain idea in order to get rich quick. This has also been dubbed as “two geeks and a whitepaper,” trying to get rich off a hot internet trend, who gave little or no business background, with no regulatory oversight to stop them.The Rise of Satire TokensDue to the incredibly low barriers to entry to raising significant amounts of funds, there has been an influx of both downright scam ICO projects, as well as satirical projects. One of the most famous satirical projects was the Useless Ethereum Token (UET). It was billed as the first 100% honest ICO project, which claimed, “You’re going to give some random person on the internet money, and they’re going to take it and go buy stuff with it. Seriously don’t buy these tokens.” UET was totally upfront, about not having any product or service, and people were still willing to send money. In fact, they raised 310 Ethereum tokens (ETH), which equates to around $200,000 at today’s ETH price.ICOs Hits Puberty Scams and gags aside, there has been a true maturation process over the course of 2017 in the ICO market. As the amount of funds raised through ICOs skyrocketed, so did the skepticism of investors trying to determine which projects were legitimate, and which were scams. In response, ICO projects had to legitimize themselves. They began recruiting and hiring former Wall Street bankers, experienced lawyers, blockchain developers, and bringing in advisory teams of well-respected industry players.More on Forbes: South Korea Is Not Banning Bitcoin Trade, Financial Regulators ClarifyTake the team from trade.io for example. Trade.io is led by a Wall Street veteran, Jim Preissler, who spent years at UBS in investment banking followed by opening up several successful hedge funds. To add even more experience to the team, trade.io brought in Chinese American billionaire, Chien Lee, who owns NewCity Capital as well as the French football club, OGC Nice.ICO teams are recruiting some of the best and brightest to be part of their projects, and are quite capable of paying out vast sums of tokens to attract said talent. This can be comparable to the first internet companies, who were able to attract talent by offering stock options with tremendous upside.What Does the Future Hold?While the total amount of funds being raised through ICOs has slowed in the end of 2017, this can somewhat be equated to the rise in the price of both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which are often used to buy into ICOs. Additionally, there was an increasing number of companies towards the end of the year, which didn't hit their ""soft caps."" A soft cap is the minimum amount needed to be raised for an ICO to be viable. Otherwise, the funds will be returned.The year 2018 is gearing up to be the year where institutional money begins to move into cryptocurrencies and ICOs at a much quicker pace. With blockchain and cryptos making the mainstream headlines weekly, and new crypto funds springing up left and right, expect to see ICOs continue to gain traction and dominate the landscape for blockchain-based companies trying to raise funds in 2018.Read More: Are ICOs The Key To A Successful Startup Journey?"

blockchain is the underlying technology. In essence, blockchain is ...","Nov 14, 2017,01:00pm EST",Talking about your credit score has never been this exciting.,"Were you one of the 143 million Americans whose information was stolen in the Equifax hack?Statistics would say it's pretty likely.These days, we're turning to technology to renovate all kinds of outdated systems, yet we still entrust our credit information (and all the personal data that comes with it) to a framework developed over a half-century ago. What if there were a solution that not only better secured our data, but also allowed us to save money and build credit more easily in the first place?Enter: Bloom, a groundbreaking answer to an outdated system.Bloom has arrived.“Bloom brings credit scoring to the blockchain,” Bloom Co-Founder Daniel Maren said in an interview with the author. “Bloom’s mission is to build a robust global credit infrastructure [that] reduces fees, increases accessibility to credit, and makes credit scoring fair.”Don’t worry, you don’t need to know the finer points of blockchain to understand how Bloom works. You’ve probably been hearing about Bitcoin and Ethereum throughout 2017; blockchain is the underlying technology. In essence, blockchain is a network where information is distributed among all participating parties, rather than centralized by one (ie. a bank). If you’re interested to understand blockchain at a deeper level, check out these primers. It might feel a bit complicated, but many believe it’s going to revolutionize the infrastructure of the web—and Bloom is one example of how its applications extend beyond digital money.Maybe the best way to grasp what Bloom is doing is to understand the problems it solves.“Bloom is exciting because access to credit is life-changing, but the existing credit system is woefully inadequate for such an important function,” Maren said.Of course, security is the top flaw in the current credit model.“As massive data breaches occur with increasing regularity, we must assume that every Social Security number has been compromised, rendering them useless as secure identifiers,” Maren said. “Borrowers must expose all of their personal information when applying for a loan—the same info an attacker can use to open new lines of credit.”Unfortunately, our avenues to establish credit are extremely limited, and under this system, our information is regularly sent back and forth, opening us up to security risks each time.“In the US, we see a monopoly with FICO—which is checked on 90% of all US loans,” Maren said. “The current system requires that businesses and credit bureaus repeatedly transfer sensitive data between one another, leaving our data vulnerable to unnecessary exposure at every turn. That’s why Bloom is building a credit infrastructure that reduces the system’s dependence on the credit bureaus.”Another vital aspect of blockchain technology is its ability to anonymize data. For any change to occur in the network, a majority of the participating nodes must “agree” that the change is valid, making it exceptionally difficult to hack. Grossly put: a prospective hacker would hypothetically need to gain control of at least 51% of all the computers on the network in order to succeed, rather than a single entity (ie. Equifax). The technology also allows for an unprecedented degree of privacy; the desired information can reach the intended party with dramatically less risk of vulnerability because the underlying data isn’t itself being revealed. The added benefit is that this also means the system costs less, saving money for all involved.“With Bloom, identity fraud is far less rampant since every credit check no longer requires the exposure of sensitive personal data,” Maren said. “By disintermediating middlemen, who are no longer necessary to establish trust, the blockchain cuts out bloat and rent-seeking. By solving for trust without centralization, decentralized organizations are able to thrive at a scale never before possible.”The current credit model also hampers us from using our information internationally.“Credit histories are not portable across countries, forcing individuals to re-establish their credit track records from scratch when they relocate,” Maren said. “Borrowers in markets with less developed financial and regulatory infrastructure struggle to access credit as lenders have limited identity and scoring data to base credit decisions.”In creating a decentralized system, Bloom singlehandedly offers a way to make this information actionable on an international scale. “BloomScore credit scores are global, allowing individuals to carry their scores across countries,” Maren said. “Lenders will be able to extend credit to millions of creditworthy individuals who are currently denied access.”Finally, the current credit system underserves the ones who need it most.“Credit systems rely on historical debt repayment information and therefore cannot easily accommodate users who are new to credit,” Maren said. “This is especially prevalent among minorities, the underbanked, and the youth.”The three parts of the Bloom protocolWith all that said: Bloom is a protocol that consists of three parts: BloomID (identity), BloomIQ (a credit registry), and BloomScore (credit scoring). Bloom also plans to launch BloomCard, the first global credit card open to anybody, including many of those without a bank or credit score. Best of all: every single purchase you make with BloomCard contributes to your BloomScore—which means that those same people can start building credit right away.“Unlike a traditional debit or credit card, purchases on BloomCard contribute to your BloomScore,” Maren said. ""BloomScore measures your purchasing power, frequency of purchases, and payment consistency to build your credit. Rather than having to rely exclusively on centralized credit institutions for capital, BloomCard holders can borrow from users on the blockchain via their BloomScore.”Before you cut that SkyMiles card to pieces; the BloomCard won’t launch until Bloom’s risk assessment and scoring protocol is complete.“Bloom does not intend to become a large-scale credit provider,” Maren said. “We hope the BloomCard will expedite the adoption of the protocol by providing a precedent for future credit providers.”BloomCard: the first global credit card open to anybody.This diligence makes sense coming from a a team that’s been working on blockchain projects together for years.“John, Alain, and Jesse met as roommates while studying at Stanford,” Maren said. “John and Alain began working closely together on crypto projects when they both served as founding research scientists for the Stanford Bitcoin Group. Founded in 2012 by 21.co CEO Balaji S. Srinivasan, the group spent years focused on research for the advancement of blockchain applications.”From there, John and Alain continued to work together, and their initial efforts reveal an early interest in blockchain applications that help streamline financial information.“Following their work at the Stanford Bitcoin Group, John and Alain left Stanford to co-found Cognito in 2013,” Maren said. “Originally called BlockScore, the company launched with the vision to solve global compliance issues with cryptocurrency. Cognito now powers compliance and KYC services for the majority of US-based crypto exchanges.”For those who want to benefit by getting involved early to foster the ecosystem, Bloom is launching its token sale for BloomTokens (BLT) on Nov. 30. If you’ve been hearing about ICOs, or Initial Coin Offerings, a token sale is essentially the same thing, but the commodity being distributed is a token rather than a coin (the differences are subtle—these articles help explain it).BloomToken: In Bloom We Trust“Participants in the token sale will be the first people allowed on the Bloom network and get to seed the network by inviting their friends using the Bloom token,” Maren said. “Token holders are also able to use their tokens to vote on questions posed by the Bloom team regarding the future of the protocol.”Because Bloom is by nature a network built on social interaction, getting involved now positions early adopters to benefit from contributing to the growth of the Bloom network, including voting.“Token holders are also able to participate in and get rewarded for accrediting network participants by staking them on the network,” Maren said. “The protocol will soon support new lenders on our infrastructure, both traditional ones as well as crypto and digital asset lenders.” To learn more about Bloom, visit the official site here and read the white paper here. Further information on the token sale can be found here.Editor’s Note: Neither the author nor Forbes endorses participation in any token sale or cryptocurrency investment, all of which have significant inherent risk.

Goldman Sachs considering trading Bitcoin. Celebs launching tokens. Fidelity mining cryptocurrencies. Even North Korea mining them. Crypto is a silly circus with serious consequences. But amid the hoopla about prices and bubbles and celebs, a group of technologists, investors, lawyers, entrepreneurs and dreamers are working on bringing about societal revolutions through blockchains. They’re all convinced it will transform our lives — but how? Twenty-five crypto luminaries shared their thoughts via email. They are reprinted here lightly edited.Kathryn Haun, board member, CoinbaseKathryn Haun, ex-federal prosecutor & digital currency coordinator, U.S. Department of Justice; Coinbase board memberWhat cell phones did to pay phones, cryptocurrencies will do to ATMs and bank branches. As cryptocurrencies scale, people will use them for payments because of lower fees, less friction, and greater privacy.Financial institutions that have historically provided trust will no longer be necessary to complete many transactions. This is already happening where people have no access to traditional financial institutions. At the same time, blockchains and decentralized networks promise greater security and accountability. One day identity and other records that can now be easily stolen will be put on distributed ledgers. It’s now cheaper and faster to Fed Ex a box of cash than to send an international wire. Cryptocurrencies are poised to change that calculus.Erik Voorhees, CEO of ShapeshiftErik Voorhees, CEO of ShapeshiftThe original blockchain application, cryptocurrency (such as Bitcoin), remains the most exciting and consequential. Cryptocurrencies will outcompete and displace government currencies. Centrally planned national monies will fade away, perhaps slowly like castles or all at once like slavery.Cryptocurrency moves anywhere, instantly, at near-zero cost, and natively digital money will become fundamental to a digital, borderless internet-based society.Governments will lose the ability to conjure money out of thin air. Budgets will derive purely from taxation and borrowing. Inflation will disappear. Prices will no longer rise each year. Bread will be no more expensive to a son than a father. Humans will again build upon an honest, market-based financial system, having escaped fiat currency debasement, the most egregious financial scam of all time.Jamie Smith, global chief communications officer at Bitfury and CEO of the Global Blockchain... [+] Business CouncilJamie Smith, global chief communications officer of Bitfury and CEO of the Global Blockchain Business CouncilThanks to blockchain technology we will begin to live in the world we deserve, where governments work better for the people.A world where our contracts cannot be altered, where the electronic transfer of our records and the tracking of our goods are fast, inexpensive and simple. A world where cybersecurity is not just a hope – but a reality. And most importantly, thanks to blockchain technology, we will be able to vote wherever we want, whenever we want, from the palm of our hands from our phones – and our voices, will be counted.Naval Ravikant, Co-founder of AngelList, Partner at Meta Stable CapitalNaval Ravikant, cofounder of AngelList, partner at MetaStable CapitalHumans are the winning species because we network -- nations, corporations, and money are networks. Networks are governed by leaders, elites, corporations, or crowds. Power makes them kings, aristocracies, monopolies, and mobs.Blockchains allow the people to operate the network, merit based. The people govern, provide resources, get paid in coins. They create electronic gold, currency, financial contracts, without rulers. Internet protocols to allocate bandwidth, computing, and storage. Self-organizing markets for power, water, Internet, and autonomous cars. Social networks and digital matchmakers without tech monopolies. Bulletproof electronic ballot boxes.Wherever a ruler is exploiting a digital network, blockchains will disrupt.Elizabeth Stark, CEO & cofounder of Lightning LabsElizabeth Stark, CEO & cofounder of Lightning LabsIt's easy to send someone a photo or animated gif, but why can't you embed value in an app? In the future waiting three days to Venmo someone funds or using a paper check will feel like ancient history. You'll send and receive money across devices and within various applications instantly.You'll be able to set specific conditions, such as paying your favorite band 5 cents every time you listen to their song, automatically, on any device. And you'll be able to interact with machines that pay other machines, like a self-driving car paying to charge itself or replace a part.Brian Armstrong, cofounder and CEO of CoinbaseBrian Armstrong, Coinbase cofounder and CEOPeople will earn income in digital currency via activities online, such as upvotes on Reddit, likes on YouTube, or answering questions on Quora.In the developing world, people will control more of their wealth in digital money and earn/spend it their mobile phones, connecting to the global economy. The developed world will hold it as an investment but increasingly use it for money on the internet as more blockchain-based apps are developed. In three to five years, a growing body of people will earn most of all of their income online in crypto, and this will bleed into the physical world — meaning they’ll want to go 100% crypto, prompting merchants in brick and mortar to cater to them.Balaji Srinivasan, 21.co CEO (Steve Jennings/Getty Images for TechCrunch)Balaji Srinivasan, 21.co CEOThe internet meant programmable information; blockchains mean programmable scarcity. The internet unified previously disparate forms of information (photos, music, movies, maps, books, news, telephony, mail).It added informational aspects to things we didn't think were informational in 1990 (your followers, likes, and steps). Information became ubiquitous, and everything became searchable, sortable, and social. In the same way, blockchains will unify previously disparate forms of scarcity (cash, currencies, commodities, stocks, bonds) and add financial aspects to things we previously didn't think of as financial. You'll get a spot price for the cost of storing 1MB on 1,000 remote hard drives, or the cost of one minute of time from 10,000 JavaScript programmers worldwide. Everything will become fairly priced, consensually transactional snd freely tradable.Fred Ehrsam, cofounder of CoinbaseFred Ehrsam, cofounder of CoinbaseThere are hundreds of specialized AI clones of you. A few write emails for you, some attend meetings as you, and others decides what clothes to order for you. To spin a new clone up, just feed its smart contract with digital currency and watch it buy all the resources it needs to accomplish your tasks.Joey Krug, cofounder of Augur and co-chief investment officer of Pantera CapitalJoey Krug, cofounder of Augur and co-chief investment officer of Pantera CapitalApps and services serving as centralized middlemen in two-sided marketplaces will no longer be operated by traditional companies. Instead, they'll be operated by peer-to-peer networks that effectively serve as coops.Why pay Airbnb, Mechanical Turk, Betfair, etc., 10-30% in fees when you can use a P2P application charging the bare minimum (around 1%) in fees? Blockchain technology enables cost savings, more efficient markets (and thus economies as a whole), and limits the role of middleman and counterparty risk. Users will benefit from cheaper fees for goods and services but not know it’s powered by blockchain tech. Companies like Apple will survive, but rent-seeking platforms milking users for fees, watch out, software is coming for you!Jalak Jobanputra, founder of Future Perfect VenturesJalak Jobanputra, founder of Future Perfect VenturesAll seven billion people have digital identities they control. Data we now hand over to banks, Facebook and insurance companies will reside in secure vaults and we’ll mete pieces of it out. Data will become currency. We’ll transact with disparate data – akin to a “digital barter” system.Your medical history, medications, and surgeries will be discrete pieces of data on a blockchain. You’ll authenticate and send data to, say, a doctor, a research study, or a relative without fears of being hacked. You’ll create an immutable record of your home’s data on a blockchain – repairs, chain of ownership, history of electricity – for potential buyers, enabling you to better negotiate a sale. Blockchains will give rise to billions of efficient micro-marketplaces. We will securitize our tangible and intangible assets and move on to a world of radical transparency and opportunity: Capitalism 2.0.Jake Brukhman, managing partner of CoinFundJake Brukhman, managing partner of CoinFundOver the last 20 years companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon have connected people globally and set humanity up for exponential growth. But the downsides of this efficiency are data silos, monopolization and proprietary control of networks by private interests.Decentralization technology is returning ownership over data and value creation back to individuals. It prepares us for a future where our technology providers are not private companies. They are services that live on the internet, give users self-sovereignty over their data, fairly compensate content creators for their efforts, are agnostic of the content that flows through them, community-owned and governed, and built exclusively for users.Sandra Ro, former head of digitization at CMESandra Ro, former head of digitization at CMEBlockchains create a world where organizations and corporations are decentralized to enable a transparent and fairer society. Blockchain challenges the notion of ownership and control by a few institutions.Individual power to control personal data and wealth will increase, while government influence will diminish. Coupled with internet and smart phones, blockchain infrastructure will enable greater democratization of financial access as well as increase efficiencies across many industries. Individuals will decide what has value. The most significant positive impact will be felt by those most vulnerable, excluded, and forgotten today.William Mougayar, investor/advisor and author, The Business BlockchainWilliam Mougayar, investor/advisor and author, The Business BlockchainBanks will no longer be our primary financial destinations. Earning cryptocurrency will be the smart way of earning money via a novel variety of work that might be as passive as sharing our data, brain cycles, time or influence.Every asset will be on the blockchain, allowing anyone from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe to create their own wealth in a world where nation-state jurisdictions are a thing of the past, upended by blockchain-governed and autonomously-run decentralized institutions. As you watch the future of money, work, society, software, government, and business, you will unearth a common fiber: the blockchain, that blockbuster mega-trend for the next quarter century.Kathleen Breitman, cofounder of TezosKathleen Breitman, Tezos cofounderDecentralized blockchains enable global coordination. Parties around the world enter into agreements which can be arbitrated and enforced at very low cost. When trade barriers open, globalization lifts billions out of poverty.Cryptographic ledgers open new barriers by lowering coordination costs, ushering in an era of prosperity.Chris Burniske, partner at Placeholder CapitalChris Burniske, partner at Placeholder CapitalThe native business model of the most successful Web companies involves harvesting data from users, and then charging others for access to that data, or providing a proprietary service based on that proprietary data.Cryptoassets and their underlying protocols, on the other hand, create shared data layers from which all users can contribute, access, and benefit. Standardization upon an open data layer will collapse the cost of innovation, opening up an entirely new set of markets and services, which will empower the end user and neuter the business models of existing tech incumbents like Google and Facebook. It is the innovator’s dilemma come to today’s tech titans.Joe Lubin, cofounder of Ethereum, founder of ConsenSysJoe Lubin, cofounder of Ethereum, founder of ConsenSysThe core value proposition of Ethereum's decentralized application platform is, along with complementary decentralizing technologies (e.g. for storage, bandwidth and high throughput computation), to create a new substrate for next-generation economic, social and political systems.Financial, governance, and other systems are being redesigned according to the principle of decentralization.One such system is identity. Currently, over two billion people do not have access to a government-issued identity. Those of us that do are at the mercy of identity providers who control and use our information for their profit and power. But Ethereum allows for identities that individuals control. For the first time in history, we can have a global, democratized identity system.Meltem Demirors, Digital Currency Group's director of developmentMeltem Demirors, Digital Currency Group's director of developmentDigital currencies represent sociotechnical systems – values and principles expressed in code, in the way the blockchain protocol is designed.This provides humanity an opportunity to create a new economic, political, and social systems – systems that are more transparent, more resilient, and more empowering to the individual. For centuries, our identity has been defined by our affiliation with a nation state, and our existence by the rules of that nation state. This technology will usher in new models for economies and marketplaces, governance, identity, and more. While we’re still in the very early stages, each experiment teaches us something new and valuable about the social, behavioral, and technical design criteria for these new systems.Will Warren, cofounder and CEO of 0xWill Warren, cofounder and CEO of 0xWe are observing the early stages of a technological renaissance. Today, blockchains are rewiring the global financial system to be more efficient, open and resistant to government intermediation.In the future, blockchains will fundamentally change the way humans organize, govern and identify themselves. By giving individuals the ability to opt-out of any particular economic system that they might have inherited, power will shift from the state to the governed. The geopolitical consequences will be jarring.Demian Brener, cofounder and CEO of Zeppelin SolutionsDemian Brener, cofounder and CEO of Zeppelin SolutionsBlockchains have laid the foundation for a new, open and global economy. Unlike current economies and networks owned and managed by centralized authorities, this new economy is built on a set of open protocols and standards.Businesses and individuals will make use of these protocols — based on crypto assets -- to buy and sell digital commodities in global markets (e.g. storage, processing power). Furthermore, these crypto assets will act as a mechanism for groups to more effectively coordinate and earn from the value they co-create around shared goals. What the internet did to communications, blockchains will do to economic interactions.Primavera De Filippi, research fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet & SocietyPrimavera De Filippi, researcher at CERSA/CNRS and faculty associate at Berkman-Klein Center/HarvardAs a new platform for distributed collaboration, blockchain technology can help society move from the paradigm of competition to that of cooperation.Most organizations today are defined by strict organizational boundaries, incorporating a variety of functions that already exist elsewhere -- for instance, finance, marketing, IT, etc. In the near future, new organizational structures may emerge, consisting of a network of functional elements interacting with one another in an open and distributed way. Instead of competing at the level of the organization, competition can be done at the edges, at the level of the functional elements focusing, almost exclusively, on their core competencies.Brian Lio, CEO of Smith + CrownBrian Lio, founder and CEO of Smith + CrownAs we begin to realize the potential of blockchain technology, the first effects will be behind the scenes.They will manifest themselves primarilyas additional options to control the services and systems that are already part of our lives:secure, frictionless and private payments; control and management of our digitalidentitiesand reputations; a staggering array of new financial products; powerful tools for creating, managing and governing organizations of every size and type.One experience,service and app at a time, we'll gain the ability to control our information and money, secure our actions, and organize ourselves in ways that have never before been possible.Adam Ludwin, cofounder and CEO of ChainAdam Ludwin, cofounder and CEO of ChainCryptocurrencies enable decentralized, peer-to-peer versions of services that have previously required a central party, like payments (Bitcoin vs. Visa), file storage (Filecoin vs. Dropbox), and computing (Ethereum vs. AWS).These decentralized models sacrifice the benefits of centralization – namely scalability, efficiency, and simplicity – but provide users with censorship resistance. This is only a good trade-off for a small number of people today, but that could change if the technology, or the world around us, evolve in unexpected ways.Joseph Poon, coauthor of the Lightning Network and PlasmaJoseph Poon, coauthor of the Lightning Network and PlasmaHumanity has always entrusted authorities to build companies and civilizations, else life is ""nasty, brutish, and short."" In the interest of building good works, we needed accountability of authority -- hence open Social Contracts in all aspects of society.The blockchain is about resolving the social contract dialectic away from the Principal-Agent Problem by making all principals be able to efficiently and economically also be agents. Though the blockchain will produce problems as well, I worry that a counterfactual future without the blockchain could be incredibly dark. I hope blockchains will enable humanity to be collectively more giving, loving, and actualized.Zooko Wilcox, founder and CEO of ZcashZooko Wilcox, founder and CEO of ZcashWhen historians look back on this time, they will talk about the networks being built today as the foundations of the resulting global economic evolution. The peace and prosperity gained from breaking down the barriers to economic inclusion will open up infinite opportunities.Already, these new financial tools offer individuals and businesses around the world the ability to interact seamlessly across borders, resisting censorship and introducing new markets. From the family in Venezuela devastated by the country's hyperinflation policies to New Hampshire's Bardo Farm serving their community with sustainable meat and vegetables, cryptocurrency is an idea who time has come.Update October 5, 2017, 5:48pm EST: This article initially misstated the title of Naval Ravikant.

People would soon use their mobile phones to order non-perishables like toothpaste and toilet paper from Amazon and buy their humanely raised lamb chops and locally foraged ramps from Farmigo.Launched in 2009 and backed by $26 million in venture capital, Brooklyn-based Farmigo built a software platform where shoppers could place orders with local farms. Farmigo also handled logistics, transporting food from farms to one of three warehouses and then distributing it to pick-up spots in schools and community centers. It operated in three locations, Seattle-Takoma, the Bay Area, and greater New York City, and made its money on the 35% markup it charged on food purchases.But in July 2016, a year after Ronen made his bold claims to Forbes, he shut down the logistics end of his business, closing Farmigo’s warehouses and laying off 100 staffers, leaving just 20 employees who continued to work on the company’s software.Part of Ronen’s prediction, that food shoppers would shift their purchases online, is coming true (a January 2017 Food Marketing Institute study said a quarter of U.S households bought some food online in 2016, up from 19% in 2014). But he concluded Farmigo would never be able to compete with Amazon, whose AmazonFresh service offers same-day delivery.Though he says a new investor he won’t name offered him an additional $20 million to expand Farmigo’s logistics arm, he figured it would cost far more than that to beat Amazon’s giant network of warehouses and finely-honed logistics operation. “To compete with the convenience Amazon was gunning for would have been incredibly costly and maybe even impossible,” he says.Ronen says his three existing investors supported his decision to turn down the cash and revamp, and that they believe Farmigo still has promise. Farmigo’s investors are Sherbrooke Capital in Newton, MA, and two San Francisco firms, Benchmark and Formation 8 (which disbanded after investing in Farmigo; its main investor then formed a new firm, 8VC). Representatives from each firm sit on Farmigo’s board. None responded to requests for comment.After ditching the logistics end of the business, Ronen has made a push to sell Farmigo’s food-purchasing software system to farms and to so-called food hubs, local online farmers’ markets like Intervale Food Hub in Vermont, which processes orders to Burlington area farms and delivers food to shoppers’ homes. He also made improvements in the software, including its mobile capability.More than 300 farms and food hubs in 35 states now use Farmigo’s software. The company’s revenue comes from charges to its farmer and food hub customers. It collects the greater of two figures, either a 2% commission on each food sale, or a $150 charge per customer per month. This year Ronen says he expects Farmigo software will process $55 million worth of food, bringing in revenue of more than $1 million. He’s cut the staff further, down to fewer than 10 employees, and he says Farmigo is profitable.How big can Farmigo get? Ronen has grand plans. “I think easily $1 billion of food could be sold through our platform,” he says. But to do that, Farmigo would need a tenfold increase in its customer base. Given that it only added 10 new customers a month this year, that may prove as much of a stretch as wiping out supermarkets.Though he’s no longer predicting the demise of the supermarket, he has a new forecast. “I haven’t done a 180, but I’ve shifted 90 degrees,” he says. “Any supermarket that doesn’t have an online offering and is not delivering to the consumer’s home will not exist.”Ronen says he’s in talks for a possible sale of Farmigo but he won’t say who could potentially acquire the company or how much they’re offering. Though a supermarket chain could be a good guess. “All supermarkets are taking steps to compete with the convenience that Amazon provides, especially now that Amazon owns Whole Foods,” says Ronen. “Markets need to differentiate themselves and we have the technology for them to do that.” Though many markets already have their own online ordering software, most of their systems link to traditional suppliers and not to small farmers who use Farmigo’s software. Farmigo can supply the missing link between supermarket chains and local farms, says Ronen.Farmigo is about to introduce one more innovation: Its software will make it possible for Farmigo’s customers to process payments from shoppers who want to use the speculative cyber currency, bitcoin. When a shopper buying $20 of organic turnips and onions from a local farm running Farmigo’s software is ready to check out, they’ll be able to choose between using a credit card, doing a bank transfer, paying with Paypal or using bitcoin. Through a service called BitPay, Farmigo’s software will give the farmer the option of storing the bitcoin in a virtual wallet or exchanging it for cash. Though few businesses accept bitcoin and many see it as a high-risk currency whose value could crash, Ronen believes that it will soon become a widely used transaction platform, similar to Paypal. “It plays into our master plan of being more advanced with our ecommerce technology,” he says."

It obtained an emergency asset freeze against Dominic Lacroix, whom it called a ""recidivist Quebec securities law violator,"" his partner Sabrina Paradis-Royer and PlexCorps. It also filed charges against LaCroix and PlexCorps alleging that they sold securities claiming investments in PlexCoin would bring profits of 1,354% profit in less than 29 days.

""We acted quickly to protect retail investors from this initial coin offering's false promises.""Longtime players in the crypto space view the action positively.

Ripple, the blockchain and cryptocurrency company, not only had a booth on the Sibos floor, it took over a venue about a mile away for its own program which opened with a chat between Gene Sperling, the White House economic advisor to presidents Clinton and Obama and Ben Bernanke, former chairman head of the Federal Reserve. Sterling directed questions to Bernanke and they chatted about their meetings during the economic crisis.","Ripple transport at SibosRipple ran shuttles on three afternoons of Sibos. It also had a small kickoff cocktail part Sunday night before and invited about 500 people to hear the Steve Miller Band on Tuesday night.At a small press briefing on the opening day of Sibos a reporter asked Swift representatives about the Ripple event. The silence was impressive, until the team recovered and noted that Ripple was participating in Sibos. Then they lapsed into silence once again. Was the reporter’s question for real or faux naive,  a colleague asked afterwards.Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the company wanted more floor space  for its program than Swift was willing to provide on the show floor so it had to find second venue.Although he was speaking at a Ripple event, Bernanke displayed a cautious stance toward cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin was designed to evade government control, and he didn’t expect that to succeed. Bitcoin also hasn’t shown itself to be a transactional currency, he said. It is more speculative, working against regulators rather than with regulators as Ripple does. When payments don’t go through banks, there are concerns about consumer protection and money laundering. Governments will want to know who pays and who gets paid. They will be tolerant of some delay to let banks and law enforcement understand money flows. Governments need the financial equivalent of the Global Entry program for U.S. passport holders — keep AML costs as low as possible to reduce the interested in workarounds and evasion.Ripple's blockchain technology was incorporated into a bank framework launched as an open source solution by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation during Sibos. The code, available through GitHub, aims to connect the innovative but often closed loop mobile payment systems in the developing world. The code has also attracted some interest from credit unions in the U.S., offering a way to create a modern core banking system without relying on existing vendors and service bureaus."

[+] (JUSTIN TALLIS/AFP/Getty Images)","There can be a lot of hype around how disruptive blockchain technology will be where some trumpet how it will change everything in our world today and every industry is primed for disruption. While I am excited about blockchain technology, I do not believe it’s a cure-all technology.The most common industries cited as ripe for disruption by blockchain are banking and finance, healthcare, cybersecurity, and any space where a lack of transparency or a lack of tracking and inefficiencies abound, such as creative works and supply chain management.The potential of blockchain’s disruptive nature across consumer and enterprise markets can seem like a sea captain sailing in the middle of the ocean during a foggy night. You know you are looking into vast and distant waters, but visibility is limited and the future is uncertain.Enterprise is keyWhen I consider the potential application of blockchain on consumer-facing products and new companies that can launch from it, I get excited.  When I think about the enterprise side, I get a little sleepy-eyed. At its core, blockchain technology is pretty boring. It makes backend processes more efficient, more secure or transparent as a new solution or as a middleware product. Middleware for legacy systems? Bringing large enterprises out of the IT Stone Age to the future of decentralized, distributed systems? Please stick a fork in my leg and pour a gallon of Red Bull down my throat.But boring is good and highlights a huge potential of blockchain enterprise companies. A good industry benchmark for these up and coming enterprise blockchain startups are companies such as SAP and Oracle, which are traditional enterprise database companies. I see today's enterprise blockchain startups and those in the coming years as the next generation of enterprise database companies. SAP has a market cap of over $135 billion with over $23 billion in revenues last year, and Oracle has a market cap of over $209 billion with over $37 billion in revenues. Oracle positions itself as the world’s #1 enterprise database company with dozens of core products from middleware solutions to servers to databases.Eye on AsiaA little-known fact is that the core technology behind SAP’s flagship product, HANA database, came from a South Korea company they acquired in 2005 called Transact In Memory. Transact In Memory was founded by Dr. Sang Cha, who is a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Seoul National University.The next generation of global enterprise database companies might not just be based on technologies acquired from the region, but wholly originated from Asia.  For example, Blocko, which went through our accelerator in Seoul in 2015, has become the leading enterprise blockchain company in South Korea with over 90% marketshare.  Their blockchain-as-a-service platform, Coinstack, has been implemented at Samsung, LG CNS, Hyundai and many other multi-billion corporations.  For the Korea Exchange, they created a blockchain-based OTC trading market decreased transaction time from 2-3 days to 1 day. This resulted in cost savings of $73 million this past year.For one of South Korea's largest credit card companies, Lotte Card, Blocko set up a blockchain-based biometric log-in and payment authorization system which decreased authentication time from 7-10 minutes to 2-3 minutes.  This simple solution reduced Lotte Card's annual security solution expenditures to 10% of their original operating costs while exponentially increasing its level of security.Blocko improving Lotte Card's customer authentication processMore on Forbes: How Blockchain Could Allow China's Netizens To Reclaim Online PublishingAnother company in China, SunlightDB (a member of SparkLabs Beijing's inaugural class this year), is trying to create a whole new database based on blockchain technology.  They are building a database that is highly secure where information cannot be tampered with, but also completely open.  Contrary to some misconceptions of blockchain technologies, their database queries have been at least 10x faster than traditional databases.Joining the blockchainOutside of Asia and the startup world, blockchain implementations are occurring throughout the globe. In Dubai, DNATA (Dubai National Air Transport Association), one of the world's largest air service providers, is working with IBM to improve the cargo delivery processes through blockchain technology. The potential cost-savings will be in the hundreds of millions.Many U.S. corporations are piloting blockchain solutions, but I believe this coming year there will be a shift from U.S. companies dipping their toes into the water to more of them jumping into the decentralized waters of blockchain technology. 2018 will be a breakout year for enterprise startups and large companies (i.e. IBM, Accenture, Bank of America) playing in this space, and U.S. companies within the space might quickly catch up to the innovations occurring in Asia.The weakness of startups in Asia is the inability to become global companies and make a big impact beyond the region. You only have to look at the development of Tencent, Alibaba, Kakao, or Rakuten to question the viability of a true global player coming from Asia, but maybe this new generation of entrepreneurs in Asia will prove us wrong. Whether from Asia, Europe, or the U.S., this coming year could well pave the way for the beginnings of the first $100 billion blockchain company in the world."

Mobile sales have been lackluster, and investors have been disappointed, to say the least. Was the VR boom real but ill-timed, or was it all a dream?Though naysayers are calling VR and AR a bust, Adam Draper says now if the perfect time to invest. Founder and Managing Director of accelerator Boost VC, Draper has spent the last five years investing in “science fiction” companies: over 180 companies from 30 countries that bring our wildest technological dreams to life through bitcoin, blockchain and VR and AR. Though VR has hit a slump recently, Draper is adamant that VR and AR are still in their early stages of growth. So adamant, in fact, that his next accelerator tribe is 70% VR companies.I had the opportunity to speak to Draper about how he chooses his companies and why, and what’s next for Boost VC.Tell me about you?10 years ago I founded a company called Xpert Financial, a private stock market for trading secondary transactions. Somewhere you would go to buy shares of Uber or Lyft today. It’s a very popular topic today; then it was not so popular, but was a very important topic, because it was at the bottom of the crash. I ran that for about four-and-a-half years with a fantastic co-founder, and then we ran out of money. I failed, a lot, and made every mistake known to man, and by learning from those mistakes I was able to help people to avoid the same mistakes as I did. I started mentoring startups in bulk, and thus founded an accelerator called Boost VC about five years ago.Our thesis statement is, “Making science fiction a reality.” We have very large communities we’ve built in blockchain and VR, investing in about 200 companies over the last five years, and they are doing really well.How do you choose those companies?It’s always by the people. You always want to focus on great people who see the world a little differently, and want to help change society. They need to have a big idea and keep pulling on that thread, and make more right decisions than wrong decisions. Because, really, a startup is literally just a series of unfortunate events where you failed, failed, failed, and failed until you succeed. You want to pick the right people who are just fantastic. That’s what we focus on: in our industry of technology -- VR, blockchain, science fiction -- we focus on the team, market and idea. What we look for is resiliency, but it’s difficult to gauge that in a couple meetings.You started with blockchain and then you ventured out into VR. How do you see VR market coming together?Blockchain we got into about four-and-a-half years ago. I was the first investor, I believe, in CoinBase -- who coincidentally announced their big fundraising yesterday -- which defined a big path for me because we ended up focusing on Bitcoin and the blockchain for our entire industry.Why did you focus there at that time?It was because no one else was focusing on it. First, it was a differentiator for us. Everyone else was focusing very broadly if they were running an accelerator, and within 50 square miles of us were tons of accelerators. But none of them were focusing on Bitcoin or the blockchain because, quite honestly, it was complicated and no one understood it. I’m not even going to pretend that I understand now on more than a macro level today.When we announced that we were going to support Bitcoin companies, we became a great lightning rod for activity and fun. We realized just how passionate and tightly integrated the community was: 150 people reached out just to me, and I met with all of them. They intensely believed in it, and that type of community is so worth investing in. We knew that we’d made the right decision there. It’s gone through ups and downs, of course, with right now being a crazy high.VR, to that point, is on a crazy low, but in a lot of ways, I’m more excited about VR because we are at a nadir, the bottom of sentiment in VR. Everyone is thinking that the numbers are not catching up to what was promised. The problem is when everyone was pitching for an idea versus actually delivering a product is that now there are numbers, and those numbers are not as good as they thought they would be. Everyone thought that it would be mobile adoption, but obviously, that never happened because it’s a new computing platform. Quite honestly, it’s a pain in the ass to put on the headset. The experience has to be good enough to put on a headset, and then it needs to get easier to put on the headset. You have to establish a habit, and creating a habit is harder than the technical challenges.What I think will happen before adoption is that the first billion dollar company in the VR space will be B2B, selling to the enterprise, because that establishes a habit. It will make someone’s life better, like the Excel spreadsheet did for computers. Suddenly there was a reason to use your computer, and now it’s an efficient machine to help you. That is the adoption cycle. It isn’t mobile. Mobile is a completely different thing, where everyone already has phones so the habit is already established. We have to create a new habit with this new technology.How are you analyzing startups in that down market? You know that they’re more likely to face challenges getting funding, and particularly where there is a longer cycle like that establishing habits, how do you select startups? Because everyone has realized that the market has cooled so much, we’re now getting incredible talent. That’s what happens because the expectation isn’t as high as it was for a founder to get funding 24 months ago, even 12 months. We are at a pretty low point for funding but it’s the best time to invest because the bang for your buck is way higher.We do a lot of blockchain companies, but our next tribe is 70% VR. The accelerator runs twice per year while we provide housing and office space, and we invest in twenty to 25 startups a year: 16 of those companies this year are AR or VR startups.Given that they are going to have more funding challenges in the future how are they looking at the business model differently? Figure out where the money and distribution is. You need to hack distribution. For example, everyone has been looking at Oculus and HTC on the Steam or Oculus stores. It’s a monopoly: these are the only ways to distribute a VR system. Suddenly a lot of founders are getting really creative. Honestly, the B2B angle is really interesting, because you aren’t selling through Oculus, you’re going door to door.Also, there is the new option of VR arcades popping up. Slowly, VR arcades are making a dent in the VR market. It’s like everyone was looking at one way to distribute their product, and it turns out that people are opening doors to other ways to show growth. Numbers are what matters -- angels and VCs need numbers and need to see that there is a market and the trajectory is growing. I honestly think that if any companies in this next six months last for  more than two years, they will be a part of the massive growth that is going to be happening. I look at my life in ten years, and I don’t see me not using VR on a consistent basis.That then suggests a different type of founder set. If they’re going to have to look at alternative distribution mechanisms, it will be difficult if they’re a team of technical founders. You’ll need a broader skill set, don’t you think? I always believe that people can learn a broader skill set. You need good technology and solving a big problem. I always think that at its core, it’s solving a problem, you’re not building technology for the sake of technology.But we’re betting very heavily on B2B. We have a company called Primitive that allows you to visualize code. It’s valuable for two reasons: one, you are programming in VR, doing graphical programming. For example, you want this code should be over here, and this over there, and you move it with your hands, just like in Minority Report. That’s his dream.But he had to start somewhere, and he found that a lot of companies have engineer churn. For instance, to get an engineer up to speed on a project takes three to four months. What if you could decrease that to a month? What they realized is that they could record the CTO walking through the code base visually, and it creates a memory palace. It’s a visual memory palace that you’re actually walking through which helps you to remember it better. People are really grasping it.There’s also a company called STRIVR which is doing really well, they started with athlete training, and have moved on to businesses. We have a company called VirtualSpeech, teaching people how to communicate better by talking in front of a group of people. These are all really great business use cases that really couldn’t have existed well in a technology before virtual reality. You need that experiential stuff. "

The new SparkChain Capital, which could fund 15-20 early-stage startups in any region, aims to cut through the speculative nature of the current cryptocurrency industry and help startups build long-lasting technological platforms, said Joyce Kim, the fund’s lead partner.The most active blockchain and cryptocurrencies markets outside of the U.S. are in China, Japan and South Korea -- SparkLabs has already invested in blockchain startups Blocko and Sentbe in South Korea, as well as Cyrex in Stolkholm. And considering SparkLabs’ global footprint and the state of crypto technology today, the combination was complementary, Kim said. “It’s clear that crypto has really left the fringes and is now at center stage,” she said by phone. Joyce Kim, cofounder of Stellar.org, will lead SparkChain Capital's $100 million fund.Improving People’s LivesKim, the former director of Stellar.org and an investor at Freestyle Capital, says she recognized the technology’s potential years ago as her family, who emigrated from Korea to the U.S., would struggle with the money remittance process. But she was struck at how the technology remained at the fringe and disconnected from people’s daily financial needs. “I saw a big need for something that focused more internationally and also focused up and down the economic chains,” Kim says. She cofounded Stellar.org in 2014 to expand financial access to people and remove financial obstructions, and created a cryptocurrency protocol for the unbanked in areas like Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa. In those areas where many are underserviced by the existing financial infrastructure, “hybrid cultures” have been innovating localized fintech services -- such as a CoinStar-like coffee bean sorting and credit system tailored for farmers in the Congo, she said. “To me, that’s something important,” she said. “Across so many countries, you have these small cocoa or coffee farmers who are the backbone of their local economies -- but they’re so far down the economic food chain that most of the profits are taken by somebody else.” Such projects that fill large gaps and build an infrastructure to improve people’s living conditions will continue to draw her eye.She brings that perspective to the new fund, with partners and advisers spread globally, which aims to add a meaningful boost to innovations emerging beyond Silicon Valley. Her fellow partners are Net Jacobsson, cofounder of SparkLabs Global and former director of international business development at Facebook; William Chu, former executive director at Zheng He Capital; and Jay McCarthy, cofounder of SparkLabs Global and managing partner at Pacific Advisers. But SparkLabs declined to disclose the new fund’s investors.SparkChain Capital itself is planning for an ICO later this year. Practicing what they preach, SparkLabs plans to adopt blockchain software to streamline its fund operations, currently exploring the best use cases, Kim said.Investing in EntrepreneursKim, who advised SparkLabs’ first fund, said she joined the SparkLabs team after seeing how it successfully replicated its long-term, entrepreneur-focused investment philosophy from Korea into other countries like Singapore.And SparkChain plans to continue investing in entrepreneurs and teams in contrast with other blockchain-focused funds that are more about speculative currency investments, Kim said.“A lot of it comes down to really deep diligence into the people,” she said. “When we invest in companies, we want to know that we’re going to be working with this team through thick and thin for the years to come.” That’s not to say it will be hands-off investing in new cryptocurrencies, taking each investment case by case. The fund will keep its ICO investments to 40%, while choosing to hold other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum at 10%-20% of the fund. Nonetheless, she believes the current proliferation of new cryptocoins is actually a good thing, as it will self-correct the speculative nature of initial coin offering investments. That will happen as the quickly developing crypto world becomes more fluidly connected to the traditional financial system.“The traditional financial system would serve as the bones of it whereas the crypto currency system could serve as the arteries and capillaries that keep things moving around. I think that would be how we’ll see fluidity between the two systems, which will be more complementary than competitive down the line.”Also on Forbes: Why South Koreans Are Risking It All On Ethereum"

Businesses cannot shy away from blockchain either. Bubble territory or not things are moving apace.","Many multinational companies have already jumped onto the blockchain bandwagon and are working on their own projects to stay ahead of the competition.The numbers being bandied about for the space are something. According to Accenture research published at the start of 2017, investment banks alone could save up to $12 billion per year by adopting blockchain and smart contracts, effectively a program code that automatically performs some actions when pre-defined conditions occur (i.e. if X does Y, then execute Z).And, Gartner has estimated that by 2022, so-called ratified unbundled (i.e. defined impact) smart contracts will be in use by more than 25% of global organizations.Major technology providers like IBM and Microsoft are offering blockchain solutions to enterprise clients. Tech start-ups too are aggressively capitalizing on the boom by building new products and services that depend on the technology. Just this year, blockchain start-ups amassed more than $3.25 billion in funding through token sales.For other businesses, however, the big question is how blockchain adoption can benefit them. There is no question that modern business environments require companies to make technology integral to their strategy.Many have been thrown into the must-adopt tech list including automation, analytics and cybersecurity just to name a few. Then here’s blockchain.(Image: Shutterstock).There is now an emergence of smart contract platforms like Jincor, which is touted as allowing any business to accept smart contracts and cryptocurrencies easily “with no legal, technical or operational complications in a cost-efficient manner.”Boasting easy-to-use interfaces that even non-tech businesses can create and manage their own blockchain smart contracts and process cryptocurrencies for payments, Jincor is embarking on an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) to fund its plans.They will issue 35 million JCR tokens in total (76% of Jincor’s native currency on sale from this December) at an initial price of $1. According to the start-up these funds will help “fully exploit its ecosystem” and gain critical mass. (Note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment). Accessible Blockchain TechBut with this growing ease of blockchain adoption, how can the technology fit into the scheme of things and how could the technology exactly benefit adopters?The launch of public blockchains like Ethereum and Hyperledger has enabled more blockchain adopters as developers can freely build their own applications on top of them. Blockchain development, however, requires a level of technical expertise to do. No thanks to the boom, access to blockchain developers can be quite the challenge especially for non-tech ventures.Fortunately, a key development in this area is how select ventures are encouraging blockchain adoption by making the technical aspect easier to manage.“Companies can establish business relations, streamline contractual and legal procedures via smart contracts and conduct cryptocurrency transactions in a safe and easy manner. It allows entrepreneurs to embrace all the advantages of blockchain technology without the necessity to develop or adjust them on their own,” says Vladislav Kirichenko, the Russian CEO and co-founder of Jincor, a tech evangelist and graduate of the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation.Vladislav Kirichenko, CEO and co-founder of Jincor, a blockchain-based platform that claims it will... [+] allow any business to work with smart contracts and cryptocurrency payments easily without legal, operational or technical complications.Lower barriers means more businesses could more readily explore the technology’s applications for their particular industries.Use CasesBlockchain can essentially be used where transparent and immutable records are useful. This is why the technology has already found wide adoption in financial services. There is value in ensuring that records of financial transactions are kept verifiable and safe from tampering and fraud. Well, that is the line touted by various protagonists in the space.Other verticals such as healthcare and even ecommerce are finding applications for the technology. What further expanded its use has been the introduction of smart contracts - code that can keep track of terms of agreements and automate the steps towards each term’s fulfillments - in new platforms. There is also the ability to create cryptocurrencies.Among the blockchain-driven technologies, smart contracts and cryptocurrencies appear to be truly beneficial to even non-tech businesses.For instance, e-commerce companies can use cryptocurrencies for payments, which takes away the need for using costly payment processors and merchant services. Merchants can also use smart contracts to automate fulfillment of orders - especially for the delivery of digital goods.This is even more useful for long-term and repeat engagements in the case of business-to-business (B2B) transactions. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba is even using blockchain to fight fake goods on its platform.More complex applications could even facilitate and secure supply chains. The MediLedger project, a joint venture announced late this September by Chronicled, Inc. and The LinkLab LLC, forinstance aims explore and develop blockchain solutions for the pharmaceutical industry.This initiative, which has formed a working group of leading pharmaceutical companies that includes Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, Pfizer, AmerisourceBergen, and McKesson Corporation, is primarily aimed at demonstrating compliance with the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA), which was enacted by the U.S. Congress on November 27, 2013.Deploying innovative capabilities found with blockchain technology to track and trace prescription medicines, it aims to secure pharma company supply chains and curb the theft and tampering of raw materials and the circulation of fake drugs. The DSCSA outlines steps to build an electronic, interoperable system in order to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the U.S. and help the FDA in protecting consumers.The increasing admissibility of blockchain records for legal purposes such as moves made by U.S. states like Arizona and Vermont also creates the opportunity for smart contracts to be used for transactions involving high-value property such as real estate.Efficiency and SavingsThrough these companies and initiatives, tasks such as record keeping, cash flow and fulfillment can be handled under one platform. Consolidating tasks and automating them can help streamline business operations and boost efficiency.Businesses could also save on a number of costs. For example, by enabling businesses to use smart contracts and cryptocurrencies, Smart contract platforms can take over functions usually done by intermediaries like banks, escrow services, and even legal services. The use of cryptocurrencies and digital wallets also allows for a variety of financial uses such as facilitating lines of credit and overdraft for their customers.A platform like Jincor also helps its users navigate the legal implications of using blockchain for business, and even has its own arbitration mechanisms to help businesses resolve disputes.Cost Reduction & EfficienciesCutting out middleman means savings for the business. According to a McKinsey report it is estimated that blockchain could save businesses at least $50 billion in B2B transactions by 2021.Nick Ayton, CEO and founder of Chainstarter, a second generation ICO platform, commenting in London said: “Blockchain technologies can, if used correctly and in the right way, reduce processing costs by at least 40%” and deliver a real-time view of positions.Dubbed the ‘Sage of Shoreditch’, Ayton added: “All secured digital records can be accessed by the parties taking on the risk, automating contractual obligations (e.g. share of risk, premium and payout) using Smart Contracts.” So, clearly the savings could be substantial, if the technology is harnessed properly.Embedding Trust           Blockchain and smart contracts essentially enable companies to create ecosystems that support their business processes. But aside from making companies more efficient through automation, another benefit that blockchain adoption provides is the trust that the technology brings to these processes.The transparency and immutability of blockchain means businesses and their customers could ensure that their transactions and agreements are verifiable. This encourages compliance and accountability among parties.Businesses can gain much from adopting blockchain. However, as with any technology adoption that would significantly change an organization’s ways of working, implementing blockchain and smart contracts would require careful planning and strategy.Looking into the use of platforms would also help companies navigate the technical and compliance challenges that come with adoption. With a well thought out strategy though, some argue that blockchain adoption becomes a competitive advantage rather than a potentially unsettling experiment. Carpe diem."

retailers, the blockchain stands to make a sizable impact on the industry.","Dec 22, 2017,02:37pm EST",Shutterstock,"With the rise of cryptocurrency and the underlying blockchain technology that fuels decentralization, several industries have been quick to look at how the technology can benefit their sector. As a retail marketer, I’m interested in how the blockchain is going to inform our purchase path. More than a “now accepting Bitcoin” sign in the window of our favorite retailers, the blockchain stands to make a sizable impact on the industry. And while the landscape is swiftly evolving, we can make some predictions about retail in a blockchain future. Here are some trends to look out for:The Future Of Online To Offline MarketingThe notion that physical retailers are at a deficit when it comes to data is one that we, as retail marketers, have been contending with for years. It’s the reason “omnichannel” is a buzzword - brick and mortar retailers have long-known that they need to engage their potential customers where the customers are, which is more convoluted with every new channel that we add into increasingly digitized lives. For the past few years, physical retailers have implemented technological solutions such as beacons to try to bridge the gap - the blockchain can take these solutions to the next level.“Beacons allow retailers to know who a customer is and use internal data for some peripheral customer insights,” says Abhi Pitti, CEO of Nucleus Vision, a company that uses the blockchain in combination with Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology to create real-time customer intelligence for brick-and-mortar stores. “Because of the lack of customer data, the information gleaned using beacons, alone, still doesn’t measure up to customer insights captured online. But when we merge in blockchain technology, all private databases such as banks, third party apps on a mobile device, and credit card companies can open customer databases to share and monetize data with required customer authorizations recorded on a secured, incorruptible, transparent, chronological, append-only, distributed ledger called the blockchain.”To put it simply, by combining the use of in-store sensors with a decentralized authority, retailers can glean unprecedented amounts of information about their in-store customers in real-time.Crypto-Powered Incentive ProgramsAccording to many experts, cryptocurrency-powered incentive programs are going to become commonplace among brands.""Retail marketing is going to make a strong shift into incentivized referral and gamification efforts driven by super fans and evangelists who are rewarded by microtransactions paid in cryptocurrencies,” says Jeremy Epstein, CEO of Never Stop Marketing and author of The CMO Primer for the Blockchain World. “For the merchants that figure this out, customer acquisition costs should fall. The key will be understanding core customer motivations as well as a bit of game theory.”Epstein points to WishKnish, as an example. The platform enables merchants to set up specialized programs designed to optimize customer referrals. “A special emphasis on incentivized referral and gamification of marketing efforts will begin to shift the burden from the shoulders of business owners to superfans and evangelizers from within their communities,” says Alisa Gus, CEO of WishKnish.That is, the adoption of blockchain-based referral rewards may have positive implications for brands and business owners hoping to move audiences to action.Loyalty CohortsSince the blockchain enables us to have a decentralized authority, it inherently holds its users accountable. According to some experts, we may see an opportunity for companies with similar target audiences to pair up to increase customer loyalty.“Loyalty programs today are disjointed,” says Kai Chen, the founder and CEO of Olympus Labs.  “They’re not interconnected because there’s no central or decentralized authority to make sure no one is cheating in the system. Today, if a company comes in and creates a consortium, there’s no policing.”Chen points to brands with similar customer bases, such as Tiffany & Co. and Coach, as examples of a potential cohort members. Brands such as these can build a loyalty program that’s connected and mutually beneficial with respect to cross-marketing opportunities and consumer insights gleaned from data. Said plainly, there’s an opportunity to have a decentralized system wherein the blockchain keeps loyalty members accountable, allowing consumers to accrue and  spend points in more meaningful ways.Increased Payment Opportunities Via MobileIn today’s omni-channel business world, consumer convenience is the name of the game. All marketing efforts become frivolous if consumers are unable to conveniently and quickly conduct their transactions.But only 1.2 billion people have access to a bank account with payment capabilities, while there are approximately 5 billion unique mobile phone subscribers. It makes sense that mobile payments add convenience to the consumer experience. A partnership between TelCoin, a blockchain mobile payment company, and telecom companies is aiming to provide secure and convenient payment options to mobile users who don’t have access to a bank account. Claude Eguienta, Co-Founder and CEO of TelCoin, says this partnership allows the company to “provide financial services to billions of people.”This not only gives a wide array of customers a method of secure payment, but is also an example of how companies with similar target audiences may use the blockchain to work together and increase customer loyalty.From increased payment opportunities and more advanced incentive programs to more comprehensive loyalty programs and richer customer insights, the blockchain may grant opportunities to retailers who are willing to stay ahead of the trends."

Whether you'll be spending money on gifts, trips home for Thanksgiving/winter holidays/NYE, vacations, or end-of-year bills, or getting ready to make financial resolutions for the New Year, it's a great time to start getting your financial house in order.","Use these tools to make budgeting, spending, and saving as easy and efficient as possible.10 apps to help you manage your personal finances1. Save for specific goals with Qapital.When you keep all of your money in one account, it can be easy to lose track of goals or what purpose you've earmarked funds for. Qapital solves that problem by splitting up savings based on your real-life goals--and using various ""rules"" to determine when to save.For instance, you could set a ""winter trip"" goal, then implement a rule that every time you buy a coffee, the app also automatically puts money into the trip fund. And when you've enjoyed the satisfaction of watching savings accumulate towards your various goals, you'll be less likely to dip into those funds for impulse purchases.2. You've heard of ""honey-do"" lists. Now, manage joint expenses with HoneyDue.Finances are a common source of tension in relationships. HoneyDue makes it easy to strike the perfect balance when combining finances, prevent arguments, and help you both stay organized and on the same page.It works by allowing couples to choose what they want to share, and what to keep separate. The app lets you create and coordinate budgets, track bills and account balances, and add both joint and individual bank accounts so you can keep your own ""fun money.""3. Want to lower your bills and keep track of all your accounts in one place? Use Empower.The most unique feature of Empower is still in the process of being released: the app will let you renegotiate big bills you didn't even realize you could reduce. Other money-saving features include the ability to cancel unwanted subscriptions and find high-interest accounts to store your savings in.If you have a lot of accounts and find it difficult to stay on top of them all, Empower also allows you to add all of them in one place--and even make transfers between them or set up autosaving. This means you'll have a full picture of your finances all from one place.4. Get money back on everyday purchases with Drop.Drop isn't the first shopping rebate app out there, but it is one of the easiest to use, because it works automatically. You don't have to unlock rewards or upload receipts: you simply link a credit/debit card, spend normally, and earn points for eligible purchases.Retailers featured on Drop include grocery stores, clothing outlets, restaurants, department stores, and even Amazon, so there are plenty of ways to earn. When you have enough ""Drop points,"" redeem them in-app for rewards like gift cards.5. Become an investor with Stash.Stash allows you to build a fully diversified portfolio full of ETFs in categories that you choose. For example, you could fill your portfolio with a clean energy fund, stocks that pay dividends, and a small business fund. Stash assesses the risk portfolio so you can make a plan. You can start with as little as $5, but keep in mind that the monthly price is $1, so it's a good idea to invest more than that so the fee doesn't cut too much into your profits.6. Make donations--it’s the holidays, after all--with CharityWater.Support a non-profit organization bringing clean and safe drinking water to people in developing countries. 100% of your gift will go towards the cause. And remember, you can write off charitable donations on your taxes come April.7. Pay off credit card debt and start 2018 on solid footing with Tally.Tally is unique in that it not only provides a way to organize and manage your credit cards: it actually functions as a line of credit itself (if you qualify). If you're carrying credit card debt, you can transfer that balance to the Tally credit line and pay lower interest. Or, simply add your credit cards as-is and let the app make automatic payments to ward off late fees. It saves you interest payments and hassle so paying off debt is easier.8. Have some free time over the holidays + want to see what all the ""bitcoin"" fuss is about? Transact with Coinbase.Interested in buying Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin? Cryptocurrency is more popular than ever, and it's easy to acquire some and start experimenting. You can sign up for Coinbase to purchase and securely store your crypto ""coins."" (If you have a friend who's been talking about it for years, ask them for a Coinbase referral link to get a $10 bitcoin bonus.)9. Transfer funds internationally with TransferWise.Looking to send money to family or friends in another country this holiday? Some banks charge up to 5% in hidden costs when sending money to any bank account abroad--and many other familiar payment apps only work domestically. TransferWise claims to be up to eight times cheaper, so you can send the money without having it eaten up by fees.10. Doing a lot of online shopping for the holidays? Use Privacy.Most websites aren't immune to hacking--so it's a bit of a gamble to store your real credit card information on them. With Privacy, you don't have to. The app lets you create temporary, virtual cards and billing details to protect your money from thieves and hackers.Also, if you intend to buy a six-month or year-long subscription as a present for someone, Privacy cards are also ideal for signing up for subscription purchases you don't wish to renew. If you have trouble canceling or forget to, the merchant won't be able to charge your card again when auto-renewal time comes.It's been an amazing decade for financial technology, and it's only getting better. As Carl Tremblay, Head of Growth at Plaid, notes, ""What we've seen emerge over the past few years is a really healthy and competitive fintech ecosystem that has started to benefit consumers and businesses everywhere. We’re at the beginning of what promises to be a busy few years.""These apps are already amazing, but fintech is nowhere near done yet."

After all, blockchain is the tech supporting Bitcoin—a currency attempting its own form of financial disruption. But what many don’t realize is that blockchain has tremendous power to disrupt and solve problems in other sectors, too. One of the most promising areas, in my opinion: marketing and advertising.I’ve heard it said that blockchain is to “value” what the internet was to “information.” Personally, I’d argue the internet was developed to transfer valuable information, but it’s taken on a life of its own since it was first developed—playing all parts entertainment hub, news channel, ad stream, and everything in between. Of course, blockchain could eventually devolve into something similar. But for now, those of us in the industry are choosing to focus on its promise, which is astronomical.In advertising alone, blockchain-based protocols could change how online ads are purchased, delivered, measured, and valued. In fact, it could even lead to accurate data on the ad tracking front—leading to better returns overall. The following are what I see as the top four ways blockchain could contribute to the ad and marketing space.
Establishing Trust with Ad BuysThe thing with online advertising is that it’s almost impossible to know if stats are accurate. When we count clicks to our site or followers on Instagram, are we counting true customers—i.e. people? Or are we counting bots or hired “clickers” who artificially pump up ad stats so their distributors can charge higher rates? In truth, it’s incredibly hard to tell. Research shows bots cost companies more than $7 billion in damage in 2016 alone. But blockchain is about to change all of that. Because the chain is transparent and encrypted, companies can easily determine if the people viewing their ads are members of their targeted audience—or not—saving millions in ad spend each year. One company, AdChain, uses its own native token to establish a trusted ad space where users benefit from campaign auditing and cryptographically secure impression tracking. In layman’s terms: companies can make sure they get the advertising they pay for.Goodbye, MiddlemanOne Forrester analyst estimated that publishers removing middlemen could increase their CPM from $1 to $5. Blockchain may do even better. It could eventually shake up the market so much that companies can pay their targeted audience directly to view their ads—skipping the ad buy process altogether. Using “micro-currencies,” companies will vie for actual audience “attention”—not just imprints. And they’ll be able to prove they’ve gotten that attention before the currency is exchanged. The Brave browser, for instance, uses its “Basic Attention Token” (BAT) to allow advertisers to pay based on “mental effort” by the person viewing the ad. That means smarter spending—and connecting—with potential customers.Targeting Audiences BetterIn the past, advertisers gained information about customers from various disparate sources—one might tell the age and sex, another their salary, and one more the kind of car they drive or where they like to dine. But using blockchain, advertisers will now have the ability to build a customer profile directly from the customer—gaining all the information the customer is willing to share in one swoop. This allows for an even greater ability to market to the customers’ needs—and spend advertising on only those customers who are most likely to buy your product.Improving TransparencyThere’s nothing like spending thousands of dollars on a watch or hand-bag, only to find the product is counterfeit. Blockchain’s digital ledger system allows for tamper-proof transparency of every product’s move through the supply chain. What that means is that buyers can easily check where a product has come from—who has handled it—whether it’s legit or faux, whether they are purchasing from an online auction or a brick-and-mortar storefront. This puts tremendous power into the hands of the customer—enhancing their customer experience (CX). Some companies, such as the Babyghost fashion line, have even used blockchain to tell a “story” about their product, including who modeled it on the runway. In that sense, blockchain does more than create trust. It builds brand.Whether these opportunities for blockchain blow up is still to be seen. After all, there are many companies who stand to lose in the new blockchain marketing paradigm—and they’re giants. (Think Google and Facebook.) Still, if we believe—and I do—that digital transformation is all about CX, then blockchain’s entrance into the marketing-scape will not be short-lived. It will mean fewer unwieldy pop-ups when browsing and closer connections with the companies we want to support. And, it will empower customers themselves to choose which marketers they wish to hear from—all while getting paid for it!Yes, the concept of blockchain has the power to disrupt our world on many fronts, but marketing is definitely one of the most exciting. And while it might seem overwhelming to those companies still learning how to use mobile apps to schedule their Facebook ads, my view—at least for now—is that it is here to stay. "

(Credit:... [+] MARK RALSTON/AFP/Getty Images),"“The porn world is a magical place, it has rules and politics of its own creation, but it still falls victim to all of the struggles the “real” world faces,” writes porn actress Janice Griffith in a Medium blogpost this October. Griffith, best known for movies such as ‘Squirt in My Face,’ and ‘I Have a Wife,’ is referring to the discrimination and sexism that sex workers deal with on a daily basis.But porn actresses also suffer from a rather unique problem — not being able to spend their money on business-related services. Due to antiquated morality clauses, porn and cannabis fall under a similar umbrella, in legalese, where business such as banks can refuse to do business with them, meaning they become cash operations or are forced to use premium banking services with hefty fees.“[I’m] seen as lesser or “dirty” simply because you can see me naked online,” Griffith writes. “[But] porn and camming are an extremely visible sect of sex work that relies on advertising and consumption in ways that other traditional forms of sex work do not.”Hence the problem. Griffith, understandably, simply wants to be able to pay for ads, etc — and is frustrated at being thwarted. Enter the business opportunity, at least according to the brains behind SpankChain, a blockchain service built on the Ethereum platform.“Our belief is that payment channels are the key to near-term cryptocurrency adoption, and the adult industry is a perfect testing grounds for creating parallel economies that transcend the inefficiencies of legacy banking institutions,’ writes Spanktoshi Nakabooty, the creator of SpankChain. “Our immediate goal is to disrupt the adult cam industry by charging only a5% fee instead of the 50% industry standard and become the dominant cryptocurrency payment platform for the adult industry.”Nakabooty's excited about building this, but is also a realist — it won't be easy to get existing performers to switch platform — cam site operators already have established their revenue payment models. For reference, Nakabooty is likely a mashup of SpankChain's board, which includes software engineer turned blockchain founder Ameen Soleimani, software developer James Young, software developer James Wolever, plus a couple more engineers and salespeople. For clarity, I'll refer to everything as written by Nakabooty.An image of Bitcoin and US currencies is displayed on a screen. (ROSLAN RAHMAN/AFP/Getty Images)“Our bet is that there are a lot of models who would start their own camsites if they had a simple solution for payments and video streaming and that these upstart, community-owned camsites will use our services,” he wrote.This isn't the first time the cryptocurrency world has got involved with adult ventures — in 2014, Tit Coin launched, tagline “The Bitcoin for Porn,” and then there’s KenCoin (which had its ICO in July 2017) and SexCoin — all claiming to disrupt the adult entertainment business.“We’re not trying to promote pornography per se. We’re trying to promote a currency that is a conduit for that,” Titcoin founder Edward Mansfield told Vice.So far all of these have had moderate success, but it seems that SpankChain is hoping that getting porn performers on board to promote the service will get them the traction they need.“I haven’t seen many compelling reasons to use any of the current adult-specific ICOs,” says Lily Campbell, a porn producer and director at adult entertainment site Yanks.com. “The idea of cryptocurrency is definitely an attractive and logical quick jump- but it’s one that the general public hasn’t caught up to yet. As cryptocurrency gets more popular, I could see various ICOs becoming more accountable to their users — there is a big problem across the board with follow through from various ICOs —- and in turn becoming more useful in general to the adult market.”For Campbell, accountability is important if these adult cryptocurrency offerings are to take off —the privacy aspect might be appealing to a user, but as you’re doing so many extra steps, there has to be a good return. It’s obvious why porn performers would like this, but porn users.. not so much. “There’s almost no regulation to ICOs right now and they are really easy to make,” she says.After a couple months of tweaking, SpankChain and the associated Spank Coin (a ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain) are almost ready to be unveiled. Their ICO is scheduled for October 31st (it was originally planned for October 24th but the date was changed) the goal being to raise their first round through token sales, funding their longer-term goals of building their own camsite operation — “to bootstrap adoption of our platform,” it says in their whitepaper.Other company goals include Ethereum Webcam hardware, which includes a built-in wallet, VR apps and an adult matchmaking service, which matches couples based on their porn preferences. It’s a little all over the place, hence why Soleimani described this as a “crypto-economic powered adult entertainment ecosystem built on the Ethereum network,” which gives him leeway for future changes.“It’s our goal to make entrepreneurship within the adult entertainment so affordable and so easy that any individual entertainer can find a profitable home and audience for their content,”Nakabooty writes. “This is the first step on a long road of developing an entire ecosystem of interoperable services that will drive down the cost of launching and operating adult entertainment businesses, while also improving autonomy for performers.”But why would users sign up for this? Many adult sites, such as Brazzers.com have accepted cryptocurrency payments for years — so why do porn performers benefit from getting this specific?LAS VEGAS, NV - JANUARY 18: Adult film actress Kendra Lust picks up adult film actress Janice... [+] Griffith. (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)For Griffith, it’s about revenue. “Right now, on clip sites, performers like myself will make anywhere from 25–60% of the money we actually earn. Imagine getting only 25–60% of every check you ever made! But SpankChain is going to change that, because this decentralized system doesn’t have costly transaction fees, we’re able to completely eradicate the standard fees that exist today and establish payments structures that are much more reasonable.”That doesn't really answer the question, and seeing as Griffith is listed as a founding member of SpankChain, she's not exactly unbiased.

it's also useful in other areas of the business world. According to ...","Dec 15, 2017,12:48pm EST",Transparency creates trust.,"Blockchain technology is changing the way people do business. The buzzworthy technology is being used in a variety of corners of the business and technology industry and is poised for more widespread use.Blockchain is a distributed record of transactions, or other data, that is maintained by a computer network instead of being managed by a central authority. It’s the technology behind the popular cryptocurrency called bitcoin, but it’s also useful in other areas of the business world.According to business and technology firm, Accenture, investment banks could save up to $12B per year by adopting blockchain and smart contracts. The research published this year found that banks could reduce infrastructure costs by an average of 30%, and reduce costs associated with compliance by 50%.But it’s not just banks. There are a number of ways smart contracts can benefit business-to-business (B2B) companies as well.Smart contracts are digitally signed, self-executing, computable contracts between two or more parties. In the B2B realm, the terms of the agreements drawn up between buyers and sellers using smart contracts are written into lines of code. This code and the agreement laid out in the contract are stored within a distributed, decentralized blockchain network.Smart contracts help you exchange money, goods, services, property, shares or anything of value in a transparent, conflict-free way. Additionally, they cut out the necessity for the services of a middleman, and go a long way toward minimizing legal fees.""Businesses spend countless hours and immeasurable amounts of money on administrative costs, including: escrow, legal fees, time spent negotiating, etc. Smart contracts automate payments, making the entire process much more streamlined,” says Nick Allen, Product Director at Zap, a blockchain startup working to democratize data through smart contracts and a peer-to-peer marketplace. “Smart contracts are written in computer code (solidity, Serpent, etc.) that autonomously execute the terms of the contract once the specific predetermined conditions of the contract have been met.”This technology can disrupt and innovate a wide range of global industries, including finance, insurance, real estate, shipping and many more.“For example, with smart contracts, a participant is able to purchase flight insurance where they bond/stake 10% of the ticket’s cost in return for insurance on their purchase. In the event that the flight is cancelled, they receive a full refund of the cost of the ticket,” Allen says. “Furthermore, smart contracts make it possible for anyone to provide the insurance, thereby creating a peer-to-peer, transparent, and likely less expensive alternative to centralized insurance companies.”Blockchain smart contracts make transactions more secure and transparent. Because of the very nature of blockchain, there is no way to deceptively alter smart contracts once they are enacted, making them more binding than other contracts and more trustworthy.Smart contracts can also simplify transactions in other ways for B2B companies by streamlining the fulfillment process. For example, they can be used to innovate the transfer of digital goods from one company to another, by executing the transactions automatically. According to research by PricewaterhouseCoopers, by 2020, smart contracts will also be used to transfer physical goods from business to business.And by automating transactions, B2B companies will have more time to focus on other facets of their business, such as marketing, innovation and customer experience. Transactions are at the core of what B2B companies do, but by utilizing smart contracts they will be able to use finite resources to better the products or services they offer.One of the problems currently facing further implementation of blockchain in the business world is that there is still a lot of uncertainty around blockchain technology. Many people have heard about the risk associated with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies because it is currently unregulated in many markets, but this shouldn’t overshadow the potential of other blockchain innovations like smart contracts.Additionally, smart contracts will become stronger as more people begin to utilize them. Gartner, a technology research firm, estimates that by 2022, smart contracts will be used by more than 25% of global organizations.And companies like Zap and Jincor, another blockchain technology company, are making it easier for B2B companies to get in on the innovation. These companies have created platforms that allow anyone, regardless of technical expertise to create and manage smart contracts.“The largest roadblock regarding the usability of smart contracts is the lack of outside (off-chain data) integration, also known as the oracle problem,” Allen says. “Zap solves this problem and makes it easy to connect off-chain data to smart contracts through an easy to use, open marketplace for data.""Smart contracts provide a unique opportunity for B2B companies looking to grow. Companies can capitalize on this innovative technology and use it to automate transactions and reduce friction in their day-to-day operations.

ESET Bad Rabbit ...","Oct 24, 2017,05:39pm EDT",The Bad Rabbit ransomware is asking users to visit a Tor network page to pay for their files.,"Remember the last time ransomware exploded into life out of Ukraine? It started with a hack of a little-known software company called MeDoc, whose tools were tainted with the NotPetya strain of ransomware that eventually spread across the globe to hit major companies like Maersk and FedEx. Now hackers have borrowed code from the Petya ransomware again and are hitting global organizations with it.But this time they've compromised a handful of Russian news media outlets and other websites to spread what appears to be new ransomware, dubbed Bad Rabbit after the dark web-based site where the crooks are demanding payment to unlock victim PCs.Early victims include the Kiev Metro service, as reported by local media, as well as Russian media organizations Interfax, which tweeted Tuesday it was to publish via Facebook whilst its site was down, and Fontanka.ru, as reported to Forbes by Russian cybersecurity firm Group-IB. The Ukrainian Computer Emergency Response Team said Odessa Airport was also hit, as the former warned of ""a possible start of a new wave of cyberattacks to Ukraine's information resources,"" while Ukraine's finance and infrastructure departments were targeted.Victims are being redirected to a website on the Tor network, named Bad Rabbit. They're being asked to cough up 0.05 Bitcoin (worth around $286.20 at the time of publication) in order to unlock their files.This is the screen Bad Rabbit victims see, asking them to pay for access to their data.According to Kaspersky Lab and Group-IB, the infections were caused by users visiting certain Russian media websites, from which a fake Adobe Flash Player installer was disseminated. The user had to click on a malicious link to become infected.Kaspersky said it had spied almost 200 individual targets, though didn't offer more information on them. Costin Raiu, head of the Russian company's research team, said the attackers had been breaking into various European websites since July, while Group-IB noted the hacked websites were last tinkered with on October 19.It appears the attackers behind #Badrabbit have been busy setting up their infection network on hacked sites since at least July 2017. pic.twitter.com/fV5U1FeVtR— Costin Raiu (@craiu) October 24, 2017Researcher Lukas Stefanko, from Czech firm ESET, initially tweeted that the malware, once on a computer, used the EternalBlue exploit in the leaked Shadow Brokers files (believed to have been written by the NSA for attacks on Microsoft Windows PCs). Forbes has since confirmed that was not the case. The hackers did use Windows SMB feature as EternalBlue did, but in a different, malicious manner. They also used exploits of WebDAV, the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning extensions to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that allow for collaborative editing between users across a network. And in a blog ESET reported that the Mimikatz tool was being used to pilfer passwords from the affected systems so the attackers could travel around machines on victim networks. All of these techniques together helped the malware self-propagate.When EternalBlue was put to use by the WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware, it helped the malware spread quickly across networks. That EternalBlue program, was leaked by a shady hacker crew called the Shadow Brokers earlier this year and was believed to have been developed by the NSA.Intriguing linksRight now, the attack isn't going global as fast as NotPetya and WannaCry outbreaks did. Countries where infected PCs were found included Russia, Ukraine, Germany, Turkey, Bulgaria, Poland and South Korea.""According to our data, most of the victims targeted by these attacks are located in Russia,"" said Vyacheslav Zakorzhevsky, head of the anti-malware research team at Kaspersky Lab, which also claimed to have seen targets in Germany.""Based on our investigation, this has been a targeted attack against corporate networks, using methods similar to those used during the [NotPetya] attack. However, we cannot confirm it is related to [NotPetya].""But, subsequently, Kaspersky's Raiu told Forbes there was a connection. Earlier this year Kaspersky found a news website in Ukraine distributing NotPetya (bahmut.com.ua), he explained. ""We followed the path and found a network of other hacked sites that worked in the same way, except they weren't distributing anything back in July. Some time ago the injected scripts in all these sites changed to a new IP and earlier today they started distributing the Bad Rabbit ransomware.""Group-IB also claimed a slice of the Bad Rabbit code - a basic process algorithm - was almost exactly the same as NotPetya. ""The difference is only in the initial vector and used compiler,"" said spokesperson Evgeny Gukov.Given links were previously found between the NotPetya and the hackers who took out Ukrainian power grids in 2015 and 2016 (widely assumed to be Russian government-sponsored), it makes for one murky situation."

Disclosure: I own some bitcoin ...","Sep 20, 2017,04:42pm EDT",Yuri Milner. ,"Billionaire tech investor Yuri Milner wants to use a giant laser to blast small silicon chips deep into space. He’s trying “to answer one of the most existential questions,” he told Forbes assistant managing editor Kerry Dolan at the annual Forbes 400 Summit on Philanthropy on Tuesday. “Are we alone in the universe?”Last year Milner funded a $100 million “Breakthrough Starshot” project to test the feasibility of the light-sail approach. He brought on Stephen Hawking and Mark Zuckerberg as board members. It’s an unusual cause to take on, even for a Silicon Valley mogul, and the potential payoff would be decades away. “Philanthropy is a very broad space. 99% of it should focus on what people need today,” he said at the event. “At the same time, there should be a relatively small amount — less than 1% — that would explore more outward kinds of things.” Milner, whose investment firm DST Global once owned 8% of Facebook, thinks his project has slim odds of answering the big question, but the upside is so big that he can’t resist trying. “The chances we’ll find something in the next 10 years are 1%,” he said. “But the significance is such that, if you multiply 1% by the significance, it’s worth it.”Private investment in space exploration has grown over the past fifteen years, from Milner’s Breakthrough Starshot to Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin. Meanwhile, U.S. government investment in the field has stagnated. The current state of public funding is a far cry from six decades ago, when the country spent more than $100 billion in today’s dollars to send astronauts to the moon. “Somehow, that was possible in the 1960s. Some of it was probably Cold War fears with the country where I was born,” Milner said. Since government spending has declined, private companies and backers like Milner are stepping in to fill the gap.Breakthrough Starshot aims to send tiny, quarter-inch by quarter-inch devices containing cameras and transmitters to the closest star system to Earth, Alpha Centauri. It’s four light years — or 25 trillion miles — away. To get there, Milner wants to use a laser that would need to be an astonishing one kilometer by one kilometer in size. To launch each “StarChip,” the laser would blast it for a few minutes, causing it to fly one-fifth the speed of light, Milner said. The chip would take 20 years to arrive. More traditional spaceships are useless in this effort because they move way too slowly. Even today’s fastest spacecraft would take 30,000 years to travel the same distance. Once the star chip arrived, it would beam back images to Earth using its small laser. Technological developments over the past 10 years have made this possible. “If we didn’t have iPhones, we wouldn’t’ be able to do this,” Milner said. “Billions of dollars have been spent on making things smaller and moving information faster through lasers.”  Breakthrough Starshot is just a testing phase for the larger, more expensive projects of building the laser and setting a stream of chips on their path to Alpha Centauri. So 55-year-old Milner will need to wait decades before he comes within striking distance of answering his question. “I hope you live a long life,” Forbes’ Kerry Dolan told him. He’s okay with the wait, he said. “Maybe just to see the launch is enough.” "

have become popular, thousands of groups of developers have ...","Oct 2, 2017,09:15am EDT",Shutterstock,"Over the last several years, as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have become popular, thousands of groups of developers have attempted to launch digital assets. In the last year or so, the number of them being issued in crowdsales called initial coin offerings accelerated to the point that, in 2017, according to data by CoinDesk, $1.5 billion has so far been raised from the crowd — more than twice the $695 million in venture capital funding into blockchain startups.But one question hovered over these token sales: In the United States, would such offerings be deemed securities?In July, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a report stating that some crypto tokens may fit the definition of securities and would therefore be subject to certain investor disclosure and registration requirements. It used what is called the Howey test (more on that below) to define which offerings would be labeled securities.But the report left many questions unanswered, particularly around what the crypto community has taken to calling “utility tokens” — multidimensional coins which function only partially as a sort of equity in a network, whose value results from a mix of speculation in the asset and the demand for their use in that network. For instance, a token that powers a decentralized storage network, if it’s structured correctly, should grow in value as usage of storage on the network increases. However, unlike company stock, its value wouldn’t derive from any one corporate entity but from all the activity by a variety of actors on this open source network. In contrast to utility tokens, security tokens — coins that, like traditional securities, represent shares in an entity similar to company stock or shares in a limited partnership — don’t have any additional utility beyond representing the value of the fund and the profits would depend on the promoter.Monday, Marco Santori, one of the most prominent lawyers specializing in blockchains and a partner at Cooley, and Juan Benet and Jesse Clayburgh of Protocol Labs, a startup working on building decentralized open source internet protocols which was behind the biggest ICO so far this year, Filecoin, released a white paper, “The SAFT Project: Toward a Compliant Token Sale Framework,” arguing that most utility tokens are not securities once their blockchain-based networks have been launched, but that coins sold before the network launch are.Marco Santori, partner at Cooley“I think almost all pre-functional tokens result in a security per U.S. law,” says Santori, noting that this is a controversial stance in a world in which so many token sales occur before the issuers have launched a network. “Just because utility tokens will one day have a consumptive use, does that remove them from security status prior to that use? On its face, the answer is no.”To determine how traditional securities regulation applies to tokens, the SEC and other legal minds have used the four-pronged Howey Test, derived from the SEC vs. W.J. Howey Co. case, which states that a security is an investment contract in which a person 1) invests their money 2) in a common enterprise 3) with an expectation of profits 4) based on the efforts of the promoter or a third party. In order to be considered a security, an offering must meet all four prongs.The fourth prong is the one that prompts the authors to assert that tokens sold pre-network launch are securities while tokens for functional networks are not. They write that this prong “asks ‘whether the efforts made by those other than the investor are the undeniably significant ones, those essential managerial efforts which affect the failure or success of the enterprise.’” To answer that question, they say the purchasers of already-functional tokens include two groups: those who wish to use the token (and thus not driven by a profit motive) and speculators who are. However, they argue, citing previous cases involving silver bars, futures contracts for gold coins and a futures contract for sugar, that the profits that speculators expect are not driven by the entity that created the network but the fluctuations in the market. Though they concede that tokens differ from silver, gold and sugar in the sense that the price of the tokens could still be influenced by the developers who launched it, they assert that the “essential” efforts were already exerted prior to the token launch and state, “It would be difficult to argue that any improvement on an already-functional token is an ‘essential’ managerial effort.” In their view, the value of a token would be influenced by a variety of factors, including not just any upgrades performed by the developers but trends in the network’s industry and news events. “For functional utility tokens, mere price appreciation on a secondary market is not a substitute for the essential managerial efforts of others,” they write.“For a token redeemable for a box of razor blades, once people are using this token to buy razor blades, there are all kinds of things that can affect the price of that token — worker strikes, the price of steel or the fashionability of beards is one light-hearted example,” says Santori. “Is that to say the developers have no effect on the price of a token? No, of course not, that’s not true. When developers develop a token, most continue to update the thing, and sometimes announcements from the issuers will move the price, but is that the undeniably significant efforts? Against all the possible geopolitical business events that could move the market, that becomes just one of many different factors.”However, they believe that the expectation of profit from pre-functional tokens does depend on the efforts of the promoter or third-party: “The application of the technical and managerial efforts of the seller is likely the predominant factor in the price of a pre-functional utility token until it transitions to being a functional utility token,” they write. (Santori cites some exceptions: tokens that aren’t good for speculation because they, for instance, include an automatic depreciation mechanism for non-use.) Because, pre-network, agreements to buy tokens are securities, the white paper proposes using so-called SAFTs, simple agreements for future tokens, which “provides investors with the right to fully-functional utility tokens, delivered once the network is created and the tokens are functional,” write Benet, Clayburgh and Santori. Protocol Labs introduced SAFTs (which they used for the Filecoin crowdsale) earlier this year along with the announcement of CoinList, and other early-stage crypto investors such as hedge fund Polychain Capital had independently come up with similar contracts based on Y Combinator’s SAFE (simple agreement for future equity).While some critics might decry the notion that, despite the democratizing opportunity blockchains provide, early-stage returns in crypto assets should be limited to the already-wealthy and perpetuate the forces in society that have fueled the widening of the wealth gap, Santori says SAFT purchasers take on enterprise risk — “the risk that the whole enterprise may fail if the thing never gets developed, and that is what the investor protection laws are for that are administered by the SEC.” However, everyday retail investors purchasing tokens take on product risk, “the risks of a consumer,” he says. “They’re not risking that this will never, ever get developed but that once they get this thing … it doesn’t function the way it’s supposed to function.” For instance, he said, a purchaser of a Tesla risks the engine not working, “but I haven’t bet the entire value of my purchase on the success of Tesla.” If regulators agree that token purchasers take on product risk, then their actions would be governed by consumer protection laws and the FTC or State Attorneys General. Santori says that this setup would still “achieve the policy goals of that distinction between investor and consumer protection. … We find the SAFT framework obeys the letter of the law without just finding legal loopholes. It’s also in harmony with the policy goals driving the letter of the law.”He also notes that that objection to the fact that the SAFT framework would exclude non-accredited investors “is really an objection to the U.S. securities laws, not the SAFT framework. Don’t shoot the messenger. … If that’s your objection, you should take that up with Uncle Sam — not with us.” (The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) Also, he adds, “Under the SAFT framework, you can still participate financially in the growth of this network earlier on than you could have had the token been a security. Yeah, you can’t buy Bitcoin at 20 cents under the SAFT framework -- if Satoshi had done a token sale -- but you could probably buy it at $6 and you’d be doing OK.” Conceding that it might be possible to get tokens their own legal regime, he says, “for now, I think this is the best we have.”Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center, a blockchain advocacy group, cautions that the SAFT Project is only one way to interpret existing laws and that how securities law will apply to tokens will not be determined until judges rule on individual cases. “We rely on people who pre-sell a distribution of tokens to ultimately build the decentralized network that would deliver the underlying functionality of the token in the long run and that reliance does look like something like the kind of reliance we have on a normal issuer of a security,” he says. “But a similar reliance occurs when someone pre-sells watches on Kickstarter or pre-sells access to a video game universe on Indiegogo. You’re still relying on them to make the product they’re promising, and then the open question with respect to securities laws is, so is this more like a crowdfund for a product to a crowdfund for equity.” And that question would be determined on a case by case basis.He says this white paper presents a route for projects that don’t want to become the case that defines the law. “The paper represents, what if we don’t want to be the case that proves that we were selling securities? Because then, oh, good, now we have clear law, but oh, bad, I’m the one who helped bring that clarity by virtue of being prosecuted for being an unregistered securities promoter.”Van Valkenburgh also said that there could be an argument made that even pre-network, many tokens may not be securities. “There are all kinds of useful items sold by a company before they’re produced or developed and they may even be transferrable like game memberships or you could a smart watch campaign and you nay buy a bunch of them because you know there will be a bottleneck in production and you will sell them to your friends. None of those are securities, and if we really do believe the underlying token is a useful item — something that primarily has a consumptive use value or a commercial purchase — then it is something you would in theory be able to sell in advance of its creation,” he says.Critics such as English lawyer Preston Byrne in the blockchain space who blogs frequently on whether crypto tokens are securities scoff at the notion that a thing could be categorized as a security one day and then no longer be labeled as such the next. “You can’t really call a token one thing today to obtain the benefit of a safe harbor, and then reclassify it as something else tomorrow because you want to trade it,”  he wrote in an August blog post. Santori rebuts that argument by saying, “The SAFT doesn’t become the token. There is no existential metaphysical continuum where this pdf file become an entry on a decentralized ledger. That’s not how the world works. And frankly, that’s not how the Howey test works.”Coin Center doesn’t hold the same position as the authors of the white paper, because it contends that if something really has consumptive use purposes, they shouldn’t  only be sold to accredited investors. However, Van Valkenburgh finds the SAFT “a reasonable approach to uncertainty” for projects that don’t want to be the guinea pig for how securities law applies to utility tokens. “If you ever want to find someone who’s reasonable, find someone who’s got people who are yelling at them from both ideological spectrums,” he says. “Both the people who are super-anent on everything being treated as a security are yelling at people doing a SAFT and people who are super-intent on nothing being a security if it’s a token say that a SAFT is a bad idea. Maybe if they’re shooting at you, you’re doing something right.”Be sure to get Forbes' twice-weekly all things blockchain email newsletter, Crypto Confidential! Sign up here."

fallout from security breaches at Equifax, and the manic swings of Bitcoin.","Dec 19, 2017,08:39am EST","As we say goodbye to 2017, it is time to take a collective deep breath and reflect on the past year. 2017 was defined by profound changes, challenges, and inspiring achievements—especially with regard to enterprise software and the freelance economy. It's prediction season and before we can look ahead to 2018, we have to see how well our 2017 predictions panned out.","Last year’s predictions were pretty spot on:These trends will all continue throughout 2018 - the upcoming year poses compelling opportunities and excitement and more opportunity to prove our powers of prediction!  So bring on 2018...The theme for 2018 is trust. The last twelve months have seen seismic cultural shifts in politics and entertainment, the fallout from security breaches at Equifax, and the manic swings of Bitcoin. The public is left exhausted and wary of just about everything. The resulting mindfulness will impact the 57+ million people who freelance in some form or fashion and the thousands of businesses around the world looking for new and creative ways to empower their extended workforce. Enterprises, workers, and customers all benefit from a transparent system that values and promotes integrity.So, without further ado, here are my 5 predictions for the freelance economy in 2018:1. Cybersecurity Scrutiny: Every week of 2017 brought a new cybersecurity revelation. Russia hacked the DNC, China hacked the DOD, and internet privacy appears to be DOA. The new year will continue this trend. In the wake of the Equifax and Uber hacks, a major trusted company or government agency will concede that they too have been hacked. Something businesses can do immediately is to only use platforms with rigorous security standards. SOC 2 isn’t required for a freelancing platform, but in 2018 smart companies will decide that SOC2 compliance is an essential for conducting business and protecting their most sensitive data.2. Data Will Rule: Next year, vendor management systems (VMS) and HR management information systems (HRMIS) will better connect the dots and talk to each other seamlessly. The integration of these technologies empowers enterprises to not only track when and where a worker is, but also the volume and frequency of work, satisfaction levels, on-time percentages, hourly rates, other key data points. These granular details will help businesses and workers eliminate inefficiencies and streamline workflows while improving the quality of SLAs and customer satisfaction.3. 1099 Workers’ Comp Revolution: The employer-worker dynamic will forever change in 2018 as businesses forgo government regulation and protect themselves through mechanisms like WorkMarket’s 1099 workers’ compensation. Antiquated laws and attitudes about the freelance economy are giving way to the reality of independent contracting as a mainstream way of life. Both employers and 1099 contractors will enthusiastically embrace insurance policies that protect businesses and individuals from the consequences of workplace accidents and injuries.  4. 34 is the new 50: A few years ago the conventional labor analyst’s go-to-take was that “50% of the workforce will freelance by 2020”. As we called last year, this has stopped, but what will take its place?  What is the composition of the workforce going to be?  There is a complex equation around cost, IP, business process, regulation, institutional knowledge and many other factors.  The outcome of the equation determines your labor force mix between freelance, temps and W2.  In 2018 people will start to understand that without fundamental regulatory reform few things change the labor equation and the 34% range that has held the last few years is here to stay.5. Enterprises Embrace workOS: In 2018, enterprises will demand that freelancer engagement is automated, centralized, and intelligent. From worker procurement to vetting, compliance, drug testing, payments, and the spectrum of local legal requirements, enterprises will seek a single source of truth on a user-friendly, comprehensive platform. The next twelve months will see a significant rise in companies—from Nokia and Walmart to Accenture and P&G—adopting workOS to organize their workforces and manage productivity.And there you go. I hope you are looking forward to the next year as much as I am. Between AI, blockchain, and whatever Elon Musk is up to—automation and digital technology aren’t just changing the modern enterprise, but are impacting everyday people’s lives. With a mobile device anyone can join the workforce, and take command of their destiny. Happy New Year!"

[+] anti-virus companies started blocking it.,"A ""legal botnet"" might seem like an oxymoronic statement. At best, it's risky phrasing. Most associate ""botnets"" with hordes of hacked computers controlled by a hidden botmaster with monstrous machinations, more often than not illicit profiteering.But ""legal botnet"" was the term used by Russian developer Alexey Khripkov (who also goes by oxothuk, amongst other names) when describing his access to hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of Android devices thanks to his wildly popular games on Google's platform. His plan to monetise those games was via a crytocurrency miner, which would use up the phone's computing power in the background to carry out the mathematical puzzles required to unlock coins of various alternative currencies, mainly Magicoin. In recent months, he added the capability to Puzzle, a game with 10 million downloads, hoping all those users would help him turn a tidy sum.Khripkov's plans have been scuppered, however. In recent days, anti-virus companies started blocking Puzzle, deciding the mining was malicious, as noted by cybersecurity researchers at Ixia, which published a blog on the developer's work Tuesday. Subsequently, he chose to remove the feature entirely, giving users the option to download another app, Reward Digger, that would give them in-game bonuses for helping him mine coins. But he says Google banned that app soon after Forbes' contact with him on Tuesday, leading him to suspect security researchers' warnings to the Android maker were causing him strife. (Google had not provided comment at the time of publication, neither on whether it had removed the app or, if so, why. Whatever the case, Reward Digger is no longer available on the Play market).Google killed the Reward Digger app that had a cryptocurrency mining feature, according to its... [+] developer.The developer, who also has two games on Apple's App Store (though without mining features, he said), has chosen not to risk deploying the mining code in his other apps, such as his most popular creation Mind Games, with between 10 million and 50 million downloads, or a crossword game with between five and 10 million.'No criminal hacker here'Khripkov isn't happy about the attack on what he sees as a completely legal method of making some money. Speaking with Forbes over email and Skype from Moscow, Khripkov was entirely transparent about his work, saying he was no malevolent hacker, just a legitimate developer trying to make a living.""'Legal botnet' is only words. It means I have control over thousands of devices,"" he said, responding to questions about the phrase, which he'd previously used on a Bitcoin forum earlier this year. ""I do not do any evil things like illegal botnets... In my app you can control mining, you enable if it's acceptable for you or disable if you do not want it. It is not hidden for users, so it is fully legal.""How my miner works in my app: users choose in settings the intensity of mining, then put the phone on charge. Now the app will wait until the phone is fully changed and start mining altcoins... If the phone [runs out of battery] or overheats, the mining stops.""So, everyone is happy, users receive in-game bonuses, the developer gets ... revenue. It is not a lot, but compared to zero it is good.""As for the anti-virus companies blocking his apps, he feels only antipathy: ""Anti-viruses are more evil than legal cryptominers... They scare people with false threats, but do not protect from real attacks."" He explained his thinking: anti-virus companies don't block apps that ask for access to a device's SD card memory, and can thereby acquire a lot of sensitive data from cellphones, but they kill silent mining that doesn't involve any information being potentially compromised, just some power being used up.Cybersecurity researchers don't see it that way. They see his actions as purposefully misleading and malicious. Whilst Khripkov claimed to have provided a disclaimer directly to the user as soon as they opened Puzzle (published in the image below), informing them of the mining, Ixia principal security researcher Stefan Tanase said he saw no such warning when he downloaded the app.A disclaimer from the developer of Puzzle on the Android app's use of cryptocurrency mining.""Crypto miners are the new adware, at least this is how I see it,"" said Tanase. ""It's technically legal (if disclosed), but they are incentivised to trick users into accepting mining on their devices... If Google allows such behavior, soon all free apps in the Play Store will feature coin miners.""Thanks to anxiety around his ""legal botnets,"" Khripov hasn't been able to make much money from his miners so far. Indeed, he said that despite having as many as 103,000 live installs across his applications, and tens of millions of historical downloads, only 5,000 had enabled the feature. A cryptocurrency account found by Tanase showed Khripov earned the equivalent of $1,150 in Magicoin as of Tuesday. The developer was mainly focused on Magicoin, as well as Feathercoin and Vertcoin, amongst other lesser-known, alternative currencies (better known as altcoins).Google's crypto mining messBut other developers have already joined the game by shoving cryptocurrency miners on apps and flogging them over Google Play. Just last week, Avast security researcher Nikolaos Chrysaidos found a ""Cooee"" chat app that, whilst it only scored between 1,000 and 5,000 downloads, had made it onto Play and was, without permission, carrying out mining for Monero, a cryptocurrency with strong privacy promises. Monero is often used by privacy-conscious folk as well as dealers on criminal online forums.Khripkov also said he'd shared his mining code with other developers, which could explain the number of apps containing code referencing his oxothuk nickname that have also been called out by anti-virus firms such as Trend Micro in recent weeks.Similar mining features have found their way onto websites in recent months too, quietly borrowing compute power of visitors, whether on their phones or PCs. Security firm AdGuard claimed in October that as many as 500 million people were being used as part of giant networks of miners, with 220 of the world's 100,000 most popular websites getting users to join in their hidden money-making operations. As much as $43,000 in Monero had been made in just three weeks by whoever ran the sites.At least Khripkov has, on the face of it, attempted to remain transparent about his work. It's a matter of opinion, therefore, as to whether his mining was malicious or not. Others will not be as clear in their intentions."

Because this is the 21st century, we don't want plastic bobbles and bags of popcorn in our stockings, we want tech.Some of us also don't have stockings (Hanukkah over here) or don't celebrate the holidays at all. That's fine. But there are office parties, apartment gatherings, co-op get-together and a billion other reasons to get someone a last minute tech gift. The key is not spending too much money while still finding something cute and with at least a sliver of functionality. Well, in the spirit of the holidays, I have scoured Amazon (and some of my recent product reviews) to find you some fantastic last minute tech gifts that will hopefully absolve you of being that person that usually just grabs Starbucks gift cards by the dozen.Also see: VAVA Dash Cam Launches With App And Battery UpgradesWyzeCamThe WyzeCam is an affordable little smart home camera. Coming in at a mere $20 a pop, it makes a great gift for the mildly paranoid but terribly cheap person in your life. The WyzeCam captures 1080p full HD video, has time lapse, night vision, live streaming video, continuous recording to microSD card(s), smart sound recognition to identify carbon monoxide and smoke alarm noises, 2-way audio, motion detection and alerts. Not to mention a pretty comprehensive companion app. The WyzeCam is available now.Amazon Echo DotSpeaking about smart home stuff, the Amazon Echo Dot is on sale for $30 right now. This is a great gift for yourself if you already have Amazon Alexa but get your best ideas while sitting on the toilet and need to immediately shout to a device that is listening to the tail end of your Chipotle experience. I still have mixed emotions about smart home devices, I don't even like my neighbors hearing my door slam, much less a massive tech corporation having any sort of insight into my life, shopping habits and weird middle of the night queries that I usually just anonymously Google.Bluetooth Fidget SpinnerWhether or not the fidget spinner craze has come to a close is yet to be determined. There is still a market for these things, especially as they continue to evolve. The consensus in development seems to be ""how can we make these things more annoying?"" Well, that question has been answered with comprehensive selection of Bluetooth fidget spinners that play music. Because that's not a disruption to anyone around you at all. This makes a great gift for your nieces, nephews or grandchildren because you know the kids will enjoy it and you'll get that quiet satisfaction of annoying your relatives through their children and not having to actually deal with their angst.ROBiTSThis one isn't actually tech, but it's kind of named after robots so we'll allow it. A card game developed by Screech Dragon Studios, you can get it for for $15 on Amazon. While it's not entirely a competitive game, it is a fun, quick card drafting and set collection game. The game is well designed with creative little robotic parts that need to be assembled (in visual card form). It's good for both children of all ages or inebriated adults, also of all ages.UV BlacklightNothing says hours of endless fun like a UV black light. While this one for a mere $11 bills itself as a tool for identifying where your pet urinated on the carpet (and also can be used as nail dryer) you know that that's where the fun starts, not where it ends. You can be guaranteed that whomever you give this great tool to will have hours of endless entertainment scouring their house for hidden stains. Makes a great gift for any compulsive cleaners or basic neat freaks who have slighted you in some way. Like making you use a coaster.The first comment on Amazon pretty much sums up how great gifting a black light can be.""NEVER take this into a hotel room... just don't... please please don't.... it's everywhere... just... everywhere... what happened in here? How many films have been shot here... oh my goodness, it's on the tv... how'd they get it on the tv.... I'm just going to sleep in my car....""Silicone Keyboard SkinIn keeping with the theme of humans being disgusting animals who can't keep their dead skin, fluids and food crumbs to themselves, might I suggest a silicone keyboard skin? This is the gift that says ""I've been to your house and have seen the plastic on the furniture"" while also acknowledging that the person you are gifting this to makes Swamp Thing huggable. We know you like to eat at your desk but your keyboard contains at least three meals, fingernails and an entire Werther's Original. These keyboard covers are available for equally dirty Mac and PC users.Mini Quadcopter DroneThere is an endless supply of tiny drones available, and for some reason, these things still hold a modicum of entertainment. While I struggle to control even the simplest of drones, toys such as this Cheerson CX-10 Mini RC Quadcopter for $19 still hold the attention of anyone nimble enough to control it. This is the type of cheap drone that you toss in the air to fly, at which point it angles across the room and either smashes into or lands behind the TV mount. Nothing says holiday spirit like flipping out on your neighbors kid for flying the dumb drone you just gave him into your brand new flat screen. Is that a missing pixel? Is that a missing pixel?Touch Screen GlovesIt's cold outside and your brand new Apple iPhone X doesn't respond to your equally freezing touch. While some of us happily use our rugged CAT phone in all-weather conditions, most of the population prefers glam over function. If you have someone in your life who laments having to wait until they get out of the cold to reply ""totes adorbs"" to that text they just got, perhaps purchase them these touchscreen gloves. A cheap way to say ""I know you so well that I don't even bother speaking to you in any way other than emojis"".BitcoinsAs the value of Bitcoin continues to surge, more and more people are becoming curious about the blockchain currency. There is a depth to trying to explain Bitcoin and other ICOs to n00bs, so don't bother. Instead, carry around a pocketful of these actual Bitcoins and hand them one. They'll think they hit the lottery (as Bitcoin is currently around $18k) and you'll get the satisfaction of knowing the copper coin you just gave them equates to a Chuck-E-Cheese token, but can't be used for Skee Ball. This makes a great gift for your older relatives who keep asking you what Bitcoin is and your co-workers who talk about because they downloaded Coinbase and read one article about it. Handing them a physical Bitcoin of no value is a great way to ferret out the poseurs.USB Flash DriveListen, it's been a rough year. For obvious and perhaps less-than-obvious reasons. If your soul has been drained of energy and just life in general, you might not feel like gifting at all. Yet, somewhere there is a glimmer of hope that perhaps not all is lost. Well, if that is the case then this standard but always useful USB thumb drive is the gift that says ""I might have no soul left to give, so I got you this instead. Feel free to store data related to your exciting life on it"". No matter how dark things get, we'll always need something we can drop in a sewer grate then lament later that we had a flash drive with that cool new band's FLAC files on it, but lost it.Whatever you celebrate, whomever you celebrate it with — don't show up empty handed. No one will judge you for wrapping your gift in duct tape and cardboard, but they will judge you if it's another gift card that you forgot to activate. If you really want to subvert the gift giving season, hand someone a container full of Juicero bags. You'll be scorned, but you'll also be a legend."

(LFIN) surged since its IPO as links to blockchain were highlighted (link).  It too is well off those intraday highs which were set on  day with an unusually large number of trading halts.The stock that originally caught my attention on how well direct involvement in cryptocurrencies could impact stocks was  Overstock.com (OSTK) which traded in a range of $14 and $18 from March of 2016 until the summer of 2017.  It has since broken out of that range and was trading above $70 earlier today.I do not know enough about these companies or their strategies to have an opinion on their businesses nor the market reaction, but I do think investors need to be watching.   Like so many things with cryptocurrencies, those who are believers will point to these moves as validation of the technology and the opportunity and the detractors will argue that this is what bubble mania looks like.  .The original link between markets and cryptocurrencies were the rise of some tech stocks tied to the equipment required to mine cryptocurrencies.  We also saw some positive reactions in financials once they announced plans to plan a plan in the crypto space.  It seems if anything, the links between blockchain technology and equity markets are accelerating.I'm seeing an increasing number of stories about cryptocurrency mining energy use (link).  I don't know whether those stories are exaggerated or not.  I don't know whether the rise in energy prices has any link to mining or not, but this seems like another area where crypto's impact on the world is increasing.Figuring out the impact of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology seems to be more and more important for making investment decision ranging from equities to commodities.  That is the one lesson we should all take away from these stories."

or Trump's tweets. I have little doubt that the Bitcoin bubble will 
burst, ...","Dec 22, 2017,10:56am EST","Time again to take out my crystal ball (or magic eight-ball) and have a little fun predicting what will happen next year. These predictions are in no particular order (and please remember that these are predictions of what I think will happen, not necessarily what I want to happen; click here to see how I did with my 2017 Top 10 Predictions):","10 - The Mueller investigation will continue throughout the year, and might not even finish before the year is over. Trump will not be indicted, however, it is possible that one of his sons or his son-in-law will be. If that indeed happens, Trump will issue a pardon(s), setting up a messy confrontation with Democrats. In other words, the turmoil surrounding the Trump Administration and the Russia investigation will continue unabated.9 - Despite making gains, the Democrats will fail to win the majority of seats in the House of Representatives, and Nancy Pelosi will be replaced as Minority Leader (this might actually not happen until early 2019 when the new Congress is seated, but its inevitability will become apparent soon after the election). The Republicans will slightly increase their majority in the Senate. The map highly favors the Republicans (with more Democratic seats up), so even though the majority will increase, it will not seem like a victory because they will not win as many seats as they could have.8 - The Republican party will continue to splinter, and the primary season will be very ugly with numerous in-party challenges. The Democrats will struggle internally as well, as the liberal wing (led by Warren and Sanders) will continue to buck the rest of the party. This latter divide is another reason why the Democrats will once again be the minority party in both Houses. No clear Democratic candidate for President will emerge, leaving both parties in disarray at the end of the year. Political turmoil continues.7 - If tax reform doesn't pass by the end of this year (which it probably will but just had not when this was posted), it will pass early next year, but no major infrastructure or other significant legislation will pass in 2018, as election-year gridlock will begin earlier than usual. The Republicans will cite Democratic obstructionism as their election cry while the Democrats will highlight the lack of Republican legislative successes. Get ready for a fun Fall!6 - Despite rampant speculation at the end of the upcoming Supreme Court term, Justice Stevens will not retire. Short of an unexpected death, Trump will be denied another Supreme Court nomination next year.5 - On the international scene, there will be elections in the U.K as the May government will fall as negotiations over Brexit stall and get contentious (this prediction was written before the recent set back when Parliament bucked May and legislated that it must okay any final plan). Merkel will put together a coalition and remain as Chancellor in Germany. There will little to no progress on Middle East peace and Assad will remain in power in Syria. Tension with Russia will continue, and I wouldn't be surprised to see Russia get more involved in Venezuela, filling the void created by the current political vacuum.4 - With ISIS losing most of its land, there will continue to cause havoc with lone wolf attacks across the globe; trucks/cars will continue to be the weapon of choice. While the odds of a second Arab Spring have increased with Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, it will not happen and the protests will dwindle over time. The odds are good that Trump will pull out of the Iran nuclear agreement when its recertification comes due, further alienating the U.S. from its allies (following the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and the declaration to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem).3 - For financial services, the biggest threat to stability is the current Bitcoin mania. Nothing was able to derail the market in 2017 - not North Korea, terrorism or Trump's tweets. I have little doubt that the Bitcoin bubble will burst, the real question is if it will cause any large scale systematic reactions. At this point, I am going to say that it won't and that as people realize the dangers of Bitcoin and perhaps calls for regulation increase, and become closer to reality, cool heads will prevail and realize that it is an isolated incident and not part of a larger problem with the financial system.2 - Despite the political gridlock, given the positive trajectory of corporate profits, the market will continue to do well. However, there will be a correction of at least 10% at some point during the year, and while the major indices will end the year in positive territory, it will be single rather than double-digit gains. Emerging and European markets will rise about the same as the U.S. markets. Technology will lag the overall market while financials will lead. There will only be 2 interest rate hikes - not 3.1 - And turning to sports, the Olympics in South Korea will go off without a hitch, despite the worries over current tensions with North Korea. Clemson will win the NCAA football national championship, beating Oklahoma. The Patriots will beat the Vikings in the Super Bowl. (I know - I probably just jinxed them!) Duke will win the NCAA basketball championship, Tampa Bay will win the Stanley Cup, the Warriors will repeat as NBA champions and the NY Yankees will win the World Series."

China bonds are a buy, says Jan Dehn, head of research at the Ashmore Group. That might be one of the tamest of the firm's top picks for 2018. (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP/Getty Images)","Jan Dehn is the type that doesn't back down from a Twitter war with FT reporters. Don't trash on his beloved emerging markets (EM), or you're going to get an earful in 150 characters. It's almost personal. China hard landing? Hogwash. Yes, the debt levels are higher than ever. We know. But China's bond market is opening and is investment grade. Chinese companies — and the government — are going to find buyers.Belarussian B rated debt: who wants it? ""I love it. We have been actively invested in Belarussian bonds for many years...and continue to have exposure. We have been overweight Belarus all year,"" he says.Argentinian pesos? Ashmore fund managers were overweight back in 2009, six years before Mauricio Macri ended the Peronista reign of the Kirchners, a presidential couple that defaulted on foreign debt twice. ""Our biggest Argentina trades were to go zero weighted before the default in 2001 and go long in April 2009 when the market was trading Argentina bonds at 2000 basis points over Treasury...priced for another default,"" he says. The country hasn't defaulted since.If you time it right and have the patience, you will be greatly rewarded. Those are words to live by for Dehn and his like-minded money managers at the Ashmore Group, a $65 billion emerging market specialist in London. They celebrated their 25th anniversary in November.Dehn spent most of his adult life outside of his home in Denmark, in places like Tanzania. Now he's on Aldwych Street across from the London School of Economics at Ashmore. He's their head of research. He came to London via New York in May 2005, where he served as a fixed income analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston. All day long, he is trying to find the best sources of yield and capital gains in emerging market debt.Since 1992, a $10,000 investment in the Ashmore EM Liquid Investment Portfolio (EMLIP) is now worth around $280,000.  They're neck and neck with Berskhire Hathaway. The fund has outperformed the JP Morgan Emerging Market Global Diversified Bond Index and the S&P 500 with lower volatility since inception. For Dehn, that's evidence of massive inefficiencies in the market. ""If an asset class has higher return and lower volatility it is a superior asset class,"" he says. And so the takeaway...""Investors need to have more money in emerging markets than they have in U.S. stocks.""One of Ashmore Group's emerging market bond funds versus Warren Buffet. A close race.Ashmore runs 10 mutual funds open to American investors. The initial investment is $1 million for institutional and $1,000 for retail mutual funds.On a cloudy November afternoon, Dehn has his sleeves rolled up in an office meeting space at Ashmore, flipping through printed slides, showcasing bond spreads. He correctly called the Russian bond bull in  Dec. 2014 when spreads were 700 points over Treasurys. As a contrarian, that's the time to pull the trigger -- when spreads are at their worst, signaling doom, and yet you believe there is enough evidence that the market is wrong. Within a year, Russian bond prices contracted 400 basis points, meaning Russian bond prices rose. Investors who bought beforehand were getting high yield and impressive capital gains once bond spreads compressed.There truly are once in a lifetimes, and that was one of them for Russia.Click to enlarge. Russian bonds were at their worse in 2014.Ashmore thrives on distress. When Enron went belly up, Ashmore bought their physical assets like pipelines throughout emerging markets for a fire sale and sold most of them for a profit. They like Venezuela's PDVSA bonds, the super-duper junk bond of global oil companies. PDVSA was in a restricted default in November, paying its bondholders late. Sinopec -- a Chinese energy company that has lent money to PDVSA -- is suing them. Ashmore, meanwhile, has it as a top five position in one of their mutual funds.Yikes.""Most bondholders believe they'll be paid,"" Dehn says.  This was the source of one of his most recent Twitter spats with the FTs emerging markets editor Robin Wigglesworth. ""Venezuela credit has traded 3000 basis points over Treasuries since 2004 and it never defaulted. Investors are being paid 25% to 30% per year in yield, plus there's plenty of opportunity to generate alpha because of volatility,"" he says, selling himself on the Venezuela bull case, if a case can dare be made.  Venezuela's chief debt negotiator is vice president Tareck El Aissami.  El Aissami is sanctioned by Treasury. They call him a narco-trafficker.""PDVSA bonds trade in the 20s and their recovery value is double that. A default would be messy...and there would be considerable uncertainty, but at current prices, you ultimately double your money,"" he says. ""They are paying...but money is coming in late.""Venezuela is the very definition of 'wild and crazy' as far as Ashmore investments.  Their fund managers hold Pakistani debt and the bonds of other frontier markets. But nothing is as nuts as Venezuela. At this point, bitcoin is safer.Within the low grade credits of Latin America, Ecuador is a stand-out. ""The government is very market friendly,"" he says. ""Transparency is improving so you know what you're buying, and you get 9% yield in dollars.""Retail investors who are looking to get into emerging market bonds on the cheap have two BlackRock products, the iShares JP Morgan U.S. Dollar Hard Currency EM Bond (EMB) or the iShares Local Currency EM Bond (LEMB) exchange-traded funds.  LEMB is up 11% this year. EMB, 5%. Both beat the two medium-term (IEI) and long-term Treasury bond (IEF) ETFs over the last 12 months.Mauricio Macri, Argentina's president. This summer, Argentina issued a 100-year bond. It was... [+] oversubscribed. Investors think the country is coming back to life. Photographer: Christopher Goodney/BloombergSee: HSBC Says Tailwinds Blowing For Emerging Markets Heading Into 2018 -- ForbesAre You Ignoring This Serious China Investment Thesis? -- ForbesThe Case For EM Bonds (Turkey No, Brazil Yes)Global investment firms dipped their feet into emerging market bonds this year, but smaller retail investors still prefer to stay home.""It is hard to get the international story across because international exposure has hurt them over the years,"" says Crit Thomas, global market strategist for Touchstone Investments in Cincinnati. ""Emerging markets have been a drag for years because all of the money was in the U.S. But with the U.S. more expensive now, I don't think it has helped convince the average advisor to put portfolio money abroad. You can pitch them to the contrary. They are influenced by what happened, not what could happen,"" he says.What's happened is if you put any money in emerging markets over the last 10 years and trimmed from the U.S., you lost around 8% while the S&P 500 rose 77%.  Emerging market bonds, however, have done better than U.S. Treasury bonds over the same period. Local currency bonds have done poorly due to a stronger dollar.If consensus is right, here is what could happen: a longer-term recovery is underway in most emerging countries based on value, fundamentals and largely underweight positioning by institutional investors.""Our long-held investment view on emerging markets has been that the market represents value and one should take advantage of any dips to get exposure, and we retain that positive stance,"" HSBC strategists led by Murat Ulgen wrote in a 20-page report dated Nov. 16.Bond fund managers who believe the Fed and European Central Bank will unwind their bond purchasing program, and will do so in an orderly fashion, think countries like Brazil and India and China are enticing.Quantitative easing (QE) was the largest and most distortionary intervention ever made in financial markets with trillions of dollars being pumped into supporting domestic bond markets. Markets quickly adopted three basic views about the effects of QE: it was bullish for the U.S. based on the expectation of strong growth, inflation and rate normalization; bearish on EU because of weak growth, no inflation and negative yield. Big investors reduced exposure to EM because central banks were not on their side of the fight.""The institutional investor is coming back,"" says Dehn. ""We estimate that so far only one-fifth of the institutional money that left between 2010 and 2015 is back. Ninety percent of our portfolio is institutional investors and in the third quarter alone we had four billion dollars come in. That's equivalent to 20% of total outflows we saw from 2013 and the first half of this year,"" he says. ""The only reason why anyone was buying U.S. and European debt was because of capital gains. Why risk it in risky EM? The whole asset class has been beaten up because of it. The S&P is up over 200% since March 2009. U.S. Treasurys are up about seven and EM has simply gone the other way. That's not normal.""Dehn flips through a thick packet of slides stapled together with the Ashmore logo in the upper right. Here's his case, based on a compilation of datasets from JP Morgan and MSCI as of Nov. 14: investors are tip-toeing in this year compared to last year, with local currency bonds beating the dollar-denominated ones. Stocks are up. Small caps are up. Both are beating the S&P 500. The trend is your friend.Jan Dehn shares his insights on emerging market debt. Dehn provides research for Ashmore Group fund... [+] managers who base some of their investment decisions on his analysis of emerging market debt. ""Institutional investors are coming back,"" he says.Yields are better and bond investors will have to return to yield again instead of gunning for capital gains. Central banks are no longer the big buyer they once were, supporting major premiums over par value. As U.S. rates go up, those holding bonds prior to the increase are watching their bond values erode.Meanwhile, investment grade emerging market corporate bonds pay around 4.12% for five-year duration and dollar sovereign bonds around the same for 7.3-year duration. Local currency bonds are better, with 6.23% yield for five year duration.Interest rates in countries like Brazil and Russia are coming down, increasing the value of the higher yielding bonds Ashmore funds have been holding for years.Two years ago, Dehn forecast that a strong dollar would turn investors to emerging markets. It didn't happen. A combination of strong growth at home kept the dollar stronger for longer. Only in the last 12 months are EMs seeing an increase of portfolio flows, according to EPFR Global in Cambridge, Mass.Still, emerging markets -- for the most part -- are worth more now than they were two years ago.  Whether or not that continues into 2018 depends on a number of factors, not the least being no surprise economic blowouts in Europe, the U.S., and China, a war with North Korea, or something similar in the Middle East between Saudi Arabia and Iran.If Dehn is right, emerging market bonds will be a strong buy in 2018 among the institutional investors that manage pension funds and life insurance portfolios. After a long hiatus, countries that have been beaten up since the Fed's Taper Tantrum back in 2013 are becoming bonafide investment destinations again.""It's a process,"" says Dehn about the investor committee meetings and legal paperwork institutional investment firms must go through before increasing allocation. Assuming it takes a good six months to decide on an asset class to build on, emerging bonds may be in their early innings. ""We're expecting a very positive flow picture next year,"" he says."

The company was attempting a $100 million CAD ($78 million USD) raise after having already received $20 million CAD in a private offering.""Today we announced that NextBlock Global will not be proceeding with a go-public transaction,"" he wrote. ""After careful consideration, we have concluded that the best course of action is to return to existing investors their capital in full and also to have them participate in any profits. As a young company, we have stumbled in our efforts to take our company public and we will work hard to rebuild the trust of those we have disappointed.""He stated the company will release details on its plan in the coming days. (Tapscott did not return requests for comment.)Alex Tapscott's Crypto VC firm NextBlock GlobalThe move comes days after Forbes disclosed that the company had falsely named four crypto stars as advisors in an investor deck labeled version 5. When confronted by two of them, Tapscott had told one, Kathryn Haun, a board member of Coinbase, that she had only been included in a printed version, when she had obtained an electronic copy (version 5).The other, Vinny Lingham, CEO of blockchain identity startup Civic and a shark on South Africa's Shark Tank, told Alex via email he was hearing he had been named an advisor and Tapscott wrote back, “You are (obviously) not an advisor and have not been listed as one! So bizarre.” Lingham responded he was looking at the deck with his face and bio on it and said, ""please don't lie to me.""When questioned by Forbes, Tapscott said that another falsely identified advisor, Karen Gifford, a special advisor for global regulatory affairs at Ripple who was previously counsel and officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, had been included after a conversation though he had not been able to confirm her. However, Gifford told Forbes through a representative that no such conversation took place.NextBlock Global CEO Alex TapscottThe reversal on the public listing is a stunning turnaround for a company that seemed poised to capitalize on the feverish crypto craze that has generated approximately $3 billion in capital for decentralized projects in so-called initial coin offerings. NextBlock had planned to invest in such tokens enabled by blockchain technologies.It is also a mark on the reputation of Tapscott, who is known for coauthoring, with his father Don, a book on the subject called ""Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin Is Changing Money, Business, and the World."" His resume also includes founding member of the IMF Fintech Advisory Board and World Economic Forum Blockchain Global Future Councils.With NextBlock, he was aiming to take the speculative excitement around crypto tokens and package it in a security that could be traded on the traditional stock market. NextBlock initially planned to raise $50 million CAD but increased the target to $100 million last Tuesday.That evening, Tapscott, when asked by Forbes about the four falsely named advisors, said, ""I currently have an order book for this financing of $250 million. To me that’s really the big story.""However, after the Forbes article came out, one of the investment banks underwriting the transaction, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) Capital Markets, pulled out of the deal. The same day, the other underwriter, Canaccord Genuity, sent out a revised deck to potential investors with the page listing advisors, including legitimate ones, excluded. ""Please note that we have removed the page related to the Select Advisors (formerly page 21),"" the email said. ""Given that there is no contractual relationship with these advisors, an investment decision should not be based on their involvement."" Canaccord declined to comment on the decision not to proceed with the public listing.But after the misrepresentations were revealed, Forbes found that the Tapscotts had used more big names in blockchain to tout a previous initiative without their permission. It was also uncovered that both version 5 and the final draft of the investor deck featured a photo of a randomly selected person next to one advisor who had requested his photo not be used.After publication of this article, Joseph Weinberg, an advisor to NextBlock Global and CEO of Paycase, issued this statement on behalf of all the remaining advisors, who requested not to be named: “Given the circumstances, the advisors concluded that this was the best course of action and we are pleased that the company reached the same conclusion. We support their decision.”Update, Sunday, November 5, 2017, 10:42pm EST: This article has been updated to include a statement released by NextBlock's advisors."

If you would like to suggest any sites ...","Dec 16, 2017,03:25pm EST",Grams dark web search engine,"In 2014, a plucky upstart search engine called Grams launched on the dark web. With a clean interface and a logo in primary colors, it was clearly a tribute to Google's homepage; with distinctly more adult-focused results. Its goal was to index the dark corners of the web and provide a searchable interface that pulled in results from many of the different dark marketplaces. You still had to register and sign up (if required) with vendors that you discovered through their results, but it was a useful way to index and trawl what's available.Grams was also a great way to analyze dark web data; in 2015 Quartz reporter Keith Collins analyzed the cost of drugs online using Grams search engine data. His insights included that one gram of cocaine was mostly sold for under $50, that there were  2,007 listings for one gram of MDMA, with a median price of $37.07, and that it was common to buy 30-packs of 30mg of Adderall, for a median price of $183.46.But now the era of easy darknet indexing has come to an end.In a Reddit post titled, ""So long and thanks for all the fish,"" (a Douglas Adama reference, FYI) the admin of Grams announced the closure of the website.""It has been a wild ride. I write to you all today with heavy heart. I have decided to take down Grams and all its' services one week from now. I have tried very hard to provide the best services on the darknet. Lately it has been more difficult to do this. It has become too difficult to get the listings from the markets and to keep up on even routine maintenance of the site. I have had a hard year personally and financially. This decision was not an easy one, but I believe it is what is best for me. I hope for nothing but the best for all of you in the darknet world. I will give all our users a week to withdrawal their funds from their accounts. Helix Light will be disabled 24 hours before shutdown. This provides ample time for any late transactions to go through before the shutdown. Any bitcoin left on the site after Grams is shut down on 16-12-2017 will be sent to several donation sites. If you would like to suggest any sites that accept bitcoins and are worthy of donations please do so below in the comments. Stay safe out there! Cheers, GramsAdmin.""Fans are unhappy to see this go, and on prodding, the admin revealed that its costs, not law enforcement that has preempted this decision.""Competitors have taken a lot of my business from the tumbling and with the high fees per transaction lately it is hard to even break even. The money is not worth the stress of maintaining the site,"" the Grams admin wrote.Over time, Grams evolved into more than just s search engine, offering tools such as Infodesk, which helped verify vendors identity across platforms and Helix, a bitcoin tumbler.Darkweb users do have other options, but it's hard not to see the end of Grams as a signifier that the end of net neutrality is having repercussions across the board. Grams, for all its faults, help democratize access to the darknet and its variances, and for that, it will be missed. "

cryptocurrency came from the initial algorithm of bitcoin.","Nov 30, 2017,08:10pm EST",DANIEL SORABJI/AFP/Getty Images,"With each passing day, the need to earn more money keep up with the ever-rising wants or needs becomes more obvious. The bills aren’t going to pay themselves, you need more to cope in this kind of situations.So, what are the new streams of income that help you earn more cash?Well, there's quite a lot you can do to earn more cash without necessarily quitting your current job. Let's take a look at Forex trading and cryptocurrencies.ForexSo, what is forex? Forex also known as the FX market simply means a virtual environment where currencies of countries are traded in pairs or against one another globally. The forex market has been around for a really long time now, it was established in the early 1970’s.Before the internet and modern technology, only a few people and organizations such as large financial institutions were able to trade currencies. But today, currency trading can be done by anyone, from anywhere and at any time.You don’t need a degree of any kind to start trading forex, a lot of websites (brokers) on the internet offer you a chance to get familiar with the system before opening a real account, and this type of account is called a Demo account.There aren’t a lot of differences between a demo account and a real trading account, the only significant difference is that the money in the demo account isn’t real; it cannot be cashed out or withdrawn.Before deciding to make forex trading a source of income, you must study everything about the system. It comes with a lot of profit but no trader can accurately predict the result of a particular trade 100%. There are few tools placed in the trading software to help you analyze the charts before trading, there are also tools to help you control and limit your loss and they are called Stop loss and negative balances.If you are really focused on making forex a source of income and getting really successful at trading, then you must come to terms with potential losses. Forex might do away with a significant portion of your capital but can at the same time earn you a fortune.CryptocurrencyNot a lot people know what cryptocurrency means yet a lot of people seem to be talking about it. Cryptocurrency is simply a digital money which is secured in such a way that every transaction made with it is untraceable or anonymous.Many individuals have made millions dealing in cryptocurrency, so clearly there is a lot of money in the sector.Cryptocurrency has its own complex algorithm which makes it very difficult to reproduce.Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency that was created, every other existing cryptocurrency came from the initial algorithm of bitcoin. Other examples of cryptocurrency are Litecoin, Namecoin, Worldcoin etc. the prices or rate of these currencies are controlled by the supply and demand of the currency in the market.Just like gold, cryptocurrency can also be mined but in a more digital sense; using mathematical algorithms. It is merely an entry in a virtual ledger which is stored on various computers around the globe. Today, anyone can mine cryptocurrency, however, it requires a high-grade computer which has to run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. the CPU runs at full power because of the complexity of the cryptocurrency algorithm so there are computers specially made for mining cryptocurrencies.Cryptocurrency is a new field that might be the next gold mine for many individuals because many people have made millions dealing on cryptocurrency, so this is definitely a new stream of income worth considering. "

from $1000 to nearly $10,000, ICOs have seen unprecedented growth.","Dec 2, 2017,04:20pm EST",Shutterstock,"According to recent news reports, a humanoid robot, named Sophia, is launching a crowdfunding campaign to fund her own advancement. If this all sounds like a scary plot from a science fiction movie, take a breath. What’s actually happening is that tech company Hanson Robotics is using SingularityNet, a token-based marketplace, to help fund the development of advanced artificial intelligence. This kind of crowdfunding campaign is known as an initial coin offering (ICO). A video promoting the ICO sale features Sophia explaining SingularityNet’s marketplace. An ICO is a virtual coin or token that is sold to investors in an effort to raise capital for a new company. Depending on the terms of the ICO, the token sold to an investor can represent either an investment security, or a form of currency within a company’s application. And while it might sound a little too futuristic, ICOs are a key tool for launching a business or entrepreneurial effort. No matter what product or service you sell, every entrepreneur will at some point be challenged to raise capital to grow their business. Without the vital funds to seed and nourish a new venture, even a genius idea will die on the vine. ICOs continue to emerge as an alternative to the traditional models of startup investment and e-commerce growth. However, like all pioneering new fields, they are not without risks.So what are the benefits of issuing an ICO as opposed to seeking traditional venture capital? For one, an ICO relies on a kind of crowdfunding to raise capital and thus opens up access to a wider pool of potential investors than the traditional venture-capital process.“ICOs raise money without middlemen, such as venture capitalists and angel investors, which, even if they give you money, they also take a percentage of equity of the company, require a certain number of seats on the board of directors, and so forth. In fact, ICOs are now raising more money for start-ups than early stage venture capital,” says Mike Stollaire, President and CEO of Titanium, an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) company.According to Coin Schedule, the proliferation of ICOs has exploded. In 2016, there were 46 ICOs that raised $96.3 million. The largest investment was secured by blockchain company Waves, which raises $16.4 million investment. Through November of 2017 the total number of ICOs has risen fivefold to 228. And the total amount of capital raised has leapt to $3.6 billion. This includes one of the most successful ICOs, which was launched by Filecoin, garnering the software company $206 million.And there’s reason to believe those ICOs launched recently will be successful. Status.im, a browsing and messaging application, raised $100 million in under three hours. Another browser startup, called Brave, raised $35 million in under 30 seconds.But despite its rapid growth, ICOs are fraught with risks. Most ICO companies are in the very early stages of development and may be very far from a point where an investor will see a return on their investment.Additionally, some worry ICOs and cryptocurrency in general could spell another economic bubble likely to burst. Like bitcoin, which saw a 700% increase in value this year alone, rising from $1000 to nearly $10,000, ICOs have seen unprecedented growth. But the current craze might leave investors in the lurch if those companies using ICOs aren’t profitable. Additionally, the world of cryptocurrency is decentralized and largely unregulated. This leaves virtual tokens vulnerable to attack and theft by hackers, and recourse in the event of fraud may be limited. In July, the Securities and Exchange Commission’s reported on DAO, a company who fundraised using an ICO and then lost a third of its assets due to hackers. Now, the SEC is working to monitor ICOs and better educate potential investors.“The SEC is studying the effects of distributed ledger and other innovative technologies and encourages market participants to engage with us,"" SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said in a release. ""We seek to foster innovative and beneficial ways to raise capital, while ensuring, first and foremost, that investors and our markets are protected.”William Hinman, Director of the Division of Corporation Finance adds ""Investors need the essential facts behind any investment opportunity so they can make fully informed decisions.”Ultimately, ICOs can provide companies with funding without giving away equity or control to investors. Entrepreneurs seeking alternatives to traditional venture capitalism may be wise to thoroughly investigate conducting an ICO as a means to raise money amid this rapidly growing and complex area of investment.This post has been updated since it was originally posted. Filecoin, the software company, garnered $206 million.

235,https://www.forbes.com/,"Oct 8, 2017","Can Blockchain Challenge Content Platform Giants' Facebook & YouTube 
Domination?",https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogeraitken/2017/10/08/can-blockchain-challenge-content-platform-giants-facebook-youtube-domination/,"Doing this with Bitcoin, for example, would cost them “millions of dollars 
and turn into high transactional fees for our community,” according to ...","Oct 8, 2017,04:27pm EDT","While the world is full of Internet millionaires who made their fortunes on social media, many talented artists and content creators are still struggling to monetize their content. Competition is fierce and one has to be creative enough to offer something catchy, unique and savvy enough to wow the insatiable audiences.","The latter appears to be all the more necessary as platforms hosting these global audiences are making monetization opportunities more difficult.Take YouTube for example. The site has over 1 billion users worldwide. Since it introduced monetization through Content ID, the company has paid content creators $2 billion as of 2016. Recently, however, the company has faced criticism for raising the bar on monetization requiring channels to reach 10,000 lifetime views before ads can be enabled.Against this backdrop new blockchain platforms are emerging in an effort to end the hegemony of a few giants. The question remains, can they succeed against the Goliaths in the space?I well recall an International eXcellence event from a few years ago hosted at the McLaren Showroom in London’s Knightsbridge by Viscount Yves de Contades, where among the luxury sports cars displayed, a throng of angel investors and the champagne and canapés, start-up presentations included a musician who was clearly frustrated by the woeful level of royalties he and others were receiving from incumbent players in the music space. It prompted him to initiate a new service in an effort to redress the balance.While the entertainment and media markets are huge, it remains very tough for artists. Estimates from DECENT, a Swiss-based blockchain start-up that early this October launched a live beta test of DECENT GO, touted as a “Google Play-like digital marketplace” built on top of a blockchain-based platform, writers lose anywhere between “30% and 75% of their profits” when publishing with Amazon.And, it is a similar picture for musicians who can lose around 30% when they sell a track on iTunes.(Image: Shutterstock).“There is too much artificial complexity and too many barriers in the industry affecting both the access to markets and income of the content owners,” said Matej Michalko, DECENT Founder and CEO based near Geneva.The Swiss-based Slovak added: “The majority of the power is concentrated in the hands of a few players controlling the industry. As a result, artists, filmmakers and writers lose money and control over their work. We designed the DECENT GO marketplace to do away with these issues and bring more transparency and fairness to the digital content industry.”As an alternative model, it aims to allow digital content exchange and purchasing on a peer-to-peer basis, with users now able to upload, download, browse, buy and sell digital content on the platform. The upshot is that profits will put directly in the accounts of content creators with the elimination of third-parties and middleman fees. And, as an incentive, DECENT is giving the first 400 new users 2.5 of its DCT token in order to get started uploading, buying and selling their digital content.DECENT claimed this could “free up a huge chunk of spending” in the global media and content distribution industry, which not inconsiderable. The current level of spending has been estimated to grow from $1.7 trillion in 2016 to over $2 trillion in 2019.And, elsewhere this June saw The 21Million Project, a blockchain-based startup seeking to disrupt the film business and Hollywood movie making machine with a ""libertarian filmmaking"" ethos. Nick Ayton, the project's co-founder, commenting at the time was cited on Forbes as saying: “The platformification of film, music and media (Spotify, iTunes and now Netflix) was seen by consumers as a step forward. But for the artist this meant the attribution they deserve a reward for their talent is further diluted, and for some their margins shrank to a point where many artists just don’t bother anymore.” So there are a few data points.Video marketplace StreamSpace is one platform challenging video on demand and advertising-driven streaming services by allowing filmmakers the ability to sell their works directly through blockchain. Another is Flixxo that combines blockchain and torrent technology to create a video sharing platform with a revenue sharing model for its community.No AssurancesIt has been a running gag that people just click “accept” on apps and services’ terms and conditions and privacy policies without really reading them. And, privacy advocates would be quick to point out that users are ceding too much in exchange for the use of these apps and services.Reading these rather lengthy walls of text, one would find out how much companies can gain from their users’ content. While most of these services would emphasize that users retain ownership, users still grant these sites and services broad rights to content and information.For instance, YouTube’s terms of service grants the company the license to “use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display and perform” user content. Other sites’ terms such as those of Facebook, Instagram and Twitter have similar conditions regarding user content and information.There are no assurances that creators will make money out of their content - even if these go viral. This is, unless they have a specific monetization mechanism in place. However, these services benefit from everything users generate.In addition, these services do not guarantee the security of content. It is easy to be able to download videos off of YouTube and repost them for another’s gain.Blockchain For ContentThese sites, acting as centralized authorities, can essentially do what they want with their particular service. As a reaction to this, decentralized services are now gaining traction. Blockchain technology is giving rise to such services, which have the potential to offer fairer and more equitable terms to users. Or, at least that is the hope.For example, StreamSpace, which is based in Austin, Texas, is leveraging this capability of the blockchain to create an online marketplace for filmmakers to easily publish and monetize their content under one platform. In this way, content creators need not deal with studios and streaming services to get their content published or deal with ad-based monetization schemes.Through their platform, creators can readily publish their works and set prices according to what they believe is fair.Viewers can readily purchase and stream content through the platform. And, since blockchain payments are immediate and irreversible, filmmakers get instant value from customers purchasing their content. This is unlike current advertising models or traditional means where they would often have to wait for net proceeds from distribution deals.Transparency in transactions also encourages fair market pricing, which is not driven by a central authority.Similar projects are also being undertaken for other types of content such as music. The introduction of smart contracts through the blockchain allows for real-world assets and intellectual property to be tokenized and traded. Even physical works of art can be tokenized and sold through blockchain marketplaces.  Robert Binning, CEO and co-founder of StreamSpace, with CTO Steve Woods and fellow co-founder and... [+] COO James Baggett (left to right), have been developing blockchain technologies since 2012.Robert Binning, founder of StreamSpace and an active cryptocurrency enthusiast who was introduced to blockchain technology through mining bitcoin in 2012, commenting in relation to starting the businesss said: “We have been passionate about blockchain for about four years since we first tried to do something different with our gaming laptops and discovered an opportunity to mine bitcoins.” He is joined in the team by fellow co-founder and COO James Baggett and CTO Steve Woods.Binning explained that they wanted to “solve real a world problem,” and not just try to reinvent finance away from the traditional banking system.He added: “We spent over a year exploring different potential applications and settled on one that is strongly associated with Austin, Texas, the Live Music Capital of the World and home of SXSW -  blockchain distribution of entertainment media content.”Binning asserted that they believe that filmmakers and independent film enthusiasts will find their offering to be the “answer they have been seeking.”  This is namely to “maximize the financial rewards possible from controlling your project from creation through to mass digital distribution.”In terms of the differentiation between StreamSpace and the major companies that distribute streaming video on demand content today, Binning, who attended the University of Texas, posited: “Most of these large companies are pursuing a model of working hand-in-hand with the major studios to deliver the kind of content that people would have gone out to their local Blockbuster ten or twenty years ago  -  current or last year’s movie hits and top television series.”He added: “Amazon and Netflix have taken an extra step and are funding unique movies and series just for their own services, in order to differentiate from each other and from the studio-linked streaming content aggregators. While all of these streaming giants pay lip service to indie films, they see this as a limited audience genre, like foreign films or documentaries, so independent films account for less than 2%-5% of their limited catalogs.”But as he pointed out there are more than 10,000 movies released every year, so there is a “huge amount of entertainment media” that they are missing.Community Friendly EconomyAs a video sharing platform that leverages blockchain and torrent technology to create a community consisting of creators, viewers and advertisers, Flixxo promises to improve with growth.Flixxo’s Flixx cryptocurrency is central to the platforms’ economy. So when content creators upload videos to the network, they could set revenue parameters that determines how much Flixx it costs to view particular content.In addition, they could set what percentage of the revenue would be shared to users that host the video on their devices. Advertisers could also spend Flixx to have their sponsored content features on the videos. Users could then spend time viewing sponsored content in order to earn Flixx.It works much like a torrent platform. However, instead of relying on users’ good will, Flixxo’s economy offers a sustainable business model and incentivizes participation.Rather than attracting pirated and stolen content, which has been popular on torrent communities, Flixxo focuses on legitimate content. The project is a collaboration between the people behind RSK Labs, Popcorn Time and Riecoin.The protagonists behind Flixxo include Adrián Garelik, a film producer and co-Founder at RSK Labs, which had been developing solutions for OTT since 1998; Pablo Carbajo - creator of Riecoin; Federico Abad, creator of  PopCorn Time; and, Javier D ́Ovidio, co-Founder and VP of Operations at EDRANS AI and Big Data.Flixxo offers a two-way system whereby producers pay users for improving the network, and users can... [+] give authors a recognition for their work.The argument expressed by the likes of Flixxo and others is that building up a value that is inherent to a community and creates a stronger social engagement between its users. This turns social networks into social economies, in which every interaction is a settlement of value.In this ecosystem authors monetize, users watch good quality content and advertisers can reach their audiences. But this is only possible by having their own token, which they can issue and distribute. Doing this with Bitcoin, for example, would cost them “millions of dollars and turn into high transactional fees for our community,” according to Binning.Here he added: “Today, as video relies on high infrastructural costs on bandwidth and storage, only three companies can afford deploying a global platform, and they have monopolized the market, creating an environment in which authors are not monetizing, users only reach low quality content and advertisers cannot reach their audiences. We can easily bring unhappy YouTubers to create content for our platform.”Valuing Users & Their ContentBlockchain can effectively challenge the one-sided nature of most platforms and social networks. Decentralization places more power with content creators and users. Users and their content are acknowledged for their value - rather than just be a base for these companies. As such, interactions and transactions develop more organically rather than being influenced for a company’s gain.Such systems also encourage creators to focus on quality content rather than force them to adjust to the rules of the system. This can also minimize efforts by malicious actors, who game such systems in order to exploit monetization schemes. Creators earn from the strength of their work.Ultimately, this could lead to the creation of fair and equitable communities where everyone is enriched by the system. That said, it will require community support and buy-in. Carpe diem.Be sure to get Forbes' twice-weekly all things blockchain e-mail newsletter, Crypto Confidential. Sign up here."

Even big multinationals like IBM and Deutsche Bank are working on their own blockchain projects, hoping to maximize the technology’s capabilities, such as immutable records and smart contracts. Pharmaceutical giants are also banding together to use blockchain to secure their supply chains and prevent drug fraud.","Yet despite the upsurge in adoption and amid the rise and rise of Bitcoin, not all of blockchain’s applications are being used by established companies. Token sales, for instance, have become a major funding method for many startups. And, on that score more than $3 billion in start-up funding has been raised through token sales this year alone. Still, many companies seem to shy away from them.But there are exceptions. Take, for example, messaging platform Kik, Hamburg-based fintech NAGA Group AG with its ecosystem and virtual reality (VR) platform Ceek, who have turned towards token sales to accelerate their respective growth.Blockchain technology and cryptocurrency concept. (Image: Shutterstock).Boosting Innovation & New Capital In today’s hyper competitive business environment, companies have to continue innovating. They should always be driven to provide better products and services to customers. Otherwise, it is easy to fall into the trap of stagnation.There is a long list of companies such as MySpace or Zynga that made huge splashes during their heydays, but eventually fizzled out as new and better services emerged.It is not enough to be good at one particular thing anymore. Today the trend is to consolidate products and services to be part of ecosystems through which customers can perform a variety of activities.To do this, businesses may have to gain expertise, add infrastructure as well as improve their systems and processes. This is where additional funding comes in. The more top-notch resources they can put into development, the greater the chances are for the effort to succeed.Despite being valued at over $1 billion and getting investments from giants like Tencent, 8-year old messaging platform Kik held a token sale last September, which raised $100 million from the event. The goal was to acquire additional funds to develop a blockchain-based developer platform for its messaging app. Having such a system in place allows it to compete against Facebook Messenger.Then there is Naga, a European-based fintech group, which was founded in 2015, which was taken public on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Deutsche Boerse) in July 2017 and as of this November had a market capitalization of around €300 million. It has already enjoyed success with services such as trading social network SwipeStox and virtual marketplace Switex.In operation since early 2015, the SwipeStox trading platform is utilized by more hundreds of thousands registered users and today facilitates several over 200,000 transactions each month with more than $4 billion transacted.However, the fintech game is also headed towards building multi-functional platforms and ecosystems.In order to quickly move in this direction, Naga decided to hold its own token sale. And, to date they have raised almost $16 million out of the $20 million they were planning to raise in the sale.The IPO of the NAGA Group AG at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Germany, on July 10, 2017. NAGA's... [+] founders Yasin Sebastian Qureshi, Christoph Brueck and Benjamin Bilski pictured left to right. (Photograph: Deutsche Boerse).The Naga Token will serve as the currency of Naga’s ecosystem that consists of a crypto wallet, a trading and investing platform, a virtual goods marketplace, and a financial education academy. Proceeds from the sale will be used to develop and commercialize these various services.As a VR platform that targets the entertainment industry and also founded in 2015, Ceek enables artists to create VR experiences for their fans and audiences. It has already worked with several industry giants and headlining acts to power VR events through their hardware and software.Currently the company is working on a VR event destination using blockchain technology, which will also provide artists and acts easy access to blockchain functionalities such as token and virtual merchandise creation. To accelerate that development, Ceek is set to run its token event through December 2017.Ceek partnered this year with Megadeath to help launch their Grammy nominated album, Dystopia.... [+] (Image source: Ceek)Tokens & Encouraging Product Use In addition to raising capital, token sales also enable companies to encourage investors to become future users of these ecosystems. Some might simply consider tokens to be tradable assets on crypto exchanges. However, tokens can actually serve specific purposes in the context of the company’s products and services. Investing in such tokens essentially is comparable to getting early access to discounted store credits.In the case of Kik, its Kin token is a general-purpose cryptocurrency that can be used in chat, social media, and mobile payments. Further developments would also use Kin as a means to facilitate all financial and economic transactions on the platform. Like other cryptocurrencies, it is also tradeable over exchanges.It should be noted here that investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment. For Naga, the Naga Token can be used by token holders to transact across its various services. For example, users would be able to spend the token on financial instruments on SwipeStox or trade virtual items on Switex. Utilizing the token would also allow users to receive bonuses and discounts compared to using fiat - traditional currencies.Ceek will also be using its own token to power its “entertainment metaverse.” Users can spend their tokens on Ceek’s Virtual Mint that would allow them to create their own virtual tokens, which can be then used as tickets to VR events and virtual items that could be traded as merchandise. Ceek will be running its own protocol, which is claimed to be cheaper to use compared to other blockchain platforms.Managing Impressions & PerceptionDespite these benefits, there are various reasons why many established companies may be avoiding token sales. To start with, token sales require preparation and technical expertise. And, some may not be prepared to make such an investment.There is also the issue of perception. Token sales are now popularly associated with tech and blockchain start-ups. Others, especially non-tech organizations, may think that blockchain and crypto tokens are not relevant to their line of business.In addition, there is also a slight negative connotation associated with the activity especially in light of failed and fraudulent token sales. And the regulators in the U.S. and elsewhere have been casting eye over them.Some might even view established companies to be greedy if they attempt to secure additional funds in such a manner since they assume that the business should already take care of itself.However, token sales still fundamentally serve the purpose of traditional funding and public offerings and according to some industry folk should not be viewed as a “strange departure” from the practice. Additional capital can improve a company’s capabilities by leaps and bounds. But of course it requires being deployed correctly, just like blockchain technology itself, to reap benefits.Furthermore, token sales could actually be part of the company’s blockchain adoption strategy.That said, as Charles Hoskinson, a former Ethereum co-founder, who in 2015 founded IOHK, a leading blockchain R&D company, noted: ""A token has to have a right to exist, it has to perform something and serve as having some form of a utility or it has to be part of a broader plan. It cannot just be used to capitalize an endeavour.” And, as he has said in a Bloomberg interview people are ""blinded by fast and easy money.”However one refers to them, token sales present a value transfer mechanism. But as Hoskinson  from Boulder, Colorado, underlined: ""It does not replace  basic business principles such as due diligence, use of funds, quality of the management team, what the business plan is and how to execute on the project.""Fot its part, NAGA has already been using blockchain for Switex. According to Yasin Sebastian Qureshi, a founder and executive director of NAGA: “Since there is an opportunity to build towards an ecosystem, creating a crypto token to power the ecosystem’s economy was the logical thing to do.”Qureshi, a 44-year old German based in London and also founder of Varengold Bank AG with a background in algo trading, hedge funds and investment banking, added: “Any potential negative stigma can be managed and addressed as long as the company’s intentions, vision, purpose and sale mechanics are communicated clearly to the public.”In fact, early success could be a powerful differentiator to inspire investor confidence. Other token sales only have minimum viable products or even less to show. Ceek, for instance, has already developed the hardware and software that are central to their service.TakeawaysCompanies might do well to investigate how blockchain can help take their business to the next level. Among its possible uses is for the creation of custom crypto tokens, which could be used to drive their product and services or used as alternative forms of store credit or rewards points.Many companies are not yet leveraging this use case, but the ability to put up significant capital without the associated burdens of a public offering or venture funding should not be overlooked. Having the resources to accelerate expansion could be the difference in thriving and surviving in today’s market."

However, the reality of the President’s proposal fails to match his rhetoric.No details were revealed as to how the Petro will work. And when it comes to a currency, the details are what count. For example, the Petro will supposedly be backed by commodities, but backing is a long way from convertibility. The only way for a currency issued by Venezuela to garner any trust would be for the currency to have an iron-clad redemption feature. Forget the commodity backing promise. It wouldn’t be worth the paper it was written on.When it comes to currency, Venezuela has had a long history of producing junk. Venezuela began central banking in 1939, when the Banco Central Venezuela (BCV) was established. Back then, the exchange rate was 3.35 old bolivars per U.S. dollar. Today, it takes 103,000 bolivars to fetch a greenback. That’s equal to 103,000,000 old bolivars.  Talk about a currency devaluation! No wonder Venezuelans distrust the BCV and Maduro’s soaring Petro rhetoric. To appreciate the currency cynicism in Caracas, just take a look at the bolivar’s recent plunge (see chart below).The Fall in the Value of the Venezuelan BolivarIn addition to watching the bolivar lose value generation after generation, Venezuelans know that the government cannot run PDVSA, Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, or anything else it touches. They are all in buried in a mount of arrears in defaulted bonds. So, even if the Petro was convertible into commodities, which it is not, it is doubtful that the Venezuelans would trust its convertibility provision. Indeed, PDVSA can’t even deliver oil that meets contract specifications.  This is forcing traders to complain, cancel contracts, and demand discounts. Why, then, would anyone trust the government to honor a currency redemption pledge, if such a pledge existed.That’s why the Petro is destined for the graveyard – where it will join Hugo Chavez’s “bolivar fuerte,” a currency the late Venezuelan strongman gave birth to on March 17, 2007. The Petro’s still birth is regrettable because it will give the idea of a commodity-backed cryptocurrency a bad name.Eventually, however, cryptocurrency fans will learn that in order to qualify as a currency, and not just a speculative asset, a crypto will have to be a reliable medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account. That can be insured if cryptos are convertible into a commodity, or basket of commodities. At present, Bitcoin, even as its price soars to the moon, fails to meet the three criteria which would qualify it as a real currency.The quickest way to produce a real cryptocurrency is to make it redeemable into a diverse bundle of commodities. Instead of a crypto, let’s call it a “Bundle.” Each Bundle would be convertible into something worth a specified basket of commodities. To avoid storage costs, each one-bundle claim would not be for physical commodities, but rather for financial assets equal to the current market value of one bundle. My good friend and collaborator, Leland Yeager and Robert Greenfield developed this approach to a laissez-faire payments system, which they based, in part, on the works by Fischer Black, Eugene Fama, and Robert Hall."

Synthetic fraudsters buy stolen SSNs or try to guess numbers not in use, then combine them with a sham identity. Using other people's real addresses, they begin applying for cards. Banks usually reject the first requests after seeing that the applicant has no credit profile. Thieves keep applying for credit cards until a lender eventually opens an account. Then the long con starts. Fraudsters can spend years faithfully paying the monthly bills for the cards--which they may have forwarded to P.O. boxes or their own homes--while watching credit limits tick higher. After an identity is established, they sign up for more cards. When the scheme is ripe, the fraudsters charge everything to the hilt, a phase commonly known as ""busting out."" Payoffs can stretch into the tens of thousands of dollars. The identities are then discarded. Barely on the radar a half decade ago, the technique may already account for as much as 20 percent of credit card loans that go bad. Synthetic identity theft probably cost banks at least $6 billion in 2016. [Bloomberg]Apple has just taken on Venmo with a new mobile peer-to-peer payment system. Photo by Andrew... [+] Harrer/BloombergApple Just Unleashed Its Venmo KillerYou now have even less of an excuse to delay paying back your friends. Apple's newly launched software update, iOS 11, includes a new feature that allows users to send or request money through iMessage, Apple's texting app, rather than using a separate app like Venmo or Square Cash. It's also sometimes referred as the 'Venmo killer.' Using the new mobile peer-to-peer payment system is simple. If you use Apple Pay, you can complete a transaction with a friend over iMessage and it will appear within your text conversation. Users can send money with their credit or debit cards, and can authenticate their transactions through a password or TouchID. [Time]The FTC is Looking into the Equifax BreachThe Federal Trade Commission is actively investigating the massive breach revealed last week at credit bureau Equifax, which leaked personal financial information on 143 million people. Equifax made a number of severe errors in handling the breach, beginning with apparent insider trading by Equifax executives more than a month before the breach was made public. Once the compromise was announced, ambiguous language in the recovery site's Terms of Service made it seem as if anyone accepting Equifax's credit-monitoring services would waive their right to sue the service. More recently, Equifax's cybersecurity has come under fire. First discovered earlier this year, the vulnerability was patched in March, months before the beginning of the Equifax compromise. Had Equifax patched the software when a fix first became available, the breach could have been averted. [The Verge]Subprime Credit Costs Capital One And Synchrony Downgrades From Morgan StanleyWhy is it that credit card losses continue to rise at a time when employment data shows a healthy labor force? Taking a deep dive into the subprime consumer shows that they are coming to terms with higher rent and health care costs, which are in fact rising faster than their wage growth, the analysts found. At the same time, the banks are also tightening their stands and pulling back on subprime card growth. As such, the analysts felt it prudent to downgrade the two credit card companies with the biggest exposure to the subprime segment: Capital One and Synchrony Financial. Specifically, 36% of Capital One's total card loans are held by subprime customers while Synchrony's exposure stands at 28%.

Analysts forecast that B2B spending on IoT technologies and solutions will reach $267 billion by 2020 -- and as more devices create a near-endless stream of data, the market for data-driven insights is being eyed as a catalyst for IoT growth.The Berlin-based IOTA Foundation, which is behind a namesake virtual currency that's designed specifically for the rising IoT industry, is delving into data monetization and solutions with the Tuesday morning launch of a new micropayment-based data marketplace that's powered by distributed ledger technology. The new initiative has gathered participation from more than 20 global organizations, including corporations such as Deutsche Telekom, Bosch, Microsoft, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Accenture and Fujitsu, as well as research groups from universities around the world.The public marketplace aims to give connected devices the ability to securely transfer, buy and sell fine-granular and diverse datasets while ultimately facilitating access to data that oftentimes sits unused.It’s the idea that data from your Apple Watch, for example, is useful and valuable to someone, somewhere. And that making that data accessible to the parties who want it and need it can ultimately help power such things as machine learning, predictive analytics -- and of course, the Internet of things.The marketplace is hinged on data's use applications in industries such as supply chain, smart cities, energy, manufacturing and healthcare. Within the next few days, participants in these industries and others are expected to open and enable access to streams of data generated by sensors they've deployed. According to the release, examples of available data include location-specific environmental data, African agricultural data and anonymized healthcare data from wearables.IOTA is now one of the largest cryptocurrencies (#9 as of press time) with a current market capitalization of about $3 billion. When it launched on the Taiwan-based exchange Bitfinex in June, IOTA shattered trade volume records and reached a market capitalization of more than $1.5 billion within hours.The token's defining feature is its “tangle”-based distributed ledger technology for storing transactions, used in lieu of the blockchain technology that underlies most cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ether. It's this decentralized permissionless ledger, where the data will be hosted, that will ensure the data being sold on IOTA's marketplace is tamper-proof.Per the latest version of its whitepaper released by IOTA in October, the tangle “naturally succeeds the blockchain as its next evolutionary step, and offers features that are required to establish a machine-to-machine micropayment system.” Its use case draws from the idea that as the industry surrounding the Internet-of-things matures, and micropayments become more of an oft-used necessity, the concept of transaction fees (which are used as incentives to pay miners, or those who help validate the transactions bundled into a blockchain's blocks) for all transactions will become an unfeasible component of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. Because IOTA requires no miners, transactions can exist free of charge.Billed as an open-innovation initiative and scheduled to run until the beginning of January, the data marketplace’s collaborative demo will also feature content published by the IOTA Foundation and its chosen partners discussing future applications of the data marketplace for specific industries.“The goal is to enable a combination of a business-to-business data economy, as well as enabling researchers and even hobbyists to participate,” says IOTA co-founder David Sønstebø. “The beauty of enabling fine-granular trade access is that we really don't know who or how it will be used, except that we know it is a completely new paradigm.”Here’s what a few of the partner organizations involved have to say about IOTA’s data marketplace initiative:“...In the energy domain, utilities are at a decisive point. The far-reaching processes of change that have taken place over the last few years in the energy industry as a whole address many fundamental challenges that need to be resolved in the next major step. For EWE AG, it is clear that digital business models make an important contribution to the transformation of energy systems. In particular, the innovation project enera is testing the energy system of the future on a large scale. In addition to smart grids, new market models, and innovative data science methods, new technologies such as IOTA and blockchain also play an important part.”– Dr. Justin Heinermann, Data Scientist EWE AG, Oldenburg“We work with energy companies to prepare for the future business models and to organise the markets for the future. In one vision, the flexibility to operate the electricity system will come from decentralised sources, including millions of household devices. To make this world work, transactions must be near instantaneous and their costs must be almost zero. While Pöyry is working on a number of promising Blockchain initiatives relating to distributed data market solutions, IOTA offers an alternative ‘distributed ledger’ approach, and Pöyry is keen to understand its possibilities.”– Stephen Woodhouse, Director at Pöyry Management Consulting“Over two thirds of the people in Europe will have a smart meter in their home by 2020. This data can be extremely valuable for innovative new services. Elering’s Estfeed platform enables access to meter data and it is fully compliant with data protection laws – end-consumers are in charge of their data, controlling which services can access it.""– Georg Rute, Development Manager for Digitalisation at Elering AS"

It’s becoming a serious problem with potentially deadly implications. An enormous fake whisky operation based in London specializing in creating phony “rare” releases was discovered earlier this year. Worse still, counterfeit Jack Daniels in Russia actually ended up killing more than 30 people – with the final number not known.A number of efforts are underway to combat the problem. In early summer, a company called Distilled Solutions unveiled a small machine that can scan a bottle to verify its authenticity. QR codes on bottles to confirm authenticity have also been tried in other beverage industries where counterfeiting is an issue.From box to bottle. Expect to find more of these codes on your whisky Photo: Qilai Shen/BloombergThis move towards transparency about whisky provenance and counterfeit operations is a significant change from the past. Previously, the industry had been reluctant to reveal counterfeits due to concerns over brand security, and as a result whisky information and recipes were long closely-guarded secrets.Some whisky companies, such as Islay distillery Bruichladdich and London blender Compass Box have begun to change things by sharing more information about the production and maturation of their whiskies. It's sparking a slow evolution as whisky geeks and fans want to know more about what exactly is in their bottles.A notable effort is now underway by one of the first Scotch whisky distilleries to use local renewable energy in its operations. The Ardnamurchan distillery, located in the Northwest highlands of Scotland, will use blockchain technology to certify the authenticity of the bottles and also to provide more information about the whisky to consumers.Blockchain was pioneered with the bitcoin crypto-currency. It allows purchases to be publicly traceable and is now being incorporated across many sectors.Owned by premier independent whisky bottler Adelphi, the distillery will print scannable QR codes on its upcoming Ardnamurchan AD 2017 release. The code will carry both in-depth information about the whisky’s supply chain - where the barley was sourced, dates of production, and other information highly valued by geeks like me - and also provide a digital certificate of authenticity confirming the whisky's claims.Adelphi hopes eventually to roll out this high tech feature across all their bottles.This campaign represents a partnership with Edinburgh- and Belfast-based Arc-Net, a company specializing in authenticating supply chain information for consumers. Though Adelphi isn’t the first distillery to provide product information with scannable QR codes, it's a first adopter of blockchain technology.Regardless, the introduction of blockchain could potentially be a game changer as both industry and consumer win.

[+] 2017 in Washington, DC. Yellen announced that the Federal Reserve is raising the interest rates by a quarter point to 1.5%. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)","Since 2008, we have been living in the land of free money, as the Fed has employed every tool in their belt to provide loose monetary stimulus.  Those times are now over.  The Fed is not only raising interest rates, they are reducing the size of their balance sheet – actions that will raise the cost of money as liquidity dries up.  Also, the passage of the recent U.S. tax bill (i.e. fiscal stimulus) likely will lead to even more monetary tightening.  This is not simply a U.S. occurrence either, as liquidity will be shrinking globally.  The European Central Bank will be paring down bond purchases beginning early next year, which could lead to rising interest rates in Europe as the market supply of bonds increases and demand declines.  There are also murmurings of tightening by the Bank of Japan, as Japanese regional banks are hurting.The rising cost of money will have implications for the economy and for inflation.  On the domestic side, higher costs of capital will hurt weak companies (perhaps forcing them out of business) and help stronger companies as less competition will lead to increased pricing power (i.e. inflationary).  This will be coupled with labor shortages and rising wages.  Also, as China invests in things like pollution control which will push up their corporate costs, I expect they will export their inflation to the rest of the world, leading to a significant change for the global economy.  As recency bias always creeps into the minds of investors, those who assume that everything that has worked over the past decade will continue to work in the future will be sorely mistaken.  Per Louis Gave, “everyone in every investment committee meeting these days is a deflationist.  The inflationists have either been fired, or beaten into silence and submission.  Which probably means that the “deflation forever” thesis is, by now, most likely fully baked into most asset prices.”As correlations among stocks and other assets classes break down, there will be a significant divergence in the performance of “quality” assets versus “junk” assets.  A prudent money manager should be prepared for this market shift by focusing on shorter duration assets, which goes for both credit and equities.  I expect longer duration equities, such as growth stocks with lower near-term earnings to underperform more value oriented stocks such as consumer staples, telecom, and energy sectors, on which I have focused.  Today’s market appears to be the inverse image to the early 1980s.  Back then, investors were misled into hiding out in cash as stocks were perceived as too expensive in a high interest rate environment.  Today, very few hold cash as stocks appear cheap relative to low bond yields.  This is a backward looking strategy derived from a relative value argument that is no longer operable.  I suggest more than a little risk aversion, as I have maintained, would be prudent in times like this.  As I have often said -- preserving capital is paramount, not winning friends.We have seen these types of markets before – just look at the contrary indicators.  Back in the late 1990s, more value-based investors like Warren Buffett and Julian Robertson grossly underperformed the tech bubble market and were viewed as “out of touch.”  Today, there are money managers like David Einhorn of Greenlight stating that “value investing may no longer be viable.”  The widest valuation discrepancies in the market today are highlighted best by the Bitcoin mania.  I believe Bitcoin is an example of the greater fool theory, it has captured the market like none other in recent memory.  While I certainly expect that blockchain technology will be embraced, I do not believe it will be through cryptocurrencies.  The Bitcoin bubble will ultimately be popped by the Fed (and other central banks) as they always love to take away the punchbowl.  Back in the 1920s, Joe Kennedy knew it was time to sell when the shoeshine boy was pitching stocks.  I believe the kiss of death for Bitcoin may be the random customs agent that recently told Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari at the airport that a friend took out a $35k home equity loan to invest in cryptocurrencies.  As the historian Eugen Weber once wrote, “One thing that we learn from history is that people seldom learn from history.”"

system, to Ethereum's blockchain taking supply chain industries by storm.","Dec 15, 2017,01:17pm EST",The Blockchain space is finally waking up to the power of influencer marketing.,"When people talk about influencer marketing, they tend to imagine an Instagram model holding a branded shaker bottle, or a stunning photo from a hotel balcony with the hashtag #sponsoredtravel.Over the past 5 years, social media influencers have paved the way for a whole new approach to advertising and marketing. Instead of pouring more money into television, print, or even conventional digital advertising methods like Google Adwords, brands are shifting larger portions of their budgets over to influencers.  The first industries to dive into influencer marketing have been largely entertainment based: movies, music, gaming, television shows, etc. Big food brands and even local restaurants have adopted the practice, seeing their audiences much more positively engaged with content created by foodie influencers. 
Oddly enough, the business world has been one of the last to adopt influencer marketing.  Sure, sponsored conferences look to bring in notable speakers to drive attendance, podcasts look to host guests that have strong social followings, but all in all, influencer marketing looks very different in the business world than in the entertainment realm.  Significantly More SubtleMake no mistake about it, influencer marketing in business is significantly more subtle.In Dale Carnegie’s famous book, How To Win Friends And Influence People, he explains that people want to do business with people they trust. If influencer marketing in the world of entertainment is all about bright filters and attention-grabbing content, influencer marketing in business is much more focused around credibility. Working with someone influential isn’t about having them create a viral-worthy video mentioning your company, as much as it is creating a partnership that will open more doors of opportunity.  This is exactly what’s happening in the blockchain space right now.In 2017, cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based platforms have completely disrupted the business world — from Bitcoin throwing a wrench in our suit-and-tie financial system, to Ethereum’s blockchain taking supply chain industries by storm. However one of the ways blockchain is being leveraged most is in holding what are called ICOs — Initial Coin Offerings. Similar to an IPO (Initial Public Offering) this is what allows a company to raise the funds required to go build a disruptive piece of technology, without needing to go the conventional fundraising route and raise through venture capital.  Influencers Are DisruptiveBut it’s not just blockchain technology that is disrupting the business world—it’s influencer marketing.Since the driving question behind every single ICO is whether or not they have the team to build whatever it is they say they’re going to build, one of the biggest barriers to entry is trust. For most ICOs, all that’s provided before the token sale is a whitepaper. Which means, in order to get people on board with the mission of the company, they have to know the team behind the product being built is solid. For ShipChain, an innovative blockchain platform in the freight and logistics industries backed by Perdue Farms and the former CEO of DHL Roger Crook, this was the strategy from the start.  What’s interesting about ShipChain’s approach to marketing has been their focus on building out a team that has influence in the world of business. It’s influencer marketing, but done in a way where each “influencer” opens a different door for the company as a whole.  Members of Shipchain including former Shark, Kevin HarringtonSome of their team members include serial entrepreneur Kevin Harrington (former Shark on Shark Tank), Brian D. Evans, Joel Comm, Justin Wu, and Brandon T. Adams, to name a few. Each one of these marketers and entrepreneurs have built incredibly powerful networks for themselves as individuals—which means, as a collective, they have the ability to reach all the right people. The team is led by industry veteran John Monarch. Growing In PopularityAs more and more companies begin to consider ICOs as a means of fundraising, this approach to influencer marketing in the business world will only become more popular.Bringing on strategic investors in any company is nothing new. What has made ShipChain stand out amongst the competition is the fact that they’ve prioritized bringing on influential team members above everything else. One strategic investor is not the same as an entire team of digital marketers and successful entrepreneurs, each of whom wield loyal networks and devoted audiences. And this is all excluding the other glaring benefit of building out a “dream team,” and the fact that the more knowledgeable people you have working on solving an industry pain point, the better the product will ultimately be.Although cryptocurrencies and blockchain platforms are disrupting all sorts of industries, it’s worth acknowledging how these companies looking to fundraise through tokens are also disrupting influencer marketing. Blockchain platforms are showing us that influencer marketing isn’t just about paying someone with a large audience to take an Instagram photo with your brand’s logo somewhere in the frame.

Here are the  top 10 Business Trends that are sure to drive success for you and your company in 2018.  We've captured all of the trends in an infographic at the end of the article.1. Artificial Intelligence Drives Customer ExperienceWhen you think of artificial intelligence (AI), you might think of dehumanizing interactions. Don’t confuse AI with primitive marketing automation.As AI expert and leading keynote speaker Christopher Penn, VP of Marketing Technology for SHIFT Communications says, “There are three levels of machine learning: AI where machines perform tasks normally performed by humans; machine learning, where the machines learn on their own; and deep learning, where machine learning chains together for rich learning.”Leading companies are embracing AI to perform repeatable, redundant tasks and to process large amounts of data not to avoid human interaction, but to enrich it.  AI is becoming the norm for many practical consumer experiences - these powerful examples use AI to evaluate GPS data:Expect to see more highly-customized content delivery, automated to a consumer’s specific persona and lifestyle. As Penn notes, “AI is not a futuristic concept. The tools and technologies are available, accessible, and not cost prohibitive.”2. Communities Embrace Live Interactions Over Social MediaYour smartphone might make you think that people prefer social media vs. in-person interactions. However, top companies realize that building great communities engenders long-term brand loyalty. Nothing drives strong communities better than in-person and live interactions. Even live video engages better than recorded video. Just look at the popularity of Facebook Live.Recently, I attended an event in Philadelphia with 75 fellow professional speakers. Though the group started as an online community, attendees spent our own money and time away from family to learn from and share with each other, in person. Great community events like the B2B Forum from MarketingProfs sell-out in advance to attendees seeking high-value, face-to-face interactions that deliver community and social learning that far exceeds what’s possible with social media. You’d have an easier time attending an Ivy League university than getting invited to the annual Mastermind Talks geared toward CEOs and entrepreneurs. Smart companies realize social media and technology do not replace the need for in-person interactions, social media can actually make in-person interactions more valuable. Since consumers are already connected in the virtual world, in-person relationships can be built at a rapid pace because you already feel as though you “know” the other person. Expect to see leading companies that cut back on live events years ago, bring them back with enthusiasm. 3. Millennials Welcome Generation ZAccording to analysts at Goldman Sachs, America’s youngest generation, “Gen-Z” (those born after 1998), are now entering their formative years and rising in influence. At nearly 70 million strong, the eldest of which are now entering college and/or the workforce, this group will soon outnumber their Millennial predecessors. Millennials are not children anymore. In fact, the oldest of them are now 35. Millennials are increasingly taking leadership roles within organizations. In addition to managing their peers, Millennials will soon be managing Gen Z employees. Will Millennial managers complain about Gen Z as much as Baby Boomer managers complained about Millennials?  Only time will tell. Gen Z is the first generation born with devices in hand and are radically different than Millennials. Smart companies and brands are working quickly to understand this next generation as an employee as well as consumer.  4. Wages And More On The Rise  Dr. Mary Kelly, a PhD economist and leadership advisor, shared great insight about what to expect in the coming year’s economy. According to the Society for Human Resource Management, Human Resource managers should expect a 3% increase in wages across all sectors. In high demand jobs such as health care, elderly care, and physical therapy, expect wage increases to be higher.  We’ll also see wages likely increase in engineering, drone technology, and virtual reality. Wages have been stagnant for a few years, and with the unemployment rate at almost record low of 4.1% of the labor force, employers will feel pressure to adjust compensation to attract and retain quality workers.  As we’ve seen in recent years, large organizations will see health care costs rise by more than 6% from 2017 to 2018. . At the same time, coverage is declining. Smart employers are looking at their health care plans now to minimize the financial increase while improving cost transparency to help drive down future costs.  Talented employees seek salary, benefits, flexibility, and autonomy. Smart companies know that flexibility and autonomy might beat out just pure compensation for many employees.  5. Social Learning Outperforms Remote Learning As more professionals work remotely, companies have found creative ways to keep employees connected and develop their talents outside of the office. One way that has gained popularity among corporate training programs is social learning.Social learning is the process of learning through peer social interaction. The most common example of traditional social learning is the chance encounter at the workplace water cooler. Two or more people run into each other, share ideas, and walk away knowing a little more in the process; this is social learning. “Social learning can take place in informal one-on-one encounters, among teams in the course of real-time problem-solving, communities of practice, through social software, expertise directories, and more,” notes a Bloomberg study on social learning.The study estimates 50% of companies already use social learning in some way, and two-thirds plan to use it in the future. It’s easy to understand why. Social-learning promotes autonomy and self-direction, increasing overall learner engagement. It can also be a welcome departure from online courses which can be lonely, isolated experiences that lack engagement. Learners do not feel the presence of other learners in the experience.The most successful online learning programs include a digital community where participants can share their experience, ask questions of each other, and engage in social learning that goes beyond the course curriculum. As companies adopt more social learning, so too will they adopt tools that support mentoring and coaching that leverages the internal expertise organically.6. Live Streaming Video Content Gains Momentum Whereas video itself has become a necessary component for successful businesses, customers are no longer content with impersonal, generic marketing.  Customers demand real connections, with real people. Video is the most viewed content, and live video is the most effective way to engage with your audience. According to Nick Losq, founder & chief creative officer at StarBeast ""Video is the most easily digestible form of media in a landscape now dominated by smartphones. And when a business starts adding a ""live” component, introducing real people, in real time, it has the power to connect with consumers in a personal and honest manner, allowing businesses to separate themselves from their competitors.  Live video has the ability to give many businesses a face AND a soul.”Businesses stream live video to establish real-time human connections with their audiences. Whether it’s streaming a product launch, running B2B webinars, offering Q&A sessions or streaming product reviews, live videos are becoming an established part of a business marketing strategy.  Livestream research shows that 80% of audiences would rather watch live video from a brand than read a blog, and 82% prefer live video from a brand to social posts. And 73% of B2B organizations report positive ROI from video marketing.Companies who plan for and dedicate resources to live stream videos will dominate their industries.7. Serve Your Community Not Just BuyersThe notion of the buyer’s journey was used to describe the path that your potential customer would take when making a purchase. However, today’s customers are sophisticated, savvy consumers who do their research. They vet companies by scouring their websites, reading online reviews and putting feelers out to their social networks. By the time consumers reach a salesperson, they are fully acquainted with your company’s product features, options and prices. They have done their due diligence and narrowed down their options.As a result, the old ‘buyer’s journey’ has given way to more realistic models that takes into account this new reality. The journey buyers and prospects take is no longer linear or even neat, it’s more unpredictable and fluid which poses a big challenge to marketers. As we enter 2018, we will continue to see these models get updated.Analyst Jon Reed writes marketers also “should be thinking in terms of “buyer’s community” or “buyer’s network.”” Reed notes that “buyers aren’t always buying but they are always learning” and “we shouldn’t only be targeting buyers.”“Today’s informed buyers get better at their jobs by building “trust networks” of experts inside and outside of their company,” Reed writes.Therefore, it behooves marketers to be where their prospects — and their prospects’ friends — hang out. Leading wealth management firm, Glassman Wealth, holds events for travel safety and responsible philanthropy. Though his firm doesn’t sell those services or profit from them, Barry Glassman, the firm’s founder says, “We seek areas where our clients have questions, and we strive to provide the single-best resource available to address their inquiry. Our clients don’t have questions limited to investing. They have questions about life.”Savvy companies realize that the best thing they can do is to serve their community, irrespective of whether or not someone is in a buying cycle.  When you deliver consistent value, you engender trust. Then, when they are actually on a buyer’s journey, you are already a trusted resource for them.8. Marketing Drives Results With A Focus On ProblemsMarketers used to espouse the features and benefits of offerings. However, B2B customers have learned to ignore features/benefits. In fact, your ideal client may not even realize that they could benefit from your product or service. Top performing companies focus on the problems you solve, and the anticipated results you deliver.I have run thousands of CEOs and executives through an exercise on how they make and approve decisions. When approving purchasing decisions, executives consistently ask ""What problem does this solve for us?"" ""Why do we need it?"" and ""What is the likely outcome or result if we make the investment?""Put another way, the client might not care about your solution if they don’t realize the problem you solve for them. Companies like E Group  and Catapult New Business have seen explosive growth by focusing sharply on the challenges they help their clients overcome instead of focusing on the products and services they offer. This shifts the focus where it should be - to the customer.Expect to see companies shift their marketing messages to the problems they solve instead of their features.  Measure and be accountable for success to outpace your competition.  9. Subject Matter Experts Open DoorsI noted in my 2017 Trends article that subject matter experts (SMEs) are the new rainmakers. As technology continues to expand and disrupt industries, companies and clients rely more and more on SMEs to educate, guide and advise. Whereas your client can get information about your company’s products and services on your website, they can’t figure out how your solution might fit their needs. SMEs provide a valuable resource to discuss industry trends, share best-practices, and delve into detailed discussions about how one solution might perform better than another. Whereas traditional sales professionals have noticed increased challenges in getting in front of customers, SMEs are welcomed into the room with open arms.This leads smart companies to take two critical steps:  1) Provide training and support to SMEs to help them navigate complex sales environments; and 2) Develop expertise in their sales organizations to build industry or application expertise within traditional salespeople focused on customer results vs. product sales. With SMEs, businesses must place a premium on proper lead qualification and narrow focus on the right opportunities to make efficient use of scarce, yet highly effective resources. SMEs won’t tolerate wasting time pursuing bad opportunities. And they don’t want to waste time on paperwork or administrative duties that will take time away from serving their clients. Top companies will continue to  put SMEs in a position to open doors and entice interest. Forward thinkers will plant seeds for their sales teams to develop subject matter expertise in specific industries. 10. Blockchain Embraced By Big PlayersIf you had invested $1,000 dollars in Bitcoin back in 2008, you’d have more than $40,000,000 today. Bitcoin is based on the blockchain protocol. Blockchain originated in the technology space, which explains slow adoption rooted in its techno-babble jargon. To better understand the technology, checkout WTF is The Blockchain? Marketing and business strategist Clay Hebert sees a familiar story playing out differently this time compared to how many companies were late to the party when social media emerged. “In the mid-to-late 2000’s, big companies missed the social media train. They couldn’t see how Twitter or Facebook would immediately impact their business, so they were slow to adopt these technologies. They don’t want to play catch-up again.” As Hebert suggests to, we’re already starting to see wider understanding and adoption in blockchain technology from companies big and small. For example:The hurdles won’t be overcome overnight. Similar to the Internet itself and social media, blockchain will enable new digital transactions that will disrupt traditional businesses like document authentication and title searches. Smart companies will build skills around blockchain technology to ensure they are the ones doing the disrupting rather than the ones being disrupted. It’s Your TurnThat’s my take on the 2018 trends that will drive business success. You might have ones that you plan to put into place right away, and you likely have ones that you think should have been on the list. We started with a list almost twice as long as what you see here, and had to make some tough choices.How do these trends get you thinking about changes in your business?

The blame has been placed upon a 29-year-old Iranian international Behzad Mesri, who was said to have tried to extort HBO for $6 million in Bitcoin. He now sits on the FBI's Most Wanted list.The most astonishing piece of the Department of Justice's indictment was the claim (one that comes with no evidence or additional data) that Mesri had ""worked on behalf of the Iranian military to conduct computer network attacks that targeted military systems, nuclear software systems and Israeli infrastructure."" That would hint the DoJ believed Mesri to be a serious operator in one of an increasingly sophisticated numer of Iranian cyberwarfare specialists.But according to two experts on Iranian cyberwarfare, there's little evidence from the online activity linked to his various names and affiliations that Mesri was the most sophisticated actor. His work was largely part of a hacktivist group called Turk Black Hat Security team, using the moniker Skote Vahshat, the DoJ said. They defaced a significant number of websites (hundreds, according to the DoJ), most likely using a type of attack targeting websites' databases, a common technique known as SQL injection, said Collin Anderson, a Washington D.C.-based researcher working on a report on Iran cyberwarfare for Carnegie Mellon.Much of their work can be found on Zone-h.org, where hackers show off their defacement work, such as in the image below.The Turk Black Hat crew defaced hundreds of websites, according to the DoJ. The feds believe the... [+] same Iranian who hacked HBO was part of the group.It appeared Mesri may have had poor operational security. Forbes found his name on domain records for the hacker crew's website, the same as linked in the defacement above. Forbes found old domain records for turk-bh.ir that listed a Behzad Mesri, alongside Gmail address skote.vahshat@gmail.com, in the registration details. It also listed an address in Naghadeh, Iran. (Forbes attempted to contact the user of that email address and another associated with Mesri and the Turk Black Hat website, but had not received a response at the time of publication).Anderson told Forbes he also found Mesri's page on PersianGig, an Iranian website typically used to share any content they wish. In the case of Mesri, Anderson told Forbes he'd uploaded a number of hacking tutorials for the likes of SQL injection and other technically basic or ""script kiddie"" attacks.As for what the indictment reveals about the HBO attack, the feds claimed Mesri had scanned the broadcaster's network for points of entry where employees could login remotely. The government claimed he was able to obtain passwords for those logins between May and July this year, allowing him access to internal systems storing data on not just Game of Thrones, but big-name shows like Curb Your Enthusiasm and The Deuce. He then sent threatening emails demanding $6 million in bitcoin, otherwise more data would be leaked, signing off one with an image of the Game of Thrones character the Night King.The HBO hacker signed off one email to the TV giant with an image of the Night King character from... [+] Game of Thrones.But even that hasn't amazed onlookers about the ostensible level of sophistication of the alleged HBO hacker. ""We're not seeing any reason to believe this guy was particularly elite hacker,"" added CrowdStrike head of security research Adam Meyers.An HBO spokesperson said in a statement: ""HBO has confirmed in the past that we were working with law enforcement from the early stages of the cyber incident. As far as the criminal case is concerned, we prefer to leave any comments to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.""Script kiddies turn government contractorsMeyers said many in the Iranian hacking scene, in the past couple of years, had moved from online forums to professionalization, including a group known as ITSec Team, a company accused of helping hack a small dam in America in 2015. From his research, it appeared to Meyers that the accused was one of the ""non-professionalized actors."" Anderson, however, suggested it may be Mesri was able to professionalize. ""It wouldn’t surprise me if this was another example of this trend going on.""He also wondered about the motivations of the U.S. government to allege Mesri worked with the Iranian military on cyber operations without more substantive evidence. ""I think it's political, in order to increase the perception this person is an operator... and might be of more substantial interest,"" Anderson added. ""Who is the audience for this indictment and to what purpose?""Is this aligned with what we see in non-cyber related issues, an overall increase in the pressure that's being applied for its more malicious activities?""I think one thing that keep remind - this person being present in Iran doesn't mean the HBO hack was orchestrated by Iran government. Iran isn't North Korea."" North Korea, another nation of increasing concern to the White House, was blamed for the catastrophic cyberattack that hit another major production house in 2014, Sony Pictures.Iran has been involved in some major cyber incidents of late. Forbes recently revealed hackers linked to the regime had created a convincing fake profile on Facebook that tricked a Deloitte employee into running malware on his work PC. Iran has also been linked to wide ranging cyberespionage operations across the Middle East with a group known as OilRig."

estate microfinancing, mutual funds and Bitcoin trade. With the ...","Dec 4, 2017,10:57pm EST",Viva Republica CEO Seung-gun Lee.,"Viva Republica is, objectively speaking, the most disruptive fintech startup in South Korea. Since the 2015 launch of its simple peer-to-peer payments app Toss, banks are finally revamping their user experiences and customers have easier access to financial products than ever. South Korea's mobile payments have more than quadrupled in that time to form a $4.6 billion industry, according to Bank of Korea data.It’s hard to call it coincidence, and the $76 million funded startup hasn’t stopped there. After a $48 million PayPal-backed investment in March, Toss has grown from a simple money transfer app to a platform of diverse consumer finance services generating $20 million in expected revenue in 2017.Breaking a billionAfter my early-year forecast that Viva Republica would be the most likely startup to break out in 2017, the company today said its flagship app Toss, now the fastest-growing mobile P2P payment service globally, has reached $12 billion transaction volume this year -- an average $1 billion a month.Putting that into context, Venmo, another Paypal-backed startup, took four years to reach the same rate and is currently processing $2.5 billion in monthly transactions, Toss says. But Toss, with 12 million users, was able to reach that benchmark in about half the time and has sights on breaking even in the near future -- a global first in the P2P payments space, says founder and CEO Seung-gun Lee.Toss has grown from a simple money transfer app to a platform of diverse consumer finance services.“Toss is how financing should be. We completely redesigned experience and accessibility in financing services on mobile, and we hope we can provide it to every mobile user in Korea,” says Lee, who is also chairman of the Korea Fintech Association.Don't slow downA little humblebragging may be merited for what Lee, formerly a dentist, and his startup have achieved. Globally, the app ranked No. 35 on KPMG’s top 100 fintech companies of 2017, higher than U.S. fintech unicorns like Lending Club and Coinbase. It’s gotten cool with the millennials, with half of twentysomethings in Korea using the app, according to the company. Toss’ exponential rise became impossible for Korea’s financial and internet giants to ignore. While local online financial services have been famously and frustratingly archaic, Toss’ popularity seemed to spark a fire under them to innovate, and users have begun to expect more. In the past year, Korea saw the launch of its first two internet-only banks -- K Bank and Kakao Bank -- while brick-and-mortar institutions quickly modernized and simplified their apps. Others encroached on Toss’ territory, as other internet leaders created Kakao Bank, Kakao Pay, Naver Pay and other similar payments solutions. Viva Republica can’t compete on marketing budgets with Korea’s corporate behemoths, but Toss has held its own through word of mouth. Its strong user loyalty has helped it maintain four times the transaction volume of its peers, according to the company. Lee says the app’s forte is a consumer-focused, seamless and simply good user experience.“First, I was quite worried about competition … and I think they’ve done everything they can do,” he says. “I think competitors were focusing on the numbers or on the competitors.“We just want to focus on the products and consumers, and that really played out well.”One size fits allThat’s not to say Toss’ main offering was a huge profit driver on its own. The company was losing cash on every P2P transaction by absorbing the banks’ transfer fees (about 30 cents each). After acquiring data-scraping startup Infotech and marketing agency Dohada in 2016, it began to make ends meet by earning commission on its partners’ offerings. This year Toss has partnered with other local fintech startups like Finda, Korbit and Tera Funding to launch their services on its platform, focusing on four core sectors: payments, investments, loans and insurance. The platform now offers over 10 services including savings accounts, real estate microfinancing, mutual funds and Bitcoin trade. With the customer loyalty it earned through its P2P payments, users would expect the same robust user experience across all services on Toss, Lee says. That allowed them to keep its customers on the app and adopt the new services. Its core revenue stream has shifted from its original product to the creation of new savings accounts.Toss’ success in savings accounts, for one, came as a surprise to Lee. While there had been fewer than 150,000 accounts created through mobile in the entire securities industry, Toss opened 200,000 new savings accounts in the first two months, according to the company.More on Forbes: How A Website About North Korea's Tech Use Battled -- And Beat -- Being Blocked In South KoreaCEO Lee.Branching outThe app also encourages users to try financial products they wouldn’t have considered in the past. Within 30 days of launching a mutual fund investment feature through a partnership with Shinhan Securities, Toss contributed 30% of the company’s mutual fund sales. Toss also began showing users their own credit scores -- something card providers never bothered to share, according to Lee -- to coach them on how to manage and improve their credit scores.Lee also gleaned intel and growth strategies from its relationship with PayPal that could possibly be applied to the Korean market. For example, Paypal helped Toss think more about its brand. “We never thought online payments would be as high-margin in the Korean market [as in the U.S.], but we learned something from Paypal,” Lee says. “We became serious about branding our payments business, and it is showing great traffic.”In turn, PayPal sought strategies from Toss on how to monetize its fee-free payments app Venmo, Lee says.More on Forbes: Both South Korea & U.S. Predicted 3% Growth In 2017 -- Can Either Of Them Achieve It?The Viva Republica team is now more than 100 strong.Three years after Toss’ launch, Lee says his challenge is less about profit model and more about sustaining a strong company culture. He is focusing less on product development and more on big-picture strategy, building autonomy and increasing mutual trust. But seeking out the right people also means the startup has trouble scaling fast enough.People power“As the company grows, my role as CEO has changed from building a great product to building a great company,” he says. “Our culture dynamic really focuses on freedom and responsibility, which is quite different from the culture at the traditional Korean companies and conglomerates. So it’s really hard to hire culture-fitting, high-performance people.”Toss plans to hold its ground in Korea for the next year with an aim of attracting 30 million users with new user-friendly services like budget management. It is also exploring partnerships to enter the Philippines and Vietnam in the next six months, with other Southeast Asian markets like Thailand and Indonesia to follow. Lee wants to defy local pessimism about the startup scene and make Viva Republica the first fintech unicorn in South Korea. He sees a future where there are no brick-and-mortar branches. All financial products will be served on a single platform, generating synergy and revenue for partner companies and a robust, accessible user experience for customers.“That’s the future we really want to make, and I think it’s not far away these days,” he says.Yohan Yun contributed to this article."

Regulation A+",https://www.forbes.com/sites/rodnturner/2017/10/17/u-s-entrepreneurs-how-to-make-your-ico-securities-compliant-using-regulation-a/,"The rate of change in ICOs, digital currency markets (think Bitcoin and 
Ether) and in the blockchain field has been so fast that regulators are ...","Oct 17, 2017,06:26am EDT",Make US ICOs securities compliant using Reg A+,"Is it possible to make an initial coin offering that complies with U.S. SEC security rules? The good news is yes, and you can use Regulation A+ to do so. But you may need a bit more patience than you expected.With approximately $2 billion of capital raised worldwide this year alone, it's fair to say that initial coin offerings (known as ICOs and very different than IPOs) are causing a great deal of change in how startups raise capital. The rate of change in ICOs, digital currency markets (think Bitcoin and Ether) and in the blockchain field has been so fast that regulators are scrambling to catch up.In the U.S., there has been a period of wishful thinking among some ICO entrepreneurs, who have charged forward with ICO plans that assumed the SEC would allow a relaxed playing field -- and some U.S. ICOs have taken place that were made based on these optimistic assumptions.In July, however, the SEC made it clear that in some cases initial coin offerings are considered securities transactions, which must, therefore, comply with existing SEC securities regulations -- the exception being those that pass the “Howey Test"", which is difficult to pass with confidence. Few ICOs do.This step by the SEC was helpful because it removed the uncertainty many were feeling. But of course, this new context places U.S. ICO entrepreneurs in a challenging situation. The ambient expectation about ICOs is that they are simple, low cost, and can be completed in weeks while raising large amounts of capital easily.Those expectations are difficult to reconcile with the need to slow down and wrestle with existing securities rules and regulations, and the confusion and expense that come from learning about them and complying with them.So when a U.S. entrepreneur reaches the conclusion that their ICO must comply with one or other U.S. securities regulation and accepts that there will be a significant cost, plus time and effort involved, what approach will work best? This is where I see some good potential. It turns out that Regulation A+ is a rather good partner for ICO's:In essence,  Regulation A+ provides the U.S. ICO entrepreneur with a viable path to compliance with SEC securities regulations , while allowing the ICO to provide many of the engaging aspects that make it such a popular capital raising system.An important step in using Reg A+ for an ICO is the proper use of Smart Contracts and the Token Software. Smart Contracts are intelligent software programs that enforce the rights and limits of a company's specific token, while each ICO token is programmed using blockchain logic to be inherently intelligent and aware of its situation, context, and history.These two components must be programmed so that the tokens will automatically restrict themselves to transactions that adhere to the specifics defined and stated in their particular Regulation A+ offering.A good example of this is that SEC-allowed exchanges must be used. I know of one that has been pre-announced as of now; Overstock.com's Medici has announced TZERO.Reg A+ has settable options, and of course, each offering has terms that are specific to it. These must be built into the Smart Contract and the Token up front. This will take thought, discussion, and legal advice.Most Reg A+ offerings are made using Tier 2, which has the requirement of an audit up front and ongoing reporting obligations post offering of profit/loss and revenue reporting every six months with an annual audit and significant changes to the business must also be reported when they take place. These reporting obligations are a downside of Reg A+ Tier 2.However, for ICOs that choose to accept investors from a small number of U.S. States that are easy and fast to make Blue Sky filings with, and therefore to depend heavily on non-US investors for a large part of their capital raise, then the Tier 1 Reg A+ can be appealing.Tier 1 is limited to $20 mill per year, and the post offering reporting obligations are far simpler. Material changes to the business must be reported, no annual audit is required, and an audit is not required when starting this form of Reg A+.Reg D 506c and Reg S (for non-US investors only) are viable options for an ICO, with the advantage that the legal work is far quicker and less expensive, and that there is no cap on the amount of capital that can be raised. However, lack of liquidity for the investors and in the case of Reg D, limitation to accredited investors does limit the appeal of some ICOs and increase the cost of marketing them. The Smart Contract and Token software will need more effort to develop to match the liquidity constraints.I have calls with ICO entrepreneurs about making compliant ICOs often these days, and I see a tendency for some to make the following three mistakes that I want you to avoid:I hope that the US ICO entrepreneurs who read this article will find it helpful in clarifying a practical way forward for securities compliant ICOs. Stay tuned for more on this subject!Please know that I am not an attorney, so do not interpret my writing here as if I am one! There are excellent securities attorneys that can quickly advise ICO entrepreneurs in a cost-effective and efficient manner."

[+] dollar banknote. Photographer: Brent Lewin/Bloomberg","Singapore is widely regarded as one of the most crypto-friendly countries in the world, largely due to its stable politics, reliable infrastructure, and favorable business environment.Singapore's Central Bank has experimented with blockchain technology, and announced Project Ubin, a collaborative project with a consortium of banks and technology companies to explore the use of blockchain for payments and securities clearing and settlement. Ultimately, the goal is to put the Singapore dollar on the blockchain. This initiative has been instrumental in reinforcing the image of Singapore as a leading financial hub and an innovator that pioneers in breakthrough technology. More so, it affirms both locals and foreigners about the country’s commitment to blockchain, making Singapore a more enticing place to establish and develop such projects.  The logo of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) (ROSLAN RAHMAN/AFP/Getty Images)Regulations to combat money launderingThe local government is clearly engaged by the potential of blockchain and understands the importance of encouraging innovation in this sector. That being said, the Singaporean regulators remain cautious in their actions and implications on the blockchain sector.As a measure to protect the interest of the public, all virtual-currency intermediaries in Singapore such as exchange operators are required to comply with requirements to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. Also, in view of the popularity of ICOs, the central bank has issued a detailed guide on the application of securities law in relation to offers or issues of digital currencies in Singapore.Private sector pushes forwardIncumbents such as major financial institutions are also investing time and resources in blockchain initiatives to keep themselves relevant in this fast-changing domain. Local banks such as DBS, UOB and OCBC have participated in proof-of-concept of Project Ubin using the blockchain technology developed by R3-- a distributed ledger platform that has integrated with Microsoft's cloud service. Universities offer blockchain coursesRecognizing the prospect of the technology, local universities have started offering blockchain courses to empower students and enthusiasts the knowledge to expand their interest in the field. Singapore Management University (SMU) and Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) are two of the universities that offer blockchain short-courses, with strong emphasis on the applications and possibilities of blockchain in the current context. Apart from that, alumni of National University of Singapore (NUS) have since created quality projects such as Kyber Network and Zilliqa. Both have benefited greatly from the supportive ecosystem, having access to specialists and consultants for advice on operations.Even though universities have already started blockchain courses, there still exists a wide gap between the demand and supply for skilled labor in the blockchain sector. Like most other economies, the demand for blockchain developer far outweighs that of the supply. If Singapore does not produce enough talent in time to feed the workforce demand, it risks losing its status as a blockchain hub to other rivals in the region.   Payment use casesAdditionally, an increasing number of companies are starting to recognize cryptocurrencies as a form of payment option, and have accepted them from consumers. Established firms, such as Aptoide, one of the largest app stores in the world are also setting up operations in Singapore to raise fresh capital from an ICO to fund their new business ventures. In view of the demand for legal services to set up a company in the country, law firms such as Dentons Rodyk and Wong Partnership have also created departments to provide legal consultation and services for blockchain ICOs.  A visual representation of the digital Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)Despite the favorable condition in Singapore, there are still shortcomings in the ecosystem that need to be addressed. Earlier this month, Quoine, a Singapore project has announced the wiring of customer payment to its company in Japan, after its account with a local bank got terminated. Quoine is not the only one, as it joins 10 other firms which were also affected by the closure of their bank accounts. Without bank accounts, blockchain firms are not capable of paying overheads and expenses, thus severely affecting their daily operations.  Educating the massesMore crypto-enthusiasts have taken the lead to set up public blockchain interest groups on social media channels in Singapore. These initiatives are aimed at educating the public of the advantages of blockchain in different sectors, and to help newcomers differentiate authentic projects from frauds and scams. The scale of blockchain disruption is likely unprecedented, and capable of producing huge opportunities and risks for industry players and their customers. With no signs of suppressing sector growth, Singapore remains an attractive operation hub for global blockchain projects. As more enterprises and individuals gain increased access to the technology, we should see more relevant use cases with profound impact on a society. "

It's merely going through a rough patch. He blames the U.S. and the opposition, a mostly unabashed capitalist collection of politicians who -- for some strange reason best left to the Venezuelans to explain -- have failed to get their act together even as leading a majority in Congress. That Congress, known as the National Assembly (also renamed by Chavez), is now about as useful as the bolivar itself. Maduro created a Constituent Assembly this year, a group of PSUV 'yes-men' that make the rules instead of the National Assembly.Maduro isn't blind. He sees the increased level of poverty and malnourishment happening in his country. He sees the economy going to hell in a handbasket. There is no end in sight.The country went into a restricted default in November, paying foreign bondholders late on at least three different bond issues. Chinese oil company and bondholder Sinopec is suing PDVSA. On Dec. 4, Maduro said the country would create its own cryptocurrency, the petro. He said it would be backed by oil. He should do it fast. At the very least, he might get some Asian gamblers to put some money to work in Venezuelan tokens. Hopefully, petro is convertible into bitcoin.At this rate, Venezuela might end up losing sizable portions of its oil reserves to the Russians and Chinese, two countries that have jointly helped prop up this ailing government. "

In 2007, M-Pesa emerged in Kenya, which allowed people to send and receive cash through mobile phones.As FinTech came into popularity after the financial crash in 2008, payments saw some of the biggest technological advances. In 2009, Bitcoin and Venmo were born; in 2011 Starbucks began accepting mobile payments. By 2013, 80% of consumer spending in the U.S. was cashless. In 2014, Apple Pay emerged.The popularity of payments godfather, PayPal, ushered in a new era of evolution in consumer payments, allowing users to send money to others using just an email address. Taking note of PayPal’s success in this new area of peer-to-peer (P2P) payments, banks began releasing mobile apps that allowed payments between members of the same bank. Venmo was the one of the first mobile apps in the U.S. to achieve massive adoption by allowing consumers to send money between almost any bank account and from credit or debit cards.
Since Venmo’s breakout success and acquisitions by Braintree and then PayPal, dozens of P2P payment apps have been introduced, including Square Cash, Dwolla and Popmoney. None are touted as being bank-agnostic in the same way as Venmo, though up-and-coming payments service Zelle has notably been called a “Venmo killer” due to its relationship with large financial institutions.While P2P companies and services have evolved, a more daunting competitor has quietly emerged. Social media giants have entered the payments space. Because of social networks’ massive reach and high rate of daily use, insiders believe the next wave in financial services will occur inside of these apps.Facebook launched no-fee P2P payments in their Messenger app in 2015, and just a few weeks ago announced a partnership with PayPal. China’s most popular social media site, WeChat, offers a P2P payment service that is used by 600 million users. WhatsApp reportedly has plans to launch P2P payments in India. Apple revealed they would soon allow iPhone users to send and receive money via iMessage, something companies like Circle have been planning to take advantage of since the plans were initially uncovered.Waterloo-based Kik received attention earlier this year when the company revealed plans to launch its own cryptocurrency, Kin, on the Ethereum blockchain to be used within the app.Kahina Van Dyke, global director of financial services partnerships at Facebook, said recently, “A couple of years ago, no one understood the social aspect of payments. But actually, every payment has a story and a concept, whether you’re donating to a charity or sending money to friends.”This trend is all the more notable when we consider the incredible reach of these apps. Kik boasts 300 million users and focuses on teens, while Facebook claims to be closing in on two billion users worldwide.Mark Zuckerberg on stage at Facebook's F8 Developers Conference in 2015.Much has been said about the WeChat model. Far beyond a simple chat platform, users can engage in most online services directly through the app, including gaming, social networking, and financial services. Kik’s founder Ted Livingston wrote in a blog that the battle is raging to become the “WeChat of the West.” The World Economic Forum’s recent FinTech disruption report posits that large tech companies offering core banking functions are the greatest threat to financial institutions.It’s a short jump from connecting bank accounts to brokering payments to offering core bank account services. As more services are bundled into existing apps with massive reach, the need for standalone P2P payments, and other financial services, will diminish. The future of financial services could very well be found in mobile networking apps."

According to a report by Deloitte, the political climate and shift in millennial power are just two of the influencing factors shaking up the financial world.","With so much uncertainty in the marketplace, offering new investment options gives clients more choice and control when it comes to investing their money. Many of these investment platforms don’t get the hype they deserve but are real performers available to an average investor.Ten members of Forbes Finance Council share what they believe are the most underrated investment vehicles available to the average American investor. Here’s what they had to say:Forbes Finance Council members discuss the underrated investment options that deserve a second look.1. Closed-End FundsClosed-end funds are an underrated vehicle. The ability to buy assets at a discount to their underlying net asset value means that, over time, they should hold up better during market downturns, potentially appreciate to full net asset value and often provide above-average income. Unfortunately, most advisers and investors don’t understand them, so they miss out on these opportunities. - Francesca Federico, Twelve Points 2. Savings AccountsBelieve it or not, an old-fashioned savings account is one of the best ways to protect your money for years to come. There are many types to choose from, designed for people at different ages with varying incomes and long-term or short-term savings goals. Savings accounts are nice because there’s no limit to how much you can deposit or withdraw each year, from now until the time you need it. - Shane Hurley, RedFynn Technologies 3. Taxable AccountsTax-sheltered accounts such as IRAs or 401(k)s are usually the go-to investment vehicles for most investors. Several restrictions come with IRAs, but there are no strings attached with taxable accounts -- investors can withdraw cash whenever needed. Unlike tax-advantaged retirement accounts already tax-free/ tax-deferred, taxable accounts allow one to take advantage of tax losses -- another benefit. - Ibrahim AlHusseini, The Husseini Group4. Real Estate-Secured DebtHigh-yielding, well-collateralized debt is an attractive, predictable and low-risk way to invest but is broadly unknown to average investors. With the advent of services like PeerStreet and Ignite Funding, real estate-secured debt has become more standardized, making that asset class far more accessible to more investors than ever before. - Bryan Ellis, Self-Directed Investor Society 5. Life-Cycle FundsThe average investor can do quite well with life-cycle funds if they continually invest and maintain a long-term plan around their investing. Though it may not be a high-risk or high-return investment, anybody can grow their money with it, given patience and time. - Ismael Wrixen, FE International 6. High Cash Value, Low Death Benefit Life InsuranceProperly structured limited-payment life insurance that emphasizes cash accumulation and suppresses death benefits can be a very effective retirement income-creating asset. Although Americans favor 401(k)s and other tax-deferred savings vehicles, C-suite corporate executives have long relied on SERPs and split dollar plans both built on high cash value, low death benefit life insurance. - Matt Zagula, Zagula Management 7. Digital CurrenciesMost people still shrug off digital currencies such as bitcoin because it's a new technology and difficult to comprehend. But one of the characteristics that make digital currencies so great is the fact anyone can invest in them and with any amount of capital. There are few investment vehicles out there, like bitcoin, that can offer the average investor such a high rate of return. - Brooks Clifford, DCI Capital Advisors, LLC8. Retirement/Qualified PlansThe ability to defer tax on your contributions and the fact that many employers match your contributions to your retirement plan make this vehicle too good not to maximize, yet most don't fully utilize their plans. What many people don't realize is that, ultimately, you can use this accumulation to purchase a business or a real estate holding. - Perry Dalessio, D'Alessio Tocci & Pell, LLP9. Growth-Oriented FundsBased on historical evidence, the probability that the market will be up in any given calendar year is well above 50%. However, fear and a repeated message of gloom cause many investors to shy away from growth-oriented funds and exchange-traded funds. This is a problem, especially for those who are accumulating wealth early in life. - Darryl Lyons, PAX Financial Group LLC 10. Roth IRAsA Roth IRA, hands down, is the most undervalued vehicle. Most people have an idea of what a Roth is and what it does. Yet, in my experience, they just aren't utilizing them. Tax-free growth and distribution in retirement make them a no-brainer! Coupled with social security and qualified plans, like IRAs, it could lead to the retirement you're dreaming of. - Justin Goodbread, Heritage Investors "

It was a South Indian fantasy-action blockbuster, Baahubali 2. Among India’s most expensive movies ever made, it was shot as a bilingual release in Telugu and Tamil, but only dubbed in Hindi. Still, it managed to traverse India’s language boundaries, breaking multiple box office records. In fact, Baahubali 2 garnered so much interest that it also found a place in the top 10 of Google’s global trend list under movies.Royal Challengers Bangalore team captain and fielder Virat Kohli throws a ball towards his...

It was followed on the list by “live cricket score” in third. Interestingly, “India National Cricket Team” was the only India-centric topic to make it to Google’s global top 10 this year.Next came Amir Khan’s massive hit film Dangal, fourth overall on the India list, followed by five other Bollywood movies, and another cricket tournament.Related reading on Forbes: Why The India Vs.

""How to link Aadhaar and PAN"" was the most searched item under the ""how to"" category in India.Other key phrases in the same category included “how to book Jio phone.” Jio is the new cell phone service provider launched by India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani’s conglomerate, Reliance.

everything, ...","Oct 26, 2017,10:49am EDT","This week, The Forbes School of Business and Technology at Ashford University in San Diego hosted a ‘thought leadership’ summit. Forbes CEO Steve Forbes keynoted, and the school invited executives, military leaders, and select Forbes contributors. I was honored to receive such an invitation, so I attended in order to cover the event for the Forbes.com audience.","The topics covered many areas of interest to executives, including leadership, capital allocation, human resources, technology, and marketing. From my perspective focusing on digital transformation – essentially, stories of disruption in the enterprise – I sought out such stories at the event.Jason Bloomberg (L) and Steve ForbesSteve Forbes Takes the StageForbes himself had some choice words on disruption. “The Internet destroyed my industry – the print industry,” Forbes told the audience.He then extrapolated his experience helping Forbes (the magazine) as well as Forbes (the company) weather the Internet storm, connecting such experiences to the challenges of the present. “You have cloud, analytics, artificial intelligence, big data,” Forbes said. “People are fearful the world is overwhelming them.”Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a topic of particular interest to Forbes. “We’re told robots are taking over the world,” he warned – but then added a bit of humor. “Mark Zuckerberg will have to give us all an income,” he quipped.Robots, however, have been around for years – a point Forbes hammered home. He explained how robots are labor-saving devices – a category that includes washing machines and dishwashers. True, such innovations may have put some people out of work. “But we moved ahead,” Forbes explained. “The key is to have a vibrant economy.”Forbes’ views on economics and politics are out of scope for this article, but whether you agree with his politics or not, his outlook is unquestionably favorable. “We don’t know what’s going to happen in the future,” Forbes said, “But big positive things are going to happen.”The Eye of the Storm: MarketingFor the most part, I was surprised how little the panels at the event discussed disruption. Even the technology panel that I joined spent its time talking about biotechnology and cybersecurity – disruptive topics to be sure, but only small parts of the broadly disruptive digital transformation story.The one exception was the panel on marketing. Many people don’t realize how central marketing is to the digital transformation story – and that misconception was one of the central themes of the panel.Bruce Rogers, Chief Insights officer at Forbes, set the bar for the discussion. “Marketing has forgotten it’s supposed to put customers at the center,” Rogers said.The panel discussed how in today’s siloed organizations, marketing doesn’t have sufficient clout, even though it’s responsible for the customer. The problem: organizations shouldn’t relegate such responsibility to any silo, as the rest of the organization feels it’s not responsible for the customer – the kiss of death for digitally transforming enterprises.In the event’s most interesting argument, however, panelists didn’t agree on the best approach to putting the customer at the center of its marketing. On one side: Lon Safko, CEO at Innovative Thinking, who emphasized listening to customers. “If you ask your customers they’ll tell you what they want – but we don’t listen,” Safko said.John Tamny, Managing Editor at RealClearMarkets and Political Economy Editor at Forbes, disagreed with Safko. “What’s already known is being competed away,” Tamny said. “I reject the notion of ‘know your customer’ altogether.”Tamny’s perspective may be counterintuitive, but aligns with the approach of such luminaries as Steve Jobs. Jobs is well-known for never using focus groups, for example, because he felt it was his responsibility to tell customers what they wanted, not the customers’ responsibility to know ahead of time.It seemed that the perspective of the panel at large was that both Safko and Tamny had good points, and that each perspective applied in different situations. Chitra Anand, Communications Executive and Advisor to High Growth Companies, was able to sum up the situation nicely. “Approaching marketing through a lens of a problem-solving mindset is critical,” she said.Other Words of WisdomMany other speakers had pearls of wisdom for the audience. Here are some additional highlights.“I don’t think you can be a leader and a snowflake at the same time,” said Rich Karlsgaard, Publisher at Forbes Magazine, on the leadership panel.Speaking of aligning operations to business results on the human resources panel, Louis Efron, HR Business Executive and fellow Forbes contributor said, “Whether you’re running a lemonade stand or a Fortune 500 business, the same rules apply.”“There are two ways to get to millennials: mobile and social,” according to Tamar Elkeles, Chief Talent Executive at Atlantic Bridge Capital.“Strategy stands on the shoulders of a big idea that’s still a big idea,” explained Ken Favaro, Lead Principal at act2 and also a fellow Forbes contributor.And we’ll save the last word for Steve Forbes, who I’m sure appreciates my skeptical opinions on Bitcoin. “Bitcoin is just a speculative vehicle and you don’t even get a tulip for your speculation,” Forbes said.I may not agree with him about everything, but Forbes is certainly correct about that.Intellyx publishes the Agile Digital Transformation Roadmap poster, advises companies on their digital transformation initiatives, and helps vendors communicate their agility stories. As of the time of writing, none of the organizations mentioned in this article are Intellyx customers.

robo-advisors, and crowdfunding are all part of this monumental ...","Oct 9, 2017,09:00am EDT","The financial services sector is currently undergoing, in my opinion, possibly the most profound transformation in history, and it will be a positive force.","The seismic changes we are currently seeing are so impactful and far-reaching that I believe these contemporary shifts are comparable to other financial sector milestones, such as the Rothschild family establishing their banks in the late 18th century, the deregulation of the sector in the 1980s and the 2007-2008 global financial crash.What is driving this industry evolution? Simply put, it's financial technology, known as fintech. Fintech, which is the use of technology to deliver financial services to consumers, is redefining and reshaping the sector in fundamental ways, and its growth is being fuelled by significant and increasing amounts of investment.ShutterstockGlobal investment in fintech was $17.4 billion last year, representing a jump of 11%, according to PitchBook. In 2014, there were $12 billion of investment, up from $4 billion the year before, per The Economist. It is this continual upward trajectory that means the sector is only going to continue to prosper.This fintech revolution -- because that is surely what it is -- has already, and is continuing to, change the world of financial services. Mobile banking apps, peer-to-peer lending, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, robo-advisors, and crowdfunding are all part of this monumental shake-up and shake-down of the sector.The reason this is happening now, I would suggest, is the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. Traditional financial services providers were, in most cases, spectacularly caught off guard by the crash. In the fallout, they were understandably busy dealing with the new regulatory landscape that prevailed in the aftermath, evolving client expectations and, for some, the massive financial penalties that were imposed on them. As a result, business and technological developments were way down their to-do list. They were too focused on regrouping -- they were in survival mode.However, simultaneously, some of the most exciting technological innovations -- things that have changed our lives and our society -- were coming to market. Uber, now the biggest taxi firm in the world despite having no cars, Airbnb, now the world’s biggest BnB/hotel chain despite owning no properties, and Amazon, now the world’s biggest retailer despite having almost no shops, among many others, all came about or same into their own during this period.It was not so long ago that Amazon wasn’t making any money, but now it is a retail tour de force. How did this come about? It was due to technology and, specifically, software. Next year, the first self-driving cars are expected to be available to the public, and within a matter of years, the whole automotive industry is likely to be disrupted forever. Which firms are leading the way in this area? Is it the major car manufacturers? No, they are in most cases too focused on simply making better models of existing cars. It is the tech firms, like Tesla, Apple and Google, that are set to take the lead.It's the same in the financial services industry. Fintech firms are filling the void left between what traditional financial services companies, especially the traditional banks, are offering and what customers are now expecting, especially in terms of customer experience.While many people are so conditioned by what they’ve been taught for so long -- and fundamentally scared of considerable change -- the shifts are happening in real time and quicker than ever before. We should not only accept them but embrace them.In terms of fintech, I believe the shift will be a positive force in three main areas.First, for clients: Increasingly, clients want all their financial services needs to be dealt with online and/or on their mobile devices. They demand personal service and instant access anywhere and at any time. Fintech is allowing this to happen. Frankly, if you have a great idea these days but you can’t do it on your phone, I wouldn’t bother, as it will not likely be successful. On-the-go is on the up and up.Second, for society: Fintech is speeding up the advance of financial inclusion. It is providing access to financial services for millions of people who live in remote areas or might normally not be able to use financial services because of the biases of traditional financial firms. For example, fintech allows money transfers to support families in international destinations who depend upon income from elsewhere. It also provides financial advice for those who cannot afford it from mainstream advisory firms, which increasingly only deal with the wealthy. Helping individuals and companies successfully manage, save and invest their money will only result in a better society for us all.And third, for businesses: Fintech is giving firms the opportunity to diversify, cut costs, meet regulatory requirements and improve the client experience, which will help build long-term relationships and trust.Of course, there will be challenges in the fintech sector, such as learning how to best meet changing compliance targets, and firms need to get smarter to address this head-on and ahead of the curve. But fintech is helping to create a better, more connected world in which more people than ever before will be able to meet and hopefully exceed their financial goals."

""Instead of spending ...","Dec 15, 2017,12:50pm EST","73% of marketing executives see AI or a technology dependent on AI as critical to the future of marketing. 20% think that bots, chatbots, or smart assistants are core. And 63.5% believe that big data will (finally) be transformative for marketers in 2018, according to a report I just completed. (Full disclosure: I consult for TUNE as a Mobile Economist.)","""AI and machine learning will have the most profound impact on marketing in 2018 because it will fundamentally make 'marketing' more human,"" Altimeter principal analyst Brian Solis told me. ""Which is ironic in and of itself.""AI, big data, and automation are key themes in the top technologies for 2018I surveyed, spoke to, and questioned 350 marketing leaders, CMOs, influencers, and experts to hear their predictions for the top ten tranformative technologies in marketing in 2018. That includes top executives from Salesforce, SAP, Dun & Bradstreet, and Microsoft.Most think that technology will enable better brand-customer communication.""As artificial intelligence and machine learning continues to make their way into marketing automation in 2018, individualization will become the new personalization,"" says Michelle Huff, CMO of Act-On Software.Here are the top 10 technologies the 350 experts I surved said would be most transformative in the coming year:(including deep learning and machine learning)(especially when used for personalization)(some are now refering to this as XR: extended reality)(especially when using geolocation technologies)(voice search, smart assistants, voice-based commerce, voice-first interfaces)(in other words, no technology at all)(data-driven, ROI-focused marketing)(data management platforms or data lakes)Clearly, AI is the big winner.AI + data = 2018 marketing successEven if executives didn't pick AI as the most tranformative marketing technology of 2018, they picked a technology that requires artificial intelligence, or benefits greatly from its application.Bots and chatbots, for instance, require AI to be more than a structured set of if/then statements, and to do more than answer the basics that they're pre-programmed with. Voice-first computing requires AI for its very existence: almost all natural-language processing (NLP) gains in the past decade have been due to smart systems that learn languages thanks to massive data sets of text and speech.And big data -- especially when used for personalization -- gets a lot more usable, not to mention smarter, with the application of machine learning and/or deep learning.""AI enables brands to differentiate by delighting customers in a more personalized and timely manner as it bolsters existing marketing automation capabilities at scale,"" Mika Yamamoto, chief digital marketing officer at SAP, told me.""The nexus of big data analytics and the various forms of AI, including predictive analytics, machine learning and deep learning, underpin well-informed and efficient customer interactions that benefit both customers and businesses,"" echoes Wilson Raj, the global director of customer intelligence for SAS.ShutterstockData plus intelligence enables hyper-personalization, says former Microsoft CMO Thom Gruhler (currently CEO of Fjuri). And that means a frictionless, contextualized, and personalized customer experience.Add it up, and marketers smell dollars.Bots + assistants + AI = new means of commerceMarketers see bots and assistants as transformative technologies that could either connect brands and customers closer, in real time, or -- in some cases -- actually completely disintermediate the companies who make products from the people who consume them.Jeremiah Owyang, principal analyst at Kaleido Insights, sees marketers finding ways to use these technologies to connect with customers.""Smart voice systems [will] enable marketers to connect to customers from anywhere: Car, kitchen, the bedroom, and on the go,"" Owyang says. ""Interfaces aren’t as relevant as we can now interact with audio.""Greg Wester, a senior VP of marketing for Mobile Posse, worries that the opposite might happen.""Post-app technologies will disintermediate marketers,"" Wester told me. ""What happens to CPG marketing when we’re ordering detergent by merely saying, “Alexa, get me more laundry soap?""Terry Jones, who founded Travelocity and Kayak.com, and currently leads WayBlazer, has a different take.""Text and voice driven bots will be used by brands on websites, apps, and social platforms to deliver highly relevant, 24/7 assistance for FAQs as well as shopping decisions,"" he said.There is a point of differentiation there, of course.Voice assistants like Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri, and Cortana are fundamentally different than bots and chatbots employed by brands for customer service via Facebook Messenger, SMS, Viber, or another messaging platform.Alexa has the potential to encapsulate huge amounts of commerce into the Amazon ecosystem -- especially as Amazon sells huge numbers of Echo devices. With Google Assistant and Siri, voice-based and commerce-enabled assistants have the potential to mediate most of the $57 trillion of consumer spend in the US alone.ShutterstockBut bots don't come between brands and their customers. Bots actually enable tighter connections.""Consumers want to chat with businesses on their phones and are becoming more and more open to live chat systems and messaging bots,"" says Allie Tretreault, a content strategist for Toast.This might even be a stealth advantage for small businesses.""It might not be the sexiest tech when AI and VR flood the media, but small businesses are flocking to mobile messaging in droves,"" says Kenneth Burke, marketing director for TextRequest. ""They’re texting and messaging to gain leads, follow up on sales, promote events, share info, get reviews, provide better customer service, and even chat with customers the same way friends do.""AI is the engine, but data is the fuelArtificial intelligence is great, but it's artificial. In other words, it needs to be constructed ... and big data fuels that process.""2018 will be the year where companies apply their extraordinary amount of data to improve the customer experience,"" says Jim Lyski, CMO of CarMax. ""Machine learning and artificial intelligence will drive a more efficient and personalized customer journey.""It's about time for big data to prove its worth, says Adnan Mahmud of LiveStories. We've barely scratched the surface of its potential impact, but AI will help unlock its true value.The same is true for the majority of the sexy new technologies marketers continue to drool over, says Ray Walia, CEO of Launch Academy.""AI, Blockchain, and AR are all tools to achieve desired outcomes but require data to do so,"" he said. ""You are going to see more marketing teams start to dive in to data and start making data driven decisions on what their customers and users want just like Amazon and Netflix do.""Extended realities: AR, VR, and MRMarketers will get very high-tech in 2018, many believe. But it won't all be helpful.""Marketers will finally figure out how to use mobile AR and immersive VR to sell products,"" says Dulce Baerga, CEO of River Studios. ""And people are going to generally hate those experiences, but they’ll do them anyway because it will be their first taste of the mixed reality future.""ShutterstockRetail will be most affected, according to some.In 2018, we'll see tech that will allow for complete and seamless retail fulfillment via mobile augmented reality, says Irena Cronin, who leads research at Transformation Group.One of the key reseaons? Silicon Valley, of course.""I believe it’s not the technology but the brands/companies pushing the markets into certain directions and at this point companies like Facebook and Apple are pushing people more into AR,"" says Sherif Kozman, CEO of ExtremeSolution. ""This can have a lot of impact on brands and marketing in general, especially with empowering platforms such as the iPhone with native AR, and Facebook with AR studio and the Camera platform.""Blockchain and cryptocurrenciesNaturally, a post on top technologies for 2018 would not be complete without the breakout stories of tech in 2017: blockchain and cryptocurrencies.Many believe blockchain will change everything ... or at least advertising.""Advertising is full of waste, fraud and other externalities. One externality is that people’s privacy is being stolen and money is made selling that to advertisers,"" says Miko Matsumura, the founder of Evercoin. ""By introducing blockchain technologies, users can control their data, while advertisers can get a more reliable product.""Hermione Way, a Silicon Valley icon, influencer, and advisor, says blockchain is the future. Joel Comm, another uber-influencer in the marketing and sales spaces, echoes the sentiment.Julie Albright, an academic at USC who frequently consults with top-level Silicon Valley and global tech leaders, has a slightly different take:""I think the important emerging technology for marketing in 2018 will be the blockchain browsers – which are still in their early stage, like Metamask,"" she told me. ""These will form a bridge from the Internet to the blockchain, enabling an entirely new market ecosystem to be accessed by consumers.""ShutterstockAnd some see cryptocurrencies coming into their own in 2018.While today it's challenging to buy anything with Bitcoin thanks to rapid price fluctuation -- is the price $37 or $32 or $45 -- and high transaction costs, some tech leaders see these challenges being solved in the near future.""With Bitcoin going mainstream, e-commerce sites will want to quickly jump on board,"" says Adryenn Ashley, CEO of Loly. ""Instead of spending years coding their own solution, I predict they will adopt Wampum Register to be able to take bitcoin transactions in person and online. It’s a game changer for any business that wants to cut their credit card transaction fees and move boldly into the future of crypto.""Sometimes it's not the big thingsMany marketers, however, point away from the hot technologies of the moment. Instead, they point to brand story, or marketing team organization and structure.""Instead of a single technology, marketing will focus on evolving team capabilities and redesigning processes and organizational structures to take advantage of the rapid evolution of technology and data in marketing,"" says Rishi Dave, the CMO of Dun & Bradstreet.Anna Winterstein, CMO of the Europe-based Smarter Time, thinks the story, the brand, and the messages marketers craft are key, especially in an era with an increase emphasis on privacy.""In the current context where individual privacy concerns are coming back with a vengeance (see GDPR, private browsers, etc), there will be a technology shift whereby personal data becomes more protected, and its uses less mercenary,"" Winterstein told me. ""Marketing might have to learn to do without that crutch. We have been so sure in the knowledge that our campaigns would fall on interested ears – we’ll have to go back to the basics and make sure the marketing messages we craft are actually in the general interest of the public.""Most marketers believe that technology is central to marketing in 2018.But not all agree.""I fundamentally believe the constant chase for the latest tech trend gets in the way of building a strong brand,"" Gartner senior analyst Augie Ray told me. ""I think smart brands will be doing a better job of using their Voice-of Customer and customer insight to understand what drives customers' satisfaction, loyalty, and advocacy. I don't know that many brands will do this, but I think it's the thing that can drive the best strategies toward long-term brand health.""It's hard to argue with that philosophy.But it's also hard to argue that marketers aren't achieving incredible results with the smart, judicious, and measured application of the right technologies.The full report is available here."

Fulfill Future VR Demand",https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/10/03/with-google-and-facebook-connections-otoys-render-token-aims-to-help-fulfill-future-vr-demand/,"Back then, the Bitcoin network had just started running and no more than a 
few academics and tech hobbyists knew about it. But now, as the ...","Oct 3, 2017,09:00am EDT","Ten years ago, Jules Urbach had an insight.","Back then, film companies would spend hundreds of millions of dollars on rendering, which turns 2-D or 3-D models into photorealistic scenes and is used in CGI (computer-generated imagery) animation, for just a few thousand frames. At 24 frames a second, that adds up just to a few minutes of an entire movie.He realized that the way they were doing it — using a type of processor called a CPU that is commonly used in computers — it was never going to get faster or cheaper.Instead, he realized it could be done 40 times faster on a type of processor known as a GPU, which is a graphics cards designed for gaming devices such as Playstations and Xboxes.That is now the most common method of rendering video games. And to accommodate demand, his company, OTOY, founded in 2009, and its main software, OctaneRender, have been using GPUs in the cloud with services such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft Azure.Even back then, he could see that the appetite for such work might grow to the point it would be difficult for his company to keep up. So he dreamed up — and patented — the idea of a peer-to-peer network where anyone with some GPUs could contribute work to render scenes and pay out each of these contributors. Back then, the Bitcoin network had just started running and no more than a few academics and tech hobbyists knew about it. But now, as the cryptocurrency market has exploded and options like Ethereum are available to build new blockchain-based networks, Urbach’s vision is now possible — and OTOY is launching a token for it: Render.OTOY CEO Jules Urbach“The demand for this work is so high that we have no other choice but to have another solution,” he says. “A lot of people are familiar with rendering in terms of computer graphics in films but it’s seeping into all parts of our lives. People don’t realize it’s in advertising, in billboards, in your Zillow real estate Matterport capture.”[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]OTOY is just one of a number of existing non-blockchain-focused companies that are issuing tokens to launch decentralized networks in their industry. The first to announce such an initiative was Kik messenger app, which recently raised $98 million but fell short of its goal of $125 million. Despite having 15 million monthly active users a month, only 10,000 people purchased tokens for its proposed token-based network for digital communication. While OTOY has an impressive roster of advisors, including Eric Schmidt, the chairman and former CEO of Google, and Brendan Eich, the cofounder and former CEO of Mozilla and CEO of Brave software, which launched the Basic Attention Token, plus big-name clients such as Facebook and Unity, it remains to be proven that an established company can successfully create a token-based network that also attracts its competitors and users outside its base and is therefore truly decentralized.OTOY’s Render token could be well-positioned to do so. This year, it secured a deal to provide the entire rendering pipeline for Facebook — the social network’s virtual reality camera data uses OTOY. “OTOY has long been on the cutting edge of rendering technology. Their products were a natural fit for our efforts in pushing media to a new level of immersion,” said Eric Cheng, Facebook’s head of immersive media, by email. OTOY has also partnered with Unity, software akin to a Photoshop, but for mobile games such as Pokemon Go. Unity claims its software is used to make a third of top games. And the VR/augmented reality industry could be on the cusp of taking off. A July 2016 Goldman Sachs report projected that VR/AR will see $95 billion in revenue by 2025 — comparable to the $111 billion hardware market for laptops and $63 billion for desktops. Goldman and Deutsche Bank anticipate VR/AR will become a bigger part of a variety of sectors including gaming, live events, virtual shopping experiences or “v-commerce,” healthcare and fitness, communication such as Skype or FaceTime, trainings and education, tourism, and social experience apps such as watching movies with others through VR.A renderOTOY estimates that what is called the OctaneRender Cloud Network could bring on seven million users (mostly game developers on Unity). Advisor Eich also sees potential for Ethereum miners to switch to Render. “As Ethereum evolves toward proof of stake or other future technologies that don’t require GPU power, that become more power efficient, the GPUs that were for mining Ethereum could be used on Render,” he says. Urbach even imagines iPhones and iPads doing rendering as they recharge overnight, though he calls that an “ambitious” goal.However, according to a Markets and Markets report, rendering is now only a $1 billion industry and is expected to grow only to $2.9 billion by 2022, so that may limit the potential market cap for the Render token, especially since the network wouldn’t constitute the entire industry. OTOY, using other projections, projects that revenue in 2021 would be $10-$20 billion even if RNDR took just 2% of the industry.While some crypto players like Eich are excited about the Render token, others are more skeptical. Brian Kelly of digital asset hedge fund Brian Kelly Capital Management says, “There’s nothing terribly unique about it. It’s a model that could be replicated fairly easily. There’s not a big moat around it from what I can tell.”However, Urbach countered in an email, “The centralized iteration of our rendering model hasn’t been replicated anywhere near our scale, and it’s a good indicator of how hard it is to scale to millions of GPUs in a decentralized way as we plan to do now with RNDR.” Lucas Ryan of cypto hedge fund Metastable Capital wasn’t convinced the token was necessary and felt such rendering work could be paid for in, say, Ether. Also, Golem network, a decentralized computing platform, might work just as well. Urbach says payment in other tokens doesn’t scale and notes that with Render (unlike Golem Network Tokens), a hash of the assets used behind the render source enables the tokens to be easily distributed to the contributors, putting IP rights on the blockchain.Render is aiming to raise $134 million from its token sale, which starts October 5. As with the other existing companies launching tokens, it will be interesting to see how well OTOY can redirect its success so far with its company toward a decentralized network.Be sure to get Forbes' twice-weekly all things blockchain email newsletter, Crypto Confidential!

[+] numbers leaked. (Photo by Scott Cunningham/Getty Images)","Colin Kaepernick, both for his skill on the field and for his refusal to stand during the national anthem in August last year, is one of the most prominent names in the NFL business, even if he doesn't have a team. Given the polarizing nature of his protest, and the death threats Kaepernick said he subsequently received, he could do without his personal contact details, including his cellphone number and physical address, being leaked.But that's what has happened, in a data leak from the website of the NFL Players Association that affects as many as 1,135 football players. And hackers may now have access to all that information, a security expert warned Tuesday.News of the leak came from Bob Diachenko, from cybersecurity company Kromtech Security. He told Forbes late last week that he'd come across an open Elasticsearch database sitting on a server for NFLPA.com. Thanks to a misconfiguration, all the data inside was accessible to anyone who knew the right link, he said. Diachenko warned the database was already compromised when he found it, with a ransom note left inside in February this year.Ostensibly, hackers had found the database, attempted to lock it up and demand payment to open it. That ransom note contained the threat that hackers would release information from the database to the public unless 0.1 bitcoins (worth approximately $428) was sent to their wallet. It's unclear if the ransomware attempt was successful; the bitcoin wallet had not received any funds at the time of publication. Similar attacks on Elasticsearch databases occurred earlier this year, according to forum posts.The NFL Players Association didn't respond to repeated requests for comment. The body did, however, send alerts to agents Monday, noting that the organization had learned of a security hole from a European company (in this case Kromtech) but it had swiftly secured the data. Diachenko confirmed the database was secured on September 29, not long after his disclosure, though he'd not received any contact from NFLPA staff.""We have worked with cybersecurity experts at Microsoft and our database consultant to determine the extent of the improper access. We are confident that it was limited to a two-hour period last week,"" the NFLPA wrote in its email, which was passed to Forbes by an agent who asked to remain anonymous. The message confirmed players' home addresses, mobile numbers, email addresses, colleges, dates of birth and agent fees were included in the exposed data.""We want to emphasize that no information about you or your player's Social Security Number or finances was in the data. Also, we are directly informing all players involved,"" the email noted. ""In addition to our work with Microsoft, we are engaging an independent firm to do a full review of all of our cybersecurity measures.""While there are around 1,200 players included in the leak, it appears most were either currently or recently free agents, like Kaepernick (his representation didn't respond to a request for comment). Other names on the list were former Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III and ex-New York Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis.Not all current and former NFL players who used the NFLPA site were affected, a fact that gave Adam Seifer, founder of Premier Athlete Advisors LLC and a certified agent, some relief.Worries remained, however. ""As an agent who is also a licensed attorney and as such is entrusted with protected information on a daily basis, I am always concerned about my clients' rights to privacy and confidentiality,"" he added. ""So a breach of this nature is clearly concerning to me."""

King Games, the developer of Candy Crush Saga and Farm Ville Saga, was acquired by Activision Blizzard in 2016 for $5.9 Billion. Their valuation was no doubt helped by my personal consumption of boosters.Online gaming is global, but the laws that regulate it are notEntrepreneurs, the crafty characters that they are, are wise to the legal issues concerning gambling and often opt for the less polarizing term 'gaming.'Many online casino sites bill themselves as online gaming companies. This is to support their customers in feeding more and more of their income into the gaming platform without legal concerns.One resource—Gamblingsites.com—attempts to keep up with the changing regulations in various regions. The site refers to the U.S. enactment in 2006 of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA).This is a tricky regulation that doesn’t regulate gambling sites or gamers, just the financial institutions that hold their money. According to Gamblingsites.com, the UIGEA doesn’t make online gambling illegal; it just makes it ‘illegal for banks and other financial institutions to process transactions between US residents and gambling sites. ‘Some U.S. States are more open to online gamblingJust as some U.S. states were loathe to allow lotteries, many states do not allow casinos to operate. But some states are interested in feeding the beast of commerce and delineating their moral filter of different classes of gambling.If you’re an entrepreneur in Tennessee for example, you may want to look at Tennessee’s position on various types of gambling and gaming here. It is here that you’ll see the amount of hair-splitting that goes on relative to types of gaming and gambling in any U.S. state. The rundown on Tennessee is as follows:Currency & Gambling Regulation continue to spark fintech innovationAs entrepreneurs continue to chase the rabbit of online casinos and gambling, they are being creative about how and where money changes hands.Cryptocurrencies scare the devil out of many people. There is a freedom—an anonymity—about them, and that freedom is used by some to stay under the radar while doing the devil’s work. Others view it a way to have the license to move their money without regard for regulations they feel should not apply to them.Reviewed Casinos published a piece earlier this year about the collaboration between Calvin Ayre, founder of Bodog Brand, and Craig Wright, one of the purported co-creators of Bitcoin. As long as the regulation around online casinos and gambling is tied to the financial transaction itself, expect to see many more of these collaborations.Entrepreneurship, particularly in a nearly $500 Billion industry, is like water—it will find a way. And they are ready to welcome you with open arms.Are you safe?In the last month, we’ve had a glimpse into the physical vulnerabilities in the most policed and filmed gambling environments. We’ve also had a glimpse into the potential vulnerabilities of your financial information in the online arena.As the dangers of the real world continue to push us into our homes and in front of our keyboards, safe is a relative term.

cryptocurrency exchange. Blockchain has a scope of advantages for 
retailers ...","Nov 28, 2017,08:00am EST",Shutterstock,"It used to be that retailers couldn’t wait to hear the unmistakable sound that said the holidays had arrived — ringing cash registers. Today’s businesses are adapting to the new signs of the holiday season — digital clicks and online carts. Black Friday, the most joyous of all shopping days in the year for retailers and customers alike, still tops the list of sales spikes for the year, followed closely by its relatively new cousin Cyber Monday.Omnichannel shopping, new technology and elevated consumer expectations are driving retail marketers to capitalize on the holiday buying season for 2017. eMarketer estimates that retail e-commerce sales in the U.S. will see a 15.8% boost for the holiday season. Bottom line: Holiday sales are key for retailers. Let’s take a look at five digital marketing trends for the 2017 holiday season.1. Mobile leads the way. Mobile will continue to be the marketing hero of the holiday buying season this year. Consumers are now using their smartphones to do preliminary research on products and pricing, as well as making purchases. Retailers that use mobile payment methods such as PayPal, Apple Pay and Amazon Pay increase their appeal to consumers who can research, browse, pay and schedule delivery all from a smartphone.Email is also big during the holiday season, with an estimated 54% of emails opened on a mobile device. And where would retailers be without mobile shopping apps? 65% of consumers have a mobile shopping app on their smartphone and have made a purchase using it.2. More efficient spends with programmatic marketing. The ability to deliver digital ads in real time completely changes the ad game. Add in the ability to deliver only to specific audiences with highly targeted messaging, as well as managed delivery times, and programmatic is a holiday gift to retailers all on its own. Getting in front of the right customers at the right time with the right message really streamlines promotions for the retailer and makes holiday shopping easier for the consumer.Programmatic geotargeting gets even more specific and pulls in customers due to their proximity to stores as well as their interest in a retailer’s products, making it a win-win for both parties. According to eMarketer, ""A big driver of ecommerce will be the continued growth of mcommerce sales—particularly smartphone commerce, which will rise by an estimated 57.8% in 2017 overall.""3. Social media marketing puts products right where consumers spend their time. Social media will have a big impact on holiday consumer shopping, especially among millennials and Gen Xers. According to Salesforce, 30% of Gen X and 48% of millennial consumers indicated that they will use social to find out about products to purchase. Not only do these consumers plan to buy online, they also plan to post about the gifts they receive on social media. That’s a double win for retailers that can rise above the rest.According to Market Measurement, 93% of advertisers plan to promote special holiday deals and discounts, largely in part to last year’s stellar analytics. Studies also show that 69% of Facebook users visit to find discounts and share the information with friends.4. Video makes the season come alive with sales. Why is video so important as part of your digital holiday marketing initiatives? Quite simply, because people like to watch them. Whether you’re creating a warm and fuzzy seasonal brand piece or using video to promote more practical sales messages, consumers like them and expect to see them. This is especially true with younger viewers who are on social media for holiday information as discussed above.In addition, 51.9% of marketers report that video delivers the best ROI and that their customers have a preference for video over other types of content. And at least half of shoppers will search for a product video before visiting an online store.5. Blockchain could be the year’s rising holiday star.Blockchain and its darling, Bitcoin, are emerging as important factors in retail transactions. Essentially, blockchain lets companies and their partners manage and track digital transactions and then store the information contained within those transactions. Consumers can purchase items internationally using Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency exchange. Blockchain has a scope of advantages for retailers including thwarting counterfeiting and serving as the basis of loyalty programs.Marketing for the holiday season is both an art and a science, but a good driver is to always keep your customers top of mind. Try to imagine what they’re thinking. Where do they spend their time online? What platforms do they use? What kind of content would appeal to them? Then deliver the communications they expect in the ways they expect to see it, and it will be another great holiday sales season."

Bob Bagga: ...","Oct 27, 2017,09:50pm EDT",BizX CEO Bob Bagga,"Small to mid-size companies combine to account for a staggering GDP shortfall of $2 trillion, resulting from untapped and underutilized business potential.Looking to help companies crack into this massive revenue opportunity while driving transactions for businesses of all scales across industries, one entrepreneur set out to establish an innovative solution that allows businesses to offer products and barter services without spending any cash.Founded in 2002, BizX is a membership-based network that works with companies to promote their products and services, build new business relationships and facilitate transactions between companies that might not normally conduct business together. BizX allows members to buy and sell within the network directly using an alternative form of currency equivalent to the U.S. dollar, aptly named ‘BizX Dollars’.By implementing their own form of currency, the company also functions as a third-party record keeper, providing clients with monthly statements and real-time account balances.  However, unlike a bank or other financial institutions, BizX connects clients with other members, creating a pipeline to funnel new customers to purchase products and services directly.This model allows their clients to preserve vital cash resources, while maximizing their service offering and increasing revenue. Additionally, by allowing members to purchase products and services from each other without the use of cash or credit, BizX helps companies offset business expenses.Agreeing to accept BizX dollars as payment from others within the network also allows members to establish additional sources of incremental revenue. This incremental money flow can be spent back within the network to fulfill other business needs.Their expansive network has powered over $800 million in transactions, significantly increasing cash flow for companies while also saving business owners over $400 million.I spoke with CEO Bob Bagga about the vision behind the company, disrupting a traditional industry, and his vision for helping businesses unlock a trillion-dollar gold mine.What was the void or opportunity you discovered that inspired the idea behind BizX?Bob Bagga:  In most cases, small to mid-size businesses operate at around 80% of their potential capacity, meaning 20% of their services or assets go to waste.  Whether it’s an empty table in a restaurant, unsold ad-space, or unbooked hours of a general contractor, lawyer -- most business owners would jump at the chance to close that 20% gap. We think the best way to help maximize that capacity is by providing business owners with tools that allow them to use unutilized capacity as currency or lines of credit, without any cash requirements involved. Since cash is often limited, using unrealized business potential as capital can help improve efficiency while paying goods and services that may have been difficult to obtain due to a lack of working capital. That’s why we created not only the BizX community but also the BizX dollar, which allows our members to buy and sell their extra capacity amongst the network.Describe your business model and what was the strategic thinking behind it?Bob Bagga:  BizX is a community of thousands of business owners who support one another through buying and selling from each other without spending cash. By using the BizX dollar, they can turn extra business capacity and assets into cash flow, which in turn, can be spent at member businesses without any cash involved. The goal for us is to reduce waste, maximize member potential, and help them earn new customers through BizX members and the eventual cash based referrals that follow.What were some of the challenges you faced early on when trying to get your business off the ground?Bob Bagga: Initially, we had to help people understand the concept, and realize that it isn’t as complex as it may seem.  Turning unused goods and services into a potential line of credit or currency was a new concept for most business owners. So, we had to invest heavily in educational content to help our early customers adopt our model. Any business has an uphill battle when it comes to building credibility, which is why we started by investing heavily in the success of our members while maintaining a hyper-local launch model. This helped us create brand champions that have in turn helped rapidly grow our network. Today, the biggest challenge we face is scaling the business to new cities. We care deeply about the BizX community, so when we launch, we launch location-based teams that can help guide our new members and foster a thriving local business network. That makes any launch a time-intensive process, but we think the results are worth the investment.What have been some of the biggest blind spots or pitfalls plaguing the space and how does your company aim to solve for them?Bob Bagga:  Business networks often fail to direct new business to member companies because they lack a practical commerce solution to encourage participation. By giving users a cashless platform, on which they can transact with other members, we’ve been able to solve that problem. Additionally, other currency alternatives or bartering options become incredibly complex, costing business owners time, which second to cash, is the most vital resource they have. We not only have a seamless web platform that members can use, we also have a mobile application that allows members to transact with one another painlessly. On top of that, we’ve provided complete transparency through dashboards that allow members to track their BizX dollar spending and their increased cash flow.What are the criteria for becoming a part of this extensive network and what are the primary benefits businesses experience?Bob Bagga: BizX is free to join, and any high-quality business that delivers real value is welcome to join. Businesses that have underutilized capacity, time, and so forth benefit from joining, because instead of letting those services go to waste, they can turn them into a cash-free line of credit when other members pay for them with our complimentary currency.  By accepting BizX dollars, a member can fuel growth for themselves, reduce costs, and grow their business. To put it another way, given the opportunity to spend cash, or BizX dollars, on expenses -- which would you choose? Obviously, the answer for most of us is that we’d use BizX dollars keep our cash to spend on other things. Our members have an advantage in that they now have two currencies to spend: U.S. dollars, which are the result of all of their marketing, sales, word of mouth, and promotional efforts. Then, they can use BizX dollars. Since they all share the motive of spending BizX dollars first, they will always choose to do business with other members over non-members.How does BizX specifically save businesses money and how does your model make business owners rethink executing deals and transactions?Bob Bagga: Since BizX is a B2B network comprised of members in practically every industry, members can get almost anything they need with member businesses. This results in direct savings because they can obtain goods and services without expending any cash. It doesn’t just save them money, in many cases it allows them to take on expenses that would otherwise be too cumbersome with their existing cash revenue alone. It certainly isn’t a closed loop either; members consistently experience new cash referrals from other members who are happy with their services. This allows them to convert unutilized potential into new customers, increased cash flow, all for nothing more than their incremental cost of goods sold.How does your company empower the small business economy and in what ways do you see BizX setting trends in the space?Bob Bagga: BizX is not just a business – it’s a community.  A community made up of business owners, entrepreneurs, and savvy professionals looking to get ahead in an ever-changing market. We believe that we are stronger together than we are individually, and our members think the same. That’s why we exist. Our goal is to make the lives and businesses of our members better by giving them the tools they need to grow without using potentially limited cash resources. Whether they need a cash-free line of capital, new customers, or a way to barter with others for goods and services, we can help them make the most of their business potential. Our long-term hope is that this can start to chip away at that $2 trillion in unutilized business potential, which will help grow not only individual businesses but markets as a whole.As Bitcoin and other forms of crypto-currency increase in popularity, where do alternatives like BizX dollars fit into the equation?Bob Bagga: BizX generates local commerce by giving business owners a way to turn their unused goods and services into capital. Cryptocurrencies are still largely based on speculation and do little to drive growth for businesses. Also, unlike other digital currency solutions, the BizX dollar isn’t theory; it’s been used and proven effective in giving companies opportunities to grow their business and invest in their teams.  We’ve powered over $700 million in transactions for business owners, with none of the complexity that comes with managing other alternative currencies. While cryptocurrencies are an exciting and innovative cash alternative, all of them eventually require a cash outlay from the buyer. With the BizX dollar, however, a transaction only involves using extra business capacity. In short, earning BizX dollars doesn’t cost a business anything, but it returns a cash alternative that they can easily use with countless vendors, through a simple application.What are the keys to your company being both successful and sustainable as industries rapidly evolve?Bob Bagga: We are growing and launching in new partner cities all the time. One thing that’s at the core of our business is building up communities of business owners that support one another and transact within the network. This is incredibly important for our members that do business in person, like general contractors, restaurants, etc. While many of our member’s services can be delivered online regardless of location, we still make sure the community is at the center of it all. Doing so helps us build sustainable member communities all around the country. That’s also why we keep BizX free to join without any monthly or annual fees. We only earn when members improve their business through new customers on the network, and when they save by spending BizX dollars for the services they need. Since our member’s success is directly related to our own, it means we can partner with them to make sure the service and the network are everything they need it to be."

From the general media hubbub to the discussion surrounding the Saudi government's treatment of women's rights, the landmark event caused quite a stir across the web.But behind all that buzz, SingularityNET, whose artificial intelligence technology powers the robot built by Hanson Robotics, has been working to completely revolutionize web as we understand it.In some sense, the premise behind SingularityNET is fairly simple.""SingularityNET is a decentralized open market for AI,"" SingularityNET CEO Ben Goertzel said in an interview with the author. ""It’s a product aimed at becoming a bridge between AI developers and business users.""Thinking of it this way helps keep your head somewhat attached to your body when you start trying to imagine a decentralized, interconnected network of AIs that can not only be purchased and shared via blockchain technology—they can actually learn from each other.AI is an umbrella category that houses four broad types, encapsulating a wide field of study that includes subsets you may have heard more of recently (ie. machine learning, neural networks, natural language processing). AI is already a $233 billion industry, and some estimates predict it will reach $3 trillion by 2025. We encounter AI every day, though much of what emerges from the field isn't immediately obvious to the user—the point is to seamlessly optimize existing systems. This is also why we're starting to see a ""hockey stick"" curve of AI acquisitions over the past few years—congregating these systems in a handful of major corporations, who then resell AI packages.Even though AI changes our lives by the day, it's a fragmented field. Many aren't able to see or learn from the work others are doing, unless they happen to be working in a company like Google, Facebook, or Salesforce (and even then), and there's no discoverability for AI inventors.Chief scientist of Hanson Robotics, Ben Goertzel (R), interacts with 'Sophia the Robot' (L) during a...

""Unless you’re Google or Tencent, you’re probably not going to build your own AI—you’re going to be making your software grab AI from some software package or API. Those are the customers.""But it can be difficult for small teams to be sure they're picking the right AI—and if they're running on a lean budget, this can end up being a costly choice. SingularityNET helps matchmake these customers with the developers who might have been working on AIs with niche purposes.""A lot of niche markets will be served by a decentralized network in the same way eBay serves a lot of weird niche markets for buying stuff that Walmart doesn’t serve, because in a decentralized market the overhead cost is very low,"" Goertzel said. ""Someone who makes AI to serve some niche purpose can reach the customers who want something meeting that niche purpose.""'Sophia' an artificially intelligent (AI) human-like robot developed by Hong Kong-based humanoid...

""Or it could be something sexier like a robotics company that wants AI to help their robot navigate. It could be a hospital that wants AI to help a conversation system to keep chronically ill people company or a diagnostics system to figure out why some medicines work for some and not others.""This is where SingularityNET really starts to sound like science fiction—even though it's about to become our reality.""What makes it more interesting is that the AIs can also exchange data and make requests of each other,"" Goertzel said. ""So then the AIs interconnect in a network of AIs, like an economy of minds—a big meta-mind out of all these AIs talking to each other."" This is facilitated through the Ethereum blockchain, on which SingularityNET is built. For a quick refresher on blockchain, check out these primers. For the purposes of understanding how it fits into the picture of SingularityNET, the most important thing to know is that blockchain allows buyers and sellers to interact directly, without middlemen.""The big a-ha moment was realizing that this same framework that enables this nice business story of disintermediating the gap between producers and consumers of AI is also actually the rights structure for leading to the emergence of higher degrees of [artificial] general intelligence,"" Goertzel said. ""If you want to have a system in which general intelligence can emerge, you want it to be—at the high level—more self-organizing and growing and adaptive, like a biological system. You want something in which all sorts of different AIs can be placed, and they can interact with each other liberally, and where the mechanisms for their interactions themselves can be improved and changed and proposed by the participants of the system.""Goertzel, who notes how biological organisms are themselves self-organizing information systems, believes that an economy like SingularityNET facilitates optimal growth on a global scale.""You want a big messy system that’s growing without the central controller, with a bunch of different parts interacting with each other, and where the parts that fit well into the whole network prevail and the parts that don’t will not get as much attention,"" Goertzel said. ""That’s kind of what Marvin Minsky, the AI pioneer was talking about with 'Society of Mind,' and then [with SingularityNET] you’re talking about an 'Economy of Minds.' The existence of the economy means that AIs that are really useful in that society will get more resources and ones that aren’t will get less.""In many ways, SingularityNET is the summation of Goertzel's life work. In the late 1990s, he founded a company called WebMind, with the goal of turning the world wide web into a self-organizing brain. But the idea proved too early, and WebMind was a casualty of the dot-com crash.A decade later, Bitcoin introduced blockchain technology to the world, gaining traction in the mainstream with each passing year. During that time, Goertzel worked as Chief Scientist of Hanson Robotics (the same company that built Sophia) alongside David Hanson, now the Robotics Lead of SingularityNET. The notion of something like SingularityNET had been in his head a long time, and when that coalesced with the possibilities of blockchain, it all clicked.""It seemed like many of the same things we want for fostering the emergence of AGI are the same things you want for making a more sort of democratic and broadly beneficial network of AIs,"" Goertzel said. ""Seeing that those two things are achieved by the same goals...it’s one of those things that's extremely obvious in hindsight.""David Hanson (C), chief executive officer (CEO) of Hanson Robotics, reacts to 'Han the Robot' (R)...

""You can have a reputation system where agents rate each other based on how well they did, and then you have built-in ways to protect against gaming and faking that reputation system. You can have agents pay each other for microtransactions without needing to incur the overhead of using Visa or Mastercard or bank transfers.""Blockchain answered one of the main issues WebMind ran up against two decades ago: the relationship between cost and functionality.""Back then encryption was insanely expensive, you know, how do you handle data privacy?"" Goertzel said. ""Now homomorphic encryption integrated in the blockchain let’s you flexibly expose one aspect of data to one customer, one aspect to another customer.""To that end, SingularityNET announced its Token Sale for AGI Token on Nov. 28, already receiving over $150M in pledged orders from approximately 10,000 registrants, with institutional backing from Blockchain Global, DigitalX, and Taas.Fund. Due to how oversubscribed the sale has become, SingularityNET has extended their token sale through 2018.Because AGI Token is an ERC20 token, 'smart contracts' will be an integral part of SingularityNET, allowing not only people to transact with other people, but AIs to transact and cooperate with other AIs.""If the peripheral node that’s directly serving a business—like summarizing a document, recognizing patterns in a picture, asking a question—if that’s accepting currency, it then has to dispense currency to other nodes to which it outsources work,"" Goertzel said. ""The node that recognizes errors in some line items in a spreadsheet, when it finds a word it doesn’t recognize in some column, it wants to outsource analysis of the meaning of that word to another AI agent—it should pay that AI agent for that. So then you need a token for internal transactions between the AIs.""That token, of course, needs to be able to keep up with AI—and have a structure to reward AIs and human actors who benefit the overall network.""That token should support fast, low-cost, microtransactions,"" Goertzel said. ""You also want to be able to use that token for rewards in a flexible way, to reward agents that do things that are good for the overall network.""The token's name is drawn from ""Artificial General Intelligence,"" the perceived intelligence of a human being. This is situated between ""Artificial Narrow Intelligence"" (ANI) and ""Artificial Super Intelligence"" (ASI). The general consensus is that we're currently somewhere in the higher end of ANI—but once SingularityNET comes to life, it's not likely to stay that way for long.For more information on SingularityNET, including the token sale, visit the official website. Join the Telegram channel to chat with the team and community.Editor’s Note: Neither the author nor Forbes endorses participation in any token sale or cryptocurrency investment, all of which have significant inherent risk.

[+] cybercriminals. (Photo by DAMIEN MEYER/AFP/Getty Images)","Five individuals have been arrested as part of an investigation into two major ransomware families - CTB-Locker and Cerber - that spread across Europe and the U.S. in recent years. All suspects were arrested in Romania, Europol announced Wednesday, as six properties were searched as part of a major global police operation involving the FBI and the UK National Crime Agency, as well as Romanian and Dutch investigators.CTB-Locker was one of the first ransomware strains to use the Tor anonymizing network in order to hide its command and control operations. It was also found by McAfee to be the most widespread ransomware of 2016. Criminals would typically spread it via spam containing an invoice, which, when opened, would attempt to infect Windows PCs. It was based on the code of CryptoLocker, previously one of the most successful ransomware variants around, until a police operation in June 2014 led to its demise, though not before it made $27 million in ransoms.When the police raided the homes of those they suspected being involved in CTB-Locker in the last week, they inadvertently came across what they claimed was evidence two members of the same gang were spreading Cerber, a ransomware that was focused on extorting money out of Americans. Earlier this year, Google ranked Cerber as the most criminally profitable ransomware around, having made $6.9 million up to July 2017. The two suspects were arrested in Bucharest as they were trying to leave the country, after U.S. authorities issued an international search warrant.Europol, which helped coordinate the international police operation, released a dramatic video of the arrests, in which armed officers stormed the suspects' residence.The Dutch police revealed that cryptocurrency mining equipment was seized, alongside laptops and hundreds of SIM cards. The identities of the individuals arrested were not released, however.A message to cybercriminals""Cybercrime is an area of crime like no other, where it is perceived as low risk, and high returns, which contributes greatly to its growth. Today a clear message has been sent that not only addresses this misconception, but emphasizes the value in public-private partnerships,"" said Raj Samani, CTO at McAfee, which helped on the investigation, first kicked off by the Dutch High Tech Crime Unit. He noted that since 2015, total ransomware has almost tripled, growing to more than 12 million samples in the third quarter of 2017.“Moreover, with arrests taking place it sends a message that being involved in cybercrime is definitely not zero risk,” Samani told Forbes. ""This is one of the first times we have seen arrests against a major ransomware family so the impact and message is huge.""It's been a busy week for law enforcement action against ransomware, in which the U.S. government officially blamed North Korea for WannaCry, which infected masses of global systems, demanding bitcoin in return. It was only when researcher Marcus Hutchins, later arrested and charged with creating the banking malware Kronos, that WannaCry’s spread was stymied.UPDATE: On December 28, the U.S. Department of Justice announced charges of two individuals suspected of distributing the Cerber ransomware, who were arrested at the Otopeni airport in Bucharest, Romania. They were named as Mihai Alexandru Isvanca, 25, and Eveline Cismaru, 28.They were charged not only for distributing ransomware, but also for illegally accessing 123 computers helping run Washington D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) surveillance cameras in January 2017, just ahead of President Trump's inauguration. Investigators found approximately 123 of the MPDC's 187 outdoor surveillance cameras had been accessed and compromised. The DoJ also accused the pair of pushing another ransomware called Dharma.The case was given highest priority thanks to the Secret Service's mission to protect the President and the potential impact on the security surrounding the Presidential Inauguration, the DoJ said. But the justice department said no one's safety was threatened or harmed as a result of the hacks."

But instead of our children being abducted, it’s our data that’s being held captive.Every 40 seconds a business falls victim to a ransomware attack. This billion-dollar industry is exploding, with attacks growing at a yearly rate of 350%. And by 2021, cybercrime will cost the world more than $6 trillion annually, according to Cybersecurity Ventures' 2016 Cybercrime Report. The epidemic is sweeping across the globe, and just when we think we might be gaining ground on our digital adversaries, a new, more powerful and complex attack is launched.Headlines highlight a world where network breaches and cyberattacks come by way of clever names and then demand payment through digital currencies like Bitcoin -- all of which sounds like something scripted out of a Hollywood blockbuster movie. But the increasing ultimatums attached to each variant are a far cry from their trivial names, and for those who simply refuse to pay, the fallout can be catastrophic.Fortunately, all ransomware attacks have one thing in common: They thrive on human error. So, with the proper behavioral changes, organizations can greatly minimize their chances of suffering a devastating blow. It all starts with developing a culture of cybersecurity. But what does that look like? And how can businesses make sure their culture stands up to the latest and greatest threats?Here’s a closer look at what it means to have a culture of cybersecurity in your organization:Risk ToleranceA successful cybersecurity culture cannot exist without first identifying your organization’s risk tolerance. This means there needs to be an established agreement assessing what data and systems must be protected, the level of security needed to protect these assets and how to go about securing them. The answers to these questions are vital to any and all information security policy frameworks and will drive the level of security within the organization, from what’s expected of each employee to the overall governance structure.Top DownHuman vulnerabilities exist at all levels of an organization, from top to bottom. That means the C-suite also needs to be on board with security protocols with just as much fervor as the executive assistants who mind the phones. Why? Because hackers make a living finding weak links and exploiting them. How do you get there? A consistent buy-in among employees starts with driving home the fact that everyone has a role to play in protecting the company’s assets, and no role is more important than any other. Additionally, employees are more likely to stay committed to the task if the security concepts can be easily implemented into their daily routines, much like brushing their teeth.It’s Tangible While cyberwarfare is a battle being fought in the digital world, a company’s physical environment is just as important in maintaining a certain level of security. The atmosphere not only can reveal a lot about the strength of a company’s cybersecurity culture, but it visually reinforces the policies in place. For instance, when you walk into the Pentagon and look around, you know the place is locked down tightly. It’s obvious the consequences of not following security protocols aren’t lost in the 17.5 miles of corridors and floor area that are all surrounded by steel-reinforced concrete walls. Maintaining a high level of security starts with the walls that encase the organization and moves inward. If your organization is a security mess, then employees won’t need to be shown the policies. They will already know what’s expected of them: not much.Awareness EducationYour employees are your No. 1 defense against a cyberattack. Likewise, they are also your biggest vulnerability, so the need to effectively educate, train and test them cannot be overstated. Too many companies think an annual cyber training class or stocking up on security technology will protect their organizations. This couldn’t be further from the truth.Effective education changes behavior and true change can’t be accomplished overnight. A regularly scheduled training session should be on the books. While every job title may require specific training, the fundamentals of all training programs should include solid password practices, email and cloud security standards, safe internet browsing, proper social media behavior, and mobile device security measures.It should also be noted that throwing policies and procedures at employees is not enough. A proper training program teaches the “why.” Why is it important to know what a phishing email looks like? Why is enabling two-factor authentication a necessity? What is the purpose of having secure passwords and a password manager? Driving home the why will help employees understand the big picture and increase the chances of a significant behavioral change."

Previous charters include ""New Rules"" singer Dua Lipa and buzzy boy band Why Don't We. All on her own, she's managed to grow her ""tribe,"" as she calls it, to right around 300,000 followers on Twitter. That's not Bieber numbers, but it's on par with -- and in some cases, much higher than -- several artists who have had multiple songs on the Billboard Hot 100.It's during the lead-up to her latest EP Special -- out Friday -- that her music has started to go viral. ""Drive"" has racked up over 2.5 million listens on SoundCloud, while her latest single ""There"" surpassed 1 million plays in 24 hours.  Much of this, undoubtedly, has to do with the music on Special itself, which marks a shift away from the acoustic sounds of her earlier career and more toward a more synth-driven pop sound. But Burke thinks it also has something to do with her use of data to her advantage, like when she determined  that 90 days was the perfect time to release new music in order to keep fans engaged.""I really believe that every artist needs to understand data,"" Burke says, ""because then you can know who your audience is and what they like and how to give them what they  want. Data is the solution to understand how to build a bigger audience.""Recently, Burke used her data expertise to try to solve a much more complex problem: Getting paid, and getting paid fast. A lot of times, Burke says  her royalties don't pay out for six to nine months. On top of that, music metadata -- the data that credits the producers, writers, performers of a song -- can be messy at best, as there is no one centralized authority where accurate data is stored. So for the release of Special, Burke decided to use blockchain technology to sort it out herself.For those who are unfamiliar with blockchain, Burke compares it to a shared global spreadsheet of data where there is no central authority. Unlike other databases, once data is introduced into a blockchain, it can't be deleted.  In the case of music metadata, it's a way to automatically link a song to the people who worked on it.  Burke made her music available via bitcoin.  Payments were then  automatically sent to all the producers and writers who worked on a song using an Ethereum smart contract within minutes.Burke isn't the only artist to propose Blockchains as a potential solution. This summer, singer-songwriter Imogen Heap wrote in Harvard Business Review that blockchain ""could help musicians make money again."" Back in 2015, her  song ""Tiny Human"" became the first song to automatically distribute payments via an Ethereum smart contract.While Burke doesn't  think blockchain is the only solution for royalties payment, ""it's a step in the right direction,"" and one other artists should consider taking.""People have always looked to artists as basically the way of the future, as influencers,"" she said. ""It's up to artists to move along technology in new ways."""

well as US dollars. The notion of peers being judged by their peers ...","Oct 23, 2017,02:59pm EDT","Earlier this year, a UK crowdsourced platform called Crowdjustice rang the first bells in the cathedral of justice and legal disruption.","Those bells tolled large in London when the plaintiffs crowdfunded a 'Brexit people’s challenge' to the Supreme Court, which agreed that Parliament must authorize the UK leaving the EU.Shortly afterwards Crowdjustice launched in the US when it raised funds to support the Aziz brothers, who were prevented from entering the US from Yemen. It has now raised £3.5 million and received more than 100,000 pledges for the cases it fights.Crowdjustice’s ‘legal precedent’ has now been joined by a similarly revolutionary service that wants to alleviate the many nuisances of the legal system.Jury.Online is a new service where any kind of small dispute can be resolved via its platform by jurors who specialize in different sectors. Moreover, it wants to abolish the high prices that professional legal services charge for minor cases.What makes Jury.Online interesting is the manner in which it functions. Deals are executed in the form of smart contracts via blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrencies.Smart contracts are executed with predetermined conditions by parties and blockchain data cannot be modified or altered, making the process safe and secure.Would it be possible to have a world without lawyers? Credit: Jury.OnlineBoth parties in a deal deposit their funds and define every necessary detail beforehand. If there is a dispute among any of the parties, a random set of jurors will be selected from a pool that will then perform a fair, quick and objective dispute resolution.The winning party with most votes would then receive the initially deposited funds. If no dispute arises however, the funds are returned to each party.Blockchain, of course, is a decentralized technology meaning there are no intermediaries to interfere in the execution of a deal. ""In five years, I hope to make lawyers redundant, at least for small cases to start with. When people want to buy a product or service overseas, for example, they won't have to consider the things that might go wrong during the process.“We believe our system makes legal confrontation much simpler and a lot easier when ensuring the success of a transaction,” said Alexander Shevtsov, Founder, Jury.Online.In a world where there appears to be one rule for the rich and another one for those less fortunate, the democratising of the law has huge support, bolstered by the surging interest in the blockchain, cryptocurrencies and ICOs.In this case (and unlike the real world when those on mandatory jury service only receive minimal expenses), jurors are paid with Jury.Online Tokens (JOTs). Those interested in Jury.Online’s services can purchase JOTS during the company’s  current ICO.The event will occur in two stages - the pre-sale begins today and finishes on  3rd November. 20% of all tokens available will be allocated with a 30%  discount. The Token Sale that begins on 13th November for a month until 13th December will offer a 20% discount for early participants.Users can purchase JOTs with cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or Bitcoin as well as US dollars.The notion of peers being judged by their peers on a platform that does away with the expensive middle men is one that is likely to be popular. Moreover the parallel rise of digital currencies and ICOs add to the acceleration of legal disruption.For now, the jury may be out on Jury.Online, perhaps the deliberation during its ICO will prove that its case may be overwhelming... or otherwise."
