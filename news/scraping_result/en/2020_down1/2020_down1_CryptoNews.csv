","Gary McFarlane is a cryptocurrency analyst at interactive investor, a UK-based investment platform.
","With central bank money-printing machines switched back on, might bitcoin be the star of the recession?Whether the bounce in both bitcoin and stocks holds will undoubtedly depend on progress in containing COVID-19 and handling the economic fallout.That means it is probably still too early to call the bottom in equities, which bitcoin has been tightly correlated with these past couple of weeks.But what about bitcoin? Today that correlation is still in effect, as both equities and crypto rise, but, as we have seen in bitcoin’s recent price movements, that may be loosening. Although a dangerous sport to indulge in, bottom-calling on bitcoin may be easier to do at this juncture for other assets.With the possibility of finding a low in the USD 3,000 area now further away, and perhaps many of those who wanted to raise cash finished with their selling, bitcoin may have the worst behind it.Certainly, as we have previously noted, the top digital currency’s safe-haven properties were found wanting, but so too were gold’s at the beginning of this bear market.As it happens, the digital gold thesis is still very much intact and the significance of the synchronized jump yesterday after the Fed’s “do whatever it takes” moment, should be emphasized.Indeed, it could be argued that bitcoin is in a stronger position than gold.Crypto followers will be aware that the Fed’s reprise of QE takes us back to where it all began for bitcoin.In short, the return of the money-printing machines – but on an even bigger scale – has the potential to truly make this the time for bitcoin to shine.Bitcoin’s limited supply stands in stark contrast to central bank monetary policy. Add to that the halving in block rewards coming in May, and the asset’s “censorship resistance” becomes a big plus.To put that in plain English, bitcoin could act as a hedge against inflation.Clem Chambers, chief executive of international private investor network ADVFN and crypto firm Online Blockchain, certainly thinks so.In comments provided to interactive investor, Chambers said: “Bitcoin is ‘the new gold’ but there is a lot less of it than there is gold around the world. The initial rally in bitcoin was created by the demand from the Chinese rich as flight capital. That story is over and as soon as there was nowhere to go for these buyers they sold and down came BTC. “Also creating a crash for BTC was the recent liquidity squeeze where any easily liquidated asset was sold for cash to make wage and margin calls.”Chambers continued: “Now we are in a new dynamic: the ‘QE everything everywhere’ move by central banks to flood the world with cheap loans to keep the world from going bust in the new quarantined dystopia. “Now investors are worried about inflation, and bitcoin and gold are rallying accordingly. This theme will run and run.”But Chambers cautions that it is the coronavirus that dominates everything.“In the background, the halvening is fast approaching which is generating some updraft but that is nothing compared to the rolling saga of the coronavirus, which will drive all markets until further notice.”Another positive for bitcoin is the unwelcome fact that an increasing number of economies are going into recession (or are already there), especially those dependent on oil exports.In the most bombed-out of those economies, where the local currency begins to sag, then bitcoin can assume a role as a uniquely accessible and liquid store of value, even if consumers and investors might be moving in and out as a bridging currency.Then there is the wider issue of how opportunity emerges from crisis.The Libra Association has not gone away, and neither has the looming launch of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in China.Although both are hated by crypto “true believers” as the bastard children of crypto, both in their own ways could help to popularise mass adoption of digital currencies, or at the least attract institutional interest to the sector.Libra, contrary to previous assertions from Facebook, could still launch without regulatory backing in the US, perhaps from Switzerland. It could be backed by safe-haven currencies other than the US dollar, such as the Swiss Franc and the yen.Alternatively, the Libra Association sticks with the dollar route to market, but pressures the regulators while they may be a little distracted and gets the green light for its scaled-back version of the original whitepaper iteration of the “stablecoin” digital currency.With Shopify onboard – a company that provides merchant facilities to a huge range of online properties – Libra could pose as the sort of cost-saving payments solution that can help precisely those small firms worldwide that are being hardest hit by the corona crisis. And so too might a resurgent “real” crypto for cross-border transactions.As for China, the notion that it has beaten the virus is almost certainly overstated, and the collapse in industrial production and consumer demand will not recover as quickly as optimists expect.In such an environment, the opportunity to “internationalize” the yuan that a CBDC would offer and the finer control over monetary policy, may prove irresistible, bringing forward the launch.But the big news this week was that U.S. politicians voiced an idea of a ""digital dollar.""The advantages of such an instrument would be the ease with which, for example, “helicopter money” could be distributed to consumers, as is planned in the various competing stimuli proposals.In this coronavirus moment, it is the credit markets that may be the weakest link – especially high-yield corporate debt. As such, limiting any damage there, and progress on the virus-containment front, are key market-health determinants. If the current crisis morphs into a credit crisis, with rising corporate credit defaults, then the equity, bond and crypto markets will fall further still – which is why the Fed’s corporate bond-buying, including junk high-yield, is so critical. Crypto investors will need to keep a keen eye on events beyond the world of crypto. Bitcoin seemed to fail the initial shock of the virus, but may yet reclaim its footing to be the star of the recession, however long that might last."

March 13, 2020
","The expected economic impact of the coronavirus has resulted in crashing stock markets across the globe. Unfortunately, the same thing happened in the crypto markets in the past few days when it became apparent that COVID-19 has become a pandemic.","In this article, which is not a financial advice and you should always do your own research before investing, we will discuss possible ways to trade the current crypto market volatility for those who are brave (or crazy) enough to do so. The world’s leading cryptocurrency, bitcoin (BTC), lost all its 2020 gains and is now 24% down year-to-date. (But still up 31% in a year).For medium to long-term bitcoin investors, the current market meltdown does not bode well. While experienced investors have seen this type of market drop before, it still does not feel good to see the value of your BTC holdings to drop almost half over the course of a few days. Conversely, for traders who are actively trading in and out of bitcoin and other digital assets, the current market volatility creates opportunities to generate trading profits. If you fall into the latter category of market participants, however, there are a number of basic trading rules, you should stay mindful of in this market. Now, let’s look at a few things you can do to potentially increase your chances of coming out unscathed (and perhaps even profitable) trading the current market volatility. Hopefully, the money you have invested in crypto is only a small amount of your overall investment portfolio and not funds that you could potentially need in the near future. If that is the case, you should assess your portfolio and look at which assets you are comfortable holding versus assets you would like to hold more of. If you would like to have more in BTC now that it has dropped so sharply, and less in another asset, maybe now would be a good time to change your asset allocation. Also, if you are unsure of what direction the market will go next, you can always move some (or all) of your funds into USDT or USDC and wait for a moment before reentering the market. The reality is that the market can still go a lot lower. Yes, even major altcoins - like XRP or BCH - that have lost over 95% of their value since their all-time highs, can drop further in value. And so can BTC. Therefore, it is advisable to put stop-loss limits in place so that if the price of the digital asset you have purchased drops by a certain percentage amount, your position automatically gets closed out to prevent further losses. Alternatively, you could use trailing stop-loss limits to protect your downside while cashing in on brief market spikes. The difference between a stop-loss limit and a trailing-stop loss limit is that the latter adjusts to the prevailing market price. So, if you set a trailing stop-loss limit 5% below the current market price and the price moves up by 25%, your stop-loss limit will trail the market price and only sell your holdings once the new price drops by 5%. That way, you can lock in profits without too much downside risk. Leverage tends to exasperate sharp bitcoin moves, especially when the market tanks. That also seems to have been the case this week, after BitMEX “went under maintenance.”If you are going to trade using margin, you should probably keep the leverage to a minimum. Chances are that you will get liquidated pretty quickly in the current volatile market, especially when you are trading with too much leverage. If you are reading this, you will most likely actively trade bitcoin or, at the very least, believe in its future. If either one is true, you could consider taking a look at the BTC options market. Bitcoin derivatives trading platforms, like Deribit or Quedex, enable retail traders (so, effectively anyone with an Internet connection) to bet on the price of bitcoin using financial options. For example, you could buy a bitcoin call option with a strike price of USD 10,000 and six months expiry on Deribit for BTC 0.15 (USD 770). If the price of bitcoin exceeds the USD 10,000 mark before September 25, the profit on your option would be the difference between the amount that the price of bitcoin is trading at above USD 10,000 and the BTC 0.15 you paid for the call option. Alternatively, if you are comfortable with your current portfolio and believe that your chosen assets will perform over the long-term but you want to protect your downside risk, you could buy a put option on bitcoin. If you buy a BTC put option with a strike price of USD 2,500, for example, you would start to be “in-the-money” with your put as soon as the market price drops below the strike. So, if your portfolio value would collapse roughly in line with the price of bitcoin, you would earn on your put option to lessen the financial blow. Finally, if you are finding yourself in a situation where you may need some of the funds you hold in crypto to support yourself and/or your family financially, you seriously need to consider selling some crypto for fiat. While this may be considered blasphemy in some crypto circles, the reality is that if your income could take a hit due to your national (and/or the global economy) grinding to a halt due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it would probably be wise to hold funds in cash just in case.

March 15, 2020
","Bitcoin (BTC) is the most secure cryptocurrency with the most secure blockchain, remind the legions of Bitcoiners who argue that the cryptocurrency's increasing hashrate is enough to ensure that it never succumbs to a 51% attack.","However, skeptics argue that Bitcoin's halving block rewards put this much-fabled security at risk. By reducing the quantity of new BTC given to those who mine the cryptocurrency, there will be less financial incentive to maintain the Bitcoin network's high hashrate, in theory making 51% attacks more feasible.Nonetheless, other commentators believe that the increasing value of transaction fees will be enough to ensure Bitcoin's security. Because even with declining (or non-existent) block rewards, Bitcoin's rising value and adoption would mean that the rewards accruing from transaction fees will incentivize mining, they say.It's already common knowledge that Bitcoin's next halving will take place this May, when the reward for being the first to confirm a block will be reduced from BTC 12.5 to 6.25. After this, the next halving will take place after another 210,000 blocks have been mined, and so on, until Bitcoin's supply cap of BTC 21 million has been reached in around 120 years.The next three halvings will reduce the block rewards down to BTC 3.125, 1.56250000 and then 0.78125000. According to Emin Gün Sirer, CEO of AVA Labs, the developer of the AVA blockchain, such reductions will be enough to seriously weaken Bitcoin's security.""As the amount of awards given to the miners dwindles down, the security of the network will drop,"" he says. ""If the security drops sufficiently, we may even see massive double-spend attacks targeting exchanges. This would, in turn, trigger exchanges to extend their confirmation times. At some point, the attackers might have access to so much hashpower that no reasonable number of confirmations may be sufficient to guarantee security.""
Sirer adds, ""I give Bitcoin at most 3 more halvings, that is 12 years, before the rewards given to the miners drop to the point where intervention is necessary.""Sirer adds, ""I give Bitcoin at most 3 more halvings, that is 12 years, before the rewards given to the miners drop to the point where intervention is necessary.""As reported, he argues that removing Bitcoin's supply cap would solve this.On the face of it, Sirer's argument looks plausible - block rewards are unquestionably getting lower, and after 30 halvings they will be reduced to nothing.Still, other people in the industry argue that transaction fees will be more than enough to incentivize Bitcoin mining. Kraken's director of business development, Dan Held, is one of these.""As we've seen Bitcoin's subsidy decrease dramatically through halvenings, we've seen the block reward [new BTC and transaction fees] grow to exponentially higher levels,"" he tells Cryptonews.com. ""And as the block reward value grew massively, we've seen transaction fees as a percentage of the block reward continue to grow as well, demonstrating that long term security should be fine with only transaction fees.""By both ""block reward,"" Held is referring to newly minted BTC and transaction fees. And according to data from Coin Metrics, the amount paid daily in USD in transactions has been rising over the long term.As reported, Bitcoin all-time cumulative transaction fees hit a symbolic amount of USD 1 billion recently. At the same time, Bitcoin all-time miner revenue (transaction fees plus block rewards) reached USD 15 billion.In July 2016 (when the previous halving took place), the total value of all Bitcoin transactions for a single day of confirmations was only USD 30,700. On March 12, 2020, this figure was roughly USD 192,200. However, it’s still small compared with block rewards.Total value of coinbase block rewards and transaction fees paid to miners.So block rewards are still highly important to miners, but the point is that transaction fees as a percentage of total block rewards are growing, as Dan Held suggests. Moreover, if Bitcoin gains wider adoption, and if its price rises, the value of fees will increase.George Agathangelou, the chief marketing officer at blockchain credential firm Block.co, agrees with Held's analysis. He believes that Bitcoin's hashrate will continue to rise even with declining block rewards.""In my view, the long-term reduction in block rewards will not undermine Bitcoin’s security if the current trend in the Bitcoin hashrate continues to rise,"" he tells Cryptonews.com. ""We do notice that significant investments in mining farms are being allocated around the world, while at the same time the hardware performance of mining rigs is also increasing. As a result, I would expect that the hashrate will continue to rise in the future and that Bitcoin’s security will keep on rising despite the block rewards reduction.""Meanwhile, Bitcoin educator Andreas Antonopoulos stressed on multiple occasions that even if the number of miners would drop by 50%, the miners who stick around and wait for the mining difficulty re-targeting, would be twice as profitable afterwards: “That is a pretty good incentive to stick around.”Also, according to Antonopoulos, ”Bitcoin could run today with one-tenth of the mining power and be very very secure without any problems.” “How do I know? Well, we had one-tenth of the mining power year and a half ago. It was very very secure then. So nothing really happens when the block subsidy runs out, nothing really happens when the halving happens, nothing happens if a bunch of miners turn off their equipment other than a slight delay in block issuance which then gets adjusted in less than two weeks. This is a dynamic system that is constantly adapting to change,” he said at the end of 2019.Some miners will drop out. The hashrate goes down. Difficulty adjusts, making it easier for new miners to enter the… https://t.co/kflH2M0D3mThe bottom line is that, if Bitcoin continues to enjoy increasing adoption, its security will rise in parallel. If not, it may be in trouble.As Dan Held explains, fees are ""directionally proportional to both the value of the network and usage. In other words, the block reward [newly minted BTC and fees] equilibrates towards adoption. There isn't a situation in which there is a disconnect as participants in this game are only financially incentivized (there is no altruism).""George Agathangelou agrees. ""As long the price of bitcoin is above the average cost to mine a bitcoin, there will always be incentives to enter the market as a miner.""

","Bitcoin's supply cap is one of its biggest selling points. Limiting the network to almost 21 million BTC, the cap makes Bitcoin a ‘deflationary’ currency.","Naturally, people have been questioning whether it might be possible to remove this cap. In theory, by simply submitting a pull request to Bitcoin Core's GitHub, a hosting service that is most often used for code, repository, a developer could potentially have the cap's removal introduced into a future version of Bitcoin.But according to Bitcoin developers and other industry players, the likelihood of this happening is very low. Yes, it’s technically feasible, but at least now there's an enormous social consensus against such removal. Even if such a pull request goes through, most likely it would end up with another version of “Bitcoin” while the original cryptocurrency would still have its supply cap. The most recent debate kicked off with a tweet from Angela Walch, a research fellow at the UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies.@angela_walch If I present a properly formatted constitutional amendment that removes the right of women to vote, w… https://t.co/WDw93pDJOQAs Walch points out, there are only so many reasons why a pull request to update Bitcoin Core's code can be rejected by an editor. These include duplication of effort, disregard for formatting rules, being too unfocused or too broad, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing backward compatibility.However, another cause for rejection is the failure to comply with Bitcoin's philosophy. It's here that Walch's suggestion falls down, since a raised or unlimited supply cap would almost certainly depart from this philosophy, and it would almost certainly confront widespread opposition from Bitcoin developers.""In order for a pull request to be accepted, it first needs to go through peer review,"" explains Benedict Chan, the chief technical officer for BitGo. ""A change to the supply cap would represent a significant modification to the behavior of the software properties, and would likely generate substantial discussion and pushback ""NACK""s [negative-acknowledgments]. Without clear consensus, no Bitcoin core maintainer would merge it into the code repository.""But even if Bitcoin developers were to insert the removal of the cap into a new Bitcoin Core version, this doesn't necessarily mean that Bitcoin would have its cap removed.""Once the new release is distributed, different stakeholders - users, miners, and various organizations that service the industry (exchanges and wallet providers) must all download and run it,"" says Benedict Chan. ""These stakeholders are incentivized to verify the behavior of the code, understand what they are running, and (hopefully) act in a manner that will be positive for themselves and Bitcoin. They may not see the removal of the supply cap as an improvement, and thus not move forward to run it.""In other words, even if the developers release a new version of Bitcoin without the supply cap, the people who actually run Bitcoin may refuse to use it.Guardian Circle CEO/Co-founder Mark Jeffrey agrees. ""If a change of this magnitude WERE to somehow make it through the Bitcoin developer community, there would be a revolt at the miner and exchange level,"" he says. ""I'd expect a major fork to occur, and I would expect the market to largely rally around the fork where the 21m cap was preserved.""A fork into two separate cryptocurrencies would occur, and this leads CEO and co-founder of Bull Bitcoin, Francis Pouliot, to argue that the forked cryptocurrency without the 21 million supply cap would no longer be Bitcoin.He tells Cryptonews.com, ""Bitcoin's supply cap cannot be lifted, because whatever shitcoin is airdropped to existing Bitcoin users, even if its promoters call it Bitcoin, will be incompatible with the existing Bitcoin network and therefore would not be Bitcoin.""Meanwhile, there is another Bitcoin supply cap-related narrative, popular among the Bitcoin skeptics and in the camp of altcoins and “altchains.”For example, Emin Gün Sirer, CEO of AVA Labs, the developer of the AVA blockchain, says that an alteration to the 21 million cap might be necessary after three more Bitcoin mining reward halvings due to security reasons. ""As the amount of awards given to the miners dwindles down, the security of the network will drop,” he says, forecasting “massive double-spend attacks targeting exchanges” and suggesting that removing the supply cap would solve this. However, Bitcoiners say that Sirer is wrong and halving block rewards won’t weaken Bitcoin’s security. Read about it here."

","Spring is in the air for those of us in the Northern Hemisphere, and that means it is time to get started with some spring cleaning – especially for those of us with crypto holdings.","If you trade cryptocurrency on a relatively frequent basis, you will probably have tiny sums in exchange wallets that are too small to trade or withdraw as they fall below the transaction value requirements to take such actions.Some types of dust can even be harmful – especially if you are not the one who accumulated it.Fortunately, there are a number of ways to address the problem of accumulating all this “crypto dust.”Learn what crypto dust is – and discover what you can do about it. In the crypto markets, dust refers to a fraction of a cryptocurrency token that is so small that it cannot be traded. As a result, most crypto dust lies idle in exchange wallets.In some cases, the holdings in questions are exceptionally small, to the extent that they cannot even be moved off the exchange and into a personal wallet as they do not meet minimum withdrawal value requirements.While crypto dust may not sound like a massive issue, there is actually a substantial amount of capital effectively locked away in wallets that could otherwise be deployed to provide market liquidity and help the industry grow.Your ability to deal with crypto dust will depend largely on the policies of the exchange where it has been piling up.Unfortunately, most exchanges have done little or nothing to address this issue.Most exchanges have minimum trade size requirements, such as 0.001 of a token, and have a minimum withdrawal value requirement to cover transaction fees.However, if you happen to have any smaller holdings on Binance, you can use the exchange’s “Convert into BNB” feature, which lets users to convert all holdings – including crypto dust – into the company’s native Binance Coin (BNB) with the click of a button. But even if your exchange does not offer this sort of feature, there are other ways of getting around your dust problems.One more obvious solution involves topping up the cryptocurrency dust to the point where its value meets the minimum trading limit. From there, you can convert it to your token of choice. Alternatively, you could top up your dust to the point where it meets your exchange’s minimum withdrawal value requirement. Then you can transfer your smaller holdings to an exchange, and use available crypto dust cleaning features.From there, it should be an easy process if you want to withdraw the funds to your bank account – as long as you have a verified account and have set up a fiat on/off-ramp.You cannot talk about crypto dust without mentioning dusting attacks. While crypto dust piling up on exchanges can be a mild annoyance for traders, the threat of a dusting attack for privacy-conscious crypto users is arguably a much more serious matter.Generally speaking, dusting attacks involve malicious actors attempting to uncover the identity of the users of a public blockchain network such as Bitcoin (BTC). They do this by sending a tiny amount of cryptocurrency to a BTC wallet.The subsequent transactional activities that make use of these addresses can then be tracked in an attempt to gain insight into fund flows and, potentially, the real-world identity of the owners of the addresses they target.The developers of the privacy-focused bitcoin wallet Samourai Wallet warned of the dangers of this type of attack on Twitter back in October 2018, stating:“If you have recently received a very small amount of BTC in your wallet unexpectedly, you may be the target of a ""dusting attack"" designed to de-anonymise you by linking your inputs together.”If you value your privacy, it pays to be very skeptical if any small, inexplicable cryptocurrency payments turn up in any of your wallets – even those you rarely make use of.If you do receive a small transaction like this, you may want to run your coins through a mixing service to ensure your privacy is not compromised.Dust-busting pays – whether you are responsible for its creation or not, clearing it up can be both profitable and safe."

","Sometimes, the history indeed repeats itself. In the Cryptoverse, it's the short-term traders who have been driving the most recent sell-off. Again.  ","As reported in October 2019, crypto market analysis firm Coin Metrics found that the bitcoin (BTC) selling pressure at the time originated from short-term traders that got this coin at prices between USD 10,000 and USD 12,000.Today, in their latest report, following the most recent market crash on March 13, Coin Metrics says that ""recent price movements were likely mostly driven by shorter-term and relatively new holders,"" according to on-chain data. They support this claim with four arguments.Based on the gathered data, the analysts concluded that:""This signals that a vast majority of the activity on March 11th and March 12th involved BTC that had been held for less than a year,"" writes Coin Metrics.The firm adds that this finding is further confirmed by transfer value days destroyed, which multiplies transfer value by the amount of days that the coins being transferred last moved on-chain, giving a much higher weight to older coins. ""There was not a significant spike in BTC transfer value days destroyed on March 11th or March 12th,"" they write. ""This signals that there was not a relatively high amount of long-held coins moved prior to the recent price action.""BTC SOPR (spent output profit ratio) dropped to 0.843 on March 12, which Coin Metrics says it's the lowest value in eight years - since February 2012. Since SOPR is a network-wide indicator of profit/loss, a SOPR below 1.0 means that investors are selling at a loss, the report explains.BTC MVRV (market value to realized value) dropped below 1.0 - for only the fourth time in its entire history. An MVRV below 1.0 may mean that holders have a higher market valuation than current speculators. Meanwhile, the markets are still volatile and the firm can't say what's to come, but all is not lost. The report concludes that this initial date they found in the aftermath of the market crash is actually ""somewhat reassuring,"" given that ""longer-term holders seem to be holding strong, at least for now.""Additional conclusions the report reached include: Learn more: 10 Crypto Minds Weigh in On Post-Crash Bitcoin and Its Future"

March 24, 2020
","Following the last few weeks carnage in the financial markets, bitcoin (BTC) may be starting to look like a viable alternative for some of the capital that is leaving Wall Street.","A “decoupling” of bitcoin prices from the broader financial system is something many community members have called for, and said that they expect will happen in the near future. Not surprisingly, such a shift would also likely attract more capital from the traditional financial system and over to bitcoin, simply due to the benefit of having an uncorrelated asset in a portfolio. However, the jury is still out on whether BTC is an uncorrelated asset.And given what we have seen in the markets over the past few days, we may have started to see evidence of this shift happening, with bitcoin now seemingly decoupling from the stock market and other risk assets. Unlike the broader financial markets, the number one digital asset has so far only seen one day of heavy selling as a result of the coronavirus market panic and has already recovered nearly two-thirds of the sell-off. Interestingly, bitcoin’s rebound has so far been markedly more powerful than that of ethereum (ETH) and other major altcoins such as XRP and litecoin (LTC), which has essentially remained in a consolidation pattern since the sell-off.Not surprisingly, the bitcoin rebound has also led to a rise in the bitcoin dominance, defined as bitcoin’s share of the overall market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, which is now up by around 5 percentage points since its bottom in mid-February. As of press time on Tuesday, the dominance number stood at 67.5%.In practice, it can, therefore, be argued that bitcoin has acted similarly to gold, which also saw an initial sell-off as market participants panicked and sold “everything” in a global run to the U.S. dollar. Following the initial decline, however, gold also rebounded and has now recovered more than half of its losses.Gold is almost back to it highs.  I believe it’s going much higher.  Let’s go $BTC.  Get on your horse and ride.   Same thesis.On the other hand, the stock market, represented by the broad S&P 500 index, is currently down about 30% from the peak before the crisis. And although stocks were pointing sharply higher today after a slew of new stimulus measures were announced by the Fed yesterday, a sustained trend change has yet to happen."

","Making larger bitcoin (BTC) transactions for business or other purposes can be daunting – and that is why many choose to make use bitcoin escrow services. Simply put, these can help you ensure that you only part with your coins after all aspects of your agreement have been met.","But are bitcoin escrow services all they are cracked up to be? And which ones are gaining traction in 2020?An escrow service is provided by a third party, who can temporarily hold and regulate payment in a transaction, ensuring that both involved parties adhere to the terms of their arrangement. Once all terms of the agreed transaction have been met, the escrow service provider will authorize the payment. Effectively, escrow exists to ensure that large payments are processed in a timely manner, and according to pre-agreed terms. Traditionally, banks and other financial institutions have provided escrow services. Nowadays, you can also find a large number of internet-based escrow service providers.As bitcoin transactions are irreversible, it should come as no surprise to learn that crypto escrow service providers are now becoming increasingly common.In fact, you might have already used a bitcoin escrow service without realizing it!If you have traded on a platform like LocalBitcoins, for example, you will have used an escrow service.On this peer-to-peer trading platform, when a buyer finds a seller and enters into a trade, the seller’s bitcoin holdings are temporarily held in escrow by LocalBitcoins until the buyer has sent the money.Once the payment for the BTC has been received by the seller, the exchange will, in turn, release the bitcoin held in escrow. Aside from peer-to-peer exchanges that use escrow solutions, there are also dedicated bitcoin escrow service providers.While the exact steps vary slightly from provider to provider, bitcoin escrow generally works as follows: Service providers, in turn, charge a small commission fee.Here are five bitcoin escrow services that many traders consider to be relatively safe.Bitrated is an Israel-based provider that has been operating since 2013. The company says it provides “reputation management and consumer protection for the bitcoin ecosystem.”Technically speaking, however, Bitrated is not exactly an escrow service provider. Instead, its payment platform enables cryptocurrency users to make multisig-based bitcoin transactions using smart contracts. That means when one party wants to make a larger bitcoin payment to another party, both parties choose a third-party provider that can also access a key to the multisig wallet. Provided that at least two parties agree that the terms of the transaction have been met, the funds will be released (as two signatures are needed to meet the terms of the smart contract). Bitrated is free to use, but third-party agents may charge a fee for fulfilling their role in the transaction.Coinsavr lets cryptocurrency users keep their funds in escrow when they process bitcoin transactions. This Canada-based company boats a user-friendly, web-based dashboard, but requires that you deposit your tokens on their platform first before being able to use escrow services.Coinsavr charges a 1% flat fee plus USD 2 for escrow transactions.Escaroo is a relatively new online provider that was launched in 2019. It claims to enable cryptocurrency users to add a level of security to their cryptocurrency transactions. Using a non-custodial, smart contract-powered KeylessEscrow system, this UK-based startup, which is registered with the (offshore) Jersey Financial Services Commission says it lets users make secure payments where funds are temporarily held in escrow to ensure all terms of the transaction have been met. Escaroo charges a 1.5% flat fee for personal and small business transactions, with customized fees for corporate transactions.IBC Group is a blockchain financial services company that says it is primarily focused on digital asset-based fundraising.According to its website, IBC says it adheres to international KYC and AML guidelines and makes use of smart contracts as part of its escrow offering, for which it charges a 1% flat fee.ItBit Escrow is a crypto escrow service provided by New York-based and New York-regulated exchange called ItBit.The company says all of the USD funds held on the ItBit platform are Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-insured, and it also claims to be a regulated crypto custodian.The minimum transaction size for ItBit Escrow is USD 50,000 and the primary target group for this escrow is professional and institutional traders.ItBit also charges a flat rate fee for escrow transactions.Using an escrow service for larger bitcoin transactions can help mitigate the risk if you are entering into a financial agreement and crypto is involved.However, as is the case with everything in finance, you can never be too careful. Remember that with escrow services, at some point along the line, you will need to trust a third-party with your funds, so some risks still remain.Try to use a regulated service when possible, and make sure the service you use is above-board before you ask yourself – to escrow or not to escrow?"

","Bitcoin (BTC) continues to boom in Venezuela – but only because it is helping citizens buy hard-to-purchase foreign fiats, says an industry observer.","As previously reported, trading volumes on peer-to-peer (P2P) platform LocalBitcoins have spiked again in recent weeks.In a report from the Open Money Initiative, author Matt Ahlborg wrote,“For a long time, the bitcoin community had surmised that the increase in bitcoin volume must mean it was being used as a store of value against the devaluing bolivar. We can now confidently say that this isn’t the primary use case.”Instead, the Open Money Initiative’s findings indicate that rather than using bitcoin “as a store of value endpoint,” it is instead being used “as a channel on the road to obtain more stable currencies such as the United States dollar, Colombian peso, Chinese yuan, and various stablecoins.”And the report’s authors say that one specific demographic group may well be responsible for the vast majority of trading on LocalBitcoins and similar platforms – namely Chinese Venezuelans.There are some 450,000 ethnic Chinese in Venezuela, and Ahlborg wrote,“Looking through advertisements and trading data on LocalBitcoins, we found that a sizable chunk of those selling bolivars to acquire bitcoins on LocalBitcoins are members of the Chinese-Venezuelan community. It seems likely that they are channeling profits from their bolivar-heavy cashflow businesses within Venezuela (restaurants and general stores), converting them and sending them to Chinese yuan accounts in China or US dollar accounts in Panama or the United States for saving and commerce payments.”Indeed, the report goes on to note that “money transferred out of Venezuela may be held in a host of fintech applications” including Chinese favorites like Alipay and WeChat Pay” – although “crypto exchanges such as Bitfinex or Binance” were other popular destinations.Ahlborg added that bitcoin converted to fiat was also being used online to pay for “streaming services like Netflix, video games on Steam or even physical goods on Amazon, which can be sent to Venezuela via courier services.”Meanwhile, the United States Department of Justice has issued an indictment on Venezuelan leaders, including President Nicolás Maduro, whom they have accused of cryptocurrency-powered “narco-terrorism.”The indictment also names Joselit Ramirez, the head of Sunacrip (Venezuela’s cryptocurrency agency), as a “narco-terrorism” accomplice. The American agency says that Ramirez helped Maduro and others avoid American sanctions in 2018."

","Disclaimer: The text below is a sponsored article that was not written by Cryptonews.com journalists.
","Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that can be used to trade online and, in turn, keeps the trader anonymous. These type of currencies are not legal tender; it does not exist as a coin or a bill; they are virtual currencies that are stored on e-wallets. Bitcoin is a common type of cryptocurrency that can be kept in a wallet more like saving cash in a bank account. Bitcoin can be used to purchase things online and can also be transferred to other people’s Bitcoin wallets. This type of cryptocurrency can't be withdrawn, but they can be exchanged for real-life currencies like Pounds and dollars.Any government does not control Bitcoins, unlike traditional currencies. This virtual currency is decentralized, so everyone has access to the blockchain, and transactions with Bitcoin are usually anonymous and transparent; it is one of the reasons why gambling with it at mobile casinos is common.Online casinos are beginning to transact more using bitcoin. Games by top-class developers like NetEnt and Microgaming are now available to be played using bitcoin as a means of staking. You can even find some casinos that deal strictly with Bitcoin. According to a recent statistic, bitcoin gamblers have wagered 4.5billion dollars in Bitcoin (BTC) since 2014. This tends to show the increased rate at which players stake using BTC.To play with bitcoins at mobile casino sites reviewed by IrishCasinoHEX, you should have some level of understanding of how online gambling works and also about Bitcoins before dealing with both at the same time. To avoid any overwhelming situation, taking some time to learn about the whole process will help.Bitcoin is not like any traditional currency you have been familiar with. It is not centralized or regulated, and no institution oversees or controls transactions with it. The cryptocurrency strictly relies on cryptography and algorithms, and it works using a technology called blockchain, which the Bitcoin uses to secure its transactions and information. A block is usually impenetrable when it is added to a chain. A security measure has been programmed into the blockchain to make it collapse if a block is compromised.  Just as with everything in life, dealing with Bitcoins in a mobile casino comes with its own risk. The big concern in mobile casino gambling is the issue of the safety of a player’s personal information as well as keeping their financial account that has been linked to the mobile casino secure. By mainly transacting with Bitcoin, the risk of having your data compromised is significantly reduced. It is worth noting that Bitcoin is a reasonably unstable currency; that is, it can have different values in just a day. It can drop fast or spikes equally as quick, and at times its value stays in a particular range. A common concern is that at one specific time, Bitcoin can drop so much in value that it goes below what it was worth when it was bought, and this will mean a loss for the buyer. Transactions with Bitcoins cannot be reversed and there is no insurance on it since it has no regulation guiding it in the first place. If by mistake, you make a transfer into a wrong wallet, or somehow your wallet gets compromised and your bitcoins get stolen, there is no way to recover your BTC.If you have experience gambling online with standard real-world currencies, then you should know that bitcoin gambling is very similar. The significant difference lies in the nature of bitcoin itself as a currency. There are different kinds of transactions at mobile casinos involving Bitcoin. The first type is that which deals strictly with Bitcoin, where all forms of deposits and withdrawals will be done using this currency and which is only accessible through your bitcoin address. For the second type, the mobile casino has Bitcoin as one of its accepted means of payment and cash-out option; here, you can fund your account with Bitcoin but make withdrawals in other forms of traditional currency. It also does transactions the other way round. The type you choose depends on your needs or preference at that particular point in time.Bitcoin casino gambling enables the existence of provably fair games. What this means is that you can verify the results of a game you play on a mobile casino to be sure you were not cheated. The lack of being able to ascertain the credibility of game results had been an issue with mobile gambling, which is now a thing of the fast, thanks to Bitcoin.Before buying Bitcoin to bet, check the trend of its value so you can make gain while playing. A lot of gamblers neglect this and suffer losses as a result.Now that you have a perfect idea of how Bitcoin works, the next thing is to pick a trustworthy online casino to invest. Don't rush this part so you would lose your precious Bitcoins. Not all mobile casinos are built on honesty, be careful so you can have a safe and fun-filled mobile gambling experience."

March 25, 2020
","Bitcoin's competitor, gold, found itself in a peculiar situation due to the current pandemic: it's getting increasingly difficult for it to move. Fears of stranded bullion led to London spot gold prices dropping far below U.S. gold futures. ","“There’s plenty of gold [...] But it’s immobilized,” Reuters quotes an unnamed banker at a major gold-trading bank as saying. While the U.S. Federal Reserve promised unlimited stimulus Monday, resulting in the jump in gold prices, there's still the issue of lockdown countries, closed refineries, air travel restrictions, shut down airports, and nobody to work on transferring the gold bullion where its needed. What's more, many dealers are worried to even try sending a shipment as it may potentially get stranded, says the Los Angeles Times. And at the same time the Covid-19-related anxieties are leading people to gold as a safe haven, a question is raised if there's enough gold in New York City to deliver against futures contracts traded on the CME Group-operated Commodity Exchange, better known as Comex. As of Monday, open interest in the April gold contract stood at 195,604 contracts, which equals to 19.6 million ounces, while the total deliverable stocks in Comex warehouses were 8.7 million ounces, reports the Los Angeles Times. On the other hand, writes Reuters, the price difference between London (the key storage and home to thousands of tonnes of gold for physical gold trading) spot gold and March futures on the Comex exchange was USD 42 on Tuesday, surpassing even USD 70 at one point, while they normally trade within a few dollars. Today (11:00 UTC), that difference is USD 12. Gold price chart:Bitcoin price chart:Another issue is that Comex accepts 100-ounce bars, while there's not enough people in London to melt their 400-ounce ones to meet that requirement. The above-mentioned banker also stated that the difference between spot prices and U.S. futures will probably remain until refineries reopened and transport resumed, or Comex altered its rules to allow 400-ounce bars to be used to settle its contracts. The London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) and several major banks that trade gold have asked CME to allow these heavier gold bars to be used, in which case the metal wouldn't be altered and would stay in London's vaults, while the ownership would be transferred, reports Reuters, citing two sources involved in the discussions who find this would fix the problem.Meanwhile, bitcoiners are responding to the situation, offering another solution. Dang it! If only there was some kind of trustless, immutable and decentralized ledger that would tell us?!😉It's time for Plan ₿. #BitcoinSome have been thinking that, if there's lack of gold, goldbugs may turn to BTC. ""Availability matters,"" writes user Zender, and in the absence of physical gold, ""investors will see Bitcoin as an interesting alternative for a hard asset because of the 24/7 availability. Also the market will be a global, online one, while the physical market for gold will be very local."" In case of hyperinflation, he argues, physical gold would not be an option for transactions, but there will likely be a digital currency backed by gold. ""I find it hard to believe that this currency will not suffer the same faith and fall into FIAT again,"" he concludes.5) So I'm not saying to run and buy Bitcoin, but just try to understand how it works. Have a look at it as I and many austrians believe it has a great chance to resist capture from the central banks and give to people back their sovereignty.Learn more:

As a result, BTC/USD started a strong increase and broke a couple of important resistances near USD 4,800 and USD 5,000. The price is now up around 10% and trading above the USD 5,200 level. An initial resistance is near the USD 5,450 level, above which the price is likely to test the USD 5,650 level.
If the price fails to continue above the USD 5,450 resistance, it could correct lower. An initial support is near the USD 5,160 level, below which the bears are likely to aim a break below USD 5,000. Ethereum price  followed bitcoin and recovered after tagging the USD 100 support level. ETH/USD is now showing positive signs above USD 115 and it might continue to rise towards the USD 122 and USD 125 resistance levels.

BTC/USD retreated from the USD 6,850 zone and it is currently trading near USD 6,650. If there are more downsides, the price could test the USD 6,550 and USD 6,500 support levels.
On the upside, the bulls need to gain pace above the USD 6,800 and USD 6,850 resistance levels to set the pace for a sustained upward move above USD 7,000 in the near term. Ethereum price  is still stuck in a key range below the USD 140 and USD 142 resistance levels.

","Despite what some may have thought, it appears that the latest sell-off in bitcoin has not scared away retail investors quite yet, new data from one Japanese crypto exchange suggests.","According to a blog post by Yuya Hasegawa, market analyst at the Japanese crypto exchange bitbank, the number of new account registrations on their platform rose by about 40% compared to the 2020 average the week after the major crypto market crash on March 12. And not only did the number of new account openings rise, but the number of email sign-ups also increased as early as the day after the crash, the analyst wrote, suggesting that Japanese investors follow the bitcoin price closely and that they are interested in getting in at the lowest prices possible.According to the analyst, the current situation differs from the price drops that were seen during the end of 2018, when bitcoin experienced a drop of approximately 50% from November to December. That drop was followed by a period of very low volatility in the bitcoin market, which bitbank said was also accompanied by a low inflow of new users on their exchange. This time, however, the exchange is experiencing high demand from new customers, and there are signs of retail investors buying the dip.Trading volume on bitbankOne potential explanation for the difference between 2018-2019 and today, according to the analyst, is the upcoming bitcoin mining rewards halving, which has received a lot of attention this year. The post also noted that Google searches for the term ‘bitcoin halving’ has soared in recent months, suggesting that this is something retail investors are very aware of. However, not everyone agrees that the halving narrative is still important now. Earlier in March, Ryan Selkis, CEO of crypto researcher Messari, argued that the halving narrative ""is completely dead now"": ""The only thing that matters with respect to the halving now is whether it breaks the mining market."" (Learn more: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Sees Historic Drop, Even Larger Might Be Coming)Further, taking the increase in registrations into account, Hasegawa noted that it is reasonable to assume that “the current market recovery is driven largely by retail investors,” and that they are positioning themselves for large moves ahead.“So, there is a good chance that, for this time around, there are many retail investors who want to buy bitcoin or stack up their holdings at the cheapest price possible before [the] halving,” the analyst concluded.Learn more:

As the price plummeted yet lower, the network has seen a surge on its mean block interval from roughly 10 minutes per block to 15 minutes per block before the scheduled network adjustment kicks in.The MRI (miner's rolling inventory) provides valuable insights into how miners perceive the market.
Prior to the market downturn (March 11, 2020), the MRI reflected the fact miners appeared conformable to sell, indicated by a >1 MRI. When the market stabilized, after bitcoin crashed to sub-USD 4,000 at its lowest ebb, the daily MRI dropped significantly to < 1.That indicates a very different view from miners on the condition of the market, and means they are holding back on bitcoin and their inventories are growing (Bytetree, 2020). At the time of writing, the daily MRI is running at around 1 (or 100%).
Miners are still comfortable selling into the market in the longer run, as demonstrated by the 1 week, 5 weeks and 12 weeks MRI ratios.The recent market downturn has caused some miners to switch off their rigs, as indicated by the recent ~16% downward adjustment on network mining difficulty. However, 1-week fees are slowly creeping up to 52-week fee levels, despite the recent market downturn. Rising fees reflect increasing network activity, which could well be a positive indicator for the bitcoin market.The SOPR (Spend Output Profit Ratio) ratio, developed by Renato Shirakashi, is one of the many insightful indicators that help analysts gauge market participants’ sentiment and behavior.This ratio dropped significantly to <1 during the recent market downturn, and backed up to near 1 when the market stabilized.However, the ratio’s upward turn faces some difficulty in its quest to break the >1 mark strongly. This could be an indicator that market participants are waiting to hit the breakeven point before they sell.Theoretical 24-hour attack costs have dropped significantly recently, and currently sit at USD 14 million. This does sound alarming, especially when we can see a large drop in 24-hour attack costs.However, it is practically impossible to perform a 51% attack on the Bitcoin network, as an attacker cannot solicit enough hash power to perform such an attack, due to the following reasons:All of the above is true unless we discover a direct channel, which could let an attacker to control 51% hash rate effectively. The risk of a 51% attack on the Bitcoin network is extremely low and such an operation is extremely difficult to realize."

","The past 3-4 sessions saw a significant drop in bitcoin price from well above USD 8,000 to well below USD 5,000. BTC/USD lost more than 50% and even tested the USD 4,000 area. The price is currently (09:00 UTC) recovering above USD 5,000, but there are many resistances waiting on the upside.","Similarly, most major altcoins nosedived between 30%-50%, including ethereum, XRP, litecoin, bitcoin cash, BNB, EOS, TRX, ADA, and XLM. ETH/USD broke the USD 165, USD 150 and USD 120 support levels. Besides, XRP/USD fell sharply below the USD 0.180 and USD 0.150 support levels before the bulls appeared near USD 0.120.Total market capitalization After a daily close below USD 7,800, bitcoin price  started a strong decline. BTC/USD tumbled more than USD 4,000 and tested the USD 4,000 and USD 3,950 levels. It is currently recovering losses above USD 4,500 and USD 5,000. An initial resistance is near the USD 5,500 level, above which the price may perhaps test the USD 6,200 resistance area.
If the price fails to correct above USD 5,500 or USD 6,200, it is likely to resume its decline. An initial support is near the USD 4,800 level, followed by the USD 4,400 level. Ethereum price  followed bitcoin and declined more than 50%. ETH/USD tumbled below the USD 150 and USD 120 support levels. It even spiked below USD 100 before it found support near USD 90. The price is currently correcting above USD 120 and it might soon test the USD 130 and USD 142 resistance levels.
On the downside, an initial support is near the USD 110 level, below which the price is likely to retest the USD 100 support level in the near term.Bitcoin cash price  nosedived below the USD 250 and USD 240 support levels. BCH/USD even spiked below the USD 150 level and tested USD 130. The price is now recovering and it is trading above the USD 150 level. On the upside, the previous supports near the USD 185 and USD 200 levels are likely to act as hurdles for the bulls.
Litecoin  fell below the USD 40.00 and USD 32.00 support levels. LTC/USD found support near USD 24.00 and USD 25.00. It is back above USD 30.00 and it could rise towards the USD 36.50 and USD 38.00 resistance levels. The main resistance is seen near the USD 40.00 level.
XRP price  settled below the USD 0.200 and USD 0.180 support levels, sparking a nasty decline. The price crashed below USD 0.150 and it even spiked below USD 0.120. It is now correcting higher, but the USD 0.155 and USD 0.162 levels are likely to act as key resistance levels for upside continuation.In the past three sessions, almost all small-capitalization altcoins declined more than 50% and are currently recovering, including AE, MKR, IOST, BSV, NANO, ONT, MATIC, HOT, ZIL, STEEM, BNB, and QTUM.The overall price action is very bearish and the current recovery in bitcoin is likely to face barriers near USD 5,500 and USD 6,000. If the price resumes its decline, the main support is seen near the USD 4,200 and USD 3,800 levels.

March 09, 2020
","As Bitcoin (BTC) mining difficulty and hashrate hit new highs, less efficient miners,  hurt by the virus outbreak, new-generation rigs, and falling BTC prices, may be out of business. ","Bitcoin mining difficulty, a measure that shows how hard it is to compete for mining rewards, has hit yet another record. According to the major Bitcoin mining pool BTC.com, it climbed to 16.55 T today, never being outside the 15 T range before. This was a rise of 6.88%. It follows a 0.38% drop in mining difficulty two weeks ago, which was the first drop this year. That said, it took BTC mining difficulty just half a year to climb from 10 T to 16 T, making validating new blocks harder. BTC.com estimates that during the next difficulty adjustment, expected to happen in two weeks, it will climb 7% to 17.71 T.On the other hand, the price of the world's most popular crypto has been falling. It's currently (10:10 UTC) standing at USD 7,935, having dropped 9% in 24 hours and 9% in a week. Since the last adjustment, on February 25, it has dropped 17%.Meanwhile, corresponding with the rise in mining difficulty, the computational power of the Bitcoin network, known as hashrate, has also gone up. Since the last halving on February 25, the 7-day average hashrate increased by around 9%, to 121 TH/s on March 7, according to blockchain.com data.The hashrate going up suggests that the network is more secure but at the same time it leads to higher mining difficulty, in order to bring block time closer to 10 minutes. There are three major development that may be contributing to this rise in hashrate, and therefore, the difficulty.As discussed previously, the outbreak of coronavirus and the subsequent quarantine by the Chinese authorities have had a massive impact on businesses and workers, including mining equipment makers. Mining hardware giants Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT had issued notices of a delay in the production of the equipment and in its shipment, as well as in upgrading the equipment by miners. Additionally, mining farms, such as that of mining pool BTC.top, had reportedly been shut down.The number of infected people, and unfortunately casualties, from the novel COVID-19 virus across the world has been on the rise lately. However, it seems that the rise in China itself is slowing down. Crypto-mining publication Mining Update has reported that Chinese ASIC manufacturers and maintenance factories have gradually started reopening and returning to full operations. What this means is that Bitcoin miners can now more easily get their new mining equipment, but also fix those that have been malfunctioning. How sustainable this is is completely unpredictable. Should the outbreak subside, the majority if not all manufacturers and maintenance factories will be back up, but the other way around is also possible. This means that the next difficulty adjustment may see quite a different end to its estimated story. The three above-mentioned mining hardware giants have announced their new rigs to hit the markets for BTC miners to update their equipment. With the new rigs, the network will see more hashrate, hence higher difficulty. For miners there's a little option there - not to be overrun, they have to update. Those who can't afford to do so may have to shut down their operations altogether.  However, Miner Update also discusses the Matthew effect, which in the context of miners means that the efficient miners will reap even more benefits, while the future brings nothing good for those less efficient ones. ""Those most efficient miners, operating on the lowest end of the cost curve, increase their advantage while all those miners who are higher on the cost curve observe their returns move closer to the cash-flow breakeven,"" they write. As a matter of fact, the most inefficient will likely be pushed below their cash-flow breakeven figure, which would result in them having to turn their mining rigs off.However, miners who have deployed their newest rigs before the difficulty adjusted to reflect the higher hash rate, which ""makes the initial deployment of new mining rigs an extremely profitable phase.""We've already discussed what the upcoming Bitcoin halving, expected to happen in May, could mean for miners. However, given the previous two points, this halving may be extra hard for the less profitable and unprofitable miners who'll have to shut down their rigs.However, not everyone is worried. As reported, the Greenidge Generation plant in New York’s Finger Lakes region can mine about 5.5 bitcoins per day and it estimates that its crypto mining business will remain profitable even after the Bitcoin mining reward halving this year.""Due to our unique position as a co-generation facility, we are able to make money in down markets so that we’re available to catch the upside of volatile price swings,"" Tim Rainey, Chief Financial Officer at Greenidge,"" said. Also, as recently reported, Bitcoin mining is seemingly being shifted to North America from China, which dominates digital coin mining."

Per CoinDance data, trading volumes at P2P platforms like LocalBitcoins is spiking, with banks foundering, according to Expansion – and the International Monetary Fund refusing to meet the country’s request for an emergency loan.The Board of Directors of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has conditionally approved the deposit insurance application submitted by Square, a payment startup founded by Twitter CEO and prominent Bitcoin supporter Jack Dorsey, related to its Industrial Loan Company (ILC) bank charter, to create a de novo industrial bank, thus enabling it to launch Square Financial Services, says FDIC press release.

","Belarus could join the growing ranks of countries that allow government agencies and police forces to seize and auction cryptoassets, closing legal loopholes that currently bar the seizure of digital coins.","In an interview, Ivan Noskevich, the head of the Belarusian Investigative Committee, told state-run broadcaster Capital TV that his organization had requested that government draw up new criminal procedure legislation that will allow law enforcement agencies to confiscate crypto.Across the border in Russia, the Ministry of Internal Affairs has led efforts to create a similar legislative proposal, which could allow crypto seizures by the end of 2021. If Minsk introduces the legislation, cryptocurrencies confiscated by police and other law enforcers could eventually be put up for auction.For example, in Ireland, independent auctioneer Wilsons Auctions is set to host the country’s first-ever public cryptocurrency auction, with over some USD 125,255 worth of bitcoin (BTC) to be sold on behalf of the Belgian government later this month.Wilsons Auctions said, in a statement,“[The holdings] will be split across lots ranging from BTC 0.25 to 1 while other cryptocurrencies will contain larger number of coins including bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin gold (BTG). The online auction of cryptocurrency will run for 24 hours from UTC 12:00 on March 24, and will begin to time out from UTC 12:00 on March 25.”In the UK, Wilsons Auctions successfully auctioned cryptocurrency worth some USD 392,000 on behalf of the country’s police force last September. The company ran unreserved auctions that marked the first attempt by the UK police to raise funds through the sale of seized crypto.The auctions attracted more than 7,500 bids from countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, Brazil, the UAE and Singapore. Wilsons Auctions said at the time,“The cryptocurrency [holdings] were sold across 62 lots and included bitcoin, ethereum (ETH), XRP and more. Despite one of the most significant market price declines in recent months during the auctions, the crypto assets achieved over the market value. A single bitcoin achieved an average sale price of USD 8,855.”Similar auctions have also taken place in the United States. Last month, the US Marshals Service stated that it was selling more than BTC 4,041 in a sealed bid auction that took place between February 3 and 12, with a required deposit of USD 200,000 per participant.The crypto holdings were seized by the police in a number of federal criminal, civil and administrative cases.

",Could the coronavirus outbreak be the jolt that drives the traditional banking sector and the cryptocurrency sector together?,"In Italy, there are suggestions that this is already the case, with Banca Sella preparing to launch bitcoin trading services for many of its mobile banking customers.The bank’s plans involve using its 1.2 million-user Hype mobile banking platform to allow customers to create a bitcoin (BTC) wallet at the bank, buy and sell BTC, and retain full control over their holdings – without making use of exchanges.Hype’s support center wrote,“The service is currently in beta testing for a small group of Hype Plus [premium] customers. In a few days, it will be available to all customers.” With the nation on lockdown as the virus outbreak rages, bank customers are finding it increasingly hard to send or receive funds from conventional financial providers – a factor that could send many to seek out solutions powered by cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.In its promotional materials, the bank stated that setting up a bitcoin wallet was “totally free,” and only involved “four steps.”However, the bank has placed trading caps on its new services – with tiered daily and annual sales and buying caps.Hype Start (basic account) customers will be able to buy and sell a maximum of USD 2,700 per year, while Plus and Premium account holders’ buying and selling rates are capped at around USD 54,000 a year.Per Mediobanco research from 2016, Sella is Italy’s 20th-largest bank.

","Dogecoin (DOGE), the cryptocurrency originally created as a joke in 2013, has been on a roll this year, gaining more than 70% from the beginning of the year until a peak in mid-February. Since then, however, DOGE has sold off along with the rest of the market, despite several short-lived attempts at rallying higher.","As of pixel time on Tuesday (11:36 UTC), DOGE, ranked as the 33rd most valuable cryptoasset by market capitalization, is up 4.8% over the past 24 hours to a price of USD 0.00223.

And although there is currently some downward pressure on the price, a firm support level can be found around the USD 0.002 area. If this level holds, a reversal up to the upper end of the range at the USD 0.0034 area is possible, which would mark an increase of more than 50% from current prices.As one of the oldest cryptocurrencies in circulation, dogecoin is listed on a large number of crypto exchanges, with the latest addition being ProBit Exchange, which in February listed in against Korean won (KRW). In terms of trading volume, however, the vast majority of trading in DOGE seems to take place on the three exchanges Hcoin, BKEX, and MXC, all relatively unknown exchanges for most traders.The coin first received a fresh wave of attention back in July 2019, when the major crypto exchange Binance said it would list DOGE against both BTC, binance coin (BNB), as well as several stablecoins. Today, however, Binance only accounts for 1.7% of the overall trading volume in DOGE."

","Although the recent crypto market sell-off may have been bad for those who bought at high levels, and may even scare off new potential investors, it certainly isn’t game over for crypto as an asset class, according to Mike Novogratz. He also urged to avoid getting in too early in an asset that is falling.","The ex-investment banker and now CEO & Founder of the digital asset merchant bank Galaxy Digital made the remarks in an interview on Anthony Pompliano’s Pomp Podcast on Monday, where he also said that he believes the sell-off means that crypto adoption will be set back 12 to 18 months.“This probably sets the story, the narrative, of bitcoin as a store of value [...] back 12 to 18 months […] We’re going to have to get through this, and then we’re going to have to rebuild confidence,” Novogratz explained.@pierre_rochard @novogratz Back? Who has lost confidence? Fundamentals didn't change overnight, just a worldwide pa… https://t.co/mg4UWYgRwgFurther, he also said that in hindsight, this situation can be considered “one of the greatest deflationary impulses we’ve ever seen in our lives.” And since both crypto and gold are widely thought of as hedges against inflation, a period of deflation will mean lower prices for those assets. “We might look back and say that this move in gold and bitcoin wasn’t as irrational as it felt,” Novogratz said.However, he then added that the deflation is most likely just temporary, saying “I personally think we’re going to have a brief period of deflation, and you’re stoking the fires for inflation, because I think the economy will come back faster than you think […] and there’s going to be a ton of liquidity.”During the wide-ranging interview, which touched on everything from crypto to the coronavirus and its impact on the broader economy, Novogratz also said that he expects the U.S. government to come up with unprecedented fiscal measures in order to keep the economy going. Among these measures may be “a form of universal basic income for people that need it,” he said while arguing that Hong Kong has already done it.Another lesson Novogratz shared in the interview, and one that he said he often uses himself, is to avoid getting in too early in an asset that is falling, even when prices look cheap.“The biggest mistake that people make is that, when a market breaks, everyone thinks it’s time to get back in way too early. Shit always gets worse than you think it’s going to,” Novogratz said, before adding: “I sometimes make the mistake, but I tell myself ‘hey, when you want to buy something, go on a long walk, then come back a week later and look at it,’ and it’s usually worse off.

Simon Chandler. March 29, 2020. Issuing CBDCs equivalent to 30% of the ...","
March 29, 2020
","There is a general consensus that the global economy is heading for a sharp recession. The economic output will contract, but there are, at least, certain innovations that can be implemented to mitigate the situation.","Central banks have already slashed interest rates and begun quantitative easing in the US, the UK, and the EU. But there's something that could ease (or at least lubricate) the global financial situation even further: central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and cryptocurrencies.According to central banks themselves and to economists, CBDCs can make the monetary system faster and more efficient, while also increasing financial inclusion and reducing the scope for money laundering and tax evasion. At the same time, even though central banks themselves are unlikely to use decentralized cryptocurrencies, these could also play a positive macroeconomic role in the future.Back in 2016, the Bank of England published a working paper in which it detailed the macroeconomic consequences of issuing a CBDC. Most notably, it concluded that issuing CBDCs equivalent to 30% of the UK's GDP ""could permanently raise GDP by as much as 3%, due to reductions in real interest rates, distortionary taxes, and monetary transaction costs.""And this March, the BoE published a new discussion paper, which again highlighted a variety of macroeconomic benefits likely to be delivered by a CBDC. Given such potential advantages, the coronavirus pandemic has come at the 'perfect' time for CDBCs and cryptocurrencies. Cash usage has plummeted by around 50% since the lockdown in the U.K., while contactless card payments have surged in Germany.And it's not only the Bank of England that believes CBDCs would provide a macroeconomic boost. The Swiss Bankers Association also takes the position that CBDCs would be an overall net gain, as explained to Cryptonews.com by its head of public relations, Michaela Reimann.""We concur that CBDC yields economic benefits,"" she says. ""Most notably, (i) CBCD can satisfy the need for an e-money without credit risk, (ii) CBDC can make payments faster, safer, cheaper.""Reimann also points to other advantages, including how CBDCs could ""increase financial inclusion, reduce money laundering/tax evasion.""Such benefits would all help speed up the global economy's efforts to recover from a lockdown-induced recession. That said, the SBA doesn't really think that CBDCs could do much right now to avoid a recession, since the main issue isn't money, but rather the inability of people to work.That said, once things pick up once again, the SBA's position is that CBDCs would help ameliorate one major problem that has been hampering the global economy for some time. ""One of the big problems of the global economy, the archaic cross-border payment system, will experience much improvement,"" Reimann says.In January, the Bank for International Settlements said that around 7 undisclosed central banks, representing 20% of the world’s population, are likely to launch CBDCs in 3 years.Unsurprisingly, such positive views aren't shared by everyone. ""I'm not convinced of the potential benefits of CBDCs as hypothesized by the Bank of England,"" says David Gerard, the author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain, speaking to Cryptonews.com. ""Anything at all 'could' happen.""Still, he does remain open to the possibility that, during the current crisis, CBDCs may enable central banks to issue money more quickly.""In this virus crisis, there's a US proposal to ‘digital dollars’ purely as a way for the government to distribute cash quickly,"" he says. ""So a CBDC could play a role in an emergency, command economy. But it's entirely unclear what benefits they bring in normal times.""One question that remains is, assuming that CBDCs bring macroeconomic benefits, how easy would it be to implement them? ""As you can imagine, there is a myriad of details on the character and the function of CBDC on which agreement [needs] to be found. (Issuing, transaction, access, account/token-based, interest-bearing?, loss possible?),” writes Michael Reimann.She also notes that matters of ""international coordination and technical validity"" would have to be agreed, as well as the ""impact on and interplay with monetary policy.""So yes, even accepting that CBDCs would be a boon, it might be some time before we see them being used widely by the world's central banks. And by that time, the coronavirus pandemic is likely to have ended. We hope.Meanwhile, cryptocurrency supporters are arguing that CBDCs might serve a gateway to Bitcoin (BTC) and other decentralized currencies, that are hard at work increasing adoption and solving scalability issues. Naturally, blockchain and cryptocurrency skeptics such as Gerard, bankers don't think they could bring any real macroeconomic benefit, either now or in the future.""Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have no meaningful economic role,"" he says. ""Cryptos have a real but insignificant payment use case, and the rest is speculation.""""Up until now and given their high price volatility, cryptocurrencies are not suited for payment purposes and neither for accounting purposes,"" Reimann adds. Also, according to Gerard, “cryptos are low-quality money” only used by people to move money past capital controls or making purchases their government doesn't want them to.  However, recent data from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis showed that the darknet still accounts for less than 1% of all BTC transactions.In either case, not every economist or banker takes such views. While German bank Bayern LB is exploring Bitcoin as an alternative monetary system and is teaching its clients about it, Deutsche Bank said in December 2019 that the forces that hold the fiat money system together look fragile and, over the next decade, some of these forces could begin to unravel and demand for alternative currencies, from gold to crypto, could take off.Also, Pete Earle, an economist with the American Institute for Economic Research, believes that cryptocurrencies could be hugely beneficial.""I think that stateless money – by which I mean cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin - could bring tremendous macroeconomic benefits: banking the unbanked, protecting consumer purchasing power against inflation, and so on,"" he says. ""But states tend to be hostile to them because they are essentially uncontrollable by monetary authorities.""On a Defiance podcast last November, Bitcoin educator Andreas Antonopoulos stressed that now we can choose between two different forms of digital cash: __Learn more:

Consumers get tracked and exploited while advertisers follow them around the web with complete disregard for privacy. This partnership with the TAP Network supports our mission of connecting consumers and brands in a respectful, mutually beneficial way, and contributes to the growth of our overall ecosystem by expanding the utility of BAT.”Brave users can redeem their BAT tokens and spend them on TAP Network partner services after verifying their wallets with dedicated Uphold accounts.The network also allows users to make charity donations, contributing to organizations such as the Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity, the World Wildlife Fund and over 1,000 others.Brave says it has 12 million monthly active users, and states that those using its platform can earn BAT by viewing advertising and taking 70% of the revenue share."

","As privacy becomes a new battlefield in the fight against the coronavirus, and new centralized digital fiat initiatives are starting to appear, how have the most popular privacy coins performed after the March 12-13 market crash?","Among the privacy coins that have seen optimistic trading in recent days are monero (XMR), dash (DASH), and zcash (ZEC), which have all outperformed bitcoin (BTC) since the start of the year. For some of them, such as dash, the outperformance is significant, with a rise of more than 60% since the beginning of January. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is still down year-to-date, following the major price crash in March.After the recent sharp gains, dash, known for its privacy feature PrivateSend, has now almost recouped the losses from the March 12 crash, which bitcoin is still working to recover. In terms of technical analysis, the coin is now close to reaching the important 200-day moving average line, which does represent some resistance to the upside in the near-term. In addition, the coin has also received a boost due to demand from Venezuela, where reports claim that it is being used for everyday purchases. An example of this is a move by Burger King Venezuela that has enabled hamburger purchases using dash in the country, as reported earlier this year.Moving over to monero and zcash, the charts of both coins show that these still have a way to go to catch up with the positive sentiment surrounding dash. Both coins are currently in the process of breaking through resistance levels in the chart.Zcash is looking somewhat stronger than monero, having already broken above the lows from the end of 2019, and is now attempting to break above resistance at around USD 32.As of press time on Wednesday (12:13 PM UTC), dash was down 3% over the past 24 hours, trading at USD 67, monero was up 1.5%, trading at USD 46, and zcash was down 3.6%, to a price of USD 31.

","Following an announcement from CME Group yesterday, some might get confused that the major derivatives market would shut down trading in bitcoin (BTC) futures & options, along with trading in other assets. Fortunately, this is not the case.","What CME really said was that their “Chicago trading floor” would close for business as a precaution to prevent the spread of Coronavirus. However, it also added that “all products will continue to trade on CME Globex as they do today.” CME Globex is CME’s electronic trading system where futures and options on all assets offered by the exchange are traded on a daily basis by the majority of market participants.The only thing that is closing, is, in other words, the floor where old-school floor trading takes place. In practice, this only represents a tiny share of the total trading activity nowadays, although it used to be where all trading happened before the digital age. CME is one of just a few exchanges in the world where floor trading is still practiced to some extent.According to CME, the closing will be effective as of this Friday “at the close of business.”The statement from the marketplace also said that no Coronavirus cases have been reported so far on their Chicago trading floor, while adding that a future reopening “will be evaluated as more medical guidance on the coronavirus becomes available.”The news that the CME would close its trading floor was widely reported by news outlets such as CNBC, which noted that the closing makes CME “the first major U.S. exchange to close a trading floor” due to the Coronavirus. It added that the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is also taking some precautionary measures as it works to “separate traders and other employees.”Meanwhile, CME also said on Wednesday that interest in bitcoin futures trading on the exchange has continued to rise in February, as market participants look to “hedge bitcoin price risk” amid “continuing uncertainty in global markets.”“For the first time since the launch of CME Bitcoin futures, monthly average daily volume (ADV) exceeded 10K two months in a row, averaging 10.5K contracts YTD, up 119% YoY. Open interest (OI) reached an all-time high of 6,621 contracts (33.1K equivalent bitcoin) on February 19,” the exchange said, adding that interest in the newly opened bitcoin options market also rose during the month."

But the Red Cross organizations in both countries are taking a very different approach to cryptocurrency donations – with Italian charities raising thousands of dollars’ worth of bitcoin (BTC) and the Spanish Red Cross saying it cannot accept crypto funds.","Last month, Italian startup Helperbit set up a blockchain-powered bitcoin donations platform in conjunction with an agency affiliated with the Italian Red Cross.The donations platform has already met its original target of raising USD 11,000 to “purchase the core infrastructure and medical equipment” for a medical center “for COVID-19 pre-triage,” with any excess funds used to “provide medical staff with the personal protection they need.”The center is now being set up.But after meeting and exceeding their original target, the organizers now say they want to expand the scope of the campaign, and raise a total of BTC 4.1024 (USD 27,389), which they say will and will grant the new facility the capacity to host emergency operations – and fit it with equipment such as a defibrillator and diagnostics monitors.A total of 77 donors have so far contributed BTC 3.2131.However, per a report from Diario Bitcoin, across the sea to the west, the Spanish Red Cross is not even accepting cryptocurrency donations.A spokesperson for the organization has told the media that the Spanish Red Cross is not planning to launch any campaigns to collect donations in cryptocurrencies, and currently only accepts credit and debit card-powered fundraising.The Dutch and American Red Cross also accept crypto donations, and some media outlets believe that regulatory hurdles related to the legal status of crypto in the country may be preventing the Spanish charity from following suit."

",Cryptocurrency enthusiasts and business insiders have reacted with alarm to a recent interview given by the head of the central Bank of Russia’s legal department hinting that cryptocurrencies could be outlawed in the country – leading to a possible block on Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins mining.,"Recent comments made by the central bank legal chief Alexei Guznov could have far-reaching consequences for cryptoassets in Russia. Guznov suggested that the Bank of Russia remains strongly opposed to cryptoassets, sees them as highly risky and would support a ban on their circulation.But per media outlet RBC, multiple experts are calling for calm – and suggesting resourceful miners could stay afloat, with others stating that the central bank’s ban will likely never materialize.RBC quotes Pyotr Lyalin, the deputy director for legal affairs and technology at the Synergy Research Group, as stating that miners could find a workaround, as miners could turn their focus on mining tokens outside Russia.Lyalin stated that Chinese miners – who have also had to deal with government restrictions – have already successfully adopted a similar approach.Another tech expert stated that as the central bank is looking to specifically outlaw the circulation and issuance of cryptocurrencies, miners could find themselves safe whatever the bank decides – with fraudulent crypto outfits the main token of the bank’s ire.The same news outlet also quotes Yuri Brisov, a digital law expert at the Russian Bar Association, as stating that miners need not be concerned as the government will almost certainly stop the central bank from getting its way.He stated,“Any ban on mining and cryptocurrencies would lead to a total decline in the Russian blockchain industry. That’s why developed countries, who understand the risks associated with cryptocurrency-related money laundering and tax evasion, have not banned cryptocurrencies and mining. A ban would mean limiting the country’s potential for economic growth and IT development.”Learn more:

","Bitcoin (BTC), major altcoins reversed losses today after the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) announced unprecedented measures to support the economy. (Updated at 13:47 UTC: updated throughout the entire text)","At pixel time (13:33 UTC), BTC trades at c. USD 6,283, and is up 3% in a day. Earlier on Monday, it was below USD 5,900 before rallying as high as to USD 6,535. Ethereum (ETH) is up less than 1%, to USD 131. Other coins from the top 10 are up around 1%-2% today.The move by the Fed on Monday marks a major shift from earlier asset purchase arrangement such as the much-discussed Quantitative Easing (QE) program, which always had an upper limit associated with it. This time, however, assets will be purchased in an unlimited quantity, and will not stop until the Fed determines that it has achieved its objectives.“We are now in [quantitive easing] infinity, again,” Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said in a note, as reported by CNBC.Most traditional assets, including stocks, precious metals, and oil all traded higher after the Fed pledged asset purchases with no limit to support markets. The stock market, in particular, reacted positively to the news, reversing earlier sharp losses in S&P 500 futures trading, which had once again traded “limit down” overnight.Bitcoin jumped soon after the news was announced:The same was also the case for the broad stock index S&P 500:In addition to the asset purchase plan, the Fed also announced a new lending program worth USD 300 billion for non-financial businesses, although specific details are still scarce. All of the new moves from the Fed comes on top of earlier measures announced last week, including the re-introduction of QE, direct payments to households often referred to as “helicopter money,” and a new credit facility in the money market, which will now be expanded to include a wider range of securities.According to CNBC, the announcement from the Fed represents “the most aggressive market intervention the Fed has made to date,” and is effectively ""an open-ended commitment to the QE program.""The market reaction on the Fed’s announcement comes as crypto market participants were growing increasingly impatient about the correlation between stocks and crypto, with several community members claiming that bitcoin will “decouple” from the stock market.The same sentiment was also shared by Mike Novogratz, CEO & Founder of the digital asset merchant bank Galaxy Digital, who wrote on Twitter that this year “will be and needs to be BTC’s year.”$btc will continue to be volatile over the next few months but the macro backdrop is WHY it was created.

","Over 500,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus have already been diagnosed across the globe, and that figure just keeps rising sharply by the day.","As a result, many governments across the globe have taken drastic measures – such as imposing quarantines and lockdowns, closing borders and shutting down bars and restaurants – all in an attempt to curb the spread of the deadly disease.While these measures are doubtlessly helping to “flatten the curve,” they have left most of us stuck at home.If you are feeling the strain, it is worth remembering that there technological solutions out there that can help you cope with self-isolation and working from home.Check out the list below – and consider looking into some of these if you want to make your new life easier – or help you prepare for the worst!Video conferencing has become the new norm for those who want to keep doing something approximating “business as usual.” If so, Google Hangouts is one obvious option. Alternatively, you could check out Zoom.The California-based communications company provides a user-friendly video conferencing platform for free (provided you only opt for the basic version).So, whether you are having a remote business meeting or just a “virtual pint” with your friends, solutions like Zoom could lend a helping hand.If you are self-isolating at home, chances are you are now online for almost 24 hours a day on your home-based PC or laptop. But all that extra time online means you are now even more vulnerable to virus or malware-related attacks.Using anti-virus and malware detection software, such as programs developed by Avast and Malware Bytes, is probably a good idea at a time like this. And that goes double if remote work has you handling sensitive work-related data on your home computer.The rise in cybercrime over the past few years would suggest that online criminals could choose to strike precisely when network security is at its weakest – with much of the world now operating on home-based systems.If you want to take a break from the new reality and immerse yourself in a video game, a VR headset may come in handy. Headsets, like the popular Oculus Quest, let you play a wide range of VR games that will make you feel like you are actually inside the game!While VR gaming headsets are hardly essential survival gear, they could help you stay entertained while you self-isolate.

If your signal is weak, or your house is big, you should probably consider investing in a Wi-Fi range extender.Alternatively, you could purchase a Wi-Fi mesh network system and place nodes around your home for full Wi-Fi coverage.What happens if the internet goes down? In the unlikely event of a total communications meltdown, we might need to turn back the clock on innovation and revisit a tech advance from yesteryear – the amateur radio set.A ham radio could help you discover vital news on what is happening in your country if web access becomes spotty or disappears altogether. You could also use a set to send out help or emergency messages. Being able to communicate over unallocated radio frequencies could become an essential survival skill in times of emergency.Finally, of course, there is bitcoin (BTC). Should the economic fallout of the pandemic result in a global economic crisis, then there is a real chance that bank bail-ins or even collapses could occur.Governments – such as the Cypriot authorities in 2013 - have resorted to enforced bail-ins on depositors in the past, so it could pay to be wary.For that reason, it would be smart to ensure you retain some bitcoin or altcoin funds that you could fall back on if your bank does buckle under pressure."

Central Banks are excited by Bitcoin's dramatic innovation, its blockchain technology and the potential for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC). However, they are also cautious as Bitcoin has a reputation as the badlands of financial services, used by drug dealers and money launderers, not upright citizens and certainly not central bankers.So after the Bitcoin innovation what have been the catalysts for Central Banks to act? One word. Libra. Facebook’s Libra caused Central Banks to panic around the world by announcing it would launch its own digital currency. Libra could become the global default crypto with two billion people having instant access to it just by having a Facebook account. Governments around the world threw their arms up in horror. France and India immediately banned it. Libra doubled governments’ efforts to respond to protect their interests. China reacted to the Libra launch quickly.“Libra has introduced a concept that will impact the traditional cross-border business and payment system,” said former People’s Bank of China (PBoC) Governor Zhou Xiaochuan.China saw Libra as an American Imperial economic invasion and responded by fast-tracking its own digital currency known as digital currency electronic payment (DCEP) system. In the early days of digital currencies, the PBoC did not outlaw assets such as Bitcoin, but rampant speculation and wild price swings led China to implement a blanket ban on trading and new initial offerings of digital currencies. PBoC created a dedicated institute to explore a CBDC. China is well suited to a CBDC as most payments are now digital through apps operated by Alipay or Tencent.The prize to get a functioning CBDC in a nation's economy is huge. The Bank of England’s own research suggests a 3% bump to GDP if you run a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), roughly the same boost to the economy as a big tax cut. The Bank of England’s recent whitepaper states there are plenty of benefits of CBDCs around interest rates, stimulus, and accountability. This is highly compelling.Just like the Portuguese Escudo, Dutch Gulder, English Pound and U.S. dollar became global reserve currencies in their time, in paper terms, it’s now the turn of a digital currency to take the crown. This is the reason CBDCs are a hot topic. Whoever wins, wins big therefore justifying their Central Bank’s move to launch these currencies. While the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was up in front of Congress explaining himself and being blocked, the Chinese were quietly rifling through the whitepaper and making plans. This tension between America and China has resulted in a classic superpower slugging match with CBDCs.Where is the rest of the world? In fact, some of the world’s major central banks are already teaming up to assess potentially developing their own digital currencies. A group has been formed in order to “share experience as they assess the potential cases for central bank digital currency in their home jurisdiction'”. The body will be made up of the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank (ECB), the Riksbank, and the Swiss National Bank, along with the Bank for International Settlements. Noticeably absent from the group is the People’s Bank of China and yes you guessed it … America. The body forming is a great move. The reality is the group will move even slower than PBoC and Libra and these Central Banks may get left behind, and lose first-mover advantage.The U.S.’s Federal Reserve has so far largely distanced itself from the concept of a CBDC. In December, Treasury Secretary Steven Munchin said he and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell see ‘no need’ for the U.S. to create a digital currency in the near future. Yet Powell has said the Fed is monitoring the activities of other central banks to identify potential benefits. There is further skepticism from Canada and the Netherlands “The essence of the [distributed ledger technology] infrastructure is that no single party should be trusted enough, but don’t we just trust a central bank to maintain the integrity of the global ledger?” said Harro Boven, policy advisor in the payments policy department of the Dutch central bank. Satoshi Nakamoto, the legendary mysterious inventor of Bitcoin would say not.In England, the debate around CBDCs intensified last year when the outgoing Bank of England Governor Mark Carney laid out a radical proposal for an overhaul of the global financial system that would eventually replace the dollar as a reserve with a Libra like CBDC currency. Carney felt fully justified to explore the possibilities. In Europe, the ECB policymakers have already discussed the idea of issuing their own CBDC. Christine Lagarde, the ECB’s head, has long argued that central banks should consider the merits, which she believes include public goals such as financial inclusion, consumer protection, and payment privacy. In Sweden, they are moving quickly to adopt a CBDC Sveriges Riksbank, the central bank of Sweden, which recently announced a pilot for a digital krona, or e-krona and the main reason is “to be ready for a cashless future”.But where does this leave Bitcoin and other non-CBDC cryptocurrencies in relation to several functioning CBDCs? Firstly, it’s a great endorsement for all of crypto, rubber stamping their benefits, although the paradox is that this endorses decentralization and control away from Central banks. Secondly, fully functioning CBDCs are a tide that will lift all crypto boats, many skeptics will get off the fence and invest time and money into crypto. CBDCs will create a new boom for Decentralised Finance (DeFi) services as these new CBDCs are digital and will interoperate with DeFi services, greatly increasing volumes. Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies are decentralized and not owned by a central organization and therefore inherently more trustworthy. Bitcoin was a response to the 2008 banking crisis and no casino bankers operate in Bitcoin. But the ultimate question is - who would you trust, incorruptible decentralized currencies like Bitcoin, or centrally controlled and potentially co-opted Central Bank Digital Currencies?"

","It wouldn't be logical to expect the market sentiment to have gone up given the week crypto market has had. Per crypto market sentiment analysis service Omenics, following the market crash on February 13, the combined moving average 7-day market sentiment measure, sentscore, for the top 10 coins by market capitalization has dropped this week from last Monday's 5.08 to 4.21/10 - the lowest it's been since September 30, 2019, when a similar drop had occurred. ","Even without the market crash, a the current redness of the coins was predicted by the poor 24-hour performance last Monday. The coins are not only entirely in red, and not only is none of them in the positive zone any longer, but none have a sentscore above 4.5 and two are in the negative zone: XRP and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) has got just 4.3 this time, a much lower grade than we're used to seeing.To put this into perspective, let's just remember that on February 17, we reported the highest recorded sentscore since starting this series: 6.23/10, with six coins in the positive zone. That's not all the bad news: the combined average market sentiment for the top 10 coins in the last 24 hours has dropped into the negative zone, now standing at 3.96, with four individual coins in the negative tone as well.Sentiment change among the top 10 coins in the past week*:
Interpreting the sentscore’s scale:
- 0 to 2.5: very negative
- 2 to 3.9: somewhat negative zone
- 4 to 5.9: neutral zone
- 6 to 7.49: somewhat positive zone
- 7.5 to 10: very positiveThe winners on the all-red list are those who've dropped the least: below a drop of 10%, we find Tether (USDT), EOS (EOS), and Binance Coin (BNB), respectively. Tether's highest scores are 5.6 in news and 5.1 in technicals, while it has a somewhat lower 4.8 score in buzz and 4.6 in social, but also a negative score of 3.4 in fundamentals. Meanwhile, though EOS has a positive score of 6.3 in news and neutral 4 in social, it's also got three negative scores, making its lowest scores 3.4 in buzz, 3 in fundamentals, and 2.4 in technicals. BNB's highest scores are in news and fundamentals (5.7 and 5.4, respectively), while it's lowest are in social, buzz, and technicals (4, 3.6, and 2.5, respectively). Daily Bitcoin sentscore change in the past month:The losers are aplenty. Still, the two that have dropped the most - above 20% - are the world's first two coins: Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH). Furthermore, Chainlink (LINK), which spent two weeks in the 10th place, has been pushed out by Stellar. Unlike many other coins, BTC's strongest sentscore is in fundamentals, with 8.5/10. But the rest of its scores are way down, in an untypical poor performance by this coin. It has the neutral 4.7 in buzz, but also three negative scores: 3.3 in social, 2.5 in news, and 2.4 in technicals. The world's second in command, ETH, also records poor scores: 5.3 in fundamental as its highest score, followed by 3.9 in social, 3.4 in news, 3.2 in buzz, and 3.1 in technicals. Lastly, now on the 13th spot, LINK has got 5.9 in buzz, as well as 4.5 in social and 4.1 in technicals, but also 3.9 in fundamentals and 3 in news.Outside the top 10 list, observing the other 29 coins on Omenic's list in the last seven days, the situation is not better. Only one coin, Nano (NANO), has the sentscore of 5. For the rest, the highest score is 4.7 and the lowest 2.9. * - Methodology:Omenics measures the market sentiment by calculating the sentscore, which aggregates the sentiment from news, social media, technical analysis, viral trends, and coin fundamentals-based upon their proprietary algorithms.

","In the midst of rising business shutdowns and unemployment rates in the U.S., which may lead to a nationwide, as well as a global recession, U.S. politicians voiced an idea of a ""digital dollar"".   (Updated at 16:48 UTC: updates in bold). ","As a response to the growing concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic and its massive economic impact, the U.S. Democratic party shared two lengthy draft bills titled the “Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act” (TRFWAF) and the “Financial Protections and Assistance for America’s Consumers, States, Businesses, and Vulnerable Populations Act,” both dated March 22, 2020. The latter was introduced by Congresswoman Maxine Waters, a well-known oponent of Facebook's Libra. Both documents had the term ""digital dollar"" included, defined in a similar manner.However, on Tuesday, reports appeared that the ""digital dollar"" has been removed from the latest version of the ""Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act,"" revealed late Monday. Update: we are hearing that a new version of the draft bill drops the “digital dollar” language https://t.co/B7jav9WMFyIn the latest 1,404-page draft, U.S. residents would receive USD 1,500 per person, though individuals with an income greater than USD 75,000 and couples with an income greater than USD 150,000 would have to repay the funds, Coindesk reported, citing the most recent draft. The ""digital dollar"" is expected to be removed from the ""Financial Protections and Assistance for America’s Consumers, States, Businesses, and Vulnerable Populations Act"" also.However, another draft bill posted today to the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs also defines a ""digital dollar"" and details how it might be maintained, Coindesk added.
Senator Sherrod Brown is proposing that the digital dollar would be ""dollar balances consisting of digital ledger entries recorded as liabilities in the accounts of any Federal Reserve bank."" The digital dollar and its wallet would be operated and maintained by the Federal Reserve.However, another draft bill posted today to the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs also defines a ""digital dollar"" and details how it might be maintained, Coindesk added.Senator Sherrod Brown is proposing that the digital dollar would be ""dollar balances consisting of digital ledger entries recorded as liabilities in the accounts of any Federal Reserve bank."" The digital dollar and its wallet would be operated and maintained by the Federal Reserve.Meanwhile, according to the earlier version of the TRFWAF Act, this new virtual USD had to be used for providing stimulus payments. As to what the Democrats defined by the phrase ""digital dollar"" was: By ""digital dollar wallet"" they meant ""a digital wallet or account, maintained by a Federal reserve bank on behalf of any person, that represents holdings in an electronic device or service that is used to store digital dollars that may be tied to a digital or physical identity.""There was also a proposal to make a ""pass-through digital dollar wallet,"" which is a digital wallet also maintained by a member bank of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for a user, where ""such qualified individual"" is entitled to a proportional share of a pooled reserve balance maintained by that member bank at any Federal reserve bank. These wallets would not be subject to any account fees and minimum or maximum balances, but would pay interest; they can't be closed by the bank due to profitability considerations; banks would provide ""reasonable protection"" against losses due to fraud or security breaches, etc. Furthermore, the member banks would be required to establish and maintain a separate legal entity to exclusively hold all assets and maintain ""all liabilities associated with pass-through digital dollar wallets.""As for who these ""qualified individuals"" are that would make use of the new dollar and wallets, the previous version of the draft said it's all but ""any nonresident alien individual"" - U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents, as well as businesses based in the U.S. These qualified individuals would then get monthly emergency payments in the digital dollar, made by the Secretary of Treasury, acting through the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service. The amounts would be:""Member banks with total consolidated assets in excess of [USD] 10,000,000,000 shall promptly offer individuals the ability to apply, through online or telephonic means, for a pass-through digital dollar wallets,"" the earlier draft proposed.As to when all those who qualify may get their digital wallet if the bill passes, the draft bill said ""[n]ot later than January 1, 2021.""Meanwhile, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, proposed giving to every person in America a U.S. Debit Card pre-loaded with USD 2,000 and recharged with USD 1,000 monthly until one year after the end of the Coronavirus crisis.Both those within and outside the community are reacting to this proposal. Many seem that not many have faith in it, while others find it could bring major changes into the world as we know it.Hart Lambur, co-founder of decentralized financial contracts platform UMA, argues that, if the bill some call ""the Pelosi bill"" after the speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi of California, is seriously thinking about creating a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in order to deliver direct stimulus to Americans, it ""would be a game-changer."" But as time constraints are worrisome, he adds, ""But there’s no way this can happen on the timeline needed, unless they use Libra... right? (That’s a joke, mostly).""Daniel Aranda from Ripple's developer initiative Xpring commented that the bill makes no mention of a decentralized ledger. Aranda finds that there's no benefit to it as the issuer is centralized, but also that ""Dollars, in this light, are already ""digital"".Separate consideration but also interesting: potential for the digital wallet to cut out commercial banks from consumer relationship and just let end users hold Fed USD directly - fiat equivalent of a non-custodial wallet.

_","As both traditional and alternative asset markets descend into turmoil this month, it’s important to remember the inherent strengths of a diversified portfolio. A market rout always causes correlation to go to 1 across virtually all assets as investors flee to the perceived safety of cash. This can give rise to unfounded narratives based on extremely narrow datasets as investors panic and question sound investment principles. The market always comes back.These short-term correlations are not as important to portfolio structure as studying the way an asset reacts across a range of economic environments. For that reason, we’ve isolated our research on each market period. First, we explore the nature of historical correlations between cryptocurrencies and traditional assets, preceding the recent panic. Later on, we will dissect bitcoin’s behavior during the recent flight to safety.To begin at the beginning, adding low correlation assets to any portfolio will improve its risk profile. While the portfolio’s expected return will change commensurately, we evaluate portfolio performance on a risk-adjusted basis, and so we can produce any desired expected return from a portfolio of sufficient Sharpe ratio by merely adding in some leverage.Portfolio Expected Volatility Decreases as 0% Correlation Assets are AddedNote the mechanism by which diversification reduces risk - even if you had assets all with the same expected volatility, low correlation means that as one asset swings into a downturn, the other has no reason to follow it down, and so returns are smoothed out.Cumulative Returns of Concentrated and Diversified Portfolios, 2000-2019The above chart gives a sense of how diversification has performed through time, allowing for the fact that 2000-2019 is a peculiar and short time scale over which to observe gains.Equipped as we are now with some knowledge of the theory and recent market history, we can start to benchmark just how accretive a BTC investment into a traditional diversified portfolio might be. Bitcoin since 2016 has had low correlations to other assets. Moreover, this pattern has persisted in a random, unsystematic fashion.Correlation of Total Returns of Selected Assets Since 2016A particular comparison between the correlations of BTC and gold is instructive. In the above table, gold features some astounding correlations: -47% against the US dollar, -64% against emerging markets equities.On second notice, however, these correlations emerge almost as accounting identities - gold and the dollar cannot both go up at the same time, except in extreme circumstances, as they trade against one another (investors sell dollars to buy gold, or sell gold to buy dollars, which is not what happens when investors move from US bonds to US equities - there they are holding dollars all the time). Likewise for EM currencies, which are the main drivers of volatility in EM equity holdings.BTC, by contrast, has achieved nearly zero correlation with the US dollar and with US equities, EM equities, and the oil markets. One fact this pattern suggests is that the sources and uses of capital in the BTC markets are not the same as in traditional markets - else BTC could not have the same level of correlation against so many different assets.Having established a sense for how correlated BTC is against other assets, we next take a look at how different portfolios would have done over the same period with a tilt towards Bitcoin. Following the lead of the chart above, we examine a long-only S&P 500 portfolio, a US-based 60/40 portfolio, and a diversified portfolio.As you see above, given the incredible bull market for equities, it’s no surprise that being long-only US equities has outperformed other strategies. But this is merely evaluating on a returns basis - all of that outperformance comes from S&P vol being higher than the volatility of either the 60/40 or the Diversified portfolio.On a risk-adjusted basis, the more diversified portfolios are more efficient, so we ought to see higher returns at equity-level volatility for each of them. We can model this by levering up the holdings in the other two portfolios. Once done, the benefits of diversification are plain to see:Now we want to conduct the same analysis, but for a tilt towards BTC. Again, some priors: the performance of Bitcoin as an asset class in the past decade is like nothing before seen in financial markets.Performance like that gives it an annualized return of 113% and an annualized volatility of 85% since 2016. Traditional assets achieve performances of that magnitude usually only via bankruptcies, in which case the signs on an investor’s return are unhappily reversed.These dramatic characteristics, however, may be moderated through prudent weighting within a portfolio: a portfolio of 95% cash and 5% BTC, for example would have had since 2016 an annualized volatility of 4.25% and annualized return of 5.6%, while retaining its low correlation to other assets. If we adopt this approach towards risk-weighting and add a BTC slice of that size to the portfolios we examined above, we observe the following:The upshot: a small addition of BTC to each portfolio dramatically improved its efficiency, raising risk-adjusted returns in every strategy while raising volatility only moderately.For a final illustration, we examine the cumulative performance over time of each strategy with its tilt, scaled to native equity volatility.Not bad for a free lunch!The outbreak of truly concerning movements in the financial markets, with consecutive circuit breakers in the equities markets, multi-trillion dollar stimuli across the globe, 40% plunge in the price of BTC and stocks has hurled us into an entirely new dynamic. While short-term insights can be gleaned from emerging data, the importance of these insights can be difficult to ascertain until the turmoil has played out. Therefore we’ve chosen to insulate our long-term historical insights from the last two weeks of data, and instead parse that recent volatility separately.With that said, it’s worth taking another look at what’s happened recently in order to (1) shore up some of the theoretical predictions made earlier and (2) reassess what benefit a diversified portfolio is in a real honest-to-God crisis.The reader is likely familiar with the following financial facts, but they are worth a quick revisit:The impact of the novel coronavirus on the global economy has rapidly brought an end to the longest bull market in history, and for good reason: already activity is slowing to a crawl across the developed world, while the emerging economies which power so much of our growth are either shaking themselves back to life, like China, or yet to feel the full brunt of the disease, like India or the Latin American economies.But if this were only a growth shock, you might expect stocks and growth-sensitive commodities like oil to underperform, while assets which don’t have as great a sensitivity to growth to muddle through without large price declines.These varying responses to different economic environments are the basis of correlations between assets. In some sense, BTC and stocks must have different responses to changes in economic environments, else we wouldn’t observe the volatile (yet, on average, negative!) correlation between them that we do.In this period, however, we haven’t seen that; to the contrary, all assets have nosedived in tandem with stocks.One way to see that, aside from looking at cumulative returns plunging in unison, is to measure correlations. Indeed, previously volatile correlations have made way for a harmonizing towards unity, as correlations between all assets approach 1.0.What lessons can we take from correlation behaviors in a crisis? In the first place, the common competition between assets and cash is an undiversifiable risk - when all hell breaks loose, nothing looks as good as holding your principal steady (before March 14th, you could still get 1.25% on it!).No passive holding would do well, so there isn’t any cleverer allocation a portfolio could hold to protect itself from something like this. Environments like these are instead the province of active management, but that’s another story.In the second place, the lack of diversification in a crisis doesn’t invalidate the benefits of diversification outside of crises. Crises are still rare, and even seemingly dire events in the global economy don’t usually rise to the level of triggering asset-wide selloffs. Instead, normal reactions take place: if, say, another oil shock were to emerge (itself less likely given changes in the distribution of the supply of oil and the level of demand of oil, but, again, another story), you might see violent moves in inflation-linked bonds, nominal bonds, commodity-producer currencies, commodity-importer currencies, factor-exposed equities, non-factor-exposed equities, gold, and certainly oil, but those moves would differ. And in an environment like that, diversification would be precisely the cure to a concentrated portfolio’s ills.Bitcoin is too young to tell us precisely what it’ll do in certain cases - for instance, the world hasn’t seen high inflation since 1981. The pattern of Bitcoin’s returns thus far, however, should make any portfolio manager pause to consider the truly diversified source of risk it provides in a well-constructed portfolio."

LTC's strongest aspects are news with a sentscore of 7 and social with 5.5, while it has 4.2 in fundamentals, and its lowest scores are 3.7 in technicals and 3.4 in buzz.In the last seven days, outside the top 10 list, majority of coins are above the sentscore of 4 or 5, while there are no coins in the positive zone and three are in the negative zone, these being: Komodo (KMD), and IOTA (MIOTA), Holo (HOT), in that order.

","Bakkt has closed a Series B fundraising round, raising USD 300 million, with participation from investors, including some major names, such as Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), Microsoft’s M12, PayU, Boston Consulting Group, Goldfinch Partners, CMT Digital, and Pantera Capital, according to a blog post by Mike Blandina, the CEO of this the U.S.-based, ICE-backed platform.""With the completion of our Series B financing and the recent acquisition of [loyalty services provider] Bridge2 Solutions,"" writes Blandina, ""Bakkt is now a team of 350 employees and powers the loyalty redemption programs for 7 of the top 10 financial institutions and over 4,500 loyalty and incentive programs including two of the largest U.S. airlines."" As reported, ICE agreed to acquire Bridge2 Solutions, and the strategic combination will accelerate the development of the Bakkt consumer application, which will provide digital asset aggregation, conversion, and payments through a single platform for consumers around the world, the company had said.Finally, Blandina announced today that Bakkt's website has been updated with more information regarding this app. The site states that all crypto, digital assets, in-game assets, and rewards are converted into cash via Bakkt's digital wallet.

","While much of the South Korean crypto community is still celebrating the introduction of the country’s first-ever piece of crypto-specific legislation, others are warning that the overwhelming majority of crypto exchanges will likely go under once the new laws’ banking stipulations come into effect.","Per news agency Yonhap, there are currently some 200 crypto exchanges in the country, most of which are small or medium-sized enterprises. That number could be whittled down to just 10 by this time next year.Under the terms of the new legislation – an amendment on an existing financial transactions act – exchanges will soon have to adhere to strict banking regulations. These regulations already exist in the form of guidelines that require all customers to use individual, real-name, exchange-linked bank accounts that are guaranteed by social security numbers.As previously reported on Cryptonews.com, the country’s “big four” exchanges (Upbit, Bithumb, Korbit and Coinone) are currently the only platforms in the country that adhere to these regulations, which were introduced as non-compulsory guidelines in early 2018.Setting up a system like this is extremely time-consuming, with banks often stepping up their compliance rules on a monthly basis. At present, exchanges can only sign deals with banks on a six-month basis, and the process for renewing such deals can be fraught and costly – even for well-backed platforms like Upbit and Bithumb.Yonhap reports that as non-compliant exchanges and their executives could be hit with fines of up to USD 41,000 or jail terms of up to five years, many exchanges “will not be able to operate in the future.”The news agency states that banks are also concerned that they might become “overburdened” by dealing with exchange clients – and thus may seek to turn them away.And it appears that both crypto and banking industry insiders are in agreement that “exchange closures are inevitable.”An unnamed crypto industry insider, says Yonhap, stated that “only about 10 exchanges, including [the big four], will be able to set up real-name accounts ahead of the enforcement of the new amendment in March 2021.”"

","While the current Covid-19 pandemic is already hurting the global economy, it's actually beneficial for stablecoins, and it's proving that they work, claims the CEO of crypto financial services firm Circle, Jeremy Allaire. Not all stablecoins have had a reason to celebrate though.","With the rise in the market demand, came the rise in market capitalization of several stablecoins, including USD coin (USDC), a stablecoin which is pegged to the USD and is managed by Circle and crypto exchange Coinbase. Allaire announced that the coin reached a new all-time high of USD 568 million in circulation over the past few days, believing that it's the result of people's behavior during the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak. It's ""[f]ascinating to see ""flight to safety"" within the crypto macro market,"" writes Allaire, ""but also demand for high-quality USD liquidity for markets.""Meanwhile, earlier in March, the most popular stablecoin, tether (USDT), surpassed USD 5 billion in market capitalization, compared with USD 2 billion in February. It even flipped XRP, the third-largest coin by market capitalization, this past weekend temporary, before going back below the USD 5 billion level on Monday. The market crashed on Friday, March 13, with bitcoin (BTC) plunging into the USD 4,000 level, before going above USD 5,000, where it has traded for a couple of days. Now (9:43 UTC), we find it at USD 4.915, having fallen 7% in a day and 38% in a week. Allaire commented that while it's ""not as exciting to see markets so crushed, it's still rewarding to see that this entirely new, entirely digital, blockchain-based monetary infrastructure is working.”Meanwhile, just six days ago, three days before the crash, Circle has released a new set of services meant to help widen the use of digital currency in everyday payments and commerce. They've expanded the rollout of Business Accounts for USDC and have introduced a set of developer-oriented platform services dubbed Circle APIs.  Other major stablecoins - namely, USDT, paxos standard token (PAX), true USD (TUSD), and binance USD (BUSD), respectively - had also experienced a change in these past three days. But not all were positive changes. In the order of highest to the lowest, the coins experienced the following changes in their market capitalizations:Whether this market demand will continue for specific stablecoins, or stablecoins in general, is difficult to predict. Nonetheless, Allaire is optimistic. ""Demand for internet dollars — digital, fast, global, secure, cheap to use — should increase significantly,"" he writes, and explains that both regular people and businesses ""will want an architecture where they can make and receive payments with less counter-party risk and more security.""4/ A broader macro theme that will like emerge post-pandemic is the need for businesses to rely more fully on trust-minimized, decentralized infrastructure. Programmable dollars, smart contracts, public chains == smarter companies.Meanwhile, Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder and CEO at crypto exchange Gemini, commented that all assets, gold included, in the short term, will be affected by a sudden and negative demand shock in the global economy. ""Bitcoin is not a hedge to pandemics,"" argues Winklevoss, ""it is a hedge to fiat regimes."" The world will get through this, but at what long-term, Faustian bargain? Bitcoin is not making any deals right now. It has the resilience and endurance to last in the infinite game."

","Sooner or later, you may be blocked out of your bank account. It can happen to any of us, and it can even happen with supposedly crypto-friendly “banks,” such as Bitwala, Revolut, and more.","The question is: what should you do if such a company freezes or blocks your account? Well, according to lawyers, there isn't any legal 'magic bullet' you can use that will successfully get your account reopened.Still, at the very least, you can seek to contact and cooperate with your company as fully as possible, assuming that they've frozen your account in order to carry out KYC (know your customer) or AML (anti-money laundering) checks. And in a worst-case scenario, you can always contact the financial regulator of the country where you and the bank are located.Complaints from people being locked out of their bank accounts are surprisingly common. Basically, if you tend to dabble in cryptocurrency trading or crypto-related business, and if you use a bank that accepts your custom as a 'crypto person,' you seem to be at greater risk of having your account blocked or frozen.For example, the Berlin-based crypto startup Bitwala that provides German bank (solarisBank) accounts, is also being criticized for account-blocking on Reddit. Here's Reddit user ""pibyk"" writing on the Bitwala sub-Reddit a couple of months ago:""I consider myself to be sort of lucky as my account got blocked for no valid reason before I put anything in it. So there is nothing to recover and no hassle to get the money back. The message I got was meaningless, and their customer service failed to respond in any reasonable time. As far as I am concerned this action constitutes a serious breach of trust, so I am no longer interested in such an unreliable service.""This kind of problem isn't exclusive to Bitwala. Another reportedly 'crypto-friendly' bank – the UK-based Revolut – has also received a number of Reddit complaints, including this one: ""All my money is locked in my revolut account, I can’t even buy a bottle of water because i got no cash on me and these jerks are ignoring me for no reason. Please help me get in touch with them, I’m desperate.""In other words, the problem is a general one, and similar complaints can be found for Wirex, Barclays, ING, Fidor, and Simple Bank, among others.Legally, what can a customer do if their account is frozen by their bank? In terms of taking specific legal actions, the disappointing answer to this question is: nothing.""Clearly, any answer is case specific and depends on where the bank and customer are based,"" says James Kaufmann, a lawyer specialized in blockchain and cryptocurrency at Howard Kennedy. ""But in a general context, as I see it, if a bank blocks an account because it feels it is appropriate to carry out further AML/KYC checks (and bear in mind that source of funds and wealth are things that need to be considered here), there is little that a customer can achieve effectively and reasonably by resorting to legal action to force the bank to release those funds.""Still, Kaufmann advises that customers take the practical step of contacting their bank wherever possible and of cooperating with them to get the account back online.""In my experience, the better course of action is to find a friendly and engaged contact at the relevant bank and seek to work with them to help them conclude their process as soon as possible,"" he tells Cryptonews.com. ""This is usually the quickest, cheapest and most effective strategy. Legal action will be time-consuming, costly, labor intensive and there is limited likelihood of success unless the bank is wilfully refusing to release funds or not following a reasonable and appropriate procedure."" But yes, assuming that the bank is wilfully refusing to release funds and has no legal grounds for doing so, then legal action may very well be viable. Felix Shipkevich is a lawyer with Shipkevich in New York, and he tells Cryptonews.com that contacting the regulator is your best bet. ""If the cryptocurrency exchange is regulated, customers who are unable to withdraw their funds should immediately contact the regulator where their account is papered,"" he says.Given that banks are also regulated, much the same applies if your bank is preventing you from withdrawing your money. But Shipkevich adds, if the company is not regulated, “then contacting law enforcement authorities should be the next best action. Unfortunately, civil legal actions may not be successful, particularly if prosecuting and enforcing judgments are likely to be challenging.""It almost goes without saying, but it's never a good idea to deal with an unregulated bank, so it's unlikely that most people will ever find themselves in such a situation. Still, contacting the relevant financial regulator and asking for advice, in cases where your bank is being consistently unhelpful, is usually a good idea.And in the end, even if you end up having your account unfrozen, it also might be a good idea to switch banks. Assuming that you can find one with a better reputation for treating customers who deal with cryptocurrency more fairly. In the meantime, let’s hope that hyperbitcoinization will arrive sooner than expected, removing all middlemen who can control your money."

",Central and Eastern Europe-focused cryptocurrency exchange BitBay says that bitcoin (BTC) trading volumes have hit record levels in the past two weeks.,"In the past fortnight, the platform’s volume of the BTC-Polish złoty (PLN) pair hit a peak of BTC 11,233 (USD 75 million) in 24 hours on March 13, a new record level for BitBay. Bitcoin-euro volumes also hit record levels of BTC 223 on March 18.And the platform says that its record-breaking performance was also made possible by the company’s rapid shift to remote working solutions as the coronavirus continues to disrupt businesses across the nation.“We have observed a significantly higher number of user registrations in recent days,” Sylwester Suszek, CEO of BitBay, told Cryptonews.com, declining to specify.On March 25, BitBay’s 24-hour volume was around USD 40 million, per Coinpaprika data. Trading volume on BitBay:The exchange was established in Poland, which was its first market before expanding to the wider Central and Eastern European area. BitBay moved its headquarters to Malta in 2018.Suszek says that BitBay has been able to accommodate increased interest from traders owing to its organizational elasticity, and says that it made a quick switch to remote work in a bid to protect the health of its staff.He stated,“Since the first coronavirus infections began, we foresaw the possibility that quarantine measures could be introduced.”As news of the pandemic’s spread broke, BitBay says it shifted its team into remote work mode: “We have introduced a number of improvements to our internal processes, and we also carried out additional training for our employees to reach higher [operational] elasticity.”Also, on March 17, BitBay donated around USD 23,535 to the Provincial Specialist Hospital Megrez in Tychy, Southern Poland – a medical facility that specializes in treating infectious diseases. The hospital will use the funds to finance the purchases of medical equipment and sanitary supplies.The CEO added that the exchange also began running an online fundraiser last week.“The money from this initiative will be used to buy medical equipment that is necessary to treat those who are infected with the coronavirus, and also to buy sanitary supplies for doctors and medical personnel,” he said.The initiative has so far raised around USD 15,149."

Furthermore, the fund is accessible only to professional investors, says Bitfinex, and its goal for the current year is to increase the size of its assets under management. Fulgur Alpha's assets are held at Delchain Limited, a licensed provider of custody, banking, capital markets and initial offering advisory solutions for digital assets, while its regulatory aspects are under the supervision of a Bahamas-based fund administrator and division of Deltec International Group, called Deltec Fund Services.""A key aspect of this listing is that the fund will trade almost solely on Bitfinex,"" Paolo Ardoino, Chief Technology Officer at Bitfinex, said, claiming that ""[Bitfinex] has most liquidity books.""Meanwhile, per the Eurekahedge Crypto-Currency Hedge Fund Index, crypto hedge funds saw -1.31% return in February, compared to +19.38% in January, but also 8.95% return in the last 3 months. Their historical monthly performance table, from 2013 onward, shows that the January increase was the largest since May 2019, while the February drop is the smallest yet recorded by Eurekahedge, a hedge fund database provider.Speaking of hedge funds, as reported in late February, New York-based hedge fund Fortress Investment Group upped its offer to USD 1,300 per bitcoin as it looks to buy up creditor claims from Mt.

March 27, 2020
","Binance just released their new product, the Binance Card, meant to make it easier for people to use crypto every day, that way assisting crypto adoption. Meanwhile, another major crypto exchange, Coinbase, passed this milestone a year ago. ","Binance unveiled the Beta version of its Binance card, a Visa debit card, on March 26, which is supposed to do away with the inconvenient methods for buying stuff with crypto that people had to use so far. CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) said that payments is an obvious use case for crypto, but that adoption is slow, as only 0.1% of people have crypto, which gives no incentive to merchants to accept it, which in turn lead to fewer people using crypto for payments. The problem is solved with this card, he says, as merchants get their fiat and users pay in crypto. He shared a video of the card in action.Do you want one of these? ðŸ’³Sign up now: Credit card https://t.co/LszTKBM6MH https://t.co/sgLmfK6t2a pic.twitter.com/4wmRiD6A8eMeanwhile, Coinbase entered this new business area back in April 2019, at which time, their card was available only for the UK clients. They have some time on Binance though, so their card has expanded its reach and offering since.Let's do a quick comparison of the two cards. Importantly, the Binance Card is, for now, available as a virtual card in a Beta version, says the exchange. The physical card, they add, will come ""shortly."" That said, people will be able to use the card in-person and online, for anything, from groceries to bills. The card, issued by Visa, is accepted by more than 46 million merchants, both offline and online, in 200 regions and territories. The initial release of the card is planned for Malaysia, followed by Vietnam, and other countries globally ""within the next few weeks."" Meanwhile, Coinbase's card has been spreading its reach since the launch and is available in 29 European countries, and its working on expanding to additional markets, according to their FAQ. It too can be used wherever Visa is accepted, online, offline, and internationally, with millions of merchants, as well as ATMs for cash withdrawals.Both cards work by allowing the customer to pay with their crypto, but then converting that crypto to fiat upon the completion of the purchase, that way making the merchants happy too.A user needs to use the Binance Card App to load the card with funds, by transferring coins from their Binance.com wallet to the Binance Card wallet, as ""simple as transferring BNB from one wallet to another."" This is the balance the card will use for payments, automatically deducting all expenses from the balance every time a payment is made. This also means that the card's internal balance will be in cryptoassets.Similarly, once the Coinbase Card iOS or Android App is downloaded, it needs to be connected to an account, upon which the virtual card can be used immediately, while the physical one will be sent to the user's address. The app allows the user to switch between crypto wallets they want to pay with.  Binance's press release for now mentions only binance coin (BNB) and bitcoin (BTC). Coinbase Card supports nine coins: BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, XRP, BAT, REP, ZRX, and XLM.Binance Card comes with a one-time cost of USD 15, says the exchange, payable in the form of initial top-up from the user's crypto wallet to the Binance Card balance. Once USD 15 worth of BNB or BTC is transferred to the card balance, the order is processed. There are no monthly or annual fees, they say. No other details are available yet.At the time of launch, Coinbase's GBP 4.95 (USD 6.48) card issuance fee was waived for the first 1,000 customers. Coinbase Card issuance fee is also covered by that first transfer, so the minimum of GBP 5 / EUR 5 is needed on the card balance to get started. The users can withdraw up to GBP 200 / EUR 200 per month for free, while amounts larger than that are charged 1% for domestic and 2% for international cash withdrawals. Domestic purchase transactions are free, while others are charged 0.20%-3%.Coinbase Card comes with a Coinbase Card App, which offers users instant receipts, transaction summaries, spending categories, etc. Binance too, as said, has users go through the Binance Card App to top-up their card balance, and this app lets them manage funds, card security, and spending.Coinbase Card comes with daily spending and ATM withdrawal, as well as monthly and yearly purchase limits. There's no information of that kind available for Binance Card yet.Google Pay is available for Coinbase Card users in fifteen countries. Coinbase also hit a major milestone when it became a Visa principal member last month.Both cards require verification to be completed.And as to why anybody would be purchasing anything with a volatile crypto, the adoption-pushing CEO CZ said it's because there are people who only have crypto in their wallets.Cuz they only keep crypto.If you only keep crypto, it's fiat that fluctuates like crazy.Meanwhile, Crypto.com (MCO) has announced some ten days ago that its MCO Visa Card is being shipped to customers in the United Kingdom. Also, in December 2019, trading and investing platform eToro confirmed to Cryptonews.com that they are working on a debit card."

Yaeger, a litigator and shareholder at Carlton Fields, the law firm representing Weeks, was quoted as stating,“These are scary times for everyone, and especially for people who are not allowed to protect themselves in the ways the rest of us are trying to. Joby Weeks just wants to stay healthy and be in a place where he can safely prepare for his day in court.”District Judge Claire C. Cecchi will now decide whether to release the accused men as the coronavirus pandemic worsens in the United States.Goettsche and Weeks were arrested in December last year, along with a third man named Joseph Frank Abel, as part of a crackdown on BitClub Network, which the men have been accused of co-running.The United States Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey claims that, between April 2014 and December 2019, the defendants solicited money from investors in exchange for what they believed were shares of the earnings of cryptocurrency mining pools. The men allegedly provided investors with fake figures on what they said were “bitcoin (BTC) mining earnings.”Goettsche and Weeks were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and all three men were also hit with conspiracy to offer and sell unregistered securities charges.Wire fraud conspiracy offenses are punishable with a maximum of 20 years in prison, and a fine of up to USD 250,000. Conspiracy to sell unregistered securities offenses, meanwhile, are punishable with a maximum of five years in prison, and a fine of up to USD 250,000."

A good platform will use a multi-cluster, multi-tier system to ensure safety and stability.Multi-device Support: Having the ability to be able to check on your cryptocurrency from different platforms, such as your web browser or a mobile app helps a lot.High Performance: Just like a top-end car, high performance is the most important thing when it comes to the software used to power the platform.Multi-language Support: It is always great to get support in the language you feel most comfortable with.High Level of Liquidity: Having stronger liquidity in a different number of cryptocurrency pairs is good.Multiple Coin Support: You will want your software to be able to deal with a wide selection of coins, such as bitcoin, litecoin, NXT and more.Fees and commission rates: No matter what you do in life, always be wary of hidden fees! When it comes to cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency trading, it is no different. Stay safe!Modes of payment: Search for the payment methods that are available to see if they are tailored to your needs.Ease of use: You’re going to want to use a platform that is not only streamlined, but also has all the features that you personally need. It’s best when everything is packaged up in a neat and easy-to-use interface.Make sure you know all the details before you even think about investing in any cryptocurrency. And always be certain to check out important information about cryptocurrency trading platforms. So, you are ready to trade? Excellent! But just like deep-sea diving, don’t jump in without a few expert pointers! When trading and selling cryptocurrency, it is best to be armed with as much information as possible – to keep you safe and sound.Ignore Biased Sources The very first thing you should always be cautious about is the fact that there are a lot of fake coins and scams around out there.  Pump & dumps, fraudulent schemes and Ponzi-type pyramids are just some of the things you need to keep an eye out for. There are a lot of people out there posting fake or misleading information on websites and blogs, as well as convincing-looking phishing pages, and other nefarious scams that can hook unsuspecting investors.Invest Within Your Means Don’t invest all of your personal savings or your child’s college funds on trading and selling cryptocurrency! You must always plan for the worst eventuality and know that at any given time you may lose your stake. It’s great to apply the old adage, “Plan for the worst, hope for the best.” That saying works really well when applied to cryptocurrency.Set Attainable Goals Cryptocurrency is not a get-rich-quick scheme. Setting profit goals of between 5-20% are ideal, but it’s really up to you when it comes to deciding how much to invest. When getting started, it might be better to start smaller. It’s up to you, but you have been warned!Above All, Don’t Panic! It’s very important to take the time and to sit back and conduct your own research on trading cryptocurrency. The most valuable companies in the cryptocurrency industry study and research extensively so that they can understand what is going on in the market at all times. And if they don’t make uneducated decisions, neither should you!"

",Major crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX says that their Insurance Fund did exactly what it was supposed to during the market crash.,"In their latest blog post, the exchange addressed questions from the traders related to the Insurance Fund, its role during the March 12 and 13 market turbulence, and why it wasn't utilized during the crash. The Insurance Fund has grown gradually in the last 18 months, says BitMEX, standing at BTC 34,678 (USD 203 million) now. ""It is important for the Fund to be large enough to absorb intraday shocks, to avoid Auto Deleveraging (ADL) on the platform,"" they add.""During these events, the Fund acted as the last line of defense, by attempting to prevent ADL,"" writes BitMEX, which is ""the automatic deleveraging of the positions of profitable traders (ranked by profit and leverage in that contract) against liquidated positions to prevent bankruptcy."" And as such, it ""completely prevented"" ADL on March 12 and 13.On the other hand, says the exchange, this fund is not used to cover BitMEX running costs or contribute to its profits, to demand payments from traders with negative account balances, or to influence markets, intentionally or otherwise.A must read for traders who want to understand the mechanics of the Insurance Fund. https://t.co/uaglC8cfUTAs previously reported by Cryptonews.com, BitMEX Co-founder and CEO, Arthur Hayes, said that the exchange experienced two DDoS (denial-of-service) attacks on February 13, the day the crypto market crashed. The exchange had stopped trading shortly, and people started speculating about what its role was in this market dive, and whether it exacerbated losses in the bitcoin (BTC) price.The exchange explains that while the crach didn't deplete the Fund, liquidity dropped ""significantly.“ A second move would've stretched the fund to its limits, but it would “likely survive due to its size and the trader confidence it creates. No other fund in the crypto ecosystem has the size to survive such an event,"" says BitMEX, adding that ""In this scenario, it is likely that massive loss-recovery events will take place at all other major crypto derivatives platforms.""Besides BitMEX supporters in the comments, there are also those who either don't believe the explanation or say do not understand it. Others said that there's very little new information shared in the post, while trader 'lowstrife' said they understand ""why the insurance fund can't protect against an event like this,"" but wondered why it, “when the worst-case scenario almost happened, was barely used. Which raises questions of why it's so large, and it's overall efficacy."""

",Major crypto exchange Coinbase has announced that it will allow users to lend out their crypto and gain interest from loans using decentralized finance (DeFi) apps via its Coinbase Wallet app.,"The development comes as the crypto lending industry continues on a path of dynamic growth, with rapidly increasing interest among would-be lenders worldwide.In a statement, the exchange wrote,“Coinbase Wallet users have already deposited millions of dollars into DeFi apps like Compound and dYdX, earning interest at rates ranging up to 6% [annual percentage rate]. Users currently access these apps through the Wallet’s built-in decentralized application (dapp) browser or via WalletLink on desktop. However, it isn’t easy to compare rates or view total balances across different providers.” Coinbase added that its latest move would “make it even easier” for customers to use DeFi apps by “integrating them” into its “wallet experience.”DeFi borrowing and lending apps typically involve making use of smart contracts, or programs that run on the Ethereum blockchain, backed by collateral from borrowers.These borrowers are required to lock up a certain amount of crypto holdings on the blockchain network in order to borrow tokens from a would-be lender.Last year saw a major surge in crypto lending worldwide.A recent report compiled by crypto finance company Credmark found that that in the fourth quarter of 2019 there was a 51.7% quarterly increase in the value of the global crypto lending industry. Between October and December 2019, active debt stood at USD 1.568 billion, USD 1.441 billion of which was private debt. USD 129 million of the total was generated by DeFi lenders.The total value of global crypto loans expanded to USD 8 billion last year, a sevenfold increase on 2018 figures.Credmark says its figures are based on public data released by DeFi lenders and private data from consumer and institutional lenders – representing an estimated 85% of the market.The report’s authors stated that early 2019 saw the emergence of new DeFi protocols and new private lenders.They added,“Simultaneously, new products were introduced by existing players. Many of these products matured during the second half of the year. Q2 growth was fueled by new entrants, while Q4 growth was fueled by increased institutional lending and recovering crypto prices.”The company added that the entry of new players, such as LendingBlock, Ledn and Bankera has also galvanized the industry, as have new products by established DeFi companies such as Nexo and BlockFi."

","Major crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX said that the root cause of the DDoS attacks on March 13 has been identified, and more than BTC 40 (USD 211,000) refunded to the affected users.","BitMEX published a blog post authored by its Co-founder and CEO, Arthur Hayes, stating that the exchange experienced two DDoS (denial-of-service) attacks on the day the market went plummeting, with bitcoin diving to the USD 5,000 level, briefly touching the USD 4,000 level, and even moving below USD 4,000 on BitMEX. With a DDoS attack, the hacker floods a website from many different sources in order to disrupt the service and make it unavailable. This is what the exchange says happened, as the attacks delayed or even prevented requests going to and from the platform. The exchange goes on to explain that they believe that these two attacks are in fact connected to the DDoS attacks it experienced just last month, done by the same actor(s), and that the previous DDoS was used to identify the target so to attack it at the most opportune moment - at ""a peak moment of market volatility."" The targeted feature was the Trollbox (a chat box). Once a DDoS was noticed, it was stopped, but both caused ""a significant internal queue,"" which was cleared manually for the second attack in order to resume system operations.That said, the platform gives a number of 156 accounts ""for which Last Price stops were clearly erroneously triggered on ETHUSD, caused by the unintended late processing of market orders during the first downtime,"" and a total of BTC 40.297 was refunded to users ""for each stop that triggered erroneously during this period."" There is no mention of any other refunds.All personal data is safe, assures the platform. While they are working on solutions to prevent a future attack, isolate critical systems, increase automated scalability under load, review the oldest and most vulnerable parts of the system (like the Trollbox), etc., they admit that ""no system is immune to disruption via DDoS.""As a reminder, we reported that in the aftermath of the now notorious March 13 market crash, there have been speculations in the Cryptoverse about what BitMEX’s role during that crash was exactly. The speculations arose after the exchange had halted trading during the storm, claiming that they were experiencing a “hardware issue” at a cloud service provider. Some argued that there was no such issues, while others said that the highly leveraged derivatives trading taking place on the exchange exacerbated losses in the bitcoin price.In their analysis on the Bitcoin crash, financial technology and data company Digital Assets Data says that at approximately 2:15 UTC, the price of Bitcoin fell below USD 4,000, and this fall was led by BitMEX, until BTC dropped to almost USD 3,600, they told Cryptonews.com. As reported, the exchange temporarily halted trading at the time. BitMEX's report also gives 2:16 UTC as the time of the first attack. Another exchange to experience outages, says the data company, is Deribit: the first during the sell-off and the second after the recovery started.""These two exchanges, acting as two of the largest liquidity providers, experienced technical issues which may have likely contributed to the extreme volatility,"" writes Digital Assets Data.They conclude that Coinbase led the subsequent recovery, ""with BitMEX lagging far behind the other major exchanges."" Meanwhile, in February, as Cryptonews.com reported, two other exchanges suffered multiple DDoS attacks: OKEx and Bitfinex.As for the accusations that this was all orchestrated by the exchange, BitMEX responded that ""It would be against our own interests to fabricate downtime."" Nonetheless, they recognized that ""the community wants to know more about how liquidations interact with the insurance fund,"" promising to share more details about that and the attacks soon. CTO of @BitMEXdotcom , @STRML_, posts a detailed thread about #Bitmex's version of events in what was one of the biggest #crypto exchange bungles in crypto's history. Meanwhile, @CryptoHayes tries in vain to explain ""in colour for yall"" 🤮. Public response will be interesting. https://t.co/vqUX7gInS2The exchange, Hayes, as well as their Chief Technology Officer, Samuel Reed, have been tweeting out the explanations of what had happened, but the response so far in the comments seems to be overwhelmingly negative. People are calling the exchange a scam, not believing that they don't stand behind the incident; people say that centralized exchanges are manipulating the markets and that ""Exchanges and Cryptocurrency do not mix""; others are asking for the IP addresses used during the attack to check it themselves or any proof that goes beyond just excuses, many are asking for refunds, some are calling for BitMEX to close, and more.are you telling us that trollbox and trading engine are on the same database?....that's crazy....🧐__Black flagging your own market manipulation is some textbook black-hat financial tactics.

",Automaker Toyota appears keen to expand the scope of its blockchain operations – with a new personal ID and vehicle ID platform now fully tested and potentially ready for rollout.,"In April last year, the Toyota Group, which also comprises financial services and R&D ventures, launched a cross-group Toyota Blockchain Lab.In a press release, Tokyo-based blockchain startup BUIDL, an affiliate of American security token platform Securitize, stated that it had successfully completed testing on the new platform – in conjunction with the aforementioned Toyota Blockchain Lab.The startup, which is owned by security token platform Securitize, says the personal ID platform could be used by corporate entities such as the Toyota Group itself to manage points and employee benefits, as well as digital certificate issuance.The vehicle ID platform, meanwhile, could be used to manage vehicle registration, maintenance records, ownership records and more.Japanese financial giant SBI Holdings – now a major player in the crypto world – made an undisclosed “seven-figure” investment in Securitize in November last year, a month before the latter acquired BUIDL.BUIDL was established in 2018, and says that it “supports several security token projects across Japan, having consistently grown its revenues and commanded a large market share since inception,” per a press release previously shared with Cryptonews.com.Toyota, meanwhile, has shown a significant willingness to pursue blockchain-related business models. The company has previously stated that its use of blockchain technology in fraud-reducing digital ad-buying tools has seen it increase its website traffic by 21%.

","The price of cardano (ADA) remained largely unchanged along with the broader crypto market on Thursday morning (UTC time), despite the unveiling of a new scaling solution that is to be implemented on the Cardano blockchain.","Earlier today (10:30 UTC), ADA traded up by a mere 0.34% over the past 24 hours to a price of USD 0.299, before correcting to USD 0.292.  ADA price chart:The new protocol, dubbed Ouroboros Hydra (“Hydra”), is being developed by the Cardano-focused development firm IOHK, and is intended to work as a second-layer blockchain scaling solution that will be placed on top of Cardano’s original blockchain. If everything goes according to plan, the new solution would increase the speed at which the Cardano network can operate, according to IOHK.Although the release of the white paper on the online research database ePrint was discussed in a video by Charles Hoskinson, Co-founder of Cardano CEO of IOHK, already on March 10, the news is now official, with Hoskinson saying that the work now begins to “translate the science into code.”Since word first came out about the new solution, ADA is down by nearly 30% in a sell-off that has largely mirrored similar action in other major cryptoassets.Hail Hydra!!! You get a second live video today: https://t.co/I0tmAqy5iH https://t.co/XRJrpJXADKAccording to Hoskinson, simulations have shown that each Hydra “head” can perform up to 1,000 transactions per second, with each stake pool being able to host one head each. If the network were to reach a thousand stake pools at one point in the future, “you could be looking at a maximum theoretical performance of a million transactions per second,” the CEO said in the video. Among the applications, he foresees Cardano being used for tipping and micropayments.As reported, in November 2019, the Cardano Foundation launched a crypto payment solution, AdaPay, aimed at merchants.

March 16, 2020
",New York University economics professor and arch crypto-skeptic Nouriel Roubini has hatched an ingenious solution to the financial crisis brought about by the coronavirus pandemic – and it involves commodifying toilet paper.,"In a tongue-in-cheek tweet, Roubini floated a plan that sounded not too far away from tokenization.He was responding to a number of toilet paper-themed memes and humor-filled online posts about toilet paper, which is now apparently in short supply in many Western countries where citizens have been panic-buying loo roll in fear of future shortages.One viral TikTok video involves a man “paying” for his coffee with toilet paper, tipping a jubilant barista with a few extra sheets. And in Australia, one coffee shop owner has already stated that he will allow customers to swap toilet paper for takeaway coffee, per an ABC report published last week. Roubini stated that commodity-backed money might not be a bad idea in light of the sudden surge in the demand and value of toilet paper.In an “explanation of the run on toilet paper [TP],” Roubini predicts,“Most folks will run out of income/savings and their credit lines too. So to survive they need to resort to some other means of payment that liquefies some existing useful asset folks already hold. That is where TP comes handy”. But despite this bright start, Dr. Doom soon lived up to his nickname – and his tweets turned into a sideswipe aimed at cryptocurrencies.Roubini’s next tweet poured scorn on the crypto industry, stating,“Maybe someone should rather create a virtual version of TP currency that to be credible [would have to be] fully backed by actual TP. But given hoarding of TP, that is hard. Maybe TP producers can introduce this virtual version of TP-Paper Money that is fully backed by actual TP stock!”Dr. Doom made himself something of a household name when he famously predicted the 2008 global financial crisis.And he continued his tirade by making an almost inevitable pun.He wrote,“TP-Paper currency will not be a crypto or blockchain scam. Unlike such useless shitcoins it will be backed by a real asset, the stock of TP produced by actual TP producers, i.e. like a true gold-standard where the entire stock of virtual TP-Paper is backed by a stock of actual TP”.Roubini’s witticisms did not tickle everyone’s funny bone, however, with many pro-crypto advocates taking to Twitter and Reddit to express their displeasure.One Twitter user questioned the technical validity of Dr. Doom’s “plans.”@Nouriel @Nouriel so you suggest that currencies should be 100% asset backed? Does this mean that a TP standard wou… https://t.co/pJYXmJwH82And a Redditor wrote (ending with an ironic pun, perhaps),“Nouriel Roubini is almost starting to understand the concept of commodity-backed sound money!!! I wonder how he'll rationalize it, when Bitcoiners explain that bitcoin (BTC) is just a way better form of commodity-backed sound money. […] If he says that TP is more useful than bitcoin, then I will lmao.”"

","The Steem (STEEM) community has decided to end the battle with Justin Sun and the Tron Foundation, but in a way that no one saw coming. In order to escape Sun's grasp, the leaders of this Medium alternative are packing their bags and moving Steem altogether. ","The Steem community has decided to move Steem to a soon-to-be launched blockchain called Hive, where Sun would have absolutely no power, given that the coins from the development fund that Steemit controls will not be moved to the new blockchain, hence making Sun's token's worthless there. Another major change is the prevention of exchanges from participating in governance attacks, due to which a 30-day delay has been added.As the announcement explains, Hive is a community-driven fork of Steem code, that is, of the Steem blockchain, independent from it. It's ""created by a large group of Steem community members,"" including over thirty developers, as well as business owners and users.The initial launch on March 20 will be a direct copy of the existing blockchain, says the post, which will enable the community to discuss further development. At the moment of launch, every Steem account will have an identical account on Hive, including history, but the two will record future content and transactions separately. Also, STEEM holders will receive an equal amount in the new HIVE coin. People have been expressing their support for the move, saying they'll be moving with it. ""At this point, it seems like most of the community is in agreement on one thing: they don’t want Justin Sun here,"" writes Blocktrades, adding that Sun just wants to be paid to leave. The post lists reasons why that shouldn't be done:""We’ve been in promising talks with some exchanges already,"" says the post, promising at least one listing ""within days after launch.""This has been quite a turbulent battle. In February, the Tron Foundation acquired Steemit Inc, developer of Steemit, Steem’s leading content sharing platform. However, an old issue quickly resurfaced - a large pile of Steem tokens controlled by Steemit Inc, called the ""ninja-mined stake,"" which the community became worried Sun will use to control the blockchain. Sun had already exercised his power when he entered a voting war with the community, dragging major exchanges into it (which later unvoted and apologized), trying to establish his authority over the community to whom his every move was just another confirmation of their worries. At pixel time (10:24 UTC), STEEM, ranked 73rd by market capitalization, trades at USD 0.12 and is down 4% in a day and 41% in a week. We have contacted the Tron Foundation for comment and will update should they reply."

","Police investigating the so-called Telegram “Nth Room” pedophile ring have served search warrants to most of South Korea’s leading crypto exchanges – including the “big four” of Upbit, Bithumb, Korbit and Coinone – as they attempt to track down people who paid to watch video footage featuring the brutal rape and torture of women and underage girls who reporters say were “of middle school age.”","The case has left the nation shocked and outraged, after two Kookmin Ilbo reporters infiltrated the now-notorious Telegram chat room for would-be viewers of the videos.

","Following the massacre in the broader crypto market on Thursday, major altcoins have already started to recoup some of their losses, with some cryptoassets now showing positive returns over the past 24 hours.","Despite a sea of red in the crypto market, altcoins such as litecoin (LTC), tezos (XTZ), and stellar (XLM), were among the first to return to green after the sell-off, posting 24-hour returns between 3% and 10%. In addition, cautiously optimistic trading also drove Ripple’s XRP higher today, although the recent market bloodbath now means that the popular cryptocurrency has lost about 96% of its value from the all-time high in January 2018.Litecoin has performed well today (+10%, 13:05 UTC), so far recouping about half of its losses from yesterday. However, the asset looks similar to XLM from a charting standpoint, with previous support found around the USD 38 level now becoming resistance for the price. XLM also turned out to be one of the strongest performers, with a 24-hour gain of nearly 7% to USD 0.039. However, that’s still down from levels seen earlier in the trading day, when the asset managed to almost regain its entire loss from yesterday, before falling back down.Despite today’s gains, however, the coin still remains below its lows from December last year, which has now become an area of resistanceAlthough it is unclear what specifically is driving the rally in these altcoins, one theory is that severe network congestion on the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks has led some crypto users to consider other and faster alternatives for making transactions.Meanwhile, many altcoins also remained deep in red after the market rout yesterday, with decentralized finance (DeFi) leader MakerDAO (MKR) seeing the biggest losses in the top 50 coins by market capitalization, still down almost 22% over the past 24 hours. The losses in MKR come after the lending platform and stablecoin issuer experienced significant turmoil during yesterday’s market sell-off, as reported earlier.As of press time on Friday (13:05 UTC), both bitcoin and ethereum also remained in red for the day, posting 24-hour losses of 7% and 6%, respectively, after experiencing their worst and second-worst trading day in history."

",The Japanese cryptocurrency scene could be about to welcome another major player to the fray – after major securities and brokerage firm Tokai Tokyo became the latest member of an increasingly high-profile and powerful-looking security token offering (STO) association.,"The move comes just months after Tokai Tokyo made a USD 4.6 million investment in crypto exchange giant Huobi’s Tokyo-based platform Huobi Japan.Tokai Tokyo has also made investments in the likes of capital markets platform iSTOX in recent months. The Japan Security Token Offering Association is aiming to win self-regulatory status, and, as previously reported, one of its prime movers, Ripple board member and SBI CEO Yoshitaka Kitao has spoken about collaborating with fellow member companies on the creation of an STO exchange platform.The association’s members include SBI – a major Japanese securities player – as well as rival brokerage the Monex Group, which also runs the Coincheck exchange. Another key member is Rakuten, an e-commerce giant that operates securities and crypto exchange platforms.Daiwa and Nomura, two of the country’s traditional “big four” securities firms, are also founding members, as is Kabucom, an affiliate of banking behemoth Mitsubishi UFG.The founding group was joined by two new members in January: Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and the securities arm of Mizuho.With Tokai Tokyo now also on board, it appears that the association will be able to wield no shortage of financial and lobbying clout in its quest to gain regulatory favor from the Financial Services Agency (FSA).Per Fisco (via  Money Voice), STO-specific legislation is widely expected to gain approval from both the FSA and lawmakers in April, leaving the door open for STO-related activity from May onwards.Fisco says that industry insiders expect “top-level” financial companies to be particularly active in the emerging STO sector."

","Steem (STEEM), the social media-like blockchain platform launched in 2016, has seen a massive surge over the past two days, after it decided to evade a hostile takeover by Justin Sun and the Tron Foundation by moving the entire platform over to a new blockchain called Hive. The new blockchain is expected to be launched already this Friday, March 20th. ","Earlier today, STEEM surged more than 100%, before correcting lower. As of press time (13:51 UTC), STEEM is up by 65% over the past 24 hours, trading at a price of USD 0.31. It's also up by 122% in a week, increasing its monthly gains to 42%. However, the price is down 35% in a year.Today, it was even trading as high as USD 0.48 on Coinbase before it fell back. Unlike most other cryptoassets, STEEM has now recovered all the losses from the major crypto market crash last week.The price is now hovering around the levels seen at the peak in mid-February, after it earlier today surged to price levels not seen since June 2019. If the price manages to close above the February high, the chart might look more bullish again after the prolonged downtrend that we have seen in STEEM over the past year.Following the recent price gains, STEEM stands out as the best performer among the top 100 cryptoassets by market capitalization over the past 24 hours, by far outperforming most of the major cryptoassets. The blockchain platform is currently ranked as the 44th most valuable cryptoasset by market capitalization.The positive sentiment surrounding STEEM also comes as the two major crypto exchanges Binance and Huobi have both announced that they will support the hard fork that is needed to move STEEM to its new Hive blockchain.According to Binance’s announcement, the exchange “will distribute the new HIVE token to users holding STEEM” as of March 20 at 2 PM UTC time at a 1:1 ratio."

","In an expected counter-move to the Steem (STEEM) community's move, which itself was a move to counter a move, Justin Sun and the Tron Foundation have allegedly decided to censor all posts on the platform related to the community's soon-to-be launched new home, Hive.","This has been a complicated battle between the two parties, yet Steem doubled yesterday in the middle of the ongoing saga. Nonetheless, the Steem community hopes to bring an end to it by moving entirely to the blockchain called Hive, set for launch today. To spread the word about it, express their opinions, and communicate between themselves until their new accounts are ready, the community continues using Steemit, a leading platform on Steem's blockchain, owned since February by Sun and his Tron Foundation. But Sun is now accused of interfering with it.A number of posts have been shared online, claiming that their authors have been censored and the posts themselves removed or hidden from Steemit, having to be re-uploaded. Reddit user 'okean1230 shared GitHub codes that include block and blacklist codes, reportedly used to censor Hive-related posts. ""I still can't believe he's 'censoring' the posts by hardcoding a post blacklist to the Steemit client, and updating the website frequently... He's shown how amateur his team is simply by how they're even blacklisting it,"" comments 'CarsonRoscoe.' On Steemit, among multiple posts claiming censorship, 'themarkymark' compared two screenshots, saying that the announcement of the Hive blockchain is blocked on Steem, but visible on Steempeak (a site based off Steem). ""If you continue to use Steemit.com you may not have access to all content on the blockchain,"" he warns, adding that the list of blocked content is growing. On Twitter, Girl Gone Crypto claims that Steemit.com removed her ""neutral explainer video"" about Hive from the platform, showing that it's not visible there. She includes a code reportedly written to block content, including hers. ""I just always figured it would happen on Youtube... not Steemit,"" she writes.Well, it finally happened. I had my content censored. I just always figured it would happen on Youtube... not Steemit. 😳Hear how my neutral explainer video about the new #hive blockchain just got removed by Justin Sun on https://t.co/qyTNoW5Xp7. #steem #hiveisalive pic.twitter.com/IZHSynCi4vMeanwhile, Speempeak said that they plan to support to Hive, but asked its users if they would want to use an interface based on Hive, as well as to provide name suggestions. There have been some 215 comments on this post so far, and the majority seems to be in support of Hive.Not everybody plans to move though. Twitter user Caleb Wright argues that ""Saying that the ‘entire’ community is moving over to hive is just an extreme statement."" Now you have spoken to your first community ‘member’ who is going to keep blogging over at #Steemit and I know many others who are not interested to move. Guess you did not read the community member article I shared with you, otherwise I would be the second 😊👍As reported, Hive is a community-driven fork of Steem code. It will practically duplicate all of the existing Steem accounts and their history, with STEEM holders getting the equal amount in HIVE coin, but it'll then continue independently from the point of the launch. It's meant to be as fully decentralized as the community wanted Steem to be. We've asked Tron for a comment and will update should they reply.At pixel time (12:24 PM UTC), STEEM, ranked 53rd by market capitalization, trades at c. USD 0.276 and is down 11% in a day, trimming its weekly gains to 107%."

","Keyless crypto wallet maker ZenGo has raised the crypto community to its feet, warning about a security issue that can suck all funds out of users' accounts. The flaw has seemingly been well-known in the decentralized finance (DeFi) developer community, but it was not disclosed to users. ZenGo however, also offers a solution.","""Imagine going to your bank and sending someone USD 1,"" but later ""you discover that by doing so you have allowed this person to empty your account,"" said ZenGo. Worse yet, your bank knew about this possibility but did nothing to prevent it from happening. Some of the most popular dapps (decentralized apps) and crypto wallets have this precise issue, which ZenGo named ""baDAPProve."" But it was discussed only in the technical circles of Ethereum developers for years, while the users had no idea that it may happen or how it may affect them, they claim. ZenGo describes baDAPProve as an exploit, whereby a smart contract can get unlimited access to the entirety of a user's funds, while the user is none the wiser. Alex Manuskin, Blockchain Researcher at ZenGo, explains: DeFi companies build dapps implemented as blockchain smart contracts so that users can access DeFi services. To do so, users have to give permission for the dapp to interact with their wallet. This means that the dapp will ask the user for access to the tokens. ""The security issue is that while most users assume they approve access for a specific transaction of a specific amount, in most dapps users actually grant access to ALL of their holdings in that token. [...] In almost every dapp, when the user connects to it, they unknowingly provide the smart contract associated with the dapp, full access to all of their funds, regardless of their actual usage.""What does this mean for the user? If that dapp which was given permission to access tokens is vulnerable to a security issue or is malicious from the start, attackers can use the permission to take every single one of the approved token at any time, even when the dapp is no longer used - and it will not require any additional consent to do so. Users who decide to move out of DeFi due to recent price drops remain as vulnerable as they were before. Furthermore, many wallets say nothing about it to their users, claims ZenGo, citing an unnamed wallet that says how communicating this to users in an understandable way would be difficult. Brave, Metamask, and Coinbase wallets display some warnings. Meanwhile, Opera, imToken, and Trust wallet give no warning whatsoever, ZenGo claims, and only Trust wallet is planning to upgrade their wallet as a result of their inquiry. We asked imToken and Opera for their comments as well.This issue is a known risk and requires user interaction. We  have already clearly notified the user when they are entering a third-party DApp. But we still thank you for your report.""What is amazing in this is that many players we approached or even publications (won't name) refused to consider it was a big deal,"" tweeted Ouriel Ohayon, CEO of ZenGo, adding that any dapp is concerned here, not just DeFi. Manuskin writes that, though the problem has been known for years, ""some security compromises that might have been acceptable in the era when users were scarce and highly technical are not acceptable when DeFi goes mainstream, acquiring many non-technical users, and handling crypto tokens in the Billions (USD).""Therefore, the wallet maker built a publicly available, open-source testnet for all to experience baDAPProve risk-free. ZenGo also developed a security solution that they say solves most of the double confirmation issues, writing: ""The approved sum is the same as the sum that the user intends to send, the user only approves once and both transactions are sent in parallel so the user does not need to wait any longer than usual."" The solution is meant for their Compound-based ZenGo Savings feature, but it's not specific to automated lending platform Compound, meaning that other apps can use it too.Learn more: Ethereum Locked in DeFi Rises, While Flash Loan Holes Are Being Plugged"

","Samsung Blockchain Keystore, meant to manage private keys, is now available on the latest Galaxy devices in seventeen countries, Cryptonews.com has learned.","As reported less than a month ago, after much expectation, the Cryptoverse laid their eyes on the newly unveiled flagship smartphones, including the latest Galaxy devices, the S20, and the foldable Z Flip. But despite seeing the phones, the Cryptoverse was left with many questions unanswered, including where the Blockchain Keystore is available. ""Samsung Blockchain Keystore is installed on the Galaxy S20 and Galaxy Z Flip, and users can download the Blockchain Wallet from Galaxy Store. The Keystore leverages the secure processor of the Galaxy S20 so it provides more enhanced security against hardware-based attacks,"" a Samsung spokesperson told Cryptonews.com, without elaborating about the usage of Blockchain Wallet and blockchain-related growth plans.However, Cryptonews.com has learned that blockchain services are currently available on Samsung devices in South Korea, Canada, and the U.S., as well as certain countries in Europe and Southeast Asia/Oceania. These include: the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Austria, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Australia, Singapore, and the Philippines. However, this varies by carrier, market, and device, therefore consumers should check with their local service provider.Also, despite some opinions that there may be enhanced functions added to the new devices, there are no new upgrades to the Keystore or Wallet from Galaxy S10. The company said in January that in 2019 they shipped more than 6.7 million Galaxy 5G smartphones (Galaxy S10, Note10, Note10+, Galaxy A90, and Galaxy Fold) globally. Meanwhile, industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo estimated in February that Samsung sold between 36-38 million Galaxy S10 devices in total, and said that it'll sell some 30-32 million of S20. On February 28, Yonhap News Agency reported, citing undisclosed industry sources, that an estimated 70,800 units have been sold on the first day, ""50 percent lower than their predecessors, amid the spreading coronavirus outbreak."" ""Sales were affected by sharp declines in discounts for new phones and the number of visitors to offline stores due to coronavirus infection fears,"" an official from a local telecom company is quoted as saying. Meanwhile, Galaxy Z Flip is allegedly selling much better, especially compared to last year's Galaxy Fold, as the industry sources claim that the sales are stronger than expected, that the company is ramping up production, and that is predicted to reach 100,000 unit shipments in South Korea alone by the end of this month, as well as 2-2.5 million units globally by the end of this year.Samsung isn't the only tech giant whose revenues have been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, as Apple and Microsoft addressed it as well.

","Major cryptocurrency exchange Binance is allegedly allowing some users from the U.S. to trade on the Binance.com platform, instead of Binance.US.","Though trading on Binance.com for U.S. citizens has seemingly been forbidden, some alleged users are claiming that they can still trade on the site. It was reported by some reddittors some five months ago that they can still use Binance.com, though others have also reported using a virtual private network (VPN) to do so. And today, Reddit user 'misterscorp' posted what they say is a proof that there is a specific group of Binance users that can still use this site, without switching to Binance.US.""Basically some of us are grand-fathered in so to speak, for now at least,"" writes the user. The screenshot of an alleged email from the exchange's customer support, dated March 11, says: ""Currently, USA users (who already has or verified the account before (Sept.12, 2019) can still continue to use their accounts as usual on Binance.com. [...] However, since Sept. 12, 2019, new users won't be able to register a new account if accessing from the US and won't be able to verify an account or promote the account to level 2 or higher."" It added that, should there be changes or restrictions placed on these accounts in the future, the users will be notified at least a week before, recommending them to open an account on Binance.US.""So it sucks no new comers can join,"" writes misterscorp, ""but those of us who registered and were verified before that cut off date are fine, and this is why we are still able to trade."" As for the limitations, they add: ""We just do not have access to margin and future trading.""In June 2019, Binance confirmed that it would enter the U.S. market and launch Binance.US, which indeed happened in September 2019. It also stated that, starting September 12, their clients from the U.S. would no longer be able to trade on Binance.com. As reported, on August 15, the exchange amended its Terms of Use, deleting the line that said explicitly that ""Binance is unable to provide services to any U.S. person,"" and changed it to ""By registering to use a Binance Account [...], you represent and warrant that [...] you are not a U.S person.""misterscorp concludes with an opinion that likely many in the U.S. don't know they can still trade on Binance.com, and that this is something the exchange should make clear, clarify their policy page, and not ""contradict their own policy regarding this."" They add: ""I am assuming they did that to keep regulators off the back and mitigate liabilities."" Binance did not respond to our request for comment. Misterscorp declined to comment when contacted by Cryptonews.com.Meanwhile, the company already found itself in hot water over a resurfaced major change in the exchange's whitepaper in January this year, raising transparency questions."

","After a lengthy battle in the California court system, the Tezos Foundation has announced that it has settled a lawsuit outside of court, thus avoiding any legal scrutiny of the Tezos (XTZ) 2017 initial coin offering (ICO). However, while the parties have agreed on the settlement, it’s still up to a federal judge to approve it.","In either case, the settlement comes after a two-year-long legal dispute between the Foundation and a large number of participants in the Tezos ICO. As far as the market was concerned, the news of the settlement was more or less a non-event, with XTZ prices largely following the larger crypto market, and ending the trading day on Friday more or less unchanged.  At pixel time (11:45 UTC), XTZ trades at c. USD 1.51 and is down 9% in a day, trimming its weekly gains to 29%. The price is down 56% in a month.The move to settle the lawsuit was announced in an update on the Tezos Foundation website last Friday, and reportedly involves a one-time payment of USD 25 million. According to the Courthouse News Service, the settlement involves about 30,000 investors, all of whom participated in the ICO.The Foundation said that the settlement was reached because it is “in the best interest of the Tezos project and community as a whole.” However, it added that the settlement was not an admission of guilt:“The Foundation continues to believe the lawsuits were meritless and continues to deny any wrongdoing. However, lawsuits are expensive and time-consuming, and it was decided that the one-time financial cost of a settlement was preferable to the distractions and legal costs associated with continuing to fight in the courts.”Although settlements outside of the legal system are common in order to avoid lengthy and expensive court battles, they invariably lead to speculations as to what the motivation for settling is when one of the parties claims no wrongdoing. The Tezos Foundation claims that its ICO was more of a “donation” than an actual investment scheme. Had the court ruled it to be an investment scheme, the Tezos Foundation would possibly be in violation of the U.S. securities regulations.The settlement was also announced one day after the foundation in its biannual update revealed that it had USD 635 million in assets as of January 31, or 2.6% less than in July 2019. In January, 47% of the assets were held in bitcoin (BTC), down from 61% in July 2019. However, the share of XTZ in this portfolio increased from 15% in July 2019 to 23%. In the past three months, BTC lost c. 20% of its value, while XTZ is still up 1%."

","Zhen Ju Yong (Zen), CEO and Co-Founder of Singapore-based distributed private key management solution, Torus Labs, said he has been diagnosed with Covid-19 virus and is currently staying at an isolated ward in a hospital. (Updated at 15:42 UTC: updates in bold.)","""I fell ill yesterday and have just been diagnosed with"" Covid-19, writes Zen today. He felt the symptoms commonly associated with this novel virus two nights ago, including fever, coughing, a runny nose, and shortness of breath. Zen said he is currently settled ""quite nicely"" in a hospital's isolated ward. Thanks for all the wishes, I've settled in quite nicely into an isolated ward. My symptoms turned up the night before last and in general, they are; fever, breathlessness, cough, and a running nose - although you don't have to have all of them to have it pic.twitter.com/et67Z7E6jXHowever, his announcement came with a major and significant warning.Zen has immediately warned the attendees of two conferences he has recently attended, and who might've had close contact to him, to take additional precautions or get tested. The two Ethereum hackathons and conferences he has tagged are ETHLondonUK, held from February 28 to March 1, as well as Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC), which took place from March 3 until March 5 in Paris. And given that the virus has already been spreading through China's Wuhan since December last year, moving soon globally, all events held in the past two-three months may have theoretically been a venue for spreading of the virus, especially since: it's highly infective, people with mild symptoms may not know they have it, and conferences are meeting places for large groups of people from across the world.Also while most #COVID19 cases take 2-14 days to show symptoms and it's the doctor's opinion that ""it probably came from France"", there is a lesser chance that it could have been from Stanford Blockchain Conference (@cbrstan) or @EthereumDenver in mid FebWe have asked ETHLondonUK and EthCC for comment and will update should we get their responses. Meanwhile, some gatherings of crypto experts and fans continue. For example, CryptoCompare Digital Asset Summit has been held in London just yesterday, on March 10. On the other hand, the Chamber of Digital Commerce has decided to postpone DC Blockchain Summit 2020, which was scheduled March 11-12, due to ""the rapid evolution of the coronavirus (COVID-19)."" Paris Blockchain Week Summit, initially scheduled March 31- April 1, was also postponed.600 people attended the CryptoCompare Digital Asset Summit, which is down some 40% as overseas visitors stayed away, Charles Hayter, CEO of CryptoCompare, told Cryptonews.com.

Big sporting events such as rugby and football matches with some 80,000 attendees, large conferences such as Crufts with 160,000 attendees, as well as many smaller conferences in the UK were still going ahead, the CEO said.

","Due to a recent crypto market crash, Ethereum (ETH) locked in DeFi (decentralized finance) is on the rise, while industry players are fixing the flash loan manipulation problem and MakerDAO raises the governance delay.","In early February, total value locked (TVL) in DeFi surpassed USD 1 billion. It fell back and now, a month later, stands at USD 920.5 million, according to DeFi Pulse. It has been dropping to this value since March 7, when the TLV recorded was USD 1.032 billionETH locked in DeFi has been rising in that same period. After an 8% drop between February 10 and February 22, there was a gradual rise, followed by a 4.7% jump, from c. ETH 2.8 million on March 7 to more than ETH 3 million today, before moving below this threshold again. ""ETH price going down: people need to put more ETH in as collateral, collateral counts for less TVL in USD,"" Martin Köppelmann, CEO and Co-Founder of a prediction market platform built as a decentralized application (dapp), Gnosis, told Cryptonews.com.Meanwhile, Mariano Conti, Head of Smart Contracts at the Maker Foundation, added that ""at least from the Maker side, it's normal when ETH drops in price for people to either lock up more ETH in their vaults or pay off their debt, because when the price drops they're closer to liquidation,"" he said, adding: ""Still with the price drop TVL can still be down.""The market itself has turned green today. However, ETH is the worst performer among the top 10 coins by market capitalization. At pixel time (14:00 UTC), it trades at c. USD 203 and is up 0.5% in a day, while other top coins surged 2%-4% and tezos (XTZ) rallied 11%. Ethereum seems to be discovering many new things in this young industry, including its own vulnerabilities.We've lately seen instances of flash loan exploits whereby, as explained, a proficient trader exploit a weakness in this system that allows borrowing funds without any collateral, but with paying the loan back within a single transaction (a single block). In an attempt to put a stop to flash loan manipulations, a DeFi platform based on Ethereum, bZx, has integrated with Chainlink's decentralized oracle networks. Their announcement explains that, utilizing these decentralized oracle solution, ""each critical price feed of bZx is secured by numerous independent nodes, which collectively source data from over seven independent data aggregators."" Therefore, the price oracles gain larger exposure to market-wide price discovery from top liquidity sources, says bZx, creating stronger security barriers, while both the amount of capital and multi-party coordination needed for an attack are ""greatly"" increased as well.As reported, bZx was attacked in mid-February, when the company stated that this wasn't an oracle attack (an oracle is a path via which a blockchain or smart contract interact with external data), but an exploit of a bug in bZx's flash loans. Furthermore, they said at the time that they were working on ""implementing Chainlink oracles as a supplement to the Kyber price feed to provide time-weighted information on price data"" and ensuring that Chainlink doesn't become a central point of failure in their oracle model. Soon after this, another attack occurred, which bZx confirmed was an oracle manipulation attack and a modified version of the original exploit.In their latest report detailing the vulnerabilities found, attacks, and solutions, bZx claims that the user funds are safe, despite funds having been lost, because ""the company and the protocol stakeholders are absorbing the losses."" They add: ""In total, the principal owed by the attackers’ two overcollateralized loans is 11497.292543653558548193 ETH. Currently, there is 6,095.57 ETH that can be used to finance the interest payments on the principal, delaying realization of the default by the insurance fund."" In the next phase of their plan, bZx will supplement the Chainlink price feeds with Band Protocol.Meanwhile, a potential major loophole in MakerDAO, the Ethereum-based decentralized finance platform, which leaves it vulnerable for an attack, had been exposed last December, prompting the Maker Foundation to respond. They had moved along with the introduction of the Governance Security Module (GSM) into the core protocol and had added a poll to the governance portal for the community to include the GSM in the Executive vote. The point of GSM is to allow MKR token holders to review changes meant to go into the system, and the proposal to raise the governance delay from 0 to 24-hour delay would give more time to the token holders to respond to potential attacks.The results of the poll were 95.71% for the inclusion, 4.29% against, among 57 unique voters (5.15% participation),  but even though the poll to raise the delay had passed, the executive vote hadn't. ""Could have been because of the Holidays,"" said Conti, ""or the fact that once the community was better informed as to why we hadn't launched with a delay, they decided against voting it in that quickly."" However, it was submitted again on February 21, when it did pass. ""So there's is now a 24-hour Governance Delay,"" concluded Conti."

",Chinese authorities state that industry 4.0 technologies such as blockchain technology have helped almost 72% of the nation’s small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) return to work in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.,"Per Chinese state news networks the People’s Daily and the Beijing Youth Daily (via East Money), spokespeople from the country’s health authorities, as well as the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, confirmed that 71.7% of SMEs were now up and running.The spokespeople stated that blockchain technology and other industry 4.0 advances such as Big Data, 5G and AI had helped speed up business recovery platforms, and were also playing a part in efforts to control the spread of the virus – helping to power virus diagnosis, prevention and treatment. These innovations were also being used as part of efforts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, they added.Blockchain and other IT advances, said the authorities, were helping companies operate unmanned production facilities, including those related to medical care.A range of next-generation IT solutions is also helping teachers provide online education to quarantined or locked-down children.Furthermore, blockchain solutions may be used to help the country’s police and army check the veracity of travel documentations as lockdowns continue to remain in place. Chinese stakeholders have also explored the use of blockchain technology in remote working platforms for companies adopting work-from-home policies.As previously reported, Chinese public and private sector entities have rolled out a number of blockchain-powered solutions aimed at easing the economic fallout of the pandemic – particularly for SMEs.The UN has recently singled out Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial’s blockchain-powered loans platform for SMEs for praise.China’s SMEs generate 70% of the Middle Kingdom’s total GDP, and account for 80% of its export revenue."

","The coronavirus pandemic has disrupted China’s economy, but not its digital currency plans. And amid reports that the country is nearing a major breakthrough in its plans to launch a digital fiat, one of the project’s key figures is urging caution lest American rivals steal a march on the Middle Kingdom.","In a research paper published by media outlet STCN, the central People’s Bank of China (PBoC) Financial Research Institute’s principal researcher Zou Pingzuo warned that the Chinese economic plans could face a number of hurdles – including possible complications from overseas.He wrote,“If the United States Federal Reserve were to decide to work with Facebook and co-launch a digital currency pegged to the dollar that could also facilitate cross-border transactions […] this type of financial intrusion could be fatal.”He went on to postulate that a digital dollar – or a successful Facebook Libra launch that somehow replaced the dollar – would see American currencies “rule the world for another 100 years.”China should be prepared to fend off such risks, he added.Zou opined that a digital currency must be “human value-oriented” if it were to be successful, and noted that simply launching a digital fiat would not necessarily put an end to the use of cash, as a token could only hope to “partially replace” conventional fiat.Elsewhere, the central bank is reportedly close to completing its development work on the forthcoming digital fiat, which it has named the Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) system.Unnamed sources told Chinese state-run news outlet Global Times that the tech work on the project is now complete, and that the bank is now in the process of drafting legislation and working with financial regulators in preparation for an official launch.The same media outlet quotes Cao Yan, the managing director of the Digital Renaissance Foundation, as stating that global stock markets have been extremely volatile during the coronavirus pandemic. He opined that China should respond by accelerating its digital fiat launch.A digital currency would be a more efficient tool for executing monetary policy than conventional currencies, he added.Central banks around the world are racing to roll out digital currencies. China hopes to emerge victorious.The private sector is also hoping to play a part. Companies like mobile payment giant and Alibaba affiliate Alipay have been offering support for the government's grand plan. The company has announced that it has registered five DCEP-related patents in the past three months.Early this month, experts at China’s National Development and Reform Commission suggested that the central bank may ramp up its DCEP efforts after the outbreak subsides, as it may become the focus of a giant stimulus package to offset the economic downturn.Rolling out the DCEP network as part of a “special fund” would allow the government to “retain full control of its flow and distribution,” the experts stated."

",US-based Chase Bank has settled an agreement with a class of customers who claim the bank billed their credit card cryptocurrency transactions by classifying them as expensive cash advances without prior warning.,"Chase’s customers Brady Tucker, Ryan Hilton, and Stanton Smith accused the bank of breaching the cardholder agreements with them and other customers by changing the way it billed purchases of cryptocurrency without notice. In January 2018, the bank allegedly decided to change the way it classified such transactions and started to treat them as cash advances which are subject to additional fees and interest. Shortly after, Chase moved to block such transactions altogether.A joint letter filed by counsel for Chase on March 10 indicates the parties expect to present Judge Katherine Failla of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York with a finalized settlement agreement along with related preliminary approval papers within a period of 60 to 75 days, reports Law360. “I write jointly with counsel for plaintiffs to notify the court that the parties have reached a settlement in principle on a classwide basis,” according to the letter. “The parties are working in good faith to finalize the settlement agreement, preliminary approval papers, and supporting documents.”The details of the settlement were not disclosed, and counsels for both parties have not released any comments.Tucker filed suit against Chase in April 2018. Following the bank’s petition for dismissal three months later, the customer filed an amended complaint with two additional plaintiffs, Hilton and Smith, who had similar experiences with their credit cards. Chase’s policy was part of a larger trend at that time, with a number of banks in the US and the UK reportedly halting transactions with known crypto dealers. Chase has claimed the decision did not represent a breach of contract with the complainants, arguing that crypto transactions are categorized as “cash-like transactions” that are billed as cash advances in line with the customer agreements. Despite these claims, Judge Failla decided last August the three plaintiffs have offered a credible alternative way to interpret the agreements' language. Due to this, it could be understood the term “cash-like” solely concerned those financial instruments that are formally related to specific amounts of fiat currency, including traveler's checks and money orders, the judge said.Chase is JPMorgan Chase & Co's consumer and commercial banking business, with some 4,900 branches across the US."

","Chinese President Xi Jinping has voiced fresh support for blockchain technology, praising its ability to aid efforts to fight the spread of the coronavirus epidemic that has infected almost 81,000 Middle Kingdom citizens.","Xi’s first announced his support of blockchain technology in October last year, spurring a series of government initiatives and private business operations – and leading to a surge in bitcoin (BTC) prices.In an article published in the Communist Party’s Study Times journal on Wednesday entitled “How to use technology innovation to support public opinion,” Xi opined that blockchain and other industry 4.0 innovations should be integrated with governance efforts.Xi wrote that emerging technology like blockchain could help government officials in a myriad of ways, particularly in the fight against the coronavirus.Digital technology, he stated, should be used to “gauge the state of societal affairs” and “ensure smooth communication,” as well as “assisting policy implementation.”In some regions, real-time data monitoring and tracking have already been implemented to “ensure the safety of personnel, communities, streets and urban districts.”Xi also suggests that real-time data sharing and monitoring were crucial in helping the government dispel “inappropriate and fake information.”He wrote,“Information technology proves to be effective in changing and reshaping crowds’ knowledge, thoughts and lifestyles – and even wider societal development.”Critics state that blockchain and other industry 4.0 advances could be used by the Chinese government as tools that allow the state to boost its surveillance and censorship capabilities.China has ramped up its controversial Orwellian-style surveillance and online censorship practices in the wake of the outbreak.Dissent and anger, however, have been brewing among some web users in the country, with defiant netizens keen to spread uncensored messages – and using a number of creative ways to avoid censorship efforts.Buzzfeed reports that messages from whistleblowing medics have even been translated into Klingon, a fictional language used in the sci-fi TV series Star Trek, in a bid to avoid censorship on chat app platforms like WeChat."

Privacy allows people to decide what kind of society we want to live in. Whether we like it or not, the constant collection of data about everything we do - like that done by Amazon, Google, Microsoft and a growing number of other companies - shapes and produces our actions. We're different people when we're under surveillance than when we're enjoying a certain amount of privacy.

At pixel time (11:10 UTC), it trades at c. USD 0.196 and is up around 3% since the mainnet went live yesterday. However, in the past 24 hours, it's still down 1%, while majority of other coins from the top 30 dropped 2%-4%.As reported, while the mainnet was down, MIOTA was still trading. MIOTA price chart:As reported, the Coordinator, the node run by the Foundation for network protection and transaction confirmation, had been shut off to prevent further attacks, after it was discovered that somebody's had compromised the Trinity Desktop wallets. Prior to switching the Coordinator back on, the Foundation had launched their seed migration tool, which they said is a piece of software for MacOS, Windows and Linux that automatically migrates IOTA Tokens, by creating a regular IOTA transaction, from potentially compromised seeds onto a new, unaffected seed.

","The crypto market crashed, and the total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi) is not here for it. Nonetheless, it bounced back.","TVL crashed 62% today, from USD 649.497 million to USD 244.398 million, before recuperating to where it currently (UTC: 10:24) stands: USD 641.6 million, according to DeFi Pulse. Nonetheless, this is a far cry from its recent glory days. TVL hit a milestone of USD 1 billion on February 7 this year, going as high as USD 1.235 billion eight days later. It stayed between that number and USD 900 million all the way until March 9, when it fell to USD 873.606 million. After shortly staying in the USD 800 - USD 950 million range, this recent crash happened.But that's not all the turbulence DeFi is experiencing today. After stagnating at c. ETH 2.8 million locked in DeFi for the most part of the last thirty days, this value crashed as well today: a whopping 77%, from ETH 3.03 million to just ETH 686,338. It bounced back since, currently standing at 3 million ETH.While BTC locked in DeFi has had a much more gradual decline and only a 0.84% drop in three days, DAI locked in DeFi crashed with USD and ETH, in its case 89%, before recuperating swiftly, now standing at DAI 61.1 million.The sudden and massive drop in the price of ETH has had a major impact on applications built on Ethereum. Given its prevailing dominance, MakerDao, a decentralized lending facility built on the Ethereum blockchain and the creator of DAI, is the largest of such applications, and even it is facing trouble in the light of this price drop. Besides the dramatic price drop, a Maker oracle couldn't catch up to provide accurate prices, plus there was a rapid increase in gas prices and devaluation of collateral, as MakerDao's blog post says. Now the foundation and the community are discussing what to do next. Even an emergency shutdown was suggested, but it seems that it's ""not being considered as an immediate option."" However, the community has been invited to vote today, so to adjust the parameters in case the situation repeats itself. There are several options to vote on, as stated in the blog post, and these include: lowering the DAI savings rate, setting SAI (Single-Collateral Dai) stability fee, giving more time for liquidation auctions, and setting a governance delay module. Furthermore, Compound, a protocol for algorithmic money markets on the Ethereum blockchain, has announced changes meant to combat the volatility, which will be activated only if necessary: Meanwhile, the founder of crypto lender BlockFi, Zac Prince, stated that ""in extremely volatile markets, we generally see heightened activity across our product suite (trading, USD loans, crypto lending, and interest accounts),"" adding that all their systems and product continue to operate normally, despite the Covid-19 outbreak and the market crash. 6/ This week and, specifically today, is no different and we continue to provide liquidity to the market - but in larger volumes. All of our products and systems continue to operate as normal.Blockchain consultant Maya Zehavi, however, listed what she says are four known risks in DeFi that appeared in the markets at the same time, discussing the potential future of DeFi projects:Others will harden their model with the new macro environment and build out safer fianncial primitivesMeanwhile, Opendime and ColdCard founder Rodolfo Novak (aka @NVK) commented that bitcoin-backed loans (borrowing money with bitcoin as collateral) are liquidated, adding that loans and credit are a ""fantastic tool for efficient capital allocation,"" but that ""people need to know how to use them properly."" Replying to a comment by Francis Pouliot, CEO of BullBitcoin and founder of Cyphernode, that this is not a good thing as ""Lots of people were using this as a conservative long-term 2x long on bitcoin to avoid having I just got fucked,"" Novak argued that ""There is no good and bad, just the market,"" and that people ""will change strategies on the next go-round.""Too many Bitcoin backed loans, when you take them at 50% LTV, if they bitcoin price drops bellow half you have to top up or you get margin called.

","How the Cryptoverse faces bad news? Head on and with what I imagine is a maniacal laugh. If one thing this community doesn't ever have enough of, even in the darkest of days - especially in the darkest of days - is jokes. And it's never too soon for one. Or many.","The crypto community has faced numerous correlated issues, one at a time, each delivering a major blow to the market. There's the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, and then the market  crashed super hard. Meanwhile, to ease the impact the virus has had on the economy, the governments are delivering quite a few solutions, which the Cryptoverse finds amusing to say the least - such as, simply printing more money! The U.S. Federal Reserve System (Fed) has been a particularly interesting subject of crypto community's both criticism and jokes after it said it would increase liquidity by injecting USD 1.5 trillion (initially) into the economy. Still, the community has used these blows to their advantage, to face the potential economic crises that may be caused by trillions of USD being printed, but also to point out the major fault in the system that can produce as much money as it wants and when it wants. Here are three ways the Cryptoverse reacted to this.It do go, indeed. But have you ever stopped to think how many Rs in BR it could be? If not, you're not taking this whole crisis seriously at all. Head on to brrr.money and check out the Fed hard at work printing them bills. Play with the slider, and make the man print the money as fast as you like. That's not all: you also get to switch between three charts and most popular indices, by clicking on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the Dow), SPY, or gold spot/USD price chart. The same folks who brought us the printing Fed man, possibly the guys over at 4chan, also offer you a chance to apply for the position of Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Don't worry, you are qualified as long as you can provide your insider trading, embezzlement, bribery, and tax evasion amounts.  Have you been carefully following the price of bitcoin jumping up and down like mad, but it just doesn't excite you anymore? Have you grown numb to green and red candles? We've got a solution for you: a visual representation of Bitcoin's current price in a battle format, where on the left-hand side, you can see buy orders, while on the right-hand side, as you might have imagined, sell orders.

","South Korea’s landmark Special Financial Transactions Information Act amendment was promulgated earlier this week, a fortnight after the country’s parliament voted unanimously in its favor.","Although many industry players have been galvanized by it, others have warned that its stipulations – which will include stringent regulation of crypto exchanges – could force “mass closure” for many of the country’s small and medium-sized trading platforms.The key to compliance will be meeting real-name banking requirements, a stringent set of already-extant guidelines set and upheld by major South Korean banks. Those guidelines will become law on March 17, 2021.Currently, the only exchanges that adhere to the full set of anti-money laundering (AML), Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and information security management system (ISMS) protocols that banks require as part of their crypto exchange compliance measures are the so-called “big four” – namely Upbit, Bithumb, Korbit and Coinone.Backed in many cases by major businesses and serious investors, the big four have been toeing the line on real-name banking since early 2018, so they are unlikely to experience difficulties keeping up to speed.But for chasing-pack exchanges, the race against time is now on, be they domestic players or branches of overseas giants. Non-compliant exchanges will be given an additional grace period of six months to fall into line. But after that, the regulator will have the power to close exchanges down, as is the case in countries such as Japan.Per Maeil Kyungjae, this group – which comprises the likes of Gopax and Hanbitco from South Korea, and OKCoin and Huobi from overseas – is now preparing to meet the new challenges.The media outlet reports that Gopax, which has already obtained ISMS certification, has built up a team of some 28 AML specialists, and is working on beefing up its suspicious transaction reporting (STR) and abnormal financial transaction detection system (FDS) networks.The company’s CEO is quoted as stating,“Security and compliance are top priorities.”Hanbitco, which also meets ISMS certification requirements, has an existing three-person AML team, but says it is now speaking to blockchain security companies about the possibility of collaborating on building up a watertight compliance network.Huobi Korea, which has a four-person AML team, says it is also prioritizing compliance and working toward ISMS certification but has had to pause its progress on this front due to the coronavirus pandemic.OKCoin Korea, meanwhile, has stated this week that it will suspend its shared customer banking operations as it readies its transition into real-name banking. The company also has four dedicated AML staff members."

","The Hive blockchain, a hard fork of the Steem (STEEM) blockchain, has officially launched last Friday, as the new home for the Steem community, while the new coin has been listed by two exchanges so far. However, it's yet to be seen if this will put a full stop on the Steem - Justin Sun battle.","As the Twitter account Hive.io announced on March 20, the Hive Blockchain is officially live, stating in a blog post that the ""launch went incredibly smoothly given the pressure and effort involved in getting a hardfork ready in such a tight window."" The blog post added that another hard fork will be needed to upgrade Hive.  The Hive Blockchain is live!- First Blocks and Transactions have been produced. - API nodes are coming upWe are monitoring the chain to ensure everything is perfectly operational.Please be patient while things normalize.#hiveisalive https://t.co/oY7kVlyRJMAs promised, the new HIVE coin is already listed on two exchanges. Just a day after the launch, HIVE has been listed on Bittrex, while today the platform announced ProBit listing the coin as well. Additionally, Ionomy has full, limited-time, fee-free trading enabled, Hive says, while other exchanges that are planning on listing Hive are currently working on bringing their trading pairs online.Furthermore, crypto exchange Binance has partnered with HIVE in the drop, says Hive, and the exchange said they would be ""transferring HIVE to their customers once the were complete with their updates."" There are six more exchanges working on the airdrops, and some of them will also be listing the coin. Another post lists the exchanges supporting the hard fork and airdrop (in addition to other useful links), also naming Huobi, Bithumb, Upbit, KuCoin, GoPax, and the Binance-acquired India-based exchange WazirX.At pixel time (10:27 UTC), Steem, ranked 63 by market capitalization, trades at c. USD 0.185 and is down 13% in a day, trimming its weekly gains to 61%. The price is down 13% in a month. HIVE trades at c. USD 0.192 and is up 10.5% in a day.HIVE price chart:Binance announced that it supported the Steem hard fork by the Hive team and will distribute the new HIVE token to users holding STEEM. However, ""supporting this hard fork does not guarantee the listing of HIVE,"" the exchange said, adding that the coin will go through their usual listing review process. As a reminder, Binance was one of the exchanges, along with Huobi and Poloniex, that were previously implicated in the voting war initiated by Tron's Justin Sun, who acquired Steemit in February. That acquisition led to the hard fork, as the Steem community had gotten worried that Sun would use a large pile of Steem tokens controlled by Steemit Inc, called the ""ninja-mined stake,"" to control the Steem blockchain - a fear they felt was further confirmed by the alleged censoring of Hive-related content. This pile wasn't moved to Hive - therefore, Sun has no influence over the new blockchain.Meanwhile, Hive has created a blacklist of their own. Per the Hive launch announcement, ""the only accounts who will not be included in the initial airdrop are those containing the Steemit Inc ninja-mined stake, and those who actively contributed to (and publicly declared support for) the centralization of the Steem Blockchain,"" though these can take part in the new chain. The so-called ""HIVE AirDrop Exclusion List"" includes Steemit accounts, ""Tron puppets,"" and others, stating that their ""steem is treated the same"" nonetheless. Users have been testing the new blockchain from the moment of its launch, reporting successful and working elements, as well as issues they're facing, with Hive assuring them that they are working out the kinks. ""API’s are still coming up and we have high traffic, sites should regulate shortly,"" they said on Twitter. ""Hive came alive, slowly worked through the operations that needed to done, produced first blocks and transactions, and has been moving steadily ever since. No stalls or crashes, fast blocktimes, all good,"" the blog post says.All Steem account holders automatically got an account on Hive, under the same name, whereby each can choose which account to use, or use both. Either way, from the point of launch, as reported earlier, the accounts are independent from each other. We have contacted the Tron Foundation for comment and will update should they reply."

""I want to emphasize that no individual inside the organization is at fault for this, and that I have never been more proud of the team we have built than now,"" said the Co-founder. The hacker attacked MoonPay's infrastructure, exploiting a vulnerability that was created due to the way this payment processor was integrated into the Iota wallet, he explained.Given that the users who've used Trinity from December 17, 2019 to February 17, 2020 might be at risk, the Foundation had launched their seed migration tool - a piece of software for MacOS, Windows and Linux that automatically migrates IOTA Tokens from potentially compromised seeds onto a new, unaffected seed. The migration ended on March 7.The status page shows that the mainnet is still down, but states it'll be relaunched on February 10, which Sønstebø confirmed as well.The incident ""has been a powerful reminder to never compromise on security under any circumstances,"" said the founder. ""In retrospect, we should have done a lot more due-diligence and had stricter auditing procedures in place, and simply more patience."" As for the attacker, the founder hopes that they will be held accountable one day and that the stolen funds will be recovered. ""The chances are low, but we did it once before,"" he says. As reported, in January 2019, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) arrested a man in Oxford, UK, on suspicion of stealing around USD 11.4 million worth of IOTA from a total of 85 people in 2018.At pixel time (10:38 UTC), MIOTA trades at c. USD 0.19 and is down by 10% in a day and 12% in a week.

","Ethereum 2.0 (ETH 2.0) (aka Serenity) has left its auditors satisfied, though critical issues have been pointed out.","Working with the Ethereum 2.0 team, security consultant Least Authority reviewed Ethereum's network update to Proof of Stake (PoS) from Proof of Work (PoW), specifically its upcoming initial phase - Phase 0: Beacon Chain. Eth2 phase 0 spec audit is back!Now onto multi-client testnet and bug bounty according to Danny. Eth2 feels close. https://t.co/oktXYBxGcRIn their report, the auditor described the specifications as ""well thought out and comprehensive,"" adding that it's ""clear that security was strongly considered by the Ethereum 2.0 team during the design phase.""Two important things had to be considered: 1) there's no other large-scale implementations of a PoS system and its real-life use to compare this one with; 2) the audit consisted of reviewing a specification as opposed to a coded implementation. Therefore, the attack vectors they identified ""were necessarily based on certain assumptions and theory,"" said the team, meaning that there may be some difference between the model and implementation in practice, and specifically for ETH 2.0. That said, given that it's critical to lay a strong foundation for a network, Least Authority found two areas with vulnerabilities that may make them potential attack vectors, saying that these would benefit from further review and additional documentation: Block Proposer Election System and the Peer-to-peer (P2P) networking layer.Meanwhile, the Ethereum team had an Into the Ether livestream hangout: Quarantine Edition, yesterday. As specifications for Phase 1 are already being worked on, Prysmatic Labs  Co-founder and Ethereum Protocol Developer, Preston Van Loon, said that there's no reason to wait for Phase 0 to be fully done before starting the work on other phases, and that they are being developed simultaneously. That's why these phases are ""kind of like an incremental add-on"" so he expects Phases 1 and 2 to roll out faster than Phase 0.At pixel time (13:19 UTC), ETH trades at c.

","South Korean crypto exchanges are cooperating with the police investigation into the Telegram “Nth room” sexual exploitation case, with brokerages now being searched, and exchange data seized and hundreds of thousands of crypto-fiat gateway records checked.","Per a number of South Korean media outlets, including Yonhap and KBS, as well as Newsis and Nocut News, police now believe they have identified 260,000 wallets, whose holders sent funds to Cho Joo-bin, the man suspected to be the mastermind behind the Telegram room.Cho is believed to have operated a number of Telegram chat rooms, charging “membership fees” for access, payable exclusively in cryptocurrency. “Members” paying around USD 1,222 worth of tokens were allowed to access graphic and brutal rape and torture videos. Police say that 74 women were featured in the videos, including over a dozen minors.Police believe that the country’s banking guidelines for exchanges have already helped them identify thousands of people who paid to watch the video. The guidelines, issued by the government in 2018, require exchanges to use real-name (non-anonymous) wallets linked to social security number–verified bank accounts.All four of the country’s biggest exchanges – Korbit, Coinone, Bithumb and Upbit – currently adhere to these as-yet-unbinding guidelines. However, a recent legal change will see the guidelines become compulsory as of March 2021.The police and the government have both found themselves under enormous pressure to make the list of subscribers to the Nth room public – a move that would be unprecedented both for the criminal justice system and the cryptocurrency industry.At least one police officer is thought to have been among the list of subscribers to the chat room, which is believed to have begun operating since 2018.Exchanges are thought to be complying fully with the investigation, despite the fact that they have been asked to hand over confidential data on thousands of their customers.Nocut says that police have seized data at exchanges Bithumb, Upbit and Coinone, and states that brokerage agencies Bestcoin and BitProxy have also been asked to release information on their clients.Cho is believed to have collected payment in a range of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH).A number of chat room subscribers appear to have attempted to cover their tracks by using privacy coins such as monero (XMR). However, police say they are confident of tracking down monero purchase orders as they attempt to unveil the identity of subscribers who chose to pay in privacy coins."

",A trust-gauging non-profitable organization says it has found that cryptocurrency-related scams are the second riskiest type of fraud in North America – second only to employment-related stings.,"Per a report from the Better Business Bureau (BBB), an organization that says it provides information to Americans and Canadians about the trustworthiness – or otherwise – of businesses and charities, successful crypto scams dupe victims out of an average of USD 3,000 in 2019.However, it appears that either most crypto scam cases go unreported or most North Americans are too wise to fall for them. While the BBB reported 9,050 instances of fraudulent online shopping site scams in 2019, there were only 273 crypto-related scams reported in the same time period.That said, when North Americans do fall for crypto scams, they seem to fall for them hard. The average amount lost per scam was USD 3,000 – a figure that tied at the top spot with the murky world of online “romance”-related fraud.This represents a very big climb from last year’s report, which featured crypto scams for the first time – with victims losing an average of USD 900.Most successful crypto scams involved fraudsters contacting their victims via email.The BBB added that almost a third of crypto scams involved buying tokens crypto, with less than a quarter presenting victims with bogus crypto investment opportunities.And no less than 31% of all crypto scams reported were tied to the Chinese cryptocurrency exchange C2CX.__Jose from Arizona shared his experience with a crypto scam:""I was scrolling my Instagram when a person named Elizabeth sent me a private message about cryptocurrency trading. I was desperate at that time and she got me interested because of the earnings. She [said she would] manage my account [and] do all the trading. She sent me the wallet address through WhatsApp, and from there I would go to a bitcoin ATM. To do the deposit initially I started at USD 100, then later boosted it to USD 150, and created a password and username on Fastcoinbitsoptions.com. I would deposit money to her bitcoin account and watch the money increase. The problem is I trusted her and that’s the lesson I’ve learned. They always say to “trust me.” After about two months I asked to withdraw the funds, and was shown a bank site, which looked fake. They told me I needed to pay USD 500 to the bank for a code to withdraw the USD 25,000 I had in my account. In total I lost about USD 1,200 – I was so frustrated. My advice is to talk to someone or a friend before making any [financial] decisions, especially during a desperate time. It was my mistake to keep this to myself.""

","Instant messaging giant Telegram and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have just finished another round in their court fight, with the judge declaring the SEC the winner. Meanwhile, Kik continued its battle against the SEC, denying the accusations the regulator raised against it.","Both cases could offer a glimpse into the future of how cryptoassets are regulated, at least in the U.S. A tightening of regulatory control over tokens could make for major changes in the industry.U.S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel, of the Southern District of New York, said on Tuesday that the regulator has proven the likelihood of Telegram's digital tokens, Grams, being sold as unregistered securities.To be more precise, Castel concluded in his 44-page opinion and order that “[t]he Court finds that the SEC has shown a substantial likelihood of success in proving that the contracts and understandings at issue, including the sale of 2.9 billion Grams to 175 purchasers in exchange for [USD] 1.7 billion, are part of a larger scheme to distribute those Grams into a secondary public market, which would be supported by Telegram’s ongoing efforts.” As a short recap of the case so far, Telegram had to push back the launch of its much-anticipated TON network and its digital token Gram, as the regulator issued an injunction against the company in October 2019. The app provider argues that its Gram token sale should be allowed to move forward, while the SEC is working hard to further block its USD 1.7 billion project. On its part, the Commission argues that Gram is a security and should be regulated like any other stock, bond, or similarly traded asset, and it charges Telegram with violating investor protection laws.The judge says that, ""considering the economic realities under the Howey test, the Court finds that, in the context of that scheme, the resale of Grams into the secondary public market would be an integral part of the sale of securities without a required registration statement."" This means that the token issuance would be violating the U.S. securities laws.The judge further stated that the company knew that ""reasonable purchasers"" wouldn't want to pay USD 1.7 billion to get Grams tokens just as a means of storing or transferring value. ""Instead,"" writes Castel, ""Telegram developed a scheme to maximize the amount initial purchasers would be willing to pay Telegram by creating a structure to allow these purchasers to maximize the value they receive upon resale in the public markets.""Telegram stated previously that it would not be in control over the new TON blockchain and would step back, which the judge doesn't seem to believe would happen. The Court finds that there's an implicit, even if formally disclaimed intention by Telegram ""to remain committed to the success of the TON Blockchain post-launch. Indeed, Telegram, as a matter of fact rather than legal obligation, will be the guiding force"" behind the blockchain ""while the 175 purchasers unload their Grams into the secondary market. As such, the initial 175 purchasers possess a reasonable expectation of profit based upon the efforts of Telegram because these purchasers expect to reap whopping gains from the resale of Grams in the immediate post-launch period,"" Castel writes.All this said, the Court finds that there's ""a near-certain risk of a future harm, namely the completion of a public distribution of a security without a registration statement."" Therefore, an injunction that prohibits the delivery of Grams to the Initial Purchasers and thereby preventing the ""culmination of this ongoing violation, is appropriate and will be granted."" It's important to note that it is a preliminary injunction, not a final judgement.Lawyers weigh in:Our courts continue to function.Not only that, if the injunction winds up being upheld, my blog also got the ""mere conduits for wider distribution""… https://t.co/zXLnjhVQgiMeanwhile, Kik Interactive filed a motion for summary judgement in the case the SEC brought against it. As reported, in September 2019, the operator of KIN coin decided to shut down its Kik messaging app over the regulatory pressure. In January that year, their battle with the SEC started, with the regulator claiming that Kik's USD 100-million ICO could be seen as unregistered securities.Kik argues that the SEC ""fails to meet two of Howey’s three requirements: common enterprise and expectation of profits based of the essential managerial efforts of others."" This proves, the company says, that its sale of KIN during the token distribution event wasn't an investment contract and that the tokens don't have ""the essential properties of a debt or equity security,"" which further means that there was no securities violation. Furthermore, says Kik, KIN was ""a medium of exchange to be used in a new digital economy, not as an investment opportunity,"" and that profit was not guaranteed to the buyers - not the price or the liquidity on the secondary market exchanges.The SEC ""seeks to stretch the definition of a “security” under the federal securities laws far beyond the plain language of"" the Securities Act, asking the Court "" to bless an unprecedented and dramatic expansion of the SEC’s regulatory authority,"" writes Kik, adding that, therefore, the Court ""should decline the SEC’s invitation to ignore well established governing law."""

",An important spreadsheet has been making its way through the Cryptoverse - that of an Ethereum conference attendees who have tested positive for coronavirus - potentially as a warning to others.,"Popular Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) took place from March 3 until March 5 this year in Paris, with some 600 people attending it, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and ConsenSys founder (also an Ethereum co-founder) Joe Lubin. However, a list has been created and is being updated by ETH 2.0 researcher Justin Drake of attendees who have allegedly voluntarily provided the information of their Covid-19 test status. Three days ago when he just tweeted about this, Drake commented: ""At least 7 EthCC attendees COVID-19 positive (see spreadsheet). Others sick and not tested,"" calling people to contribute with more information. The spreadsheet provides the following information at the moment:Meanwhile, as the reports of attendees getting sick keep rolling in, many people, such as ConsenSys Labs investor Min Teo, say that all who were present at the conference, regardless of symptoms, should self-quarantine, particularly in the cases such is the UK, where the National Health Service (NHS) will refuse to test, she claims.A few days ago, Buterin tweeted that he has no symptoms and that he'll report should there be a change. Many others have not been so fortunate. Some who reported that they've been infected include a Gnosis staffer Marco Correia, ConsenSys' Business Development Lead Brianna Montgommery, analyst and Ethereum France co-founder Marc Zeller, German software engineer Afri Schoedon, author of the ERC-777 token standard Jacques Dafflon, and others. As for those whose tests were denied, many across the globe are complaining that there aren't enough tests for everybody in their countries, so only some cases which the authorities deem should be tested are in fact tested. Pascal from the Netherlands said in the comments on the spreadsheet that the country ""requires fever before testing, even having had contact with known cases."" NHS, for example, advises people to stay at home if they have symptoms of coronavirus and that testing for such cases is not needed.They denied testing me. Since my only current symptom is cough, they told me to go home and don't come near the hospital.This list definitely serves as a warning, but of what kind? It can help those who have attended this specific event to realize they might've contracted the disease just by being there or being in any physical contact with an attendee, given how infectious this virus is. Additionally, it may also encourage the attendees of similar events to get tested or take additional precautions and pay more attention to any symptoms they may be experiencing. Finally, following a number of these events being held despite the potential danger, this spreadsheet can be considered as a step in the right direction, as few would disagree that these conferences should be postponed or cancelled for the time being, as hundreds of people travelling and converging to a single spot in the time of a pandemic is simply too risky.Many, however, are wondering why these events hadn't been cancelled in the first place. Not only did Buterin and Lubin not warn against holding these events, but have actually attended them. Granted, the duo is not in charge of these conferences, but they are Ethereum conferences after all, and their word against them at this hour certainly carries such weight that might've put some pressure on the organizers. That said, this is in the realm of speculations.What is a fact is that this year’s Ethereal Summit New York will be held virtually on May 7-8 as 'the first-ever Ethereal Virtual Summit 2020,"" while the in-person event is postponed until fall 2020.Other people in the comments on the spreadsheet are issuing a different type of a warning: that the information provided on the list and people's identities to intentionally mislead about who was tested and why, that the tests were denied by the people on the list, and ""also using their names to try to attack their position in the community,"" writes Vincent Kersuzan, arguing that the spreadsheet should perhaps be made private or the names anonymous. Commenters, such as Privacy Strategist at Microsoft Bethan Cantrell, have also argued that people's names shouldn't be shared, while the user RJ Boogie claims that a person's name has been included against their will.It’s public self-reporting (mostly via Twitter; see “Source” column). This instinctive and dutiful radical transparency may change behaviours and save lives. I guess Ethereum blockchain culture approaches things differently to Microsoft corporate culture.__I’m for privacy / anonymity but people created that list because they wanted to prevent others from not knowing if they came into contact with peers who may have COVID19.Now is not the time to hide if you accidentally spread the virus to someone at a large gathering.People are also worried about other conferences as well, as many more people, and many of these who attended EthCC, attended other events as well where they might've gotten infected. For example, Montgomery stated she attended ETHLondonUK, which was held from February 28 to March 1.As reported almost a week ago, Zhen Ju Yong (Zen), CEO and Co-Founder of Singapore-based distributed private key management solution, Torus Labs, had said he has been diagnosed with Covid-19 virus, subsequently staying at an isolated ward in a hospital. He had warned other attendees to either get tested or be extra careful. The CEO hasn't posted any updates on Twitter since March 11.EthCC has been warning the attendees since March 11 that one of them has been hospitalised. When we first reported on this, we had contacted both EthCC and ETHLondonUK, and again today, but haven't heard from them yet. Meanwhile, there are currently 186,975 people in the world infected by Covid-19. 80,842 have recovered and 7,477 have unfortunately died."

","What seemed like science fiction a few short weeks ago is now very real. Movies such as Outbreak, Contagion and Virus are looking more like documentaries every day. As we battle COVID-19, a major issue that will only increase is disruption to supply chains. ","This disruption has been as devastating as it has been swift. There is unprecedented demand for some products (hand sanitiser has never been so popular), just as production of other products grinds to a halt due to lack of parts.Our research concerns managing supply chains in a crisis and using technologies such as Artificial Intelligence , 3D Printing and blockchain. These technologies, which also seemed like science fiction just a short time ago, can help the world recover from one crisis and be better prepared for the next one.  There are a number of challenges these technologies can address. One of these is predicting how people respond to unprecedented events. Unexpected surges in demand for hand sanitisers, for example, have led to perfume factories in France switching to the production of hand gels for hospitals to increase supply.Decision makers struggle to predict where and when the demand will come, as well as how much of it there will be. It is here where AI can help by identifying patterns and predicting what will happen next. It helps decision makers cope with information overload by capturing and aggregating data from a variety of sources. These techniques are helping to identify high-risk patients in Chicago, even when testing is limited. Another challenge is maintaining supply, especially when supply chains are reliant on one source that is affected by unexpected disruption. Italy’s battle with the pandemic naturally means supplies of pasta are disrupted elsewhere. This is where 3D printing comes in. 3D printing involves making things layer by layer, directly from digital files. It allows things to be made where and when they are required, without the the expensive tools or moulds that mass production requires. While it might cost more to make a single product, 3D printing can make manufacturing faster and more responsive to changing demand – even for pasta.So if car factories, for example, take advantage of 3D printing then it suddenly becomes a lot more feasible for them quickly switch to making ventilators for hospitals, as is being suggested by the UK government.However, this assumes they can access reliable designs and parts lists for these specialised and highly technical products. To this end, efforts are underway to create open-source ventilators. Safety testing and certification will be vital or these well-intentioned efforts may do more harm than good.Fake products and medical equipment have already been an issue during this crisis. So being able to track where things are and where they came from to ensure they are genuine is vital. Blockchain can help because it provides an open, distributed record of transactions. Everyone who needs to be able to see the record is able to – but no one is able to either modify or delete it. It ensures that transactions are transparent and traceable, turning a supply chain into a digital “chain” of permanently visible “blocks”. This helps to maintain trust between all relevant parties. For example, in China it is being used to trace and confirm the source of public announcements, helping to eliminate fake information. Additionally, blockchain enables smart contracts, which automatically transfer funds when specified conditions are met. Brooklyn Microgrid uses smart contracts to allow homes with solar panels to sell energy to their neighbours (every unit is automatically counted and paid for).Blockchain also helps to minimise price inflation, ensures the right equipment gets to the right people and helps distribute the costs fairly and transparently. This may be vital when privately owned factories make goods for public services and should be reimbursed from taxpayers’ money.Individually, each of these technologies can have an important role in managing supply chain disruption. The greatest value, however, comes when they are combined. This requires investment in skills as well as infrastructure. Private investment from a range of companies is driving development, but coordinated government strategies, from Industrie 4.0 in Germany to 
Made in China 2025 can help by guiding investments, supporting technology adoption and overcoming a skills shortage.Managing a crisis involves three sets of decisions around preparing, responding and recovering. As the coronavirus pandemic evolves, the focus is now firmly on response. But the recovery may be even more challenging. The unprecedented scale of the impact looks certain to change lives, whether it is how we interact or even having jobs to go back to after self-isolation. Panic buying of protective masks and hygiene products is symptomatic of a lack of trust in institutions and their ability to keep us safe. Yet just as science fiction movies see humans pulling together to save the world, the response to this pandemic has seen institutions collaborating to share resources – from hotel rooms to production lines. Investing in AI, 3D printing and blockchain can help businesses be more responsive to changes in supply and demand and make their supply chains more resilient.

",It seems that the notorious market crash on March 12-13 has affected every crypto company. But how? ,"A few industry players shared their own experiences and plans.""The market crash is definitely an important stress-test for both Ethereum and the decentralized financial products launched on it, and I'm confident that both will emerge as more antifragile,"" Nate Hindman, Head of Growth at decentralized liquidity network Bancor (BNT), told Cryptonews.com.Hindman said that the downturn has tested how Bancor liquidity providers fare during periods of extreme volatility. ""We're glad Bancor pools were able to process the increased volume and also serve as a hedge against losses,"" he said. In the week between March 9 and March 16, staking one's ethereum (ETH) in Bancor and generating fees from ETH trades on the network delivered a 73.84% APR (annual percentage rate) vs. holding ETH on its own, according to Hindman. ""This is because high trade volume on Bancor creates fees for users who are staking liquidity in Bancor and the profitability of those fees can outweigh losses in the pool's underlying assets,"" he explained. Meanwhile, crypto exchange KuCoin, in general, hasn't been heavily affected, said Johnny Lyu, CEO of KuCoin Global. ""The recent COVID-19 and dump in financial markets do have a negative impact on people’s confidence in crypto and traders are getting less active as a result,"" Lyu told Cryptonews.com, ""but we are bullish on the crypto market for the long term, and we believe that as the panic fades away, the price of major tokens will return to its value.""At pixel time (14:03 UTC), bitcoin (BTC) is down 32% in a month, while other coins from the top 10 lost 40%-50% of their value. However, the top 10 coins are up 20%-30% in a week.In either case, KuCoin said it is now focusing on new products and services. The biggest issue KuCoin has now is the lack of time compared to the number of things they have in plans, Lyu said. Recently, the company has established KuGroup, consisting of three business groups, namely KuCoin Global, KuCloud, and the KuChain & KCS Business Group. For this year, they've got a number of new products planned, such as KuChain and KuDEX, while they will also introduce new features to KuCoin, KuMEX and Pool-X.Others agree that the focus on products and services is essential. CEO of digital asset storage, transfer, and issuing platform Fireblocks, Michael Shaulov said that they've seen a 150% increase in volume, supporting their customers to move their crypto in the volatile market. This means, said the CEO, that they dedicate more time to their operations and making sure that the system is scaling up and working properly at all times. However, he added that ""sporadic outages"" of their interconnected partners could've been noticed, specifically cryptocurrency exchanges, providing as examples Coinbase, Gemini, Huobi, and BitMex, which had experienced issues on March 12-13. ""Business remains strong and it seems that our customer base is actually doing pretty well in the current climate. We continue to see extensions in our customer base and project to continue to move forward,"" Shaulov said. ""Moreover, our cash balance is solid and efficiency is high so we are ready for a long downturn.""Though it's difficult to predict how long the broader global volatility will last, Bancor's Head of Growth added that, as governments announce bailouts and the legacy infrastructure faces further strain, the value of a brand new programmable capital markets infrastructure becomes more apparent. Loi Luu, CEO of Kyber Network (KNC), added that, in critical times like this, access to liquidity is key for users and Defi projects. DappRadar, a dapp data aggregator and analysis firm, argued that it's down to national governments how long this turbulence continues, but they see a better future for crypto than other assets.  ""Probably there will be 6-12 months of uncertainty, with some reasonable chance (30%) that BTC and ETH will test respective recent lows c. USD 3,000 and USD 90. But I think when the rebound happens, crypto will rebound fastest compared to other assets - gold, stocks etc.,"" Communications Director Jon Jordan said.

","Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, finds money to be a type of game, but out of that game, there may be a solution for people to act towards the common good.","In a recent episode of Artificial Intelligence Podcast with Lex Fridman, the podcast host and a research scientist at MIT, Buterin is asked the question ""what is money?"" It's a game, he says. You've got points reduced by a number, and somebody else's points increase by that same number. It's one type of a fair game, which has served a useful function for thousands of years, so it survives. ""I guess the economist's utopia would be one where [...] incentive aligns in the sense that there aren't conflicts between what satisfies your goals and what is good for everyone in the world as a whole,"" Buterin says. However, he finds that existing economic philosophy in many ways deviates from utopia. Public goods, which Buterin often discusses, are especially important on the Internet, he believes, and the idea of money as a game is reflected in trade - somebody loses money, another gains that amount. ""This model works really well when the thing that we're using money to incentivize this kind of private goods, things that you provide to one person where the benefit comes to one person - but on the Internet especially,"" and numerous contexts outside of it, ""there's actions that individuals or groups can take where, instead of the benefit going to one person, the benefit just goes to many people at the same time, and you can't control where the benefit goes to,"" says Buterin. The individual actions, he continues, have concentrated cost and distributed benefits, and money as a point system doesn't do a good job of encouraging such actions. Something ""even tangentially connected to crypto, but theoretically outside of it,"" that Buterin works on is a mechanism called quadratic funding. By this system, he explains, if a person gives a coin to another, it works as money, but if many people give coins to one person - and anonymously so - it's ""not in consideration for a specific service to that person themselves, and then the number of coins received by that person is greater than just the sum of the number of coins that have been given by those different people."" If N people each give a dollar, each person's contribution gets multiplied by N, and the N person gets N squared coins.The formula for quadratic funding, he finds, ""optimally compensates"" for the tragedy of the commons - people behaving contrary to the public good by depleting/spoiling the shared resources for self-interest, or as Buterin explains, not wanting to pay the full cost for the sake of the group's benefit if they're set to receive only a fraction in return. Quadratic funding is useful for public goods in general, he argues. The mechanism has been tried within the Ethereum ecosystem, and the top use cases supported by users were unwinding user interfaces to make it easier for them to interact with Ethereum, documentation, podcasts, software implementations of the Ethereum protocol, etc. - ""lots of things that are gonna be useful to lots of people"" who are contributing to a particular entity. Discussing money not being backed by anything physical, but with billions of people agreeing that it has value, ETH co-founder stated that an interesting thing seen in the 21st century, in particular, is that ""a lot of the important, valuable things are not backed by anything."" However, ""the reason why the thing has value is just kind of network effects and coordination problems,"" says Buterin. ""Employees, in reality, aren't going to switch all at once, and also the users aren't all going to switch at once,"" because doing so is difficult. In a scenario where 80% agree on switching from one thing to another, making it a reality, the first person doesn't have the incentive to join, but the one in the 55th percentile does as they feel it's safe. And this can be used as an analogy for crypto as well. Buterin argued that money is definitely far from the only human motivator, but it's a big one, and the closest we have to a universal motivator. Fridman pointed out that one of the ideas decentralized applications are looking at is who holds the power - but money is often said to equal power. ""Money is definitely a kind of power,"" Buterin replies, adding that he sees those two things as interplaying. People use it to display their social status, but also as a scoreboard  - a way to measure success, bringing us back to money as a game. And though many may measure their self-worth through it, money is ""far from a perfect indicator of how much value you provide to the society,"" Buterin concludes.

","Blockchain-powered decentralized browser operator Brave (BAT) has filed a formal General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) complaint against Google, stating that the search engine giant has violated regulations pertaining to its users’ data.","Brave claims Google has violated Article 5(1)b of the GDPR, a European Union data protection and privacy law that came into force on May 25, 2018.Johnny Ryan, Brave’s Chief Policy and Industry Relations Officer, filed the complaint with the Irish Data Protection Commission, Google’s lead GDPR regulator in the EU.Ryan says that by collecting personal data collected from users worldwide across its platforms, such as its search engine and YouTube, Google has effectively built a monopoly.Brave has also petitioned the European Commission, as well as a number of European competition watchdogs – including Germany’s Bundeskartellamt, the UK Competition and Markets Authority and France’s Autorité de la Concurrence.Brave said, in a statement,“The GDPR purpose limitation principle requires that organizations internally ring-fence personal data and use it only for the narrow purpose it was collected for. Brave’s evidence shows that Google’s internal data free-for-all is unlawful.”The company added,“For six months, Johnny Ryan of Brave tried to learn what Google does with his data. Brave has now sought recourse from the [Irish] regulator to force Google to reveal what it does with everybody’s personal data. New Brave evidence […] offers a glimpse of what Google does with everyone’s personal data: hundreds of ill-defined processing purposes, and unknown legal bases.”Brave has released a dossier of 100 documents its says Google has drafted for a variety of business clients, tech partners, lawmakers, developers.Google brushed off the charges, with a spokesperson telling media outlet The Register that “repeated allegations from a commercial competitor don't stand up to serious scrutiny.”Google added,“Twenty million users visit their Google accounts each day to make choices about how Google processes their data. Our privacy policy and the explanations we provide users are clear about how data is stored and the choices users have.”Ryan, however, stated,“Google has to seek a legal basis for each specific purpose, and be transparent about them. But Brave’s new evidence reveals that Google reuses our personal data between its businesses and products in bewildering ways that infringe the purpose limitation principle.”GDPR’s purpose limitation principle, per Article 5(1)b of the act, reads: “Personal data shall be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes.”Should the Irish regulator uphold Brave’s complaint, Google could technically find itself unable to automatically opt its users into services and use collected data across all of its own – and third-party – platforms.Brave has recently struck a partnership deal that it says will allow users to spend its native tokens wit partner companies including e-commerce giant Amazon."
