The digital asset defied the worst fears of analysts by holding above the $5,400 support and currently Bitcoin continues to show growing strength in the face of wilting equities markets. ","Interestingly, gold and silver prices also rallied 4.42% and 5.94% as the S&P500 and Dow closed the day with moderate losses. This could indicate that market participants who recently exited their stock positions could be looking for shelter and growth in store-of-value assets. Thus, crypto investors will be closely watching to see if Bitcoin’s price action separates itself from that of traditional markets. Crypto market daily performance. Source: Coin360At the time of writing, bulls are defending the $6,400 resistance in order to secure a daily close above the resistance. For days now, analysts have advised that the $6,400 resistance needs to turn support and while today’s rally to $6,600 is encouraging, traders will be watching to see if there is enough purchasing volume to support the current momentum. BTC USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewIn the shorter time frame traders will note that the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is in the process of converging with the signal line and the histogram is on the verge of turning positive above 0. The relative strength index (RSI) is also climbing into bullish territory and is currently above 61. Gains above $6,455 place Bitcoin price above the 50% Fibonacci Retreacement level but the 61.8% Fib retracement is also expected to function as a level of stiff resistance. A glance a Bitcon’s price history on the daily timeframe shows that the price consistently encountered resistance at this level when below the 61.8% level and support at this retracement when trading above it. BTC USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewNotice that the March 20 rejection at $6,900 is within a hair’s reach of the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $7,101. From November 27, 2019 until January 3, 2020 the 61.8% Fib level had provided steady support so barring a high volume breakout, it’s likely to now function as resistance. The volume profile visible range also shows a high volume node right at this level.In the event of a pullback, $6,200 is the nearest underlying support and below this level $5,800 and $5,500 have proven to be reliable supports. As suggested yesterday, risk averse traders could wait for a few 4-hour candle closes above the ascending trendline or a daily close above $6,455. Bitcoin daily price chart.

is there more pain ahead as the global economy comes to grips with ...",1 month ago,"Bitcoin (BTC) price has started to show strength in its recovery since the black Thursday selloff this past week, but is this something we can expect to continue? Or is this a dead cat bounce on the way down to lower lows?","In today's analysis I’m looking not only at the charts, but also at the possibility of large Bitcoin miners being the cause of the 50% price drop on March 12, after supporting data emerged last week suggesting that short-term holders sold a whopping 281,000 BTC, which resulted in the crash.Daily crypto market performance. Source: Coin360.comIn an article published by Coinmetrics on March 17, on-chain data supported the fact that short-term BTC holders were most likely responsible for the selling rather than new holders.The figures they quoted included 281,000 BTC was on the move after 30 days of holding, compared to 4,131 that hadn’t been touched for over a year before being moved.This data might suggest to some that it was weak hands that FOMO bought in during Bitcoin's 30% price rise at the beginning of 2020. However, one has to consider the possible motives at play for such a large amount of Bitcoin being sold off cheap.This to me opens up the very real possibility that the same people responsible for Bitcoin's price rise this year, were the same people responsible for its fall.As can be seen in the chart below, Bitcoin had been trending in a downward parallel channel since June 2019 — a trend that seemed to bottom on Jan. 4, 2020, which saw the Bitcoin price take off in a new ascending channel.This new impetus for Bitcoin’s price was welcomed, but not questioned. Why did Bitcoin start to rise? Was it the upcoming halving, which is now just 51 days away? Was it the mining difficulty increase? Was it renewed institutional interest? However, what if it was all of these things combined, but with a twist.There are 1,800 new Bitcoins mined every day, and between the period of Jan. 4 and Mar 12, there would have been 122,400 Bitcoin mined. This is about 50% of the amount that was revived by short term holders, and you don’t get more short term than freshly mined BTC.BTC USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewI’m not going to pretend that I know any of this for a fact, this is just a theory with a lot of supporting data. But I will throw a few reasons that would make sense for larger miners to crash the market before continuing with my analysis.I believe the above to be plausible reasons, especially if you consider how much hashing power comes out of China, a nation that pretty much has a crystal ball when it comes to the Coronavirus outbreak, as the first cases where being reported there back in November 2019.This almost creates a perfect storm of conditions to execute the black swan event that was able to simultaneously gain dominance in the market, and regain control of the price. After all, if miners have no control over the price, then the halving will have no impact.BTC USD daily chart Source: TradingViewWhen you zoom out on the Bitcoin 1-day chart, it’s almost obvious where miners could have stopped selling. The breakout at the beginning of the year just looks like a bump in the road, as we have since resumed the same downward channel we were in for the entire second half of 2019.We’ll never really know whether or not the above scenario is true because of the selloff. However, one thing that is definite is that the price bounced off the support of the descending channel at $4,400 as anticipated in last week's analysis, so I am keeping these levels in mind looking forward to the week ahead.At present, the price is holding above the middle of the channel, which is around $5,800. However, should this level fail to hold, then I expect $4,200 to be tested next week.Should $5,800 continue to hold, then $7,200 is the key level of resistance for Bitcoin to push past and flip to support to be rid of this descending channel once and for all.BTC mining difficulty. Source: BTC.comSince the beginning of 2020, we have largely had the mining difficulty increase. This, in turn, seemingly saw the price rise, and as such, it seemed like a valid indicator.However, next week we are set to see the year’s first double-digit adjustment, and unfortunately, it’s a negative one of -10.54%. Only time will tell if this will have a negative impact on the price of Bitcoin.The yearly trend suggests that it might also just be correcting itself after such a dramatic selloff on the day it last increased. Bitcoin has a history of punishing its holders prior to big rewards, and the next chart might help you visualize what could be in store over the coming weeks and months.BTC Rainbow Chart Source: Blockchain CentreSimilar to the stock to flow ratio chart, only this one I feel helps convey an important message, and that message is “Keep buying Bitcoin at these levels.”Whilst this chart isn’t intended to be financial advice, and like the S2F model has most likely been based on hindsight, what it does show is potentially how long we might remain in the blue “fire sale” zone both ahead and beyond the halving.As a Bitcoin hodler and trader, I take great comfort in one thing shown on this chart. There are many more buying opportunities than there are selling opportunities, so should the price of Bitcoin continue to slide next week, try to view it as an opportunity to buy more, rather than reflecting on how much of a rekt pleb you feel right now.I said it last week, I’ll say it again, the CME gap still exists at $9,165. Whilst it feels almost impossible right now, 90% of CME gaps still fill, so there’s always a possibility.However, being more realistic and looking at the week ahead, if Bitcoin can hold $5,800 as support then all eyes are on $7,200 as the key level to break out from.From here, I would expect the next level of resistance to be present around $8,000 before we can even start to think about $10,000 again.We can’t completely ignore all the global turmoil right now. Thus, if $5,800 fails to hold, I think it’s highly probable that we will revisit $4,200.Falling below $4,200 is not a scenario I believe we need to consider. However, if this were to break, then $2,760 would be the last level of support I’d be looking at, as this would represent an 80% retracement from last year's high of $13,800. If it fails to bounce there, then I would completely expect Bitcoin to go to sub $1,000 levels.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of @officiallykeith and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Looking at performance relative to its peers, Ether (ETH) and XRP both underperformed versus Bitcoin last week against the U.S. dollar and have continued to do so. ","As a result, Bitcoin dominance is up 1.5% and pushing to reclaim 68% as there has been a general flight to safety in Bitcoin, although dominance is still down some 4% for the highs of the year at around 70%.Cryptocurrency market 7-day view. Source: Coin360BTCUSD 3 Day chart. Source: TradingviewBitcoin is trading up against what is a fundamental decision point at $6.8K. This is previous support now acting as resistance and the top of a high volume node which is dissected by a diagonal resistance trend line, which dates back to mid-2019. Reclaiming $6.5K has been a sign of strength by the bulls who catapulted Bitcoin higher off the 200-week moving average in the mid $5Ks. Looking at the big picture, a meaningful break out of the $6.8K resistance would see Bitcoin first attack $7,200 — the 50% retracement of the 2020 lows to highs — but above that stands formidable resistance.  There is a so-called “death cross” taking place today overhead at $8300 where the 50-day moving average is crossing below the 200-day moving average, which is a crowded cluster of other former support levels, namely the 100-day and the 20-week moving averages. Alongside this is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $8K and yearly pivot at $8,100 and a high volume node, implying that it will be a real challenge for the bulls to break beyond this point.  BTCUSD 3 Day chart. Source: TradingviewThe 3-day Bitcoin chart helps illustrate the persistently high volume being transacted by the bulls, albeit declining in its momentum, the volume at the 200-week moving average has resulted in the OBV printing the biggest surge to the upside in recent times and is indicative of real support around the mid $5Ks.BTCUSD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingviewThe 4-hour Bitcoin chart shows a strong trend pressing Bitcoin up against the $6.8K resistance level with the structure arguably being in a rising wedge pattern, which is typically bearish when accompanied by decreasing volume as is apparent here. The RSI is also showing bearish divergence which adds to the bearish case. If the bulls are unable to regain the $6,800 level, the 200-week moving average is lying below at around $5,500 on a high volume node, which was previously front run in the last attempt to break $6,800. Should the bulls find their feet again, diagonal support will be found at $6,250.Typically in Bitcoin’s history, we have seen a rally into the death crosses and depreciation into a golden cross.  If the bulls can break the $6,800 level, there is a high probability of selling pressure around $8K due to the confluence of previously lost support now likely to act as resistance.The Crypto fear and Greed index, which is a metric deriving the sentiment in the market from various inputs, shows unsurprisingly that the market remains in extreme fear meaning that there is likely to be more market volatility on the way.  The last time that fear was at these lows for any amount of time was in December 2018 at the lows of the 2018 bear market and interestingly also at the 200-week moving average. The 200-week moving average was ultimately a magnet for a retest although price never quite made it and was front ran, which was a good indicator the bottom was in. It is possible we are setting up for the same scenario again here.Bitcoin Fear And Greed Index Source: Fear and Greed IndexThe futures market also gives an insight into what the expectation is for the price of Bitcoin with contracts ending in June currently trading in backwardation with a discount from spot prices of around 1%. However, there is an expectation of some recovery and higher valuation for the September contract close. Bitcoin Futures Prices Source: SkewPerpetual swap funding also remains negative in the market, meaning that in order to achieve a synthetic cash position on a perpetual swap exchange, market participants are effectively paying an interest rate. Historically, there has been an inverse relationship between negative funding and propensity for the market to turn bullish so this may indicate that eventually those paying to be in a short position for longer periods while price remains flat above the 200 WMA will naturally be squeezed out. BTCUSD 15 Minute BItmex Funding chart. Source: TradingviewWith global uncertainty reaching all-time highs at present and with the commitment from central banks to provide “unlimited” liquidity in the form of debt, Bitcoin finds itself at ground zero in terms of its purpose for its creation.  While global assets are depreciating in real terms, Bitcoin’s inflationary supply is due to be cut in half in May and once the dust settles on the global markets, it may be that there is a flow of idle dollars into the Bitcoin market. This macroeconomic backdrop could prove to be very beneficial to the price of Bitcoin. The key challenge is to maintain the 200-week moving average and miner’s revenue above production cost, which is presently the case.  Assuming the 200-week moving average will be retained and $8K will be the resistance expected, Bitcoin may find itself trading sideways between the $6K and $8K for some time before a decisive move. The backdrop couldn’t be a better time to talk about the halving and in a few weeks that will present itself as being an imminent event that could be the catalyst to take Bitcoin back above resistance; time will tell with 49 days remaining until Bitcoin reward halving."

longs were liquidated. Top traders discuss the causes. 63153 Total views.",1 month ago,"The Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped to $3,600 overnight, marking Bitcoin’s biggest daily drop in the last seven years. Over $1 billion worth of longs was liquidated on March 12, causing one of the most intense long squeezes in the crypto market’s recent history.","The main catalyst of the sudden 50% decline in the price of Bitcoin within a span of eight hours was the 9.99% drop of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The United States stock market experienced its worst sell-off since 1987, as panic over the coronavirus pandemic intensified to unprecedented levels.In the past seven days, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general have shown a high level of correlation with the U.S. stock market, possibly due to the overall drop in investor appetite for high-risk assets. The steep correction in the U.S. stock market together with a lack of buying demand as Bitcoin’s price fell to the low $5,000 levels ultimately led the price to decline to $3,600.Until the global financial market begins to show signs of recovery, potentially through the introduction of more stimulus packages from central banks in Europe and the U.S., Bitcoin is likely to remain vulnerable to abrupt pullbacks in the near-term.Speaking to Cointelegraph, cryptocurrency trader and technical analyst Eric Thies said that while the focus of investors has solely been on the coronavirus pandemic, there have been major geopolitical conflicts and risks affecting the market as of late, such as the the dispute over oil prices between Saudi Arabia and Russia. The unexpected decline in the price of oil further imposed additional pressure on global markets, adding to the uncertainty, fear and instability felt by investors. As Thies said:“Today’s massive dump in both the crypto markets and the traditional markets was very interesting to say the least. While many would say it is solely due to the coronavirus, looking into it further and you will see this does not show the usual signs of a recession. This may be because of the war on oil that many people have not heard about due to the news of the virus.”Thies noted that with the drop to $3,600, a new market cycle for Bitcoin could begin. Top traders have said in the last 24 hours that the overnight plunge of Bitcoin could kickstart a long accumulation phase, similar to in early 2019.If that happens, institutions could continue to accumulate BTC at lower prices if the appetite for risk-on assets improves over time, making the market less concentrated on whales or individuals that own a significant amount of BTC. Thies explained further:“One thing I think that is overlooked by many crypto investors is the money flow in this new market cycle. This is the first market cycle where the weight of the money will potentially be held by institutions. That means that Bitcoin is now tied to the traditional markets, and far from being a safe haven when it comes to the emotional cycles of humans, and our instinct to save our money when we become fearful.”Throughout February, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust showed a premium of around 30% relative to the spot exchange price of Bitcoin on platforms like Coinbase. This represented a steady inflow of capital from accredited and institutional investors in Bitcoin.The Bitcoin price crashed down into the $3,000s because of the highly leveraged nature of the cryptocurrency market and the unwillingness of buyers to step in amid extreme volatility and uncertainty. After the drop, the liquidity of Bitcoin wore to the point in which a limit sell order of around $11 million was lowering the BTC price on BitMEX by $300 relative to other exchanges. Cryptocurrency trader Jacob Canfield explained in a tweet:“This guy is trying to offload $11 million here with limit sells, but it's been holding the price down relative to other exchanges. Mex was running $300 lower than almost any other exchange due to liquidation backlogs.” $11 million limit sell order for BTC on BitMEX. Source: Jacob Canfield TwitterA large portion of the daily cryptocurrency exchange market volume comes from futures trading platforms like BitMEX, OKEx, Binance Futures and FTX. This suggests that the majority of traders in the cryptocurrency market are trading major cryptocurrencies with borrowed capital.In times of heightened volatility and unforeseen market sell orders in the hundreds of millions of dollars, Bitcoin’s price could react with a severe correction with no end in sight, such as on March 12. Before the large drop occurred, Thies said that $4,800 looked as the next logical level of support based on previous areas with high trading activity. Thies said prior to the drop to the $3,000s:“It appears BTC may have been caught by the $5.6K breakout range from 2019. For bulls, the only good sign at the moment is that it technically confirms last years breakout as a legitimate change in trend from the 2018 bear trend, with a successful back-test of that break out range.”The Bitcoin price dropped below every major support, even further than the last remaining support at $4,800 across all major exchanges, as virtually all longs in the market were wiped out in a span of several hours.A screenshot shared by well-known cryptocurrency trader I am Nomad showed an investor on BitMEX losing 1,220 BTC overnight, which would have been an equivalent of $9.7 million before the drop.More than $1 billion of longs was liquidated in the last two days on BitMEX alone, precisely because large longs above $10 million started to be stopped or liquidated, which then turned into strong selling pressure.In the aftermath of the 50% drop in the price of Bitcoin, top industry executives that oversee the sector’s largest investment firms expressed their belief in the asset class and confidence in the long-term trend of the market.Michael Sonnenshein, the managing director at Grayscale — which oversees the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, a publicly tradable Bitcoin investment vehicle with around $2 billion in assets under management — said that he hasn’t doubted his faith in the cryptocurrency industry and the community amid this extreme volatility:“I'm 7+ years into my digital currency journey. Years ago I'd wake up in the middle of the night to check prices or allow my stomach to churn when the market dropped precipitously, but I never once lost faith in what this incredible community has built. Stay strong. HODL on.”The billionaire CEO of Galaxy Digital, Mike Novogratz, said that the confidence of investors across the world in just about every asset seems to have dropped, which makes Bitcoin all the more valuable in the long term. Paolo Ardoino, the chief technology officer at Bitfinex, said that one single day does not make a market, adding that:""Bitcoin is a battle tested asset which in time will prove its underlying strength as a genuine store of value. While Bitcoin has grown to fruition during a period of massive QE from central banks it will in time prove its metal as these policies surely begin to fail.""According to Thies, one positive takeaway from the market crash is that it occured at the beginning of the month, leaving more time for BTC to recover and stabilize. Had the drop happened in late March, it would have caused larger time frame candles like the monthly candle of BTC to close with a drop to the $3,000s, which could have established an intensely negative precedent for the months to come. Thies concluded:“Although we aren’t sure what mayhem ensues in the media and markets from here, just know this: Buy when people are fearful. Sell when people are greedy. Times like these, in which emption and stop-losses are triggering catastrophic results are typically a sign of true capitulation and often a time to countertrade the masses.”"

business Digital Farms about 2 months before Bitcoin halving.",1 month ago,"Although the cryptocurrency markets have slightly recovered following massive sell-offs in mid-March, Bitcoin’s (BTC) faltering price has led to notable miner instability and closures.","Soon after Bitcoin dropped below the $4,000 threshold on March 13, DPW Holdings, a Nasdaq-listed holding company, announced that it is temporarily shutting down its cryptocurrency mining business, Digital Farms.According to a March 18 business update filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC), the Digital Farms’ suspension comes alongside other closures and changes at DPW in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.However, while changes at other businesses at DPW are directly connected to the impact of COVID-19, Digital Farms is said to be suspended due to Bitcoin’s recent price crash. The filing reads:“Digital Farms’ cryptocurrency mining operations have been suspended indefinitely, primarily due to the sharp decline in the market price for Bitcoin.”Formerly known as Super Crypto Mining, Digital Farms is a wholly owned crypto mining subsidiary of DPW. As reported by Cointelegraph, Digital Farms deployed DPW’s own mining hardware, AntEater, which was developed in collaboration with tech giant, Samsung. In May 2019, Digital Farms acquired a 617,000 square foot facility in the U.S. to increase overall mining profitability by gaining access to 28 megawatts of power and an infrastructure to support up to 300 megawatts.Digital Farms’ suspension announcement came just about 60 days before the next Bitcoin halving in May — one of the most anticipated events in the crypto community, which will see mining rewards cut by 50%. Taking place once every four years, the Bitcoin halving has historically led to significant growth in Bitcoin’s price. However, some crypto players believe that the next Bitcoin halving will have little-to-no impact on Bitcoin’s price.Though some factions of the crypto community were anticipating Bitcoin to surge amid the upcoming halving, Bitcoin experienced exactly the opposite trend in March 2020. On March 13, Bitcoin’s price “halved” its price instead, dropping to as low as $3,600. At the height of the crash, the coin’s daily losses amounted to over 50%.The massive drop of Bitcoin subsequently led to significant miner instability as mining became unprofitable. This forced a number miners to remove their hashing power from the network, blockchain analytics firm Glassnode reported. Similarly, Chinese mining pool, F2Pool, also reported on March 12 that Bitcoin’s daily mining revenue was suffering more losses than during the price lows of November and December 2018.When some miners retreated due to unprofitability following the crash, Bitcoin experienced its second-largest historical drop in difficulty ever. According to Glassnode data, Bitcoin’s difficulty — a measure that indicates the time taken by miners to add new transactions to the Bitcoin network — dropped almost 16% on March 25. While some industry players think that downward difficulty adjustment completes the so-called “miners’ capitulation cycle,” others are confident that such events mark a bottom in the market.As of press time, Bitcoin is trading at $6,652, up about 0.2% over the past 24 hours, according to data from Coin360."

Awesome! Love it!” Later that day, 1,000 Bitcoins that had been mined on August 24, 2010, were identified to be moving on the Bitcoin blockchain — leading many to speculate that the coins may have belonged to whoamisoon. The coins appeared destined for Coinbase.On March 12, the user returned to thank the forum members who had assisted him in realizing his Bitcoin bounty, stating:“Thank you all for all the suggestions. It was overall a great return and the best welcome one can get! Keep it up; I can see it helping others that are in my shoes as well.”The post suggested that whoamisoon may have liquidated their holdings prior to March 13 — meaning that they may have cashed out in the $7,500 to $8,000 price range, equating to $7.5 million to $8 million. The value of their corresponding BCH and BSV forked coins would have added roughly $500,000 to their payday."

In the past 48 hours, however, they have started to lean toward a resumption of a bearish trend for Bitcoin, as the relief rally of the dominant cryptocurrency is seemingly coming to an end.","Much data from the imbalanced buy and sell orders on major exchanges like BitMEX and the decline in the total open interest of Bitcoin futures point toward lacking demand from buyers. Historically, when the Bitcoin price came close to a full-blown capitulation phase as seen in December 2018, it required months of accumulation in a low price range to recover over a lengthy period of time.The last time Bitcoin dropped to the low-$3,000s region, it took around four months to begin a gradual recovery to the $7,000 to $8,000 area. There are concerns that Bitcoin’s price may have recovered a little too quickly after dropping to $3,700, and as the biggest whales in the crypto market like Joe007 explain, such a short-term, V-shape recovery after a massive correction never occurred in the crypto market in the past.Speaking to Cointelegraph, cryptocurrency trader and technical analyst Eric Thies said that the struggle of Wall Street and institutional investors directly affected the price trend of Bitcoin. As the stock market in the United States took a hit, the open interest across major futures exchanges including CME dropped off substantially. In futures trading, the term “open interest” refers to the total amount of long and short contracts open at a certain time.According to data from Skew, aggregated open interest for all Bitcoin futures contracts — which include CME, BitMEX, Binance, OKEx and Huobi — fell from more than $4.2 billion to just $2 billion since March 1.Based on the data, Thies emphasized that the drop in the volume of the futures market led the price of Bitcoin to correct, causing mayhem in the entire cryptocurrency market:“With last week's plummet, many were initially left scratching their heads. But it makes complete sense from a logical point of view. Looking at the facts of the situation: Bitcoin was looking bullish prior to the breakdown; this is Bitcoin's first 'recession.' [...] Point being, that since futures carry such a heavy weight of the volume in the market, guess what's going to happen when wall street is getting destroyed… Bitcoin also gets shredded. And last week was a very interesting point to be made.”Some strategists in the U.S. seem to believe that the stock market has not reached its bottom yet. The coronavirus pandemic is still expanding, and the U.S. overtook China as the most infected country in the world. The negative impact the Bitcoin futures market is having on the price trend of BTC is unlikely to subside anytime soon, adding to the selling pressure on the market as a result.Several renowned traders who have predicted multiple market cycles throughout the history of Bitcoin such as PentarhUdi foresaw the Bitcoin price drop to sub-$6,000 coming when the price of BTC was still hovering above $10,000 in February.The 200-week moving average mentioned by PentarhUdi on Feb. 10 was $5,800. However, a cascade of liquidations on BitMEX and other exchanges led Bitcoin’s price to free fall to $3,600.Following the correction, PentarhUdi noted that Bitcoin could recover to up to $8,500, which technically presents a 200-day simple moving average. Then, the trader said that BTC remains vulnerable to a second correction to sub-$3,000s, adding:“Amid global financial panic, Bitcoin price aggressively attacks Weekly SMA200 and bottom triangle line of previous chart. I see this might not end as well as I thought. As the bearish potential of global markets is huge.” From $5,200, Bitcoin saw a decent recovery to around $6,900 but was rejected at a historically strong resistance level. It is now at a borderline negative year-over-year, and in the short term, Thies told Cointelegraph that he now leans toward a bearish outlook:“One additional interesting point from the event is that it was on 3/13/20 and the low was $3,850. Looking at the charts, the closing price of 3/13/19 was the exact same number. From the pricing standpoint, it is interesting that BTC is now borderline negative for YOY gains since the implementation of futures went live in 2017. I'm watching carefully here since I'm actually leaning unfortunately bearish at the moment.”Bitcoin has shown less correlation with the U.S. stock market since March 25. While the Dow Jones surged by more than 6% on Thursday, the price of Bitcoin remained relatively stable. Venture capital investor and partner at Placeholder Chris Burniske said that, purely based on technicals, Bitcoin could retest the lows at $3,000.That validates the historical cycles of Bitcoin, which show that Bitcoin has never recovered in a V-shape pattern from a near 60% correction within a three-week span. For Bitcoin to maintain a bullish trend at a macro level over the medium to long term, a retest of lows and a stable accumulation phase lasting several months is critical.Echoing the logic of other experienced traders, Burniske said that the plunge of Bitcoin through the 200-week moving average, which typically served as a historical support level for BTC, leaves the dominant cryptocurrency vulnerable to another big pullback:“Lots of people are asking where BTC bottoms. The short of it is I wouldn’t be surprised to see a retest of our 2018 lows near $3,000. Historically, I’ve relied on the 200 week moving average (yellow line below) as our bear market bottom, but we fell through that at ~$5,500 last Thursday.”The unprecedented weakness in the altcoin market can be considered another signal of the lacking appetite for high-risk assets and cryptocurrencies in general, as trader DonAlt said: “BTC looks like it could go up, down or sideways. Alts look like they could go down, down or down.”When Bitcoin is on track for an actual relief rally, altcoins tend to front-run Bitcoin, as seen in December 2019 when Bitcoin started to recover from $6,400 to over $7,500. Bitcoin is now essentially in the same price range; it has rebounded from $6,400 and rose to as high as $6,950, but major altcoins the likes of Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) have barely moved against both Bitcoin and the U.S. dollar.Strategists predict the U.S. stock market continuing to be rattled by the economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. New reports show that the virus outbreak in the U.S. may just be starting — and like China in the early days, there is a high probability that the U.S. may take more than two months to recover.Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson explained that the recovery of the U.S. from the coronavirus could be delayed by a week or two compared to China, based on the contrast in containment efforts.With record-high jobless claims and the rapidly expanding coronavirus outbreak, both the U.S. stock market and Bitcoin — primarily due to the declining futures market open interest and volume — remain highly vulnerable to another leg down in the foreseeable future."

officials seem to disagree vastly on the issue. 12831 Total views.",1 month ago,"In early March, the Bank of England’s governor-designate, Andrew Bailey, said that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. He controversially stated that any investor that holds Bitcoin should be prepared to lose all of the money. Bailey said, “If you want to buy it, fine, but understand it has no intrinsic value. It may have extrinsic value, but there is no intrinsic value.”","Throughout the past several years, many high-profile investors and government officials such as billionaire Mark Cuban, Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett and United States President Donald Trump have criticized Bitcoin for its lack of real value.In July 2019, President Trump echoed the sentiments earlier shared by Buffett and his business partner Charlie Munger when he claimed that the value of Bitcoin is “based on thin air,” implying that it has no intrinsic value. At the time, President Trump said:“I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.”The argument for the lack of value in Bitcoin derives from its origin: a decentralized and peer-to-peer network of miners, users, developers and node operators that has been running since 2009 without the presence of a central entity or a group that oversees the blockchain protocol.Hence, the concept that a decentralized and completely open-source network, which in theory is software, is foreign to many investors. In 2018, Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger said that Bitcoin is “worthless, artificial gold,” describing it as a piece of clever computer science. Munger told CNBC:“Bitcoin reminds me of Oscar Wilde’s definition of fox hunting: ‘The pursuit of the uneatable by the unspeakable.’”Most of the negative stances towards Bitcoin and the skepticism about its value stems from its distributed structure and the digital nature. But, cryptocurrency industry executives and prominent investment firm operators perceive the value of Bitcoin differently.In an interview with Cointelegraph, BlockTower Capital chief investment officer Ari Paul explained that the value of Bitcoin comes from the control it gives to users that own the asset. The non-confiscatable characteristic of Bitcoin provides users with an unprecedented level of financial freedom when compared with traditional assets.Safe haven assets like gold, for instance, which investors foresee Bitcoin would compete against over the long run, have seen many instances wherein gold held by individuals were seized by governments in the past. Paul told Cointelegraph:“BTC is many things: its value comes as the only way to pay for Bitcoin blockchain space (aka censorship resistance as a service), but I’d argue far more of its value comes from its seizure resistance. If I want to store $1 of wealth in a way that can't be arbitrarily seized by governments, I need to own $1 of BTC, regardless of BTC’s price per dollar. With that framing, it’s vaguely comparable to the offshore banking system which is roughly $30 trillion.”The argument that the value of Bitcoin comes from its seizure resistance goes in line with the sentiment of Wences Casares, the CEO of crypto custody and wallet provider Xapo. In an essay titled, “The case for a small allocation to Bitcoin” published in March 2019, Casares suggested that every $10 million portfolio should have at least $100,000 invested in Bitcoin with a long-term investment thesis. Casares explained that growing up in Argentina, he saw his family lose their savings three times over, and the last time was due to unfair confiscation of assets.Related: Crypto Traders Explain What Caused the Bitcoin Price Plunge to $3,000sFounder of Quantum Economics Mati Greenspan told Cointelegraph that whether Bitcon has any “intrinsic” value purely depends on the perception of an investor of Bitcoin and the entire asset class. By definition, the term intrinsic value refers to the true, inherent and essential value of an asset, commodity or currency. But value is subjective and oftentimes changes significantly based on varying circumstances.As an example, before President Richard Nixon essentially eliminated the gold standard by disallowing the Federal Reserve to reclaim dollars with gold, the “intrinsic value” of the dollar came from the backing of gold. But when the gold standard was abolished, other countries started to print money and the inflation rate of reserve currencies began to rise.A case can be made that the intrinsic value of a reserve currency is the government or the country behind it, but the value of it can change rapidly depending on varying factors, according to Greenspan:“Intrinsic value is defined as ‘an investor’s perception of the asset’s value,’ so whether Bitcoin does or does not have it depends entirely on the perspective of the prospective investor. Perhaps it holds no value for Mr. Carney at this time, but it certainly has value to millions of other people around the world.”Despite the emergence of trusted custodians and strictly regulated exchanges that have contributed to the establishment of a rapidly improving infrastructure supporting the market, Bitcoin is still an emerging asset.Since the Dow Jones fell sharply on March 12 due to heightened levels of fear from the coronavirus pandemic, Bitcoin has shown a high level of correlation with the U.S. stock market. This tight correlation has devalued the image of Bitcoin as a safe haven asset. Prior to March 2020, BTC was never tested under an environment where the global financial market started to crash and show signs of extreme uncertainty.Related: Bitcoin Price Correlates With Traditional Assets, but Not EntirelyThe volatility of BTC and its correlation with stocks this month primarily stem from the fact that its market capitalization is still hovering at around $116 billion. That is merely 1.37% of the $8 trillion market cap of gold.As the market cap of Bitcoin increases over time, it will show less volatility and increased levels of stability, which would allow it to be seen as a safe haven asset in times of global market slowdown. Tyler Winkelvoss, the billionaire CEO of U.S.-based crypto exchange Gemini, said recently on the matter:“Bitcoin is not a hedge to pandemics, it is a hedge to fiat regimes. A sudden, negative demand shock in the global economy’ will affect every asset, including gold, in the short term. The world will get through this, but at what long-term, Faustian bargain? Bitcoin is not making any deals right now. It has the resilience and endurance to last in the infinite game.”With a larger market cap, stronger infrastructure, higher liquidity, clearer regulatory frameworks and increased levels of mainstream awareness, the value proposition of Bitcoin can improve significantly over the next decade. And eventually, the argument that Bitcoin lacks “intrinsic value” is likely to weaken, as its non-confiscatable characteristic, decentralized nature, and fungibility will add to the asset’s value."

Source: lookintobitcoin.comIn a tweet on Mar. 13, stock-to-flow creator PlanB said that “bitcoin oscillated nicely around model value”.

The current 365-day average model predicts a price of $8,426 at the estimated time for the halving – May 9, 2020. On Sunday, Bitcoin’s price hovers around $5,400, while its realized price on the NTV signal is at $5,596, suggesting the asset is in a purchasing zone after the dump in price on Thursday. Currently, the NTV signal is at 49.5 with 45 representing an oversold scenario. For traders considering a short-term purchase, the model suggests that there’s an opportunity for a quick profit based on the realized price and the 200 week average.

As the digital currency supporters say, “honeybadger doesn’t care” and they’re right in that sense. Most likely there will never be a consensus on what Bitcoin’s main usage is and some would argue that there is no need for one.Bitcoin was designed to work on a standalone basis, without the need of banks, governments, international currencies or whatever system is needed for traditional fiat money. Satellite and mesh network communication systems are currently in use in order to keep the Bitcoin blockchain alive even during an internet outage. One does not need to imagine a catastrophic scenario in order to put Bitcoin usage to the test as people from North Korea and Iran are already using it to bypass international sanctions.There are many who argue that Bitcoin cannot be a store-of-value based on its whipsaw volatility but valuable insight can be drawn from gold’s price action during the 2008 financial crisis.Gold/USD daily chart 2007 - 2009. Source: TradingViewGold certainly doesn’t look like a safe haven after a 24% plunge in less than 2 months, even more worrisome is the fact that the S&P 500 remained flat during that period. Therefore, is it really fair to analyze any correlation over such a short period? Does that sharp movement in price invalidate gold’s resilience during market uncertainties?The same thing can be said as Bitcoin enters its first-ever major global crisis. This, in fact, is the first of four triggers for a major price pump ahead; this is where we will focus.Bitcoin price sustaining a level above $5,000 translates into a 55% or more premium to the December 2018 low of $3,200. Keep in mind the current crisis is something without precedent over the past decades.The S&P 500 took only 3 weeks to drop 20% from its peak, a point which most investors consider the beginning of a bear market. This is unprecedented in history even compared to the 1929 stock market crash.Bitcoin and S&P 500 60-day correlation chart. Source: TradingViewBitcoin’s lack of correlation with stock markets is another factor that might aid a new wave of inflow as investors realize the crisis has impacted almost every asset class imaginable. The chart above represents the price relation between the S&P 500 and Bitcoin on a scale from -1, a perfect inverse relation to +1, a perfect relation. The indicator clearly trends to 0 most of the time indicating there is absolutely no relationship between the two assets.The equivalent inflation being reduced to 1.8% per year after the block subsidy cut does not directly translate into price appreciation. What investors should be looking for is the sustainability of the network despite the halving’s negative impact on every single miner. It is a $5 billion industry and yet there’s nothing they can do in order to prevent it.The mere existence of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Cash SV (BSV) is a reminder that social consensus determines Bitcoin (BTC) rules, not miners, not exchanges, and certainly not the CME.Those forks were willing to increase block capacity, hence increasing the difficulty for an average user to run a node. The simple fact of the network continuous operation and adherence to the social consensus will be itself a display of strength.Even though the current crisis does not seem to be mortgage credit-related, the economic turmoil caused by the Coronavirus might be enough to bring down highly leveraged companies, physical retail oriented businesses and credit lenders. This GDP setback could be the trigger needed to remove confidence in the financial system as a whole.No one expects Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to be the first option for most investors but it surely is a contender for a small percentage, as evidenced by a Charles Schwab report published in November 2019. Recent examples of Venezuela, Turkey and Iran struggling to deal with hyperinflation of their local currencies shows that the financial crisis could lead to a perfect runaway for increased Bitcoin adoption.Since its inception Bitcoin has been patiently waiting for a global crisis. The recent price crash does not reflect investors' lack of confidence in Bitcoin's network strength, digital scarcity or its ability to work as a medium of exchange.The potential triggers for an upcoming rally come not only from its decentralized and noninflationary nature but also from the potential crisis impact on financial institutions and the government’s ability to sustain fiat money credibility.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Referring to the interview, Draper tweeted:“Entertainment for while you are holed up. When the world comes back, it will be Bitcoin, not banks and governments that save the day.”In the interview, Draper expressed confidence that new technologies like Bitcoin and artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to completely transform all the industries from banking to healthcare and real estate, tapping trillions of dollars of their value.

Source: Coin360Bullish investors relying on traditional technical analysis to assess Bitcoin’s price action will find the asset’s current performance less than satisfactory and the digital asset’s constant struggle to reach $10,000 is leading some to question whether or not the cryptocurrency will meet investors high expectations with the halving event just 64 days away.Since 2018 crypto traders looking for an edge have become increasingly interested in how the activity within the Bitcoin network can be analyzed to provide insight into its price action on spot and derivatives markets. Blockchain analytics firm glassnode recently published a thorough analysis examining how on-chain data allows one to categorize market participants into distinct “meaningful actor groups.” According to glassnode co-founder Rafael Schultze-Kraft: “Bitcoin’s UTXO–based system allows for analyses of on-chain data based on the ‘age’ of Bitcoins in the network, i.e. the categorization of Bitcoins depending on the last time they moved.” Schultze-Kraft further explained that taking a closer look at coin age data allows one to categorize market participants into “meaningful actor groups” and: “This allows us to obtain a refined understanding of on-chain activity that can be associated to investors that are characterized by different hodling behaviors. In particular, our approach is to break up on-chain activity according to two major industry stakeholders.” To gain a more detailed understanding of how on-chain data can be valuable to investors, Cointelegraph recently met with glassnode co-founders Rafael Schultze-Kraft and Jan Happel to discuss how on-chain metrics can benefit short and long-term Bitcoin holders. Cointelegraph: In your recent analysis you said that analyzing Bitcoin’s UTXO data allows one “to assess information on investors’ hodling behavior, and to gauge whether coins that have been dormant for a long time are currently being moved.” You also mention that close analysis of this data supports the categorization of Short Term Holders (STH) and Long Term Holders (LTC) as two investor types based on coin age. Furthermore, according to the chart below, on-chain data about the coin age allows researchers to estimate the probability of a UTXO being spent within the next 14 days.Probability that a UTXO is spent within 14 days based on coin age. Source: glassnodeWhile this is interesting, we are curious to know what is the value of “knowing” whether or not a Bitcoin will be moved within a certain number of days?Rafael Schultze-Kraft: The value of knowing is that on-chain movement represents economic activity so if we know the probability of coins moving can be placed within a certain window then one can make some inferences into how this may impact on-chain volume and this represents economic activity within the network. Jan Happel: From our research, we’ve found that generally the crypto market remains heavily driven by retail investors. Everyone is waiting for the institutions but we don’t believe they are in yet. I don’t expect that to happen within the next 24 months either. CT: It seems that using the 155 day metric of determining the difference between long and short term holders uncovers the percentage of coins either in the total supply or in the current circulating supply that is held by short term holders and long-term holders. Is this correct?RSK: Yes, once a UTXO is created, the probability that they will move is very high but older coins have a much lower probability of moving. Now, we can look at UTXO’s younger than 155 days and what the volume is of the circulating supply to determine what percentage is held by short term holders and long term holders. CT: How does the growth of derivatives markets like Bitcoin futures and high leverage trading offered at major crypto exchanges, Bakkt and CME impact the signal captured by any glassnode metrics? RSK: It has no impact on on-chain data but what can have an impact on derivatives trading and spot trading is prior on-chain data, which is happening on-chain and entering into an exchange. Meaning, the flow of funds moving into an exchange can provide a signal on what may happen in the derivative and spot markets. They are two different hemispheres from a data point of view so what is happening in the derivatives market is not influencing the raw data, which comprises our metrics. But what is happening on-chain does provide some insight into what might happen in spot and derivatives markets. I’ll let my colleague and co-founder Jan speak to this with more clarity. JH: You can think about the exchanges from an on-chain perspective as a black box, we can see what goes into the box, like the order book, transactions, fund transfers. We can see that there is a big “readiness” to trade because normally people don’t leave their Bitcoin on exchanges so when we see abnormal transaction activity we can infer that something significant is about to happen in the market.  Derivative data may not be as predictive when it comes to tracking trends but it is complementary and provides important signals for those using on-chain data and those who do not.CT: Popular trading indicators like the Relative Strength Index, Moving Average Convergence Divergence, and moving averages are lagging indicators that do not reflect the status of an asset in real-time. Are the LTH-SOPR, LTH-MVRV, STH-SOPR, and STH-MVRV active or lagging indicators? RSK: You can see instances where the indicator functions in both ways, so this is a very complex inquiry. Sometimes the LTH-SOPR, LTH-MVRV, STH-SOPR and STH-MVRV precede price action, and sometimes these metrics function as lagging indicators.  MVRV (blue) and LTH-MVRV (orange). Source: glassnodeEach can react based on investors’ reaction to price in the market and this would be an instance where the indicators lagged price action. Sometimes each can also provide insight into what might happen in the market when on-chain activity precedes what is yet to happen in the market. CT: The majority of the metrics on glassnode.com have adjustable timeframes, moving averages, and a zoom option for each indicator. Is there a particular default setting that best captures the signal provided by on-chain metrics? RSK: Not necessarily. We recognize that traders and researchers come from varying backgrounds, so we want as much flexibility and interactivity as possible. For example, there is a new feature called the compare tool, which allows users to plot various metrics against each other. We encourage users to experiment with each metric in order to develop processes and systems that work best for them. CT: Exactly how does the STH-MVRV determine when Bitcoin is over and undervalued for short-term periods? RSK: I wouldn’t always refer to valuation, the STH-MVRV is a signal that allows you to see how MVRV works on short time periods. The MVRV basically shows how the coins are valued today based on today's (realized) price. The realized price of Bitcoin’s price is its true value. In very simple terms, it tells us that if STH-MVRV is above 1, Bitcoin is overvalued and investors may consider taking profits or selling. Short term holder (STH) MVRV. Source: glassnodeThe nice thing is that it very very nicely shows how the line at 1, which represents equilibrium and the true underlying value of Bitcoin at that time can be used as an indicator. It really highlights short-term local cycles well and this info can be useful to those interacting with Bitcoin on a shorter time frame. CT: When evaluating on-chain data provided by the MVRV are the terms overvaluation and undervaluation interpreted in the same way that traders understand the terms overbought and oversold? RSK: We can use MVRV as a price valuation model, which shows the current market value and realized value. If the current market value is higher than realized value then the asset is overvalued. Bitcoin MVRV Ratio. Source: glassnodeHowever, if we look at MVRV over a longer timeframe, we see that 90% of the time Bitcoin price was overvalued. Interestingly, this doesn’t mean that it was overvalued and the value of following the metric over time allows the user to determine on their own whether or not a value of over or under 1 means Bitocin is over or undervalued.Alternatively, we can see that MVRV, when overvalued, can still be quite far away from a global top so this indicates that there is room for Bitcoin’s price to grow. It is only overvalued with regard to realized price and investors can evaluate what actions they can take by looking at Bitcoin’s price history to see at what levels did the trend change depending on activity within the spot market."

Or is it just about to get started?Daily crypto market performance. Source: Coin360.comBTC USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewBitcoin broke out of a worrying descending channel on March 5. However in the last hour, after retesting the support line of this channel several times, it has now broken back into it just three days later. This gives Bitcoin two very real downside targets of $8,100 and $7,500 in the short term. With the upside resistance being first at $8,700 to get out of the channel, and then $10,500 and $11,050, respectively.  However, one has to question the validity of such drastic price action over the weekend, and next week could see a monstrous bullish rise, much akin to the power move we saw from Bitcoin on Oct. 25, 2019, when the price jumped from $7,400 to $10,500.  But what are some of the leading indicators telling us? BTC USD RSI 4-hourly Source: TradingViewThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) Indicator on the 4-hour shows that we could have some distance left to fall with a reading of just above 31. This tells us that Bitcoin is approaching heavily oversold on this key timeframe, and historically it must break below 30 before seeing a reversal.  BTC USD RSI 1 hour Source: TradingViewThe hourly, however, looks massively oversold, reading at 18.62, which is approaching levels we haven’t seen since Feb. 15.  One would hope to see a reversal at this stage. However, despite the RSI appearing to pivot on this date, the Bitcoin price did not, and continued to fall from $9,700 to $8,400 over a period of two weeks.  But what does the Moving Average Divergence Convergence (MACD) Indicator tell us? BTC USD weekly MACD Source: TradingViewAs I have mentioned several times, the weekly MACD is a great indicator when looking to identify bull or bear trends.  However, I expressed concerns back in January in my analysis stating that weekly MACD was exhibiting similar signs to that of the false bull phase we saw around August-September 2018. During this phase, bulls were lured into a false sense of security, which saw Bitcoin fall from $8,000+ to sub $4K in a matter of weeks, and it appears my concern could have been valid.  However, in late 2018 there wasn’t an imminent halving of Bitcoin mining rewards around the corner like there is now. But then again, there also wasn’t a global pandemic either. However I’m yet to see any major correlation between Covid19 and the Bitcoin price as of yet, so I’ll not be going down that road just yet. The week ahead should give us some answers as we have two historically bullish indicators ahead of us, and should they fail to increase the price of Bitcoin next week, perhaps we need to start looking at the reality of a potential global slowdown having a very negative effect on the price of Bitcoin.  BTC USD CME weekly Source: TradingViewI’ve said it countless times, if you are not trading the CME gaps, “do you even crypto bro?” The CME gaps occur when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange closes for trading on a Friday evening and reopens on a Monday after large weekend moves, which leaves a gap in the charts. There are many theories as to why gaps fill. One is that orders left on the books from the Friday prior remain unfilled, in this case, sell orders of Bitcoin at $9,165 need to be bought to fill the gap on the charts.  But if the market opens at $8,100, who would buy at a premium of $9,165? Potentially someone who has a long position on margin, that stands to profit from a guaranteed long that’s who. And in such an easy market to move, is it any wonder that historically 90% of CME gaps for Bitcoin get filled?  This isn’t the only bullish indicator though, there is another reliable indicator that has served as a crystal ball this year, and that is the mining difficulty. BTC mining difficulty. Source: BTC.com Next week, the mining difficulty is set to increase by nearly 8%  and that’s the most it has increased all year. In fact, it’s the most it has increased in the last 6 months, so this is a very positive sign for Bitcoin. At the beginning of 2020, the Bitcoin mining difficulty kept increasing every two weeks by anywhere between 4% and 7% and, in turn, the price of Bitcoin followed; and typically this happens on the same day the increase was implemented.  If this follows next week, then Bitcoin could see a tremendous reversal, but only time will tell.  The week ahead for Bitcoin is quite important for several reasons. Right now, with the state of the global panic, there is a lot of irrational behavior (for example, how much toilet paper did you buy this week?)As such technical analysis might be completely useless, and that’s a very real fact that people should consider this forthcoming week. If the CME gap and BTC difficulty increase have no impact, we might see that $4K Bitcoin I spoke about in January after all. In terms of resistance this week, Bitcoin first needs to reclaim $8,700 and flip this to support again to break out of this bearish channel. After this, I would be looking to $9,200 and then $10,500 as the key levels to break, with the last heavy area of resistance being around $11,050 before we finally go to the moon. On the downside, $8,100 and $7,500 are the two levels most likely to see support formed, and if $7,500 fails to hold, it opens up $4,000 in 2020 once again as a possible scenario. The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of @officiallykeith and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

At the time of writing, notable losers were Ether (ETH), with a 43.06% loss, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which has dropped 42.85%, and XRP, which now trades at a multi-year low of $0.13.Blockchain conferences worldwide have also suffered the effects of COVID-19.

I didn’t mention the $4,000 scenario again because just three days after my analysis on Jan. 15, Bitcoin broke out of the 7-month downtrend channel it had been bouncing around in since the June 2019-Libra FOMO pump.However, I did mention it again in my analysis last Sunday, since we had fallen into a steep descending channel that was about to break into the previous 7-month downward trend again. In other words, if $7,500 failed to hold there was no support all the way to $4,000Resident gold-bug and renowned Bitcoin-hater Peter Schiff was quick to tweet out something many of us should have taken more seriously.BTC USD 1 hour Source: TradingViewJust 32 minutes after the trendline on the hourly time frame was broken, the same trendline I was looking at on the 4-hour chart just a few days prior, Schiff tweeted the following:“If any institutional money ever actually went into #Bitcoin it's about to come out, never to return. Bitcoin has finally proven conclusively that it's neither a store of value, a safe haven, nor a non-correlated asset. The Bitcoin chain letter has finally run out of links!”It’s important to understand why Schiff may watch Bitcoin so closely and why he may be so intent on dissuading people from investing in it. Notably, here’s something I haven’t seen anyone mention before.His bank, Euro Pacific Bank, has a target customer base of high-net-worth individuals looking for offshore tax structures. For a long time, Bitcoin has been seen by some as an alternative place to park your wealth as opposed to exploiting questionable tax loopholes, so it’s clearly in Schiff’s interest to see Bitcoin fail as it directly attacks his business model.But while I doubt that institutional money is leaving Bitcoin for good, I believe that Peter Schiff’s comment makes sense and that institutions that bought the last 4-month dip where Bitcoin traded between $3,000 and $4,000 knew it was time to exit the market.If this is the case, it could end one of the popular theories being pushed right now about stocks and Bitcoin being correlated.If it’s true that institutional investors just withdrew from Bitcoin, then this bounce from $3,850 might signify that we have not only bottomed, but we might be about to decouple from any possible correlation with the stock market.’BTC USD/ S&P 500 Daily Source: TradingViewThe math is quite simple, the S&P market cap is around $25 trillion versus Bitcoin’s pre-dump market cap of $150 billion. Simply put, institutions stood to lose more from the S&P crashing than from their Bitcoin holdings.So in the likely event of stock market margin calls as prices began tumbling amidst the coronavirus global panic, what was the fastest liquid asset they could realize?The answer was most likely Bitcoin. And by all exiting at the same time (because they all had the same reason to exit) you end up with exactly the same situation you get when an ICO gets their team tokens unlocked, i.e. large holders crash the price leaving smaller holders left holding their depleted bags.BTC USD Daily Source: TradingViewDespite all this blood, there is some light on the horizon. The wick on the bounce from $3,850 has left the support line intact on the daily. This means that the support is currently around $4,400 and will slide to around $4,000 by April 1.True holders are unfazedHowever, the resistance to break out of this channel once and for all is currently around $7,400 and will fall to around $7,100 by April 1. So if it’s true that institutional money really has left, then this range will theoretically hold despite any further selloffs in the stock market.Newcomers can now enter at lower pricesThis, in turn, should bring confidence back to Bitcoin and create the opportunity for people, who previously thought they were too late to the party, to step in and start buying at fire-sale prices.Future selloffs won’t be as extremeThe reason this is not only good but, in my opinion, great for Bitcoin is that by having Bitcoin held by a large number of small holders as opposed to a small number of large holders, means that it is less likely for a catastrophic sell-off to occur in the future. This will also enable the digital asset to build on its new support level.BTC mining difficulty. Source: BTC.comThe mining difficulty is still increasing whilst the price is falling and the halving is only 57 days away. This means that soon any Bitcoins entering the market will be doing so at a much higher rate than the current price as they will have a higher production cost.It may not happen overnight but when it does, it’s likely to trigger one of the most impressive bull runs that we have ever witnessed, and whilst I don’t personally expect this to happen for at least another 6 months, I also don’t expect these prices to last for long or go much lower.It’s still a very turbulent time for the crypto-sphere as a whole. Should the support of $4,400 ($4,200 by next weekend) fail to hold, then the charts point to $2,450 as the next level of support.Prices this low would either spark a huge FOMO rally or a further lack of confidence. However, if people have “hodled” through the pain of this past week, I can’t see them selling should $2,450 hit either as this would be capitulating at an obvious bottom.On the bullish side, there is still the CME gap at $9,165, but now that institutions are supposed to have exited the market, it’s unlikely we will see these fills as regularly as we used to. Moreover, it may even lead to a reduction of traders on leverage platforms and a return to spot exchanges. In other words, an early “alt season” may then become a possibility as people attempt to regain their losses by speculating on altcoins again.The resistance levels to break now are $7,400 and then $8,000 before opening up $11,250 as the next target that would put Bitcoin on the same upward path it broke into on January 15.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of @officiallykeith and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Last week’s low of $3,700, he nonetheless added, was likely “close enough.” Vays is not alone. According to statistician Willy Woo, Bitcoin is in line for losses before a major retaliation takes hold of the market.“Dump then moon. We are undergoing flight to safety right now, BTC is looking for its bottom,” he tweeted on Wednesday.“But know that once the bottom is in there are strong bullish pressures ahead. It's this economic environment in the years ahead that Bitcoin was built for.”Meanwhile, Cointelegraph reported, current theory around the halving focuses on miner profitability. Bitcoin’s losses have likely forced out smaller miners, given its production cost is currently several thousand dollars higher than the spot price. As such, major players, such as those producing hardware, will be able to pick up the slack and claim more in block rewards, thus countering the impact of the supply dropping 50% in May."

The site reported a 2020 peak of roughly 150 EH/s on March 5, today down to 105.6 EH/s — a 29% decrease.Bitcoin network hash rate, April 19, 2019–March 27, 2020, Source: blockchain.comThe hash rate of a cryptocurrency is a parameter that gives the measure of the number of calculations that a given network can perform each second. A higher hash rate means greater competition among miners to validate new blocks; it also increases the number of resources needed for performing a 51% attack, making the network more secure.After a volatile month in which Bitcoin saw dramatic, if short-lived, losses of as high as 60% to around $3,600 in mid-March, the network’s difficulty yesterday decreased by close to 16%. Difficulty — or how challenging it is computationally to solve and validate a block on the blockchain — is set to adjust every 2016 blocks, or two weeks, in order to maintain a consistent ~10-minute block verification time. This has a close connection to the network’s hash rate. Typically, when the network sees a low level of participating mining power, the difficulty will tumble — while in periods of intense network participation, it rises, working as a counterbalancing mechanism.As reported yesterday, the last downward adjustment in difficulty was on February 25 of this year, when the coin’s price was around $9,900. Just three days later, it dropped to around $8,800, and by March 14, to nearly $4,800 — and as low as $3,600 on some exchanges, as noted above.Theis relationship between price, hash rate, and difficulty has historically generated a trend that some analysts refer to as a “miners’ capitulation cycle.” The theory holds that while Bitcoin’s price remains high, and mining is profitable, both hash rate and difficulty inch upwards until they reach a threshold at which miners are squeezed and forced to liquidate more and more of their holdings to cover their expenses — leading to an increased supply of Bitcoin on the market. The “capitulation point” — at which some can no longer afford to keep mining altogether — then involves a decline in hash rate (reflecting lower participation) — as can be seen today —  and a subsequent reset in the network’s difficulty.According to data from btc.com, Bitcoin’s difficulty is currently forecast to decrease by a further 16% in 14 days’ time."

No, there’s no conclusion to be drawn out of it. During the credit crisis of 2008, gold showed a similar retrace as it dropped 30% in a year, alongside equity markets. However, after this, gold outperformed the equity markets massively until the top in 2011.Through that, investors and traders on the equity markets usually sell their risky assets in order to have the liquidity to cover their equity losses.

After some markets saw their worst day since 1987, Bitcoin followed by tanking 60% to lows of around $3,600 on some exchanges. While commentators are scrambling to explain the phenomenon, Antonopoulos appeared to have already catered to such a scenario.“When people get scared, when there is a recession like that, they pull back their investments, and they’re going to pull back from crypto too,” he continued.Bitcoin derivatives trading volumes with March 12 spike. Source: Skew.comHe noted that Bitcoin alone in January required around $18 million of buys per day just to keep price parity.“From that perspective, I think the first order effect that happens if we have a recession is crypto crashes because all the liquidity dries up which is a classic effect and symptom of a recession.”Thereafter, Bitcoin has the chance to emerge as a safe haven, but the relative difficulty of accessing and storing for non-technical investors could form hurdles to adoption and price stability. Antonopoulos concluded:“All of those things are really a symptom of the fact that we have a small lifeboat and a very, very large number of people who need saving.”BTC/USD managed to recoup some of Thursday’s monumental losses the next day, but at press time still traded down 9%."

This time, it came from the European Central Bank (ECB) and was worth 750 billion euros. In the wake of a muted reaction to similar efforts by the Federal Reserve in the past week, Christine Lagarde, president of the ECB, said that there were “no limits” on potential financial measures."

Titled “Inflation Is Coming,” the blog post by BitMEX Research outlines the coronavirus financial market crash as the biggest economic turmoil since the 2008 financial crisis. In the same analysis, BitMEX also compared the downturn with the 2000 Dotcom bubble and the 1997 Asian crisis.Pointing out that inflation is likely to reveal “one clear winner” under a new global financial regime, BitMEX Research emphasized that Bitcoin — created in 2009 as the first ever cryptocurrency — now has its biggest chance to purportedly prove its worth.BitMEX Research wrote:“In our view, in this changed economic regime, where the economy and financial markets are set loose, with no significant anchor at all, not even inflation targeting, it could be the biggest opportunity Bitcoin has seen, in its short lifetime.”On the same day as BitMEX’s post, a different blog post tried to explain why Bitcoin experienced a major sell-off last week, plunging to as low as $3,600. As reported by Cointelegraph, BitMEX blamed two DDoS attacks for crashing its platform on March 13.On March 16, famous billionaire investor and Bitcoin bull, Tim Draper, predicted that “it will be Bitcoin, not banks and governments, that save the day” after the world comes back from the crisis.Apparently, Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency that is expected to prove itself during the global financial market’s ongoing instability. As reported by Cointelegraph, amid the global market turmoil, stablecoin cryptocurrencies have gained significant market share.

industry is that the financial product shouldn't be managed by central ...",1 month ago,"As of early February, more than $1 billion U.S. dollars of assets reside in decentralized finance protocols, commonly called DeFi protocols. DeFi protocols and platforms offer crypto holders sophisticated financial tools that were unavailable to them just a year or two prior, but the rapid evolution and speedy adoption of DeFi has left some observers wondering about the ecosystem’s future.","Skeptics and supporters alike want to know when Bitcoin (BTC) — the first and most popular cryptocurrency — will receive adequate DeFi support. Decentralized finance with Bitcoin is on the way, but there are good reasons that it’s relatively late to the market.Related: Decentralized Finance, ExplainedBitcoin, as any longtime cryptocurrency trader knows, suffers limitations in terms of speed and transaction fees. There’s a long history of people attempting to extend the capabilities of the Bitcoin blockchain, but today, more and more are developing cross-chain solutions that move Bitcoin onto other chains for use in DeFi. One such protocol, Wrapped Bitcoin, has many strengths, but still requires third-party-intervention and Know Your Customer checks for its users. While some may accept these tradeoffs as necessary for doing business, others will conclude that such concessions are overly centralizing and contrary to the spirit of crypto.Related: Bitcoin Scaling Problem, ExplainedThe tBTC protocol also looks promising, taking inspiration from protocols such as Maker and uses bonded deposits to secure Bitcoin on other chains. Ensuring that the decentralized custodians are properly incentivized to keep the system running smoothly while providing “no KYC, no middlemen.” It remains in early days, however, and there are substantial limits to its current feasibility. To take an obvious example, the project’s website acknowledges that for the moment, “deposits are only possible in fixed-sized lots of 1 Bitcoin.” While there are compelling reasons for this limit, tBTC participation requires significant faith and significant funding.Many DeFi users are projects or investors, rather than individuals. What does this mean for Bitcoin DeFi? They have substantial chunks of crypto to move around, convert, and invest: They’re not making transactions akin to buying a coffee on the way to work, and are rather more likely make deals closer in size to buying the coffee shop. This tendency to large transactions may make relatively high per-transaction fees acceptable to DeFi users, but large fees may deter smaller holders, particularly individuals with limited holdings. Is Bitcoin DeFi fated to be the sole province of institutions, groups and the occasional “whale” tycoon?Related: DeFi Can Now Choose to Run Trustless Zero-Knowledge ProofsThe advent of Bitcoin DeFi requires would-be users and supporters to face some difficult truths. The first truth is that, although some technologies are more robust and less compromised than others, it’s likely that any technological solution to the impasse will require tradeoffs. One DeFi Bitcoin implementation might increase centralization as wrapped Bitcoin does — will ideological purists be able to accept this? Another version of Bitcoin DeFi might be less centralized, but still require substantial collateralization from participants, which might deter certain kinds of investors.Cryptocurrency in general is a young industry, and DeFi is even younger. Mass adoption remains a ways off for crypto, and standard practices are still coalescing in associated fields like DeFi. What tradeoffs will prove most palatable (or rather, the least unpalatable) for investors? Will one protocol or solution corner the market, or will several viable tools peacefully coexist?

According to an age-old adage from investing legend Baron Rothschild, investors should look to buy during down markets. “Buy when there’s blood on the streets,” Rothschild famously said. Some financial advisors are reportedly recommending just that. Anthony Pompliano posted a number of these shared comments on Twitter, while keeping their sources anonymous. “It’s time to buy cheap stocks,” one professional said. ""Wait for everyone to say they sold and then buy,” another said, adding, “Warren Buffet style, buy when there is fear.""Some professionals alternatively recommend more stability with hedge-type investments. ""Keep things that have stability and dividends (utilities), hedge with precious metals, move to cash and wait for future buying opportunities,"" an advisor explained. Arguably showing its ties to traditional markets in 2020, Bitcoin has also suffered falling prices. Contrary to its previous status as a volatile asset used for drug purchases, however, Bitcoin has found its way into the recommended section of financial advisor’s verbiage.""He’s been telling me to get out of stocks, but he’s been monitoring Bitcoin and telling me there’s a big deviation in trend from global indices,” one client said of his advisor. “He’s watching and he’ll tell me when to buy,” the client added. “Sell everything,” another reportedly said, adding, “Buy BTC and Gold.” “Bitcoin is a binary game, it’s either going to be a 1 or a 0,” a different advisor said, giving Bitcoin a pass/fail evaluation. “Blockchain may have promise, but it’s far too early to know,” he added. Although comments concerning Bitcoin were a mixed bag, the growing interest from financial advisors demonstrates an awareness of crypto as an asset class. This may indicate that the industry is moving forward in the public eye.Cointelegraph reached out to Pomp for comment, but received no response as of press time.

Monday’s correction was followed by major cryptocurrencies - Ether (ETH), XRP, and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) all losing 11.6%, 8.3%, and 4.2%, respectively. ","Crypto market daily price chart. Source: Coin360The dump in crypto prices has raised further doubts over the classification or use-case of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies at-large. Bitcoin's safe haven argument as “digital gold” is being put in question as gold’s year-to-date returns surpassed Bitcoin and all other asset classes. Notable Bitcoin critic, Peter Schiff addressed the relationships between Bitcoin and traditional assets to claim its lack of value for investors:“Bitcoin is no longer a non-correlated asset. It's positively correlated to risk assets like equities and negatively correlated to safe-haven assets like gold. When risk assets go down, Bitcoin goes down more. But when risk assets go up, Bitcoin goes up less. No value in that!”On the other hand, it has been reported that financial advisors suggested that Bitcoin was a good alternative investment to consider adding to one’s portfolio. This raises doubt that the relationships between crypto and traditional assets claimed by Peter Schiff are observed in different scenarios. During January 2020, Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) saw gains of 26.2% and 32.9%, respectively. At the same time, in such a positive period for the top cryptocurrencies, traditional assets such as the S&P 500 gained (1.96%) and the Nasdaq composite remained approximately the same (- 0.16%).Cumulative returns for BTC, ETH, Oil, Gold, S&P 500, and Nasdaq during January 2020.Looking at the correlations between the 4 assets in January, we find the opposite relationship to the one mentioned by Peter Schiff. Bitcoin and Ether are negatively correlated with both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. Bitcoin is correlated at -24.4% with the Nasdaq composite during this period, while Ether has a smaller negative correlation at -16.2%.Regarding the S&P 500, Bitcoin is negatively correlated at -19.7%, while Ether has a smaller negative correlation of 7.9%. This is the opposite of Schiff’s comments, as, during a positive scenario, Bitcoin goes up more than other risk assets, as seen from the returns obtained during January. Moreover, Bitcoin and Ether have a correlation with equities in the opposite direction (negative), which is contrary to Schiff’s comments. A correlation of 100% means that either Bitcoin or Ether and each traditional asset move completely in the same direction, while -100% correlation means they are inversely related. A correlation of 0% means that the variables are not related in any way.In January both Bitcoin and Ether returns showed a positive correlation with gold at 24.1% and 22% respectively. The relationship between Bitcoin, Ether, and WTI oil returns was also positive and in higher magnitude – 33.6% in the case of Bitcoin and 34.7% for Ether. This is the opposite of Schiff's comments as gold and Bitcoin are positively correlated instead of negatively. In February Bitcoin price dropped about 7.5%, while Ether gained more than 23%. During this negative period for Bitcoin, its relationships with stock indexes were the opposite from the one observed during January (a positive period in price). Bitcoin was correlated at 5.85% with the Nasdaq and at 21.3% with the S&P 500.In February, Ether gained in price and its returns were positively correlated with the Nasdaq (20.2%) and the S&P 500 (31.1%) Cumulative returns for BTC, ETH, Oil, Gold, S&P 500, and Nasdaq during February 2020.Throughout February, gold was still correlated at 21.1% with Bitcoin, while Ether was correlated at 17.2%. January’s relationship with oil was also quite similar, with correlations at 32.3% and 36% for Bitcoin and Ether, respectively.Since March, both Bitcoin and Ether cumulative returns have performed worse than equities markets. This trend follows the argument made by Schiff that “when risk assets go down, Bitcoin goes down more”.However, Bitcoin and Ether returns have shown a high positive correlation in the first 12 days of March, with gold at over 70%, and between 66% and 69.5% with the stock indexes. The lowest correlation was with oil – between 32% and 34%, which has also seen a great decrease in price. This challenges Bitcoin and Ether's role as safe-haven assets during severe market conditions.Nevertheless, if we look at year-to-date returns, even after bloody-Thursday, Bitcoin still holds a better return than other risk assets like the S&P 500 or oil, even though each are negative in this period. Year-to-Date returns for BTC, Gold, Oil, S&P 500, and US Dollar.

immediate liquidity crisis gripping the global markets has subsided.",1 month ago,"On March 14, Tyler Winklevoss, the co-founder and CEO of Gemini and prominent early Bitcoin investor, took to Twitter to defend Bitcoin despite the recent market crash.","In the tweet, Tyler emphasizes that Bitcoin is still in its infancy, stating: “If bitcoin isn't gold 2.0, then what is it? The fact that it's not acting how you might expect only underscores just how early it is.”Supporting Winklevoss’ assertion, Anthony Pompliano, the co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital, has attributed the recent crypto market meltdown to a broader liquidity crisis coursing through the global economy. He said: “Bitcoin and gold are doing the same thing, just as you would expect them to in a liquidity crisis..they go down. Same thing happened to gold during liquidity crisis of 2008 too.”As in 2008, the metals markets have suffered enormous losses as a result of the current liquidity crisis, with gold futures falling 4.25% and silver futures crashing 8% in a single day on India’s markets. Over the past week, gold is down about 10% compared to Bitcoin’s (BTC) 50% while becoming increasingly correlated since January. Bitcoin-gold realized correlation. Source: SkewIn a recent episode of his Off the Chain podcast, Pomp argues that the shutting down of economic activity in response to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic has sparked a liquidity crisis — driving down the prices of Bitcoin and gold despite their status as a safe-haven asset.“A liquidity crisis means that investors all rush to the exit doors at the same time, but there are so many more sellers than buyers that investors actually have a hard time offloading their assets for cash. Quite literally, investors begin aggressively lowering the price they are willing to accept for each asset in exchange for the cash which they are desperately seeking right now.”Pomp points to the 30% crash in the price of gold during the 2008 global financial crisis, stating: “This [wasn’t] because gold is a bad store of value or that it had lost safe-haven status after 5,000 years. It [was] because gold has a liquid market and investors needed liquidity over anything else.”Despite gold’s sudden drop in price, the Morgan Creek Digital co-founder notes that the price of gold nearly tripled in five years from $650 in 2006 to more than $1,800 in 2011 as concerns regarding U.S. monetary policy, inflation, and debt increasingly gripped the markets.“Simply, gold served as a store of value and safe-haven asset over the full timeline of the crisis, but it succumbed to the liquidity crisis during the worst 6 months. This is what I believe is happening to Bitcoin right now.”Pomp asserts that most investors who were holding Bitcoin for cash likely sold over the last week — driving the huge losses recently sustained across the crypto markets. While hesitating to “guarantee” that BTC will not see deeper local price lows, Pomp speculates that most investors who are still holding Bitcoin are “holders of last resort” who will not sell their BTC.“Regardless of price movements in the USD exchange value, the holders of last resort won’t sell their Bitcoin. They are strong hands. They can’t be shaken out of their belief. In fact, they are likely to be buying Bitcoin on these large price drops, rather than selling. They are exchanging USD for Bitcoin right now.”Further, Pompliano expects that the upcoming halving will coincide with the introduction of monetary stimulus measures and may further drive an influx of investors seeking safe-haven exposure. Predicting interest rate cuts and quantitative easing, Pomp expects that investors will soon seek to weather the liquidity crisis by seeking exposure to “sound money” and “safe-haven assets,” adding: “Both gold and Bitcoin should do incredibly well during this time period.” "

Despite the current pullback, technical indicators like the Stock-to-Flow model and the network’s consistent growth in hash rate show that investors have regained a small amount of confidence.","Another factor worth considering is Bitcoin’s mempool size as it also can provide some insight into how buyers and sellers are reacting during these uncertain times.Cryptocurrency market weekly overview. Source: Coin360The mempool is where all the unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions wait until all confirmations are released to conclude each transaction. The higher the mempool size, the longer it takes for transactions to be confirmed since more blocks have to be confirmed (more power input).If a jam occurs in the memory pool due to an abnormal size of transaction waiting to be confirmed, the higher the probability to incur in a higher transaction fee to expedite it promptly.Bitcoin’s mempool size reached a record-high value at over 130MB/block during January 2018, days after Bitcoin price slightly crossed its all-time high at $20,000.Bitcoin Mempool size (in MB/Block) since June 2016-March 2020. Source: Blockchain.comThis could suggest a relationship between the number of transactions waiting to be confirmed and Bitcoin's price. If that is the case, the relationships would be inverse in times of corrections such as the one investors are facing now.Considering a period from Feb. 19 until March 13, when Bitcoin lost 60%, we find that the correlation between the Bitcoin mempool size and its price is negative at -41.2%. This is a very high relationship considering that this correlation for the entire 2020 period available is almost non-significant at 2.34%.A correlation of 100% means that the Bitcoin price and the mempool size move completely in the same direction, while -100% correlation means they are inversely related. A correlation of 0% means that the variables are not related in any way.In correction periods during 2016, where Bitcoin lost more than 20% in price, we find the same negative relationship between the mempool size and Bitcoin price, even though both have a high difference in values — one period is very inversely correlated (-83.1%) and the other period very slightly negative (-4.6%).In the six periods where a correction of up to a 20% decrease in price during 2017 and 2018, we find an inconclusive relationship across the correlations and this makes it impossible to reach a solid conclusion.Correlation between Bitcoin price and its mempool size for different correction periods during 2017However, if we look closely at the two periods that occurred during the second half of 2017 when Bitcoin ended up reaching its record price, both periods show an inverse relationship between the mempool size and Bitcoin price.Between Nov. 8 and Nov. 12, this relationship was very negative (-85.9%), while between Dec. 17 and Dec. 25, the correlation is very small (-5.6%).Correlation between Bitcoin price and its mempool size during 2018 correction periodsDuring 2019, four out of the five correction periods identified showed a positive correlation between the Bitcoin mempool size and its price, except for the last periods, which showed a slight negative correlation.Correlation between Bitcoin price and its mempool size during 2019When considering the relationship during each year instead of only analyzing the corrective periods, we find a clear trend and a positive correlation between the mempool size and Bitcoin’s price. Moreover, a high correlation is seen in 2017 (80.8%) and 2018 (72.2%), despite not being able to draw a conclusive trend when analyzing the correction periods within those years. The positive trend, although small in magnitude, is also seen between both variables in 2016 (26.3%) and 2019 (9.5%). While in 2020, the relationship is practically non-existent (2.34%). Last week, there has been an increase in the mempool size even as Bitcoin’s price is going down. Looking forward, we may see the continuation of this inverse relationship contributes to the uncertainty of Bitcoin’s price in the short-term. As Cointelegraph markets analyst filbfilb recently pointed out:“I just can’t be long while I know there is so much BTC in transit.”The amount of Bitcoin possibly being moved into and out of exchanges in the last week’s raises further doubts about the inverse relationship between the mempool and Bitcoin price.Data for the mempool size drawn from Blockchain.com and prices from coinmarketcap.com.

The best (and worst) quotes, adoption and regulation highlights, leading coins, predictions and much more — a week on Cointelegraph in one link.","It’s fashionable to think that Black Thursday’s bloodbath on the crypto markets was caused by the coronavirus. But Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, disagrees. He believes the pandemic certainly triggered the current global meltdown — but added the mass sell-offs over recent weeks have proved that the world’s economy is far too weak. Many investors are hoarding cash as the uncertainty continues, but Zhao believes they will begin to broaden their portfolios in time. “Have people bought more Bitcoin yet? No, in most cases. Many of them are still panicking over toilet paper,” he said. BTC has come a long way over the past seven days — and, at the time of writing, it’s up by 12%, sitting pretty at about $6,000. This is some way off the highs of $6,900 that were achieved earlier in the week.The debate now is about how closely Bitcoin’s performance is tied to the U.S. stock market. According to research by Santiment, the correlation between BTC and the S&P 500 has now reached a two-year high — a bearish sign for the crypto markets. Historical data shows that such a high correlation is often accompanied by major downturns in BTC’s value. Santiment said: “With this pandemic, we are obviously seeing very similar movements in tandem as the coronavirus justifiably has investors in virtually every sector in a similar state of cautiousness.” Not everyone agrees with this analysis, though. Since the March 13 lows of $3,775, BTC has rallied by about 77%. Compare that with the S&P 500, which has fallen by 7.4%, and the Dow Jones, which is off by about 10% over the same period.Countries around the world are now trying to figure out how to support those who have lost their jobs because of the coronavirus — and how to keep their economies afloat. In the U.S., one Democratic representative in Congress has proposed giving $2,000 a month to every adult — and $1,000 to every child. Other nations are similarly exploring radical measures, with the U.K. recently announcing plans to pay 80% of the wages of workers on furlough. Some in the crypto community have been taken aback by these ideas. Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, told Cointelegraph that the American proposal would cause massive inflation — and would even benefit Bitcoin in the long run if the Democrats won the White House in November.We’ve got a little bit of time to switch gears and cover some different news in this week’s Hodler’s Digest. MakerDAO has added the USDC stablecoin as a third type of collateral, following an emergency vote this week. The move is designed to urgently increase Dai’s liquidity after how last week’s ETH flash crash created bad debt worth millions of dollars.

USDC is pegged to the U.S. dollar and was created by Coinbase and Circle.Bakkt — a platform best known for offering crypto derivatives — is diversifying into retail applications for digital assets.

Unfortunately, it’s unclear how much this new Bakkt feature will be used by Starbucks customers, with the coffee chain closing its locations to eat-in customers because of the coronavirus.At the end of the week, Bitcoin is at $6,093.87, Ether at $128.94 and XRP at $0.15.

Rob Sluymer said that “lower highs and lower lows are in place for Bitcoin” after investors practically fled every asset class — and this leaves it in a “compromised, potentially vulnerable long-term profile.” Looking ahead, he added: “Bitcoin will likely need months of consolidation to repair the technical damage now in place.” Another prediction this week came from eToro analyst Simon Peters, who predicted that the coronavirus crisis could strengthen Bitcoin.A woman has been arrested for stealing 63.5 BTC from the cryptocurrency exchange she had previously co-founded.

The BTC addresses associated with the supposed ‘accelerators’ have absorbed more than 17.6 BTC — taking in nearly $110,000.Opportunistic scammers have sought to capitalize on the COVID-19 pandemic — with UK county regulators, the Texas State Securities Board, and the US Commodity Futures Trade Commission issuing warnings about the proliferation of coronavirus crypto scams over the past week.Recent scams have also impersonated the World Health Organization in an attempt to siphon donations, and taken the form of apps purporting to track the spread of coronavirus."

He wrote:“The crypto breakdown over the past week mirrored the ‘get me out of everything’ panic that dominated all asset classes, whether they were defensive (bonds and gold) or not (equities). [...] Lower highs and lower lows are in place for Bitcoin, leaving in a compromised, potentially vulnerable longer-term profile.”Still, Sluymer admitted that Bitcoin stayed above its 200-week average, which he believes to be a major long-term structural support level for most assets. He also pointed out that this indicator worked for Bitcoin in both 2015 and 2018, adding:“For now, technically we will again give Bitcoin the benefit of the doubt that it is attempting to bottom but recognize Bitcoin will likely need months of consolidation to repair the technical damage now in place.”Vijay Ayyar, the head of business development at crypto exchange Luno, pointed out that there was a major buying pressure for Bitcoin under $5,000, which indicates seller exhaustion:“These prices were potentially below running cost for many miners, and we’ve seen hash rates drop. Miners are also better off just buying Bitcoin at such prices so there could be that aspect as well.”As Bitcoin approaches the expected halving of the block reward in under two months, Ayyar expects the prices will reach $6,500 again before stabilizing between $3,000 and $6,000 until the next bull run, concluding:“This is classic redistribution and would be very healthy for future Bitcoin price action and if we were to have bullish momentum going forward.”As of press time, Bitcoin’s price already broke $6,500 to trade at $6,700, up nearly 20% over the last 24 hours. While the recent cryptocurrency downturn resulted in a loss of confidence in Bitcoin, the rebound that came shortly after shows that optimism has returned among some investors. The founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor, Raoul Pal, recently said that he is quite bullish on Bitcoin after the asset recovered by about 80% in just one week.As Cointelegraph reported earlier today, Italy’s Banco Sella recently launched a Bitcoin trading service as part of its smart banking platform Hype."

He also gambled with tens of thousands of dollars while visiting high-end casinos in Las Vegas.Karanjit was arrested at the McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas on July 18, 2019, while Jagroop later appeared at his arraignment voluntarily.The pair pleaded guilty on Dec. 16, 2019, and were ordered to pay total restitution of $184,511.A number of government regulators have warned of a recent uptick of scams seeking to capitalize on the widespread fears relating to COVID-19. On March 11, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority warned that coronavirus scams may “take many forms and could be about insurance policies, pensions transfers or high-return investment opportunities, including investments in cryptoassets.”Earlier this month, cybersecurity threat researcher DomainTools identified the coronavirus-themed ransomware “CovidLock.” DomainTools found that the website coronavirusapp.site installs ransomware on a users’ device under the guise of providing a thermal map showing the spread of the coronavirus nearby. Once granted permission to access a device's screen settings, the ransomware changes the lock screen password and demands $100 in Bitcoin in exchange for restored access to the phone."

BTC/USD, meanwhile, could have hit $0 if the vicious circle, which the attack triggered had continued, one researcher claimed.“As part of our internal post mortem, the BitMEX team identified 156 accounts for which Last Price stops were clearly erroneously triggered on ETHUSD, caused by the unintended late processing of market orders during the first downtime at 02:16 UTC,” CEO Arthur Hayes confirmed. “For each stop that triggered erroneously during this period, BitMEX calculated the delta to the printed Index Price and refunded the user. A total of 40.297 XBT was refunded.”At current levels, the refunds equate to $217,800.Hayes added that developers were working to shore up the platform’s operations in an attempt to shield it from further DDoS attacks while acknowledging that “no system is immune” to such a threat.Reacting, suspicions continued to run high, with Twitter-based analyst Armin van Bitcoin giving Hayes little room for maneuver.“Ain’t gonna work here. Nice try though,” he responded to the blog post. Additional questions center on BitMEX’s giant insurance fund, which only temporarily decreased in size last week before hitting fresh all-time highs of 36,493 BTC ($197.5 million). The fund, critics argue, should have been used to stem user losses. Addressing the issue, Hayes also took the opportunity to deny accusations that BitMEX had deliberately crashed its own systems.“We operate a fair and efficient platform. Trading downtime degrades the experience for all customers and reduces our stature in the market. It would be against our own interests to fabricate downtime,” he concluded. “That said, it is clear that the community wants to know more about how liquidations interact with the insurance fund, especially in this very demanding scenario. We will share more details about this very soon.”"

An official blog post by bitbank market analyst Yuya Hasegawa reveals that Bitcoin trade volume and account registrations both saw a significant surge in the wake of the crash.Even the number of users going through KYC was above average on the day of the BTC downturn and the following couple of days.Hasegawa contrasts the current situation to the period between November to December 2018 when the price of Bitcoin ground down. In that case, “interest in the crypto market as a whole went down and bitbank’s daily account registrations took a hit.”However, the price saw a 60% rebound while sustaining high volumes soon after the recent crash, which suggests to Hasegawa “the intent to buy the dip is quite obvious”:“When we take the increased daily account registrations into consideration, we can once again deduce that the current market recovery is driven largely by retail investors. Furthermore, as Forbes reports, this phenomenon is likely to be global, as Kraken, a San Francisco-based crypto exchange, experienced a steep increase in account registrations after March 12.”In just under 49 days, BTC will experience a halving where the block reward will decrease to 6.25 BTC. The last time this happened was in 2016.Hasegawa writes that data from Google Trends suggests that investors in Japan and around the world are well aware of the possible price impact of the halving and will seize on any price drop to add to their holdings:“There is a good chance that, for this time around, there are many retail investors who want to buy Bitcoin or stack up their holdings at the cheapest price possible before its halving.”"

Source: TradingViewOn the shorter, 4-hour timeframe, traders will notice that the RSI remains flat as buy and sell volume decrease and Bitcoin trades within a narrowing range between $5,517 and $5,021. Some traders would argue that the short-term frame supports a bullish case for Bitcoin as each 4-hour candlestick has formed a lower-high as price descends lower but the moving average convergence divergence, Stochastic RSI and RSI trend upward, and the MACD histogram shows an increase in positive momentum. Such bullish divergences have been the signal du jour for crypto traders for some time and the drop in trading volume and tightening Bollinger Bands also signal that an explosive move is bound to occur before the weekly close. Currently, the price is pinned beneath $5,500 where there is a high volume node on the volume profile visible range (VPVR) and there is support at $5,200 and $4,850. If Bitcoin price could push above $5,500 there is open-air overhead and the price could rise to $7,650 but this is dependent on sustained volume and traders' confidence that the event which catalyzed to drop to $3,770 has ended. The current price action suggests that traders are taking profits as the range top is reached instead of opening long positions and buying on breakouts. BTC USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewIf the price can break above the $5,500 resistance and reclaim the former support at $6,300 to $6,400 this would be an encouraging step. As mentioned earlier, given Bitcoin’s oversold position and the volume gap from $5,500 to $7,650 could easily be exploited by a high volume spike. Such a move would set the price back in the $7,750 range Bitcoin traded in prior to last week’s meltdown and also set the asset up for a move back to $8,500. As shown by the daily time frame, losing the $5,200 support would be far less than ideal, even though the price Bitcoin bounced higher when the price dropped to $3,770 on March 13. BTC USDT daily chart.

Below this level, the price of Bitcoin would look to form a double bottom at $3,384 and $3,177. One must remember that while not uncharacteristic of the sector, Bitcoin price is being heavily impacted by the financial crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic. As the situation grows worse, investors expected that the markets will worsen and so a self-fulfilling cycle driven by fear and threat or long-term economic slowdown impact asset prices. Over the coming weeks, one should expect to see a series of multilateral stimulus packages launched by various governments, thus as equities markets possibly rise from financial bailouts, investor sentiment for risk-on assets, commodities and stocks could improve. Until then, it might be wise to either wait along the sidelines until a bottom is found in traditional markets or for those trading, play clearly defined ranges and rest in cash by the closing market bell or bedtime each day. Obviously, some Bitcoin investors will advise taking long positions and accumulating as a range develops but with the current global economic uncertainty, perhaps it is better for those with limited capital to rest in cash in order to live to trade another day. The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

A Chainalysis report found professional traders and investors were usually the drivers behind recent major price movements, despite only moving about 5% of the total supply of Bitcoin.David took issue with the vague label of “professional trader/investor”. He reminded us that traditional or institutional players are not the only ones who can drive the market with high volume trades:“I think that probably you’ve seen an onboarding in 2016/2017 of a traditional, probably institutional, fund class to some degree but not very large, right. But still prior to that this was a very small market and I think that it’s still probably mostly dominated by early larger crypto whales, right.”Since the beginning of March Bitcoin has been heavily correlated with large movements in the stock market. When asked if the Bitcoin price drops in the past two weeks were the result of professional players liquidating their positions, Simon nodded his head in agreement.He went on to explain how this shedding of weak hands could allow Bitcoin to eventually evolve into a hedge asset:“We’ve seen this conversion of assets into cash, regardless of which market it is, but there will come a point where, due to this increasing amount that’s been pumped into the system, the cash is going to lose its value. Then as the virus no doubt stems down and the number of new cases that are being reported tails off, the question to investors then is, ‘what do I do with all this cash that I have?’ And then they may look into other assets that can hedge against that, essentially, with crypto possibly being one of them.”If you enjoyed this latest crypto market update, hit the Like button and subscribe to our YouTube channel for more weekly crypto content!"

hedge against banks may grow in face of economic meltdown.",1 month ago,"Philip Salter, head of operations at Genesis Mining, believes that economic meltdown may lead to a growing value for Bitcoin as a hedge against the banks.","In the last couple of weeks, there has been a lot of turmoil in the Bitcoin world. There was a rapid decline in hashrate, followed by an even more precipitous price drop. This was particularly troublesome in view of the impending halving.Cointelegraph has had an in-depth conversation on these topics with one of the most prominent figures in the Bitcoin mining space, Phil Salter.Speaking on whether miners played a major role in the recent market decline, Salter observed:“It’s no different from traditional markets, you have to sell everything to keep the operations going, to pay off your debts. As a miner you have bills to pay, you have to pay for electricity, for operations; and your expenses are in dollars, so as the price of bitcoin is dropping, it means you have to sell more of your inventory just to keep going.”Up to a point, it’s a snowball effect — as price falls, miners are forced to sell more of their inventory, and as they are selling more — the surplus in supply drags the price further down.  However, there is a point when for a given miner, it makes more sense to shut off electricity and halt production until markets begin to recover.One of Bitcoin’s most popular narratives has always tried to portray it as the new gold. However, Bitcoin has been breaking away from that narrative by following the trajectory of the traditional markets. Whether this latest reversal will continue largely depends on the severity of the crisis, Salter believes:“If this economic crisis is contained, then it will not have major implications for Bitcoin. However, if there is a real collapse, then the interest in Bitcoin will explode. It will go back to being seen as a hedge against the banking system. The more skepticism people will have in the old economy, the more they will flock to Bitcoin.”With the third Bitcoin having just 53 days away, things are about to get even more interesting."

when the SEC might approve a Bitcoin ETF, stablecoins, and whether ...",1 month ago,Several investment firm executives have debated the likelihood of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) licensing a U.S.-based Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) during a CNBC broadcast on March 7.,"The discussion follows the SEC’s recent rejection of its last pending Bitcoin ETF application. Wilshire Phoenix had first filed the application for its proposed ‘United States Bitcoin and Treasury Investment Trust’ with the SEC during January 2019. Despite amending their application six times in 13 months, the SEC rejected Wilshire Phoenix’s ETF, citing concerns about manipulation of Bitcoin’s market, and limited investor protections.Chris Hempstead, the director of institutional business development at ETF and hedge fund provider IndexIQ, predicts that a Bitcoin ETF will come as retail demand for the product grows.“I doubt very heavily that it’s going to be the last straw,” Hempstead stated. “I think everyone will continue to listen to the feedback and the notes from the SEC, what their comments are, and they will continue to address it.”Despite predicting that the commission will reconsider its stance if faced with widespread demand in coming years, Hempstead does not predict “any significant changes to the SEC’s decision in the near future.”“At some point, when market demand and investor demand pushes the pendulum to a certain area, they will probably take another look at it and have different kinds of considerations.”Nick Colas, the co-founder of investment analysis firm DataTrek Research, expressed skepticism at the prospect of the SEC licensing a Bitcoin ETF any time soon.“You will see a central bank cryptocurrency before you will see a Bitcoin ETF,” he stated.When asked whether stablecoins make “imminent sense” to consumers, Hempstead responded: “I think you’re onto something.”Hempstead predicts stablecoins and other cryptocurrency products will become regulated as the sector matures and the public gain a greater understanding of the inner workings of distributed ledger technology (DLT).“I think that maybe part of what they’re waiting for is a little bit more structure and oversight into the operational complexity of cryptocurrency transactions [...] I think when we start to see more risk diversification, and more understanding about how these various products, not just Bitcoin, how they operate - I think that’s probably what’s needed at the Commission level.”According to Dan Wiener, the chairman of Adviser Investments and the senior editor of The Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors, business adoption of blockchain technology is “more important” than cryptocurrency.Wiener dismissed the notion that there is a need for Bitcoin altogether, arguing that payment platforms like Venmo have attracted far greater adoption than cryptocurrencies.“Do we really need bitcoin? I’m not a drug dealer. I’m not worried about moving money [...] We have many, many ways to move money around, I don’t know that we need to be able to hide ourselves, or our identities.”"

stablecoin Tether (USDT) are charged with manipulating the Bitcoin 
market ...",1 month ago,"The iFinex–Tether market manipulation lawsuit continues. Last week, Judge Katherine Failla of the Southern District of New York selected Roche Cyrulnik Freedman as interim lead plaintiff counsel, and four civil actions were consolidated into a single class action: Leibowitz v. iFinex Inc. ","In the complaints, iFinex’s subsidiary, Bitfinex, and related stablecoin Tether (USDT) are charged with manipulating the Bitcoin market in 2017 — something the firm strenuously denied.This isn’t shaping up as an ordinary civil action. As Failla observed in announcing her lead counsel decision on Feb. 27 via a telephone conference call, she claimed that the case combines old and new:“The cryptocurrency law is quite novel [with] lots of issues and not a lot of resolution, but there is a lot of established law out there as well with respect to pleading requirements, with respect to traditional antitrust issues and RICO and the Commodities Exchange Act.”The case has reached an inflection point where the plaintiff groups that had been competing among themselves for primacy must now coalesce and confront iFinex Inc. directly. It’s a good time to ask: What sort of challenges await the litigants? Felix Shipkevich, an attorney specializing in cryptocurrency-related legal and regulatory matters at Shipkevich PLLC, told Cointelegraph: “I am pessimistic that they [i.e., plaintiffs] will be able to overcome the hurdle of proving market manipulation of a decentralized currency like Bitcoin.” The scope of market manipulation can differ from industry to industry, said Shipkevich. It’s one thing to prove market manipulation with commodities futures but another to prove it with equity securities. Cryptocurrencies are still so new that it isn’t clear which way the courts will lean with regard to market manipulation.“Price manipulation claims under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) are difficult to prove,” according to a statement to Cointelegraph by Anne Termine, an attorney with Covington & Burling LLP and former chief trial attorney for the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) enforcement division. She added: “Proving a price manipulation charge where Bitcoin is the underlying commodity just adds another layer of complexity.” In proving market manipulation, there are typically four “prongs,” or factors, that have to be taken into account, said Shipkevich. Two of these may be problematic for the plaintiffs: Was there deceptive intent to manipulate the market? In other words, did people collude to move the price of a commodity up or down? Because of the decentralized nature of crypto exchanges and ledgers, this could be difficult to prove in the case of Bitcoin.Another factor is market dominance. A firm typically has to be able to dominate a market to manipulate it. If one buys up all the crypto in an initial coin offering, that’s a closed loop, and the path to dominating or monopolizing that market becomes a real possibility, said Shipkevich. But how do you prove price dominance with regard to BTC, which had a market capitalization of $166 billion on March 6? It might be difficult. Termine added to the notion: “Price manipulation requires proof of the ability to create/cause artificial prices and proof that the defendants, in fact, caused the price of the futures contract — the Bitcoin futures contract, in this case — to be artificial. While facts can be used to establish the requisite specific intent and the ability to cause artificial prices, proving an artificial price did, in fact, occur can often be a difficult and technical but-for analysis.”What seems clear, however, is that Tether continues to play an outsized role in Bitcoin trading. In December 2019, BTC trading into USDT represented 76.2% of total BTC volume traded into fiat currencies or stablecoins, according to CryptoCompare’s Exchange Review December 2019. It’s been even higher in the past and suggests at least the possibility of leverage if not dominance. As Ohio State Professor John Griffin told Newsweek in November: “Crypto can be pushed around easily by big whales.” In a statement sent to Cointelegraph, Tether General Counsel Stuart Hoegner vehemently denied any wrongdoing: “Tether and its affiliates have never used Tether tokens or issuances to manipulate the cryptocurrency market or token pricing. All Tether tokens are fully backed by reserves and are issued pursuant to market demand and not for the purpose of controlling the pricing of crypto assets.”Sidharth Sogani, founder and CEO of Crebaco Global Inc., a crypto and blockchain credit rating and audit firm, told Cointelegraph that stablecoins, in general, are detrimental to both cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies because they “create manipulation and creation of artificial wealth, resulting in economic inflation.”As for Tether, specifically, the company is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, which doesn’t inspire confidence from a regulatory compliance standpoint, Sogani said. The British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands’ country risk assessment is Category C, per Crebaco’s standards, adding:“There are more chances of frauds, MLMs [multi-level marketing schemes] and scams arising out of these countries due to the lack of regulations for digital assets.”Since 2014, iFinex–Tether has been essentially self-regulated. In its intelligence reports, Crebaco uncovers serious flaws in USDT’s compliance, reserves and circulation throughout many exchanges and wallets, Sogani informed Cointelegraph.In October, Shipkevich told Cointelegraph that he was not surprised that a class-action lawsuit had been brought forth against both Tether and Bitfinex, considering the legal pursuit these entities have been facing by the New York attorney general over the past year. The New York State Attorney General’s office has been investigating the company for potential securities and commodities fraud after the company allegedly moved Tether reserves over to affiliate exchange Bifinex after it lost $850 million earmarked for user redemptions. In a Dec. 13 filing, lawyers for Bifinex and Tether said that the NYAG didn’t have the authority to investigate the companies because “Tethers are not securities or commodities.”The issues in the current case aren’t entirely clear, and this may have figured in Failla’s selection of Roche Cyrulnik Freedman as lead plaintiff counsel. According to the transcript of the telephone conference, the judge had four criteria in mind for picking a lead counsel: “The work that counsel has done, the experience of counsel, the knowledge of the applicable law, and the resources that have or will be committed.” Here, any of the three competing firms would have sufficed, she said.Related: Top Cryptocurrencies Are Exponentially More Liquid Than Ever BeforeThe definition of the injured class differed among some of the firms, however. As reported by Cointelegraph, two of the vying legal groups — Roche Cyrulnik Freedman LLP and Kirby Mcinerney LLP — defined the class action of their respective injured parties in a broad sense, while a third, Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP, restricted its class definition to investors in Bitcoin and Bitcoin futures. According to Brian Cochrane of Robbins Geller:“Roche defined it as anyone who owned crypto over the last six years. That’s overwrought — much too broad. Bitcoin and Bitcoin futures are closer to my definition of the class. Not all cryptos should be included. That would simply be taking money from real victims and giving it to others.”Failla, however, decided against this more restricted definition of the injured class: “I can't agree with a class as narrow as that initially defined by the Robbins Geller firm, and my concern here is they're cutting off the line too soon into the matter.” Robbins Geller was thus eliminated. Next, Failla had to choose between Roche and Kirby. This was close a call, she recounted, but after looking at the firms’ work products in other cases, the judge felt that the Roche firm would “best illuminate the issues, new and old, that I believed are going to be implicated by this litigation… So, I am granting their motion for appointment as interim lead plaintiff counsel.”Is this likely to be a significant case for the crypto world? “Generally, yes,” answered Shipkevich, but not as significant as some other cases, like Telegram or others involving the Securities and Exchange Commission, CFTC or the states. “This case is in such an early stage that it is difficult to say if it will be a precedent case for market manipulation in the crypto world.” According to Sogani, USDT remains the largest stablecoin by far and is listed on all the major exchanges and wallets. “Any [court] decision will impact the industry directly.” Furthermore, Termine told Cointelegraph:“There are some courts that have found that Bitcoin is a commodity in interstate commerce, but it is by no means a settled issue. It does help that the agency responsible for enforcing the CEA, the CFTC, has publicly taken the position that Bitcoin is a commodity. How a jury will see the issue is not a certainty. As such, any decision by the court on each of these issues will be closely watched by the industry.”The case is complex, Termine added, and the charges here go beyond price manipulation — they also include fraudulent manipulation. Then, what has to be alleged and proven in private lawsuits, like this one, is often different from what is required when a government agency like the CFTC brings an action. Related: Tether Stablecoin: Can the Crypto Market Live Without It?Shipkevich wouldn’t venture to say whether a settlement — as opposed to a court decision — in this case, is likely. “But if I were Tether, I’d be litigating until I ran out of money. To settle would be to declare open hunting season,” he told Cointelegraph. The firm could expect to be besieged by lawsuits. One can expect that the defense, led by Walden Macht & Haran LLP, will now file a motion to dismiss the case. This process, which would culminate in an oral argument before Failla, might take six months. If the defense prevails, iFinex–Tether wins the case. If the plaintiff group survives the motion, however, things could really heat up. Plaintiffs take depositions, they gain access to trading data, and all sorts of scenarios could emerge. When Cointelegraph asked iFinex Inc. to comment for this story, a company spokesperson replied: “We have no further comment at this time beyond our most recent statement and look forward to putting the facts before the court, and addressing the baseless allegations in the judicial forum.” The SEC and CFTC both agree that Bitcoin is a commodity and should be regulated as such — and there is established law to determine if and when the price of a commodity has been manipulated. However, Bitcoin isn’t a material commodity like oil or silver, and as recently as October, CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert speculated that a cryptocurrency could move from being a security to a commodity and “change back and forth.” Cryptocurrency law, too, is still “novel,” as Failla observed — i.e., it is a work in progress. It comes as no surprise, then, that proving price manipulation — in regard to something as elusive as BTC — might be a challenging task for the aggrieved parties in this case."

Satoshi strongly opposed WikiLeak’s adoption of the cryptocurrency, but it was too late:“No, don't ""bring it on"". The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way. I make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a small beta community in its infancy. You would not stand to get more than pocket change, and the heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage.”Hoskinson states that he does not know the rationale behind Wikipedia’s hostility towards his project, despite it being “the most cited of all of the peer reviewed coins”:“We don't know why there's hostility where coins like SpankChain can have an article on Wikipedia. A lot of other cryptocurrencies and top 15, top 20 apparently have articles and that's perfectly fine.

Other projects like Dogecoin (DOGE), GridCoin (GRC), and PotCoin (POT) do have one, however. Most of the top ten projects, including Bitcoin Cash (BCH), have one too.Source: CointelegraphHoskinson confirmed to Cointelegraph that the censorship comes exclusively from Wikipedia’s English language editors, noting that there are Cardano wiki entries in German, Estonian, Italian, Japanese, Dutch, Portuguese, Romanian and Russian. Crypto censorship has recently been on the rise.

advantage, with significant adverse effects on Bitcoin, this problem ...",1 month ago,Bitcoin (BTC) miners openly using AsicBoost are now comprising 63% of its network hashrate. This vindicates community concerns from 2017 that accused Bitmain of using the “covert” version of AsicBoost.,"The statistic was highlighted on March 9 by Bitmex Research, building on a similar report from December 2018. Though the overt AsicBoost was only used by 30% of miners at the time, the analysts argued that the 2017 controversy was largely settled. They wrote:“If covert AsicBoost was used by some miners to obtain a secret advantage, with significant adverse effects on Bitcoin, this problem now appears mostly solved.”Bitmain was the target of strong criticism from notable Bitcoiners in 2017 after it allegedly introduced covert AsicBoost into its hardware. The company was also chastised for opposing the network’s Segregated Witness (SegWit) upgrade — a proposal which would have limited the usefulness of their covert AsicBoost tactics.AsicBoost is the name of a technique developed by cryptography experts, Timo Hanke and Sergio Lerner. The solution was patented under a framework named “Blockchain Defensive Patent License,” which was specifically designed to limit competitive advantages in mining and preserve network security.In a Proof of Work system, miners must generate a cryptographic hash of some important block information, which is contained in the block header. In order to make it a difficult task, the hash must satisfy the “difficulty” condition, which generally requires it to be lower than a certain number. Since hash functions are completely unpredictable, the only way to satisfy the condition is to simply try many different combinations of input data.AsicBoost exploits the fact that Bitcoin block hashes are created from separate chunks of 64 bytes of data. Since the entire header is 80 bytes, there are two chunks that need to be hashed during the mining procedure.Structure of a block header. Source: Bitmex ResearchWith the technique, one of the chunks can remain unmodified over multiple hashing attempts, which saves resources. The difference between overt and covert AsicBoost lies in which chunk is kept unchanged. Under overt AsicBoost, the “version” bytes are used as an extra nonce to modify the resulting hash. Thus, the second chunk does not change for a number of attempts.With covert AsicBoost, miners need to shuffle or even remove transactions in order to keep the last four bytes of the Merkle root — the signature of the block’s transactions — unchanged.While the latter technique is less efficient, it is more difficult to detect and thus would allow a miner to maintain a competitive advantage. Crucially, the activation of SegWit would have broken the exploit.In April 2017, news broke that Bitmain had implemented the covert AsicBoost exploit in its hardware. The discovery was made by Gregory Maxwell, at the time CTO of Blockstream.The findings were used by the community to allege that Jihan Wu — Bitmain CEO and strong SegWit critic — had ulterior motives for his position. AsicBoost was estimated to increase mining performance by 20-30%. Andreas Antonopolous and others argued that covert AsicBoost would eventually destabilize the network, as some miners would have an unfair advantage. The ever-increasing figure of overt AsicBoost miners, currently at about 63%, means that the advantage of using it covertly is dwindling. Even if there are fewer incentives of foul play now, in a conversation with Cointelegraph, Kristy Leigh-Minehan noted that Bitmain “cleaned up its act” in preparation for the initial public offering (IPO). The initial plans of the 2018 IPO were thwarted by a protracted bear market. Though a new attempt in late 2019 was discovered, internal company issues prevented it from continuing.The pressure from the Bitcoin halving has allegedly forced Bitmain to slash over 50% of its staff. Even though some may have hoped for a halving-induced rally, the already-significant cut may not be enough to sustain the company amid a global market panic just two months before the upcoming block reward decrease."

Governments are making drastic interventions to save equities markets ...",1 month ago,"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold with dire consequences across the globe, desperate measures to keep the economy afloat continue to be taken by world governments. Currently the most notable example is the U.S., which recently announced an unlimited quantitative easing program and also reached an agreement for a $2 trillion stimulus package.","The unlimited quantitative easing process will entail the Federal Reserve purchasing assets “in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning” and after the announcement was made Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied almost 10% from $6,300 to $6,900. At the moment, Bitcoin has dropped to $6,630 and crypto markets have remained fairly stable throughout the day.Crypto market data.

Gold price dropped by more than 12% in 10 days but has since recovered to the $1,620-$1,680 price range seen between February 20 and March 9. SILVER USD/m2 chart. Source: TradingViewMeanwhile silver has hit its generational low against the US dollar when money supply adjusted, a figure to keep in mind while the Fed prints billions of dollars. In the last 3 days, silver has seen modest gains, surging from $12 to $14.5.As the U.S. government sets out to spend billions of dollars this week, stock markets reacted positively and the S&P 500 rallied over 9% on March 24, the biggest daily surge since 2008. The Fed’s QE efforts may prop up stock prices for now but the long-term consequences will likely have a significant impact on the economy for years to come. While stock markets are currently reclaiming some of the ground lost during the past two weeks, the worst may be yet to come as the total impact of the Coronavirus and its effects on the population and on the economy are not yet visible. At the time of writing the number of newly confirmed cases is growing at an alarming rate. Just yesterday, in the U.S. the number of confirmed cases grew by 10,270 to a total of 54,453. At this rate, the total number of confirmed cases in the U.S. may soon overtake China’s.Cumulative total number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. Source: CDCAs for Bitcoin price, it is showing stability and painting higher highs and lower lows on the daily time frame. It seems likely that Bitcoin will continue to hold its own as the dollar inflates, although it’s worth noting that today's difficulty adjustment may cause the digital asset to lose value as mining becomes cheaper.BTC USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewTo the surprise of many investors, precious metals had been falling alongside global equity markets which on March 9 saw their worst performance since the 2008 financial crisis. However, this isn’t entirely new for gold or silver. In 2008, safe-haven assets behaved similarly, dropping alongside stocks and rallying after the announcement of the Fed's quantitative easing program. For the time being, gold and silver seem to be back to providing security for traders and Bitcoin has been following the lead by holding its own in what could be its biggest test as a unique asset class so far. The Fed’s unprecedented new measures highlight one of the primary value propositions of decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, the issuance rate cannot be tampered with.As the current global financial meltdown has demonstrated, precious metals also have their weaknesses. On March 23, three of the world’s largest gold refineries announced that they would stop production for at least a week in order to comply with requests by local authorities. How this will weigh on price is yet to be determined.  Bitcoin, on the other hand, operates on a decentralized system that ensures that no geo-specific event can alter its production. Unlike precious metals, Bitcoin’s system allows miners to leave and join the network without severely impacting the amount of Bitcoin mined.Over the past month the U.S. Dollar has also seen steady gains throughout the crisis due to the market participants quick exit from stocks and other risk-on assets. So far DXY has risen 6.35% in March but it has fallen by nearly 1% since the Fed’s announcement of unlimited QE. Coincidentally, Bitcoin is set to have its next halving event in April which will lower its issuance rate drop from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC every ten minutes. This means the supply will increase less than 2% per year, and will drop to less than 1% after 2024, a rate which is similar to the average rate of increase of the gold supply.As the Fed sets out to print an unlimited supply of dollars, Bitcoin is in a prime position to become the next ultimate store of value currency as its issuance rate remains relatively unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the upcoming halving continues as programmed. The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

This effectively means that nearly 16 million people are now severely restricted in their movement as bars, schools, sports competitions and travel is shut down. As Cointelegraph has reported, Italy has been especially hard hit by COVID-19 and to date 366 have died and more than 7,000 have been diagnosed with the virus. On the same day, France also banned all gatherings of more than 1,000 people in an effort to stem the spread of Coronavirus as 19 people have already died and more than 1,126 have been infected. Obviously, Bitcoin price has not been spared the carnage inflicted upon equities markets and at the time of publishing the digital asset is plunging below $8,000 to mark a new low at $7,675. For weeks, analysts cautioned that a drop below the crucial support at $9,400 would lead to a strong downside move and the March 7 rejection at $9,150 catalyzed the start of the pullback, which has now completed the right shoulder of the head and shoulders pattern on the daily time frame. Surprisingly, the price sliced right through the 200-day moving average, 128-MA, $8,400 support and key support at $8,200. BitMEX XBTUD Liquidations.

The Fed rate is now 1.25%, with more cuts forecast this year.The pound immediately reacted, shedding 0.5% against the US dollar, to subsequently recoup some of the losses. While Bitcoin (BTC) failed to react, supporters of the cryptocurrency maintain that stimulating spending and borrowing by lowering rates is just one practice laying the foundation for the long-term ruin of the fiat economy.To avoid recessions, a key fear of Keynesian economists, governments aim to increase spending while applying incentives such as tax cuts for businesses.Additional spending against a backdrop of less income can only happen via the use of measures such as increasing the money supply, further debasing fiat currencies.Nonetheless, Bitcoin’s lackluster reaction to the coronavirus crisis caught many by surprise. Among them was John Bollinger, creator of the Bollinger Bands trading indicator, who on Tuesday said that recent losses were unexpected.“Bitcoin fell victim to the COVID-19 panic. I truly did not see that coming, I thought it might act as a safe haven asset,” he tweeted.In another post, he added:“Safe-haven-ness is a matter of perception, not fact.

ripples through the French crypto community, and beyond. This may seem ...",1 month ago,"The Commercial Court of Nanterre’s Feb. 26 ruling that Bitcoin (BTC) is a fungible, intangible asset sent some ripples through the French crypto community, and beyond. This may seem surprising, given that this was a lower court decision and, moreover, one that did not declare BTC a currency or fiat money — as some news stories reported — but just a fungible asset like money. ","The ruling is “an important milestone for further development of the crypto market, particularly in France,” Roman Matkovskyy — associate professor at the Rennes School of Business — told Cointelegraph. “The French court’s characterization of Bitcoin as financial instrument could be an important development in the legitimization of the cryptocurrency,” added John Wagster, an attorney at Frost Brown Todd LLC, in a statement to Cointelegraph, “but the real significance of the ruling will be determined by if and how it is incorporated into France’s regulatory regime.” Wagster added that the French court has moved the first chess piece, and it will be interesting to see how the French regulatory authorities respond. Christopher Giancarlo, senior counsel at Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP and former chairman of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission, told Cointelegraph that he believes that the ruling will probably have an impact in France and perhaps elsewhere, as in the E.U., adding:“Broadly, legally speaking, how an asset is legally defined is the starting point for how it will be regulated.” Hubert de Vauplane, an attorney at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP, told Cointelegraph that because in its decision that the tribunal claimed that Bitcoin is a fungible and intangible asset, “consequently, Bitcoin lending only requires the borrower to repay Bitcoins of the same type, quality and quantity to the lender (absent specific provisions to the contrary in the loan agreement).” As a result, any gains or advantages accruing to the borrower during the lifetime of the loan can be retained by the borrower. In this instance, the French judges confirmed that because a hard fork leading to the creation of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) occurred during the period of the loan, the borrower is able to keep the BCH received during this time. The matter of fungibility seems arcane, but it goes to the heart of the decision. An asset is fungible if it is interchangeable. A grain of rice or a U.S. dollar can be substituted for each another — whatever their origin is — because they are fungible. By comparison, people or works of art or customized sailboats are not interchangeable because they are non-fungible.If BTC had been ruled by the tribunal to be non-fungible, “it would be a disaster for the market,” said Vauplane, in particular for any future BTC lending or borrowing activities. It would mean the BTC borrower would have to return to the lender the self-same assortment of BTC — i.e., with the same crypto addresses — which, of course, is absurd. “This decision appears to be applicable to any other fungible cryptocurrency or token,” added Vauplane, concluding that “it’s a lower-court decision, but a quality legal decision.” It can still be overturned — by an appeals court, for instance.Still, in the crypto world, institutional recognition is important, even if comes from a lower-level European commerce court. “This ruling in France should legitimize crypto further and could encourage more adoption and new entrants into crypto even if it does not become law,” Rob Odell, co-president and chief product officer of Salt Lending, told Cointelegraph, adding: “France is the 7th largest economy in the world by GDP, so it certainly is likely to influence other markets, especially in the EU, initially. In such a new and emerging market and technology like Bitcoin, regulators around the world do look to how other countries' regulators are viewing cryptocurrencies. So, any ruling France makes will be closely observed by regulators worldwide.” In France, the ruling has created excitement with regard to new business possibilities. According to Matkovskyy, “Bitcoin lending now falls under the ‘consumer loan’ [designation], meaning [it is] a transfer of loaned ownership property to the borrower. [...] It will facilitate Bitcoin transactions, including lending and repo — i.e., repurchase agreements — a form of short-term borrowing — transactions.” Matkovskyy went on to add:“It can potentially create a new competition among the banks and stimulate further development of the Bitcoin market. It is estimated that lending accounts for 80% of total value locked in DeFi. Thus, it can potentially unlock some part of it.”Not everyone was ready to pronounce this a milestone case, however. “I‘m wondering where the news is in this court decision,” Michael Reuter, co-chairman of the European Blockchain Association, told Cointelegraph: “From my perspective, rather than the classification of the unit, the handling of commercial (proprietary) trading of Bitcoin and other coins is of more importance.” Back in 2014, Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, or BaFin, declared Bitcoin a financial instrument in the form of units of account pursuant to the German Banking Act, explained Reuter. But in early March 2020, BaFin stopped the operations of a Berlin-based company that allowed consumers to buy and sell cryptocurrencies through ATMs. The regulator’s enforcement action was arguably more decisive than any legal definition of BTC.Regulators may be as important as courts or even legislatures when it comes to determining future permissible crypto activities, said Angela Angelovska-Wilson, co-founder and chief legal officer of Sila transaction network. “[The U.S. state of] Wyoming passed a bill in 2019 adding further legal clarification on digital assets and cryptocurrencies to encourage blockchain businesses to set up shop in Wyoming, but this has not yet not had a major impact on US federal regulations,” she told Cointelegraph. “It all depends on the importance that a regulatory agency gives to a court ruling.” But that doesn’t necessarily mean the Nanterre ruling is inconsequential. “What the French court ruling might do is pave the way for more clear and transparent investment rules concerning Bitcoin itself,” suggested Wagster.In the U.S., the legal definition of BTC has basically been settled, Giancarlo told Cointelegraph. Since 2015, the CFTC has recognized digital currencies as commodities, and the legal definition of Bitcoin as a commodity has been supported in the courts. So, the Nanterre court ruling is probably “not so important in the U.S.” at least with regard to BTC. However, the definition of other cryptocurrencies is less settled.Crypto regulation in France, as in the U.S., appears to be evolving organically. This approach has the advantage that it is less likely to stifle technological innovation. But it can be confusing. As Carol Goforth, a law professor at the University of Arkansas, told Cointelegraph in August: “Regulatory authority in the U.S. is split among too many diverse agencies, and they all have their missions and their interests to assert.”The Crypto-Currency Act of 2020 — a bill introduced on March 9, 2020 — by U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ), for instance, classifies digital assets into three categories: crypto-commodity, crypto-currency and crypto-security. Under the proposed legislation, these three categories would be governed, respectively, by the CFTC, the Secretary of the Treasury via the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and the Securities and Exchange Commission.Related: Hester Peirce Says SEC Is a Partner to Crypto, as US States Chase Regulations“Interestingly, the language of the bill would seem to cement the status of digital assets like Bitcoin as crypto-commodities rather than crypto-currencies,” reported Cointelegraph. By comparison, stablecoins would probably fall into the currencies basket. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service, for its part, considers BTC to be property rather than currency, noted Odell, going back to 2014. In 2020, for the first time, federal tax forms began asking about taxpayers’ Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency activities:“While this does mention crypto as a ‘virtual currency,’ this does not change Bitcoin’s status to a currency in the eyes of the IRS,” said Odell, adding that it does mean the IRS is starting to regulate crypto — which is good for the crypto industry.Related: Bitcoin Is Property, Chinese Court Rules — No Crypto Ban ContradictionElsewhere, a Chinese court concluded in July 2019 that Bitcoin should be considered digital property — not a currency. Japan, meanwhile, went the other way, recognizing Bitcoin and other cryptos as “money” in 2016. In the end, the actual classification of BTC in the Nanterre court case may be less important than the mere fact that it is being classified. “Bitcoin is already considered a financial instrument by many throughout the world,” affirmed Wagster, adding:“The recognition by the court of a major European economy carries particular weight. The nomenclature the court uses is not important, but the fact that Bitcoin now falls into a category of financial instruments that will likely be monitored and regulated by the French government is significant.”Additionally, Cred CEO Dan Schatt told Cointelegraph that this ruling could have a deeper meaning behind it in the long run: “The fact that an OECD country is recognizing BTC as an ‘interchangeable’ [i.e., fungible] asset is progress — it’s a wake-up call to banks, institutional investors and regulators that Bitcoin is here to stay. Whether it will actually be used as money is less important than the institutional recognition this will bring, which inevitably leads to an inflow of funds for this asset class.”"

The outfit reported a mere six incidents in 2018, while 2019 yielded 115 accounts, the statement detailed.One report showed ransomware efforts in which a hacker locked down all of a user’s business data. They then demanded bitcoin as payment for unlocking the data, threatening to increase the price tag for restoration if the victim did not pay up within a certain timeframe.Another report showed a perpetrator threatening to release private information into the public if a victim did not send over BTC.Reports showed several regions with high Bitcoin-related crime numbers. These included 89 accounts from the Greater Manchester Police, 82 from Hertfordshire, and 21 from Leicestershire.“The rising tide of digital financial crime will bring a shiver down the spine of consumers, who are already acutely aware of the risk of fraud and blackmail from malicious hackers,” Retail Financial Consulting CEO Andrew Martin said in the statement, adding:These incidents underline the risks associated with online currencies, which are often an easy way for anonymous third parties to extort money from victims, without detection.Martin also added a note for the future. “Moving forward, it’s time for the big banks to recognise that the aggressive push towards a cashless society is forcing many people to experiment with new forms of investment, some of which come with significant risks,” he said, including,“Restricting consumer access to cash limits choice, leaving many people in our society behind and in an increasingly dangerous online world, this can only be a bad thing.”By the numbers, Bitcoin demands represented around 4% of all blackmail attempts in the U.K. between 2018 - 2019. The other 96% of cases involved demands for traditional fiat currencies."

Traders should target $0.06 as the next support level in that case. Such a downwards would be combined by a deep drop on the BTC pair, as discussed previously. However, such a drop would also be caused due to weakness in the cryptomarkets in general.  The price movements are comparable to the movements in the previous cycle, as the price of XRP retraced back to the support level prior to the deep surge in the last cycle too.

Yes, there are some movements needed to create some bullish momentum.First of all, the price needs to hold the $0.145 level for support, after which the resistances at $0.182 and $0.20 needs to be cleared to the upside. The moment that XRP reclaims the previous support at $0.20 for support, then there’s a possibility that the price continues to rally towards $0.30-0.33 as the next resistance. Such a move would confirm that XRP was copying the movements of the previous crypto cycle in 2014-2016. In that cycle, the price of XRP fully retraced the bull move, after which a sideways accumulation period of one year occurred. If the price of XRP moves to $0.32 in the coming months, a similar period of sideways accumulation should be expected. For further bullish momentum and sentiment, the price should make a new higher high. In that case, the price of XRP needs to move above $0.33 to create one. However, if $0.145 is lost as support, a drop towards $0.06 is on the tables and can be expected.XRP BTC 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe BTC pair needs to claim the 0.000 02500-0.00002575 satoshis level as a first step.

However ...",1 month ago,Pantera Capital Founder and CEO Dan Morehead has predicted Bitcoin will “come of age” during the 2020 financial crisis and may top its all time high price within 12 months.,"The San Francisco-based blockchain and cryptocurrency hedge fund founder made the comments in a March 25 letter to investors examining the fallout from the COVID-19 financial crisis.Morehead offered a grim prediction for the economy and said he believes the global economy is about to enter its first ever period of negative growth. “I now believe that the recession is likely to be larger than any post-War recession,” he said about the U.S. economy.“I have spent 35 years trading global macro disruptions. This is like no other. This will certainly end the longest global expansion on record. It is likely to have a larger global economic impact than any downturn in recent memory.”Morehead noted that Bitcoin has been correlated with the sharemarket in this and other market downturns. However, he said the cryptocurrency tended to be less correlated after the first month or two of stock market price falls.“We now believe that the short-term high correlation with general markets is over and that crypto will trade independently.”He likened Bitcoin to bonds, which tend to shine in times of market turmoil, and predicted BTC will recover in stages before reaching a new all-time high:“The price of Bitcoin may set a new record in the next twelve months. It’s not going to happen overnight. My best guess is that it will take institutional investors 2-3 months to triage their current portfolio issues.

However, the bulls are struggling to sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, which is a bearish sign. BTC USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewCurrently, the bears are defending the $7,000 level while the bulls are attempting to keep the BTC/USD pair above the breakout level of $6,435. The 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI is just below the midpoint, which suggests a balance between buyers and sellers.If the bulls can push the price above $7,000, a move to the 200-day SMA at $8,343 is possible. Conversely, if the price dips below $6,435 once again, a drop to $5,660.65 is possible. If this support also gives way, the next level to watch out for is $5,000. Therefore, the traders can keep a stop loss of $5,600 on the long positions.Ether (ETH) is trading close to the midpoint of the $117.090-$155.612 range. On the upside, the 20-day EMA is at $152.1, which is close to the resistance of the range. Hence, we expect the bears to defend this level aggressively.ETH USD daily chart.

Therefore, traders can buy on a breakout and close (UTC time) above the 20-day EMA and keep a stop loss of $34.EOS continues to trade inside the $2.1624-$2.4001 range. However, we anticipate the altcoin to break out of this tight range and start a directional move soon.

This resulted in an unexpected high strain on trading infrastructure and some major hiccups.As Cointelegraph reported in late February, major cryptocurrency exchange Binance halted trading on its platform to resolve an unexpected technical issue with its infrastructure. The unscheduled maintenance followed weeks during which the exchange’s users had to endure a number of performance issues on the platform.Earlier this month, Binance halted trading after its infrastructure malfunctioned once again.

72,https://cointelegraph.com,1 month ago,Bitcoin in the Palm of Your Hand â€” Crypto Hardware Wallets Review,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-in-the-palm-of-your-hand-crypto-hardware-wallets-review,"A hardware wallet may just be the safest way to store cryptocurrency for

Nowadays, many different devices are trying to tackle the challenges of secure crypto asset storage. In this article, Cointelegraph will review some of the most well-known hardware wallets and compare their features.","The cryptocurrency wallets that will be covered in this article are Ledger’s Nano X and Nano S, SatoshiLabs’s Trezor One and Trezor Model T, ShapeShift’s KeepKey, and Coinkite’s Coldcard and Opendime. It is also important to point out that all the wallets tested in this article, other than the Ledger Nano S (which was already owned), have been provided by the producers, free of charge.Ledger’s Nano S and Nano X are similar devices when it comes to their functionality. Both interact with the same software, run the same applications and support the same cryptocurrencies, according to the firm’s official website.The Nano X is different from all the other devices in this article because it is the only one that is rechargeable and works wirelessly via Bluetooth. However, during the tests, the device’s wireless connectivity was only functional with the Ledger Live mobile application.Ledger Live allows users to update the device and to manage a significant portion of the crypto assets supported by the device. The rest of the assets are accessible through third-party software that is compatible with the hardware wallet.Another advantage that the Nano X has over the Nano S is the larger and higher resolution screen. While no one will be watching movies on either device, the fact that an entire wallet address fits on the screen helps when checking where the assets are being sent.The Nano S can hold fewer — under 10 in the tests — applications than the Nano X, which is advertised to hold up to 100. Not having the app of a crypto asset installed precludes the ability to manage it, but uninstalling and reinstalling the application does not imply a loss of cryptocurrency. Consequently, the limitation in the number of installed apps of the Nano S results only in a minor inconvenience.Both wallets can be used on mobile devices, but the Nano S only works with a USB on-the-go cable. Third-party mobile apps also support both the Nano X and S. The Nano X is available on the official Ledger website for around $120, while the Nano S is just short of $60.The SatoshiLabs’s Trezor One and Trezor Model T hardware wallets, on the other hand, share fewer similarities than the Ledger devices. The Model T  has a larger color touch screen than the One, a micro SD card slot and a reversible USB C connector. Yet, both support about 1,000 crypto assets.The micro SD card slot in the Model T allows for signing transactions in an offline environment and saving them onto the memory card. The transactions could then be transmitted to the network from a second device that is connected to the internet. However, this functionality has not been added to the device yet.In order to operate Trezor, the hardware wallet needs to be connected to a computer or a mobile device that runs dedicated software. This software can be Trezor's purpose-built Google Chrome browser extension or a third-party, web-based wallet. Moreover, the device has all the expected functionalities, as well as an intuitive user interface. Like Ledger’s devices, the Trezor hardware wallets are also supported by a long list of third-party software wallets.SatoshiLabs also provides a mobile wallet that allows device initialization, recovery, label change, pin change, passphrase management, firmware upgrade and a full device wipe. Mobile wallets, such as Mycelium or Walleth, allow users to manage their crypto assets from a mobile device, although only via a cable.Furthermore, the Trezor web-based wallet can also be accessed through the Android version of Google Chrome when the wallet is connected to the mobile device. According to the company’s website, the Trezor One is available for $55, while the Trezor T is just a little short of $170. The Corazon Titanium Trezor Model T — sold by Gray in a partnership with Trezor — costs about four times more than the standard version, which was also tested.Although it’s lesser-known but is still a major player on the market, the KeepKey surprises with its large black and white screen and premium feel. The materials used for the front of the device make it hard to clean and can be easily scratched.The device is significantly larger than the other ones in this list, and the number of digital assets supported is severely limited when compared with Trezor and Ledger hardware wallets. The KeepKey supports eight cryptocurrencies but also allows users to manage all their Ethereum-based tokens compliant with the ERC-20 standard.During the testing phase of the review, some bugs were encountered in the dedicated software. The application stopped during an attempt to add an account, and it ran into multiple issues when unlocking the wallet.Fortunately, no such bugs interfered when testing the beta version of the cryptocurrency management and trading interface developed by ShapeShift. It is worth pointing out that the ShapeShift service is not a KeepKey exclusive but is also supported in Ledger and Trezor devices.ColdCard is an open-source hardware wallet that closely resembles a calculator and targets more tech-savvy users. The Opendime, on the other hand, is closer to a real-life version of the cyberpunk credit chips or a piggy bank than a traditional hardware wallet.The Coldcard wallet only supports Bitcoin (BTC) and is the only wallet in this review that supports the Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions format. This feature allows users to sign transactions, save them onto the SD card, and broadcast them at a later time — and co-sign them in the case of a multi-signature wallet.The Opendime wallet is a single-use device that needs to be physically altered in order to spend the cryptocurrency. When it is first activated by inserting the device into the computer’s USB port, the user has to input random data onto its drive. The wallet then uses this data to generate a private–public key pair.Once the device is initiated, users can see their public keys and send cryptocurrencies to it. What users cannot do is access the private key, which means they cannot move the coins.In order to access the private key, the device's owner has to puncture the device in an indicated spot, permanently altering its electronic circuit. After piercing the Opendime device, users gain access to the private key that can be used to move the cryptocurrency to a software wallet.This device can be viewed as a way to transform a digital currency into a physical currency. When accepting an Opendime as a means of payment, its balance can be verified while users can feel confident that no one will spend the balance without accessing the device.This unique device is the perfect choice for some atypical situations. However, the fact that physical access to the Opendime device automatically translates into access to the cryptocurrency precludes its use in most cases.Coinkite only sells the Bitcoin version of the Opendime device, but the Litecoin Foundation has one for Litecoin (LTC) as well. Coinkite’s official shop sells the Coldcard for a little under $120 and the Opendime in packs of three for just short of $45.Views and beliefs expressed in the article are of the author, Cointelegraph does not endorse any of the products or projects mentioned."

This raises the uncertainty on how long and how much damage will this pandemic do before it is contained. As a result, the equity markets continue to be hammered down.","Due to strong measures like lockdowns, the economy will go through a slowdown.

Coley explained that as the markets have matured over the past year, institutional investors could be looking to take advantage of the current low prices to make an entry into this space.In today’s analysis, we have suggested several trades on the major cryptocurrencies. The traders can do their due diligence and stick to the ones which interest them. As the situation remains uncertain, volatile movements cannot be ruled out. Therefore, keep the position size only 40% of usual.Let’s study the charts of the major cryptocurrencies to determine the ones that look strong?Bitcoin (BTC) turned down from the 20-day EMA at $6,835 on March 20. However, since then, the price has been consolidating close to the overhead resistance at $6,435. This is a positive sign as it shows that the bulls are not closing their positions in a hurry.BTC USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewConsolidation near the critical resistance increases the possibility of a breakout of it. Therefore, we anticipate the bulls to push the price above the 20-day EMA. If the BTC/USD pair can close (UTC time) above the 20-day EMA, it is likely to rally to the 50-day SMA at $8,435.70.Therefore, we suggest traders buy on a close (UTC time) above the 20-day EMA and keep a stop loss at $5,600.Contrary to our assumption, if the price again turns down from the 20-day EMA, a drop to $5,660 is possible. Below this level, a drop to $5,000 is likely.Ether (ETH) is currently trading between $117.090 and $155.612. A bounce off the support at $117.090 can carry the price to the resistance at $155.612. The 20-day EMA is also located close to this level, hence, we expect the bears to defend this level once again.ETH USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewIf the price again turns down from $155.612, the ETH/USD pair will extend its stay inside the range. Nonetheless, if the bulls can push the price above $155.612, we anticipate a move to the 50-day SMA at $208.90.Therefore, traders can buy on a close (UTC time) above $155.612 and keep the stop loss at $117. If this level cracks, a drop to $100 is possible.XRP turned down from $0.17595 on March 20. However, the bulls are attempting to keep the price above $0.1450.

A break below this level will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has been struggling to break above the 20-day EMA at $236. However, the positive thing is that the bulls have not given up much ground.

Source: TradingviewIf successful, we expect a change in trend. Above the channel, a move to the 50-day SMA at $332 and above it to $400 is possible. Therefore, the bulls can purchase the breakout and close (UTC time) above the channel with a close stop loss at $196.Contrary to our assumption, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above the channel, the BCH/USD pair might again dip down to $190 and below it to $166.Bitcoin SV (BSV) has been struggling to break above the 20-day EMA for the past three days. However, the positive thing is that the bulls have not given up much ground. This increases the possibility of a break above the 20-day EMA at $171.5.BSV USD daily chart.

A break below this level will be a huge negative as it can drag the price to $120 and below that to $100.Litecoin (LTC) turned down just below the 20-day EMA on March 20. However, the bulls purchased the dip to $34.6001 levels, which is a positive sign. The bulls will now once again attempt to push the price above the descending channel.LTC USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewIf successful, the LTC/USD pair can run-up to the 50-day SMA, which is likely to act as a resistance. If this resistance is crossed, the next level to watch is $80.

Source: TradingviewIf the bulls can carry the XTZ/USD pair above $1.955, it will complete the bullish setup. This pattern has a target objective of $2.9004.

However, BCH meetup organizer Akane Yokoo notified group members — called “cashers” or “Bitcoiners” — on March 17 that the meetups would instead be held virtually:“Our virtual meetups will start this coming Wednesday March 18th from 7:30pm and we plan to host every Wednesday at the same time when our physical meetups happen.”High-demand items like toilet paper, masks, and hand sanitizer are still not quite as available in Japan as they were prior to the coronavirus outbreak, which makes it difficult for those in at-risk groups to attend physical BCH meetups. However, for those who are comfortable and taking necessary precautions, Yokoo suggested that visiting meetings in person was also possible: “Even though we do not want to encourage members to go out and get sick, members should be free to do whatever they choose to do. If they choose to get together physically, the merchants are open for business as usual.”With more crypto companies around the world suggesting or ordering employees to work from home, blockchain and cryptocurrency conferences and meetings have also been taking similar actions to combat the spread of the coronavirus. Unfortunately, not all events in Japan have been able to move so successfully into the virtual world. The TEAMZ Blockchain Summit — the largest blockchain conference in Japan — was going to take place from April 22–23, but has been rescheduled to September 28. Public gatherings for Tokyo’s cherry blossom season have been discouraged as well, with the flowers predicted to start blooming next week."

Source: Coin360According to Unchained Capital, the recent fall has not been able to deter the confidence of the long-term HODLers. The supply of Bitcoin stored for more than 5 years has only increased from 20.37% to 21.65% in the past year. This shows that the long-term investors are buying on dips and panics and are holding onto their positions. Data suggests that it is the speculators who have held Bitcoin for 6 months or less have dumped their holdings.As long as the spread of the virus is not controlled, traders will continue to panic and dump their positions periodically. However, like every crisis, even this will pass and the world will move on. Hence, we suggest traders look beyond the crisis and utilize the sharp drops in crypto prices to accumulate for the long-term. Let’s study the charts and see if we also see Bitcoin falling to $2,000 levels or lower?Bitcoin (BTC) has been holding above the support line of the symmetrical triangle for the past few days. On March 16, the bulls purchased the dip below the support line of the triangle, which is a positive sign. This shows demand at lower levels.BTC USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewCurrently, the BTC/USD pair is largely stuck between $4,400-$6,000. After the sharp fall on March 12, we anticipate the pair to spend a few more days inside the range.A breakout of the range will be the first indication that bulls have overpowered the bears. It will also suggest accumulation by the stronger hands at lower levels. We might suggest long positions after the price breaks out and closes (UTC time) above the $6,000-$6,435 resistance.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the pair below $4,400-$3,803.58 range. Such a move will be a huge negative. However, we give it a low probability of occurring.The bears are attempting to keep Ether (ETH) below the support at $117.090. Though the bulls purchased the dip to $100.926 on March 16, they could not push the price back above $117.090. This shows selling by the bears on minor rallies.ETH USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewIf the bulls fail to push the ETH/USD pair above $117.090, we anticipate a drop to the next support at $84.25. This is a critical level to watch out for because if it cracks, the decline can extend to $50.Conversely, if the bulls can carry the pair above the downtrend line, a move to $139.386 is possible. We will wait for a new buy setup to form before proposing a trade in it.XRP continues to trade inside the descending channel.

If this level also gives way, the downtrend can reach $0.10 and below that $0.075.Conversely, if the bulls can keep the XRP/USD pair above the uptrend line, a move to $0.17468 is possible. A breakout of this will be the first sign that bulls are making a comeback. Until then, we remain neutral on the pair.The bulls purchased the dip to $150.67 on March 16, which shows demand at lower levels. However, the failure to push Bitcoin Cash (BCH) above $200 shows a lack of buyers at higher levels. This might keep the altcoin range-bound between $150-$200 for a few days.BCH USD daily chart.

If this level cracks, the drop can extend to $105.Conversely, if the bulls can carry the BCH/USD pair above $200, it will indicate strength. Above $200, a move to the 20-day EMA and above it to the downtrend line of the channel is likely. A break above the channel will suggest a change in trend. We might recommend a long position if the pair sustains above $200.Bitcoin SV (BSV) has been trading close to the $120 mark for the past few days. The bulls purchased the dip to $100 on March 16, which shows demand at lower levels. However, buying dries up at higher levels.BSV USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewIf the bulls fail to propel the BSV/USD pair above $131.46 within the next few days, we anticipate another attempt by the bears to drag the price to $78.506. A break below this level can sink the pair to $66.666.On the other hand, if the bulls can scale and sustain the pair above $131.46, a rally to the 200-day SMA at $159.50 is possible. We will wait for the price to break out of the channel before suggesting a trade in it.The failure of the bulls to carry Litecoin (LTC) above the overhead resistance at $35.8582-$38.8015 suggests a lack of demand at higher levels. However, the positive thing is that the buyers are accumulating on dips to $30 and $24.LTC USD daily chart.

A break above the descending channel will indicate a possible change in trend.The range in EOS has been shrinking for the past few days. This suggests that the bulls and the bears are unsure about the next likely move, hence, they are not placing large bets. This period of low volatility will be followed by an increase in volatility.EOS USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewIf the bears sink the EOS/USD pair below the March 16 low of $1.7213, a drop to the recent low at $1.42 is possible. A breakdown of this support will be a huge negative.

We will wait for the price to sustain above the 20-day EMA before turning positive.The bulls purchased the dip on March 16 but are struggling to keep Binance Coin (BNB) above $10. This shows a lack of buyers at higher levels. If the bulls fail to sustain the altcoin above $10, we expect another attempt by the bears to resume the downtrend.BNB USD daily chart.

We will wait for the pair to form a reversal pattern before suggesting a trade in it.Though Tezos (XTZ) recovered from the low of $1.1349 on March 16, the bulls have not been able to carry the price back above 200-day SMA at 1.52. This shows that the bears are defending the resistance at the 200-day SMA.XTZ USD daily chart.

The total crypto market capitalization has risen from the recent low of about $118 billion on March 13 to about $191 billion on March 20, which is a rally of about 62%.

We expect strong buying to emerge at these levels.Though we are positive, we suggest traders wait for the rally to prove itself before jumping in to buy. We will watch the price action for a couple of days more and then suggest a trade in it.The momentum in Ether (ETH) picked up after it broke above the downtrend line. This is a positive sign.

24 by the Open Money Initiative suggests that even in neighbouring ...",1 month ago,"The President of the Brazilian Banking Federation, Murilo Portugal, has argued that  cryptocurrencies are not really currencies at all.","Portugal was speaking in a debate about the 'Impact of the Digital Revolution on the Financial System' at the non-profit think tank, the Fernando Henrique Cardoso Foundation. The debate examined the impact of new technologies on financial services, including blockchain, cryptocurrency, big data, artificial intelligence and fintech.Portugal argued that “cryptocurrencies do not fulfill any of the classic functions of the currency"" and said they are not a unit of account, or a means of exchange, or a store of value.""They are actually called coins but they are not coins, which is why it is cryptocurrency. They do not fulfill any of the classic functions of the currency, which is to serve as an account unit, where people can express prices. They do not serve as a means of payment or as a store of value because the volatility is very high.""Portugal is a respected figure in the financial world, he has a degree in Economic Development from Cambridge and has served as an executive director of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.He went on to theorize that money and information are becoming one and the same — predicting that data and information will end up being regulated in the same way as money. ""It is an experience that I think we already see happening,"" he said.A report published on March 24 by the Open Money Initiative suggests that even in neighbouring Venezuela where hyperinflation is rampant, Bitcoin is not being used as a traditional store of value.The report, by data scientist Matt Ahlborg, looked at the effects of a multi day power blackout in Venezuela and its relationship to trading volume on Localbitcoins, as well as trades between Bitcoin and other South American currencies.It determined Bitcoin is being used as a 'vehicle currency' to transfer value out of Venezuela and that informal money transmitters are holding onto Bitcoin only as long as necessary and converting it as soon as possible to dollars or stablecoins. The report stated:""Bitcoin is being used not as a store of value endpoint, but as a channel on the road to obtain more stable currencies such as the US dollar, Colombian peso, Chinese yuan and various stablecoins.""However Ahlborg concluded this is an incredibly valuable use case for Bitcoin:""It’s not unreasonable to suggest that Bitcoin could have already facilitated billions of dollars worth of censorship-resistant value transfer to and from Venezuela over the last few years. If we take this as a real possibility, then Bitcoin has already played a part in changing the destiny of an entire country.""Bitcoin's ability to serve as a currency is hotly debated. Some argue that Bitcoin is 'digital gold', including the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust — who launched an advertising campaign around the concept. In a blog post published in February, U.S exchange Coinbase argued that ""Bitcoin is a store of value to rival gold in the digital age”.Cointelegraph's Antonio Madeira explored the question in an article in late February. He spoke to Antoni Trenchev, managing partner of crypto banking app Nexo, who argued Bitcoin is a store of value:“The very early narrative was that Bitcoin was going to be a revolutionary currency and p2p payment system. I think that this has failed to materialize in any way. Bitcoin has the functionalities of a currency but it’s used more as a store of value and transition of value especially in larger quantities.”Madeira wrote that Bitcoin exhibits five of the six features of money — durability, portability, divisibility, uniformity, limited supply. However he concluded it is currently failing on the sixth, which is general acceptability as a payment method."

digital assets like Bitcoin as crypto-commodities rather than crypto- ...",1 month ago,A United States congressman is the latest working to clarify and determine which U.S. regulator is responsible for which digital assets. ,"On March 9, Representative Paul Gosar (R-AZ) introduced the “Crypto-Currency Act of 2020,” a bill that looks to choreograph a wide range of digital assets to answer to the appropriate regulator.As Will Stechschulte, Gosar’s legislative assistant, explained to Cointelegraph, “the bill looks to provide not only clarity, but legitimacy to crypto assets in the United States.”Gosar’s proposal divides digital assets into three categories: crypto-commodity, crypto-currency and crypto-security. Respectively, the three categories would be governed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Secretary of the Treasury via the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Interestingly, the language of the bill would seem to cement the status of digital assets like Bitcoin as crypto-commodities rather than crypto-currencies. The classification of “crypto-currency” reads “representations of United States currency or synthetic derivatives” — more reminiscent of stablecoins like Tether (USDT). The language behind crypto-securities, remains familiar: “all debt, equity, and derivative instruments that rest on a blockchain or decentralized cryptographic ledger.” As to non-fungible tokens, the bill makes no mention. The bill is an updated version of one that first leaked in December. The updated bill features expanded definitions for terms like “Decentralized cryptographic ledger” and “Smart contract” — concepts that U.S. legislators are struggling to cope with. Possibly more significantly, the updated bill is more explicit about determining “primary” rather than “sole” regulatory responsibility. The exact implications remain to be seen, but the change could weaken the legal standing of crypto businesses arguing that, say, the SEC has no right to regulate them. Breaking with typical congressional practice, Gosar is presenting the bill solo, without a co-sponsor. Stechschulte told Cointelegraph that “For introduction, it’s just going to be Congressman Gosar. [...] After introduction, we’re hoping to garner some serious support.”Communications Director for Gosar Ben Goldey explained the emphasis on industry engagement before legislative approval“Since this is such a niche issue, we worked with stakeholders and outside groups/experts to get a good sense of the kind of clarity that the industry needed. We chose to gather stakeholder support before working toward cosponsors.”One of the industry players involved in drafting the bill was pioneer Bitcoin investor Erik Finman. Speaking with Cointelegraph, Finman said he had initially approached Gosar’s team to work on such a bill because “I like that they’re brave and will stand strong for anything.”Regarding the bill’s history and development from the version that came out in December, Finman said that a number of participants had weighed in: “That bill that leaked, we were experimenting with a couple of things, that was our second draft. We’re thirty-two versions away from that.” The past year has seen a number of new draft bills, especially in response to Facebook’s white paper for Libra. Fears of facing regulation by the SEC probably contributed to changes to Libra’s initial vision of a managed stablecoin based on a “basket of currencies.” The nearest peer to Gosar’s new bill is, however, Warren Davidson’s (R-OH) Token Taxonomy Act, initially introduced in 2018 and later updated and re-introduced in April 2019. Finman, for one, felt that the Token Taxonomy Act had stalled out. He also said of the new Crypto-currency Act that “I think this is slightly bigger in scope.”"

Whether a cryptocurrency is securely stored or not, much depends on the wallet, which is only as secure as its private keys.","Wallets are generally either hot or cold. The funds in a hot wallet can be spent at any time, online. A cold wallet functions in contrast: not intended for regular cryptocurrency transactions, but funds can be received at any time. Wallets can also be divided into three groups: software, hardware and paper. Today, we will take a look at the most widespread group of crypto wallets ー software.Software wallets come in many forms, each with its own set of unique characteristics. Most are somehow connected to the internet and are hot in nature. Wallets are distinguished by a set of supported cryptocurrencies and software platforms such as Windows, Mac and other operating systems. Software wallets are available in three forms — desktop, mobile and online:So, the burning question on everyone’s mind is: Which of these software wallets do I choose?Exodus is one of the most popular software wallets for storing Bitcoin (BTC) and supports over 110 other cryptocurrencies. Launched in 2015 and based in Nebraska, the service is supported by all major software platforms.The Exodus code is partially open-source. Private keys are controlled by the users and do not leave the device where the wallet is installed. The service’s philosophy implies the absence of any personal identification and interaction with banks. Exodus has partnered up with several exchange partners to offer transfer services on a wider range of coins.Exodus is a free service, while its transaction fees are paid only to miners and determined automatically using the Bitcoin fee service. The size of a transaction in the wallet is determined by the number of inputs and outputs. The more input, the more expensive the transaction becomes. The wallet charges a portion of the commission for facilitating transactions made within the system.The Electrum Bitcoin Wallet is a reliable service that has been around since 2011. It is a so-called “thin” cold wallet, where the entire blockchain is not downloaded to the user’s device but is rather stored on the network servers. In this case, private keys are stored on the user’s computer in an encrypted form and are never sent to the server.Versions of the Electrum Bitcoin Wallet can be automatically synchronized on different computers. If users want to use another client program or an online service in the future, they can easily export their keys there or import keys into a cold wallet.This crypto wallet can sign transactions on a device disconnected from the network by saving a new transaction onto a USB flash drive and then loading it onto a device connected to the internet, where the new transaction can be imported onto the network. The wallet is functionally an analog of a hardware wallet, albeit with a slightly more complex chain of actions, and also uses two-level encryption.Based in Canada, Jaxx was launched in 2016 by Anthony Di Iorio, CEO and founder of Decentral as well as a co-founder of Ethereum. Jaxx is available on most popular operating systems: Windows, Linux, Mac OS, Android, IOS and also as an extension in the Google Chrome web browser.Over 80 cryptocurrencies are available as the ShapeShift exchange is also integrated into the Jaxx wallet for easy and fast transactions. The Jaxx platform does not support fiat money exchange operations or multi-signature. It is a free service, and its transaction fees are paid to miners and differ by currency. When transferring BTC, users choose from three options for fees, depending on the urgency of the transfer.All of Jaxx’s code is open-source except for the user interface. Private keys are controlled by users and do not leave devices that have had wallets installed on them. To verify transactions, centralized validation technology is used. The intuitive controls render this wallet user-friendly and convenient to use.However, the company has had its rough times. In 2017, Jaxx was hacked, and more than $400,000 in various cryptocurrencies was stolen. However, Jaxx Chief Technical Officer Nilang Vyas said in a Reddit post that, unlike hardware wallets, Jaxx is not designed for long-term storage of crypto assets and that users should store only small amounts of funds in their Jaxx wallets.Founded in 2017, Atomic Wallet is a desktop app that provides users with full control over their cryptocurrency savings, as the private keys and transactional data for this service are stored on users’ computers rather than on the provider’s servers.Atomic Wallet is compatible with all known operating systems and currently supports more than 300 cryptocurrencies, including the most common ones, alongside most ERC-20 tokens and its own Atomic Wallet Coin (AWC). The app can be downloaded for free, but it does contain certain paid services:As a solution that lacks servers, Atomic Wallet does not require registration from its users. Therefore, the wallet does not store any confidential personal information and does not utilize the services of intermediaries to conduct transactions.All data transferred is encrypted, as users receive a unique “backup phrase” comprising 12 randomly generated words to recover access to their wallets to serve as a backup should other forms of verification fail, or in case a mobile phone is lost.Bitcoin Core was created in 2009 and is based on the wallet program code that was published along with Bitcoin’s project software, thereby ensuring streamlined functionality along the network. In 2012, the Bitcoin Foundation began developing applications based on the original Bitcoin project code. The main focus was on the wallet as a dominant app that met the primary needs of the network: storage and money transfer.Bitcoin Core was one of the first wallets to support SegWit technology and serves as a reference cold wallet for BTC. No other currencies are supported. The wallet can be downloaded as a desktop application on Windows, Linux and Mac.The main advantage of Bitcoin Core is its security. All information is stored on the user’s PC, independent of third parties and other entities’ servers. A file with private keys is generated and stored by the user — no one else can access it.With Bitcoin Core, the user can be guaranteed complete anonymity, including anonymized payments. Bitcoin Core uses an address rotation system, making it practically impossible to track the sender and the recipient addresses — provided that different addresses are used for each transaction.Among the wallet’s shortcomings is low mobility, which may be unappealing for many potential users. Bitcoin Core lacks a mobile version, and this is likely to remain the case, as mobile use contradicts the wallet’s foundational principles of operation and security. Installing a wallet on another computer or even on a reinstalled OS will also not help to recover the funds, as the entire synchronization process (i.e., data downloading and verifying validity) would need to be repeated.BitGo is a blockchain company founded in 2013 and headquartered in Palo Alto, California. While originally a BTC wallet, BitGo has added support for other popular cryptocurrencies over the years. The BitGo wallet is a web wallet that can be connected through a desktop computer, laptop or other devices. The mobile version of the wallet allows storing keys on user devices. Additionally, keys can be transferred to other devices.The company has developed two versions of its wallet for either individual or business use.In addition to being an online wallet, BitGo offers a service providing reliable storage of digital assets for institutional investors through its partnership with Kingdom Trust. In the spring of 2018, the wallet began supporting the ERC-20 standard, expanding the list of supported digital currencies to 90. However, this is of little use to ordinary investors, as all ERC-20 tokens on BitGo are available only to institutional investors.Each BitGo wallet has three keys: One is stored on BitGo, the second on the user’s device and the third through the Key Recovery Service software. To avoid third-party involvement, just two signatures are required to complete transactions. Access to the wallet is protected by two-factor authentication, and users must confirm their IP every time they log in to their wallets. BitGo charges a fee of 0.25% on all withdrawals up to 1 BTC alongside the usual mining fees.Like Jaxx Liberty, the BitGo wallet has been at the center of a scandal. In 2015, BitGo and Bitfinex announced their collaboration to create a multi-signature wallet system. The companies decided to put user funds into a mixed storage, in which some were stored on large, offline wallets and the rest online. As a result, each user had three keys, two of which were stored by Bitfinex and the third by BitGo.However, in August 2016, Bitfinex discovered that more than $60 million in BTC had been withdrawn from its users’ hot wallets. To this day, no explanation has been offered as to how the attackers managed to pull this off other than BitGo confirming on its official Twitter page that its servers had not been breached.Cryptocurrency wallets are an integral part of using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They are a fundamental element of the crypto infrastructure that allows funds to transfer across blockchain networks. Each wallet has its own advantages and disadvantages, so understanding how they work and what kind of activities they facilitate is essential before moving on to using them.In any case, software wallets are becoming increasingly popular, and according to Atomic Wallet’s PR manager, Kristina Khachatryan, they are becoming more accessible and attractive every day:“The software wallets are getting to be more and more accessible for a larger number of people, more multifunctional and filled with cool features at the same time losing nothing in the performance or the security issue. Moreover, the possibility of the decentralized staking is the central opening of this year. That’s why we see high potentials in this field of the software wallets and believe that the market will be surely driven to grow by the increased popularity of this product.”Exodus’s communications manager, Davey Zelaya, is confident that the software market will develop at a faster pace as more cryptocurrency and blockchain solutions continue to be launched:“We expect the market to continue to demand user-friendly software to interact with the increasing number of blockchain products and applications. In short, we want to make crypto easy for everyone. Right now, decentralized apps are still bulky and sometimes difficult to navigate. We want to change that.”"

Source: Coin360As prices start to fall, the traders who have been sitting on the sidelines delay their purchases waiting for a bottom to form. This results in a further fall due to a lack of demand. Along with other possible reasons, this could also be one of the reasons for the sharp fall in the crypto markets. Let’s study the charts of the major cryptocurrencies to spot the critical levels where buyers might step in. On Mar. 6 and 7, Bitcoin (BTC) could not close (UTC time) above the 20-day EMA and failure to climb above the 20-day EMA attracted selling by the bears.BTC USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThe downside momentum picked up after the bears plunged the BTC/USD pair below the 200-day SMA at $8,670 and the next support at $8,400. This shows liquidation by the traders who had purchased the recent dip.Currently, the bulls are attempting to defend the support at $7,856.76 and the support line of the descending channel. A bounce off the support can carry the price to $8,400, which will now act as a stiff resistance.If the price turns down from $8,400, the bears will make another attempt to sink the pair to the next support zone of $7,000-$6,435. The 20-day EMA is sloping down and the RSI is near the oversold territory, which suggests that bears have the advantage.The first sign of strength will be a break above the 200-day SMA and the resistance line of the descending channel. If the price sustains above the channel, we might suggest long positions once again. Until then, we suggest traders remain on the sidelines.Ether (ETH) closed (UTC time) above the overhead resistance of $235.70 on Mar. 6, which triggered our buy recommendation given in an earlier analysis. However, this turned out to be a bull trap because the price quickly turned around from $251.781 on Mar. 7.ETH USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThe ETH/USD pair plunged on Mar. 8, which broke the support at $209.95 and triggered our suggested stop loss at $208. Currently, the bulls are attempting to defend the support at $197.75. A bounce off this level can carry the price to $209.95 and above it to the 20-day EMA at $229. However, if the bulls fail to defend the support at $197.75, a drop to the 200-day SMA at $179 is likely. The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative zone suggest that bears have the upper hand. We will wait for a new buy setup to form before proposing a trade in it once again.XRP turned down from close to the 20-day EMA on Mar. 7. The sharp selling on Mar. 8 has dragged the price below the critical support at $0.22250. The 20-day EMA is sloping down and the RSI is close to the oversold zone, which suggests that bears are in command. XRP USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewCurrently, the bulls are attempting to defend the psychological support at $0.20. If successful, a relief rally to $0.22250 is likely. We expect the bears to defend this level aggressively.If the price turns down from $0.22250, the bears will attempt to resume the downtrend and drag the price to $0.17468. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the XRP/USD pair breaks and sustains above the 20-day EMA.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) turned down from the 20-day EMA on Mar. 7. This shows selling by the bears at overhead resistance levels. The altcoin broke below the support at $306.78 and the 200-day SMA at $282 on Mar. 8, which is a huge negative.BCH USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewCurrently, the bulls are attempting to defend the support at $270.15. If successful, the BCH/USD pair might pullback to $306.78 and above it to $360.However, if the price slips and sustains below $270.15, it will be a huge negative. The next level to watch on the downside would be the psychological support at $200. We will wait for the pair to sustain a bounce off $270.15 before turning positive.Repeated failures of the bulls to push Bitcoin SV (BSV) above the 20-day EMA attracted selling. The altcoin turned around on Mar. 7 and broke below the most recent low of $204.310 on Mar. 8. This is a huge negative.BSV USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewIf the bears can sustain the price below the psychological support at $200, the BSV/USD pair might drop to the 200-day SMA at $159 and below it to $120.The pair is currently trading inside a descending channel. The first sign of strength will be a break above the 20-day EMA at $246, which is just above the channel. However, as the pair has been a huge underperformer for the past few days, we will wait for a new buy setup to form before turning positive on it.The bears are aggressively defending the 20-day EMA. The sharp selling on Mar. 8 has plunged Litecoin (LTC) below the 200-day SMA, which is a huge negative. Currently, the bulls are attempting to defend the critical support at $50. LTC USD daily chart.

The 20-day EMA is sloping down and the RSI is close to the oversold zone, which suggests that bears have the upper hand.However, if the bulls can defend the support at $50, the pair might again move up to $66.1486 and remain range-bound between these two levels. We will wait for a new buy setup to form before recommending a trade in it.EOS turned down sharply from the 20-day EMA on Mar. 7 and plunged below the 200-day SMA on Mar. 8. The failure of the bulls to defend the 200-day SMA at $3.35 is a huge negative as it shows a lack of buyers even at that level.EOS USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewCurrently, the bulls are attempting to defend the psychological support at $3 but the failure to achieve a strong rebound could attract further selling. If the EOS/USD pair slides below $3, a drop to $2.4001 is possible. The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI close to the oversold zone show that bears have the upper hand.Alternatively, if the pair rebounds off $3, the bulls will attempt to push the price back above the 200-day SMA. If successful, a relief rally to the 20-day EMA and above it to $4 is possible. We will wait for a new buy setup to form before proposing a trade in it.The bulls could not propel Binance Coin (BNB) above the overhead resistance at $21.80. That attracted selling, which plunged the altcoin below the 20-day EMA at $20 and the 200-day SMA at $18.50.BNB USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThere is a minor support at $16, below which the decline can extend to the next support at $14. The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI close to the oversold zone indicate that bears are in command. However, if the BNB pair bounces off the current support at $16, it can move up to the 200-day SMA and above it to the 20-day EMA. We do not find any buy setup at the current levels, hence, we suggest traders remain on the sidelines.Though Tezos (XTZ) sustained above $3.011 for three days, the bulls could not build up on the breakout. This shows a lack of buyers at higher levels. The altcoin reversed direction on Mar. 7 and has plummeted below the support at $2.5263. XTZ USD daily chart.

Currently, the bulls are attempting to defend the support at $2.28451360, which is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the most recent rally. Below this level, the decline can extend to the support line of the descending channel at $2.Our bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls can push the XTZ/USD pair above the channel. Such a move will increase the possibility of a resumption of the uptrend.Chainlink (LINK) broke below the 20-day EMA and the trendline support. However, the bulls stepped in to defend the trendline, which is a bullish sign. If the altcoin bounces off the trendline, the bulls will again attempt to carry the price to the recent highs at $4.9762.LINK USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewConversely, if the bears sink and sustain the LINK/USD pair below the trendline, a drop to $3.3113 is possible. A breakdown below this support will complete a double top pattern, which will be a huge negative.The 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI is just below the midpoint, which suggests a range-bound action for a few days.

to ...",1 month ago,"Amid countries increasingly auctioning Bitcoin (BTC) seized in law enforcement actions, some jurisdictions are fighting for authorization to confiscate crypto.","A state authority in Belarus wants lawmakers to authorize them to seize cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin from criminals. The Investigative Committee of the Republic of Belarus, a centralized system of state law enforcement agencies, is purportedly planning to back a legal initiative that would grant them the authority to confiscate crypto.Ivan Noskevich, head of the Investigative Committee, publicly voiced the initiative in a March 9 interview with Belarusian state-owned TV channel CTV. According to the executive, Belarus has had no legal regulation that would allow the authority to seize cryptocurrency through enforcement actions to date.According to the official, the Committee has been encountering problems while investigating criminal cases involving cryptocurrencies as part of the offense. As such, the Investigative Committee has proposed to amend the existing criminal procedure law to allow the authority to seize crypto in such cases. Additionally, Noskevich believes that the authority should be able to confiscate crypto from actors who used it in crimes motivated by profit.Noskevich further expressed hope that lawmakers in Belarus would respect the stance of the Investigative Committee and will put necessary amendments into the existing criminal procedure law. He said:“We’ve encountered such cases before, but there was no legal regulation of the mechanism for seizing cryptocurrency. I hope that the legislators will listen to the opinion of the Investigative Committee, and such amendments will be introduced into the criminal procedure legislation.”Cointelegraph has contacted the Investigative Committee for additional information but did not receive an immediate response. This story will be updated should they respond. Although Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko reportedly legalized cryptocurrencies in the country back in 2017, Belarus doesn’t appear to have been very active in terms of crypto-related developments to date. Among the latest crypto news from the country, Belarus’ general prosecutor raised concerns over the role of crypto in tax evasion in June 2019. Previously, Belarus’ largest bank, Belarusbank, was reported to be considering setting up a cryptocurrency exchange.While the Investigative Committee is fighting to become authorized to confiscate crypto, a number of countries worldwide have been putting seized cryptocurrencies on auction as part of a common practice. As such, the Belgian Federal government plans to auction $125,000 worth of Bitcoin on March 24, 2020. As reported, the United States Marshals Service sold a total amount of 185,230 bitcoins confiscated during its enforcement operations.However, some jurisdictions are not quite sure what to do with seized cryptocurrencies. On Feb. 25, Cointelegraph reported on Finnish Customs deliberating about what to do with 1,666 Bitcoins seized from drug criminals years ago. The authority purportedly doesn’t want to auction the confiscated Bitcoin because the cryptocurrency could be returned to the hands of criminals."

the world's Bitcoin (BTC) trading, a signal moment in crypto ...",1 month ago,"Mt. Gox’s creditors met today to discuss a draft rehabilitation plan as part of a compensation process that seems to go on and on. This news comes at a unique time: amid a pandemic and with the world on the brink of economic crisis. It calls to mind again the 2014 collapse of Mt. Gox, the Japan-based cryptocurrency exchange that once accounted for 70% of the world’s Bitcoin (BTC) trading, a signal moment in crypto history.","In anxious times like these, people are inevitably asking: Can a failure of this scale happen again? Earlier this week, the crypto hedge fund Adaptive Capital announced that it would cease operations after suffering heavy losses during the March 13 crypto market meltdown. Other disruptions are expected as entire national economies shut down to fight the coronavirus.Meanwhile, the claims and lawsuits against Mt. Gox continue. Mark Karpelès, the exchange’s former CEO, remains embroiled in an active lawsuit with investor Gregory Greene, as Cointelegraph reported on March 17. Coinlab, a former business partner, has a $16 billion (1.7 trillion Japanese yen) bankruptcy claim against Mt. Gox, up from the $75 million claim originally filed.The former exchange’s 24,000 creditors, meanwhile, are still waiting for a rehabilitation fund overseen by trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi to be distributed, and even though a draft plan has been approved, it is yet to be filed to the court, and even then, it may take more time for creditors to get their assets back in the form of crypto or fiat.Elsewhere, Fortress Investment Group raised its offer to purchase claims from Mt. Gox creditors. As of February, they are offering $1,300 per Bitcoin lost, up from $755 in December 2019.It seems like a mess, and it’s easy to forget that Mt. Gox was once the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, handling more than 70% of all Bitcoin transactions. When it filed for bankruptcy in February 2014, it announced that 850,000 Bitcoins were missing, presumably stolen. A little over 200,000 Bitcoins were eventually recovered, and that’s basically what the parties are now fighting over.Is it surprising that lawsuits continue? The amount of Bitcoin stolen was worth around $473 million at the time, but those that were recovered would be worth $1.7 billion today. “I’m not surprised some people are suing,” said Johnny Lee, Grant Thornton LLP’s national practice leader for forensic technology services. One also sees more tort claims directed at crypto generally, Lee added. “It’s just the beginning of that trend.” Exchanges and other custodians are increasingly going to pay the price for failing to exert sufficient fiduciary duty. Pascal Gauthier, the CEO of Ledger, told Cointelegraph:“Cryptocurrencies are a complex digital asset, and the sheer loss of that much money is something we’ve never seen before in the industry, so I’m not particularly surprised this case is still being litigated.” Moreover, the security technology used by Mt. Gox didn’t leave a particularly clear audit trail, which probably drew the legal process out further. When could Mt. Gox’s creditors eventually see some money? It may take a while still. In an interview with Cointelegraph last year, Karpelès outlined his belief that Coinlab is interested in prolonging the case in hopes of reaching a higher settlement.""It was a pivotal moment in Bitcoin history,” wrote Ian DeMartino in a chapter of The Bitcoin Handbook titled “Mt. Gox: Bitcoin’s Defining Moment?” He continued: “Arguably, it was the most important event so far, negative or positive, for the still-young currency.”The world now has more than 200 exchanges — not just one — on which to trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. While that offers some comfort in terms of diversification, a number of these are still offshore enterprises operating without the benefit of regulation or transparency. Kim Nilsson, the chief engineer of WizSec who led an investigation into Mt. Gox’s “missing” Bitcoin, told Cointelegraph:“Isn’t this the main painful lesson from Mt. Gox — that something that looks like the most authoritative and legitimate business of its kind could be a complete disaster on the inside and you might not have any idea until it was too late?” Could history repeat itself, then? Markus Veith, a partner in the audit practice at Grant Thornton LLP and the leader of the professional services firm’s digital-assets practice, told Cointelegraph: “Mt. Gox was hacked mostly in hot wallets. Today, 95% of our clients’ Bitcoins are in cold storage.” Some clients have gone so far as to put their private keys on flash drives that are stored in former military bunkers. These stored private keys should, at the very least, be impervious to hackers — i.e., people sitting at computers — and many other malefactors. The Mt. Gox hacks and the others that followed gave rise to a whole new awareness and new specialties, like crypto custodians — Fidelity Digital Assets, for example — added Veith. Many of today’s crypto exchanges also carry insurance against theft. Nilsson added:“My gut feeling is that, on average, exchanges are probably more secure today, as some exchanges have taken things like audits and provable holdings to heart and have simply had much more time to build a proper business, but the general quandary of limited insight remains, with most exchanges running fairly opaque operations. A lot of people tend not to worry about the security or reliability of their chosen exchange until it's too late, the same as before.”One sometimes forgets that the crypto world has existed for only 12 years. The early exchanges were created and run by programmers and other technical specialists, noted Lee. For instance, Karpelès, who acquired the Mt. Gox Bitcoin-exchange site from programmer Jed McCaleb in 2011, was a PHP developer. “The later ventures had more traditional financial services leadership and they often pro-actively sought regulation,” Lee told Cointelegraph. Instead of domiciling offshore in an effort to avoid regulation, “they assumed they would eventually be beholden to U.S. securities law and they sought to comply.”“The first wave of entrepreneurs were evangelists for the technology, but low on quality,” Nick Shalek, a general partner at Ribbit Capital, told Reuters at the time of the Mt. Gox bankruptcy filing. With time, a more financially focused group of entrepreneurs emerged, intent on building more serious infrastructure around Bitcoin.That doesn’t mean today’s exchanges are model enterprises. “We're still seeing news of exchanges or other businesses folding under pretty eye-catching circumstances — QuadrigaCX springs to mind,” said Nilsson, referring to the Canadian crypto exchange, whose founder reportedly died in late 2018 and which still owes around $145 million to its 115,000 creditors. In a May 2019 report, Bitwise Asset Management noted that Bitcoin trading volume adds to roughly $6 billion per day, “but under the hood the exchanges that report the highest volumes are unrecognizable. The vast majority [95%] of this reported volume is fake and/or non-economic wash trading.” Still, that same Bitwise research suggested that the Bitcoin market has significantly matured in recent years. Nilsson commented on the matter:“These days there obviously exists a much larger number of crypto exchanges than back in the age of Mt. Gox, so there's probably a wide spectrum with many superior businesses but probably also many worse than Mt. Gox, where the saving grace is just that all the eggs are no longer in one basket, so to speak.” Others note that while blockchain platforms like Bitcoin and Ethereum are decentralized, the crypto exchanges upon which they trade remain largely centralized with private owners. “To fix this, decentralized exchanges have been built,” wrote DeMartino. “They aren't popular at this time because they tend to be slow, but they do work.""""Most cryptocurrency owners today do not truly own cryptocurrencies,"" observed Quinn DuPont in his book Cryptocurrencies and Blockchains. They instead trade them on privately owned exchanges. The wealth that has been stored on these “centralized services” presents a systemic market risk, he argues, ""not unlike the 'too big to fail' banks of the 2008 global economic crisis."" It’s not as bad as when Mt. Gox was so dominant, but the risk remains. Could something as spectacular as the Mt. Gox collapse take place again? “On the technical front, absolutely,” answered Nilsson. “But there's no longer one dominant exchange handling the bulk of all trading, so we'll hopefully never see something with as large a potential impact as Mt. Gox did.” “Good governance, a clear audit trail, and account segregation — these are the essentials to avoid a Mt. Gox 2 scenario,” said Gauthier. DeMartino wrote on the matter, ""The most positive thing that can be said about the Mt. Gox fiasco [...] is that it did not kill Bitcoin.” Thus, people continued to invest their money in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in ever larger amounts.Still, that was then, and this is now. Surviving a single bankruptcy in a period of economic expansion — even a loss as critical as the Mt. Gox exchange in 2014 — is a different sort of industry challenge than outlasting a Great Depression. The good news is that with more than 200 exchanges spread around the world — many of them covered by insurance and many professionally managed — the risk of a total crypto calamity is significantly diminished when compared to six years ago."

And the crypto industry really boomed from nothing in 2008 with the release of pseudonymous author Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin white paper. By 2017, thousands of new digital assets built on top of that work had found their way onto exchanges. Nowadays cryptocurrency lives somewhere in the public consciousness between a Bloomberg headline and a subculture.Cryptocurrency remains less than 100% accessible to the general public, but plenty of adults of legal age understand beer references. In that spirit, please enjoy this playful explainer of which crypto is like which beer.A standard American-style lager, Budweiser is an immensely well-known beer available in establishments east to west and beyond. It doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of contemporary India Pale Ales or bespoke sour beers, but it can still come through as a simple, reliable drink that many folks enjoy. Bitcoin gets the job done similarly in the crypto world. As the first cryptocurrency available to the public, it’s not the fanciest, latest thing. But users know what they’re getting when they use it — reliability and brand persistence. Just as Bitcoin’s implications (with regard to forking) lead the charge of a thousand cryptocurrencies, Budweiser’s parent company, Anheuser-Busch, is responsible for several other beers and brands. Positioned as a less filling, lower calorie alternative, Bud Light does not claim to be the real Budweiser, but rather takes its place as the popular alternative. Bud Light is obviously built on Budweiser’s impact, but has the potential to serve a different purpose, depending on the customer.Litcoin’s creator, Charlie Lee, describes LTC in relation to its usability and mass appeal. At one point in time, some headlines called Litecoin the figurative silver to Bitcoin’s gold.It’s worth noting that Litcoin confirms transactions more quickly than Bitcoin.A mainstream, entry-level craft beer, Blue Moon Belgian White has an arguably different, more robust flavor panel than a Budweiser. Watch me stretch this to how Ethereum built on what Bitcoin started. Blue Moon has a number of different flavors that go beyond its basic Belgian White designation, including Honey Wheat, Harvest Pumpkin Ale, White IPA and more. Ethereum was similarly the foundation for a multitude of initial coin offerings built on its blockchain. Additionally, many beer aficionados do not really classify Blue Moon a top-tier craft beer, much in the same way many parties criticize Ethereum for its scalability and performance issues. A popular choice, Goose Island 312 exudes the flavor and hoppiness of a fairly solid craft beer, although some enthusiasts might not call 312 a craft beer at all. Goose Island is owned by large-scale brewing giant, Anheuser-Busch, arguably disqualifying it as craft beer — some say that designation is partially characterized by a brewery’s small operating size.In the same way, many argue about XRP’s connection (and alleged centralized ties) to the large tech company Ripple. The XRP asset is fast, but many crypto enthusiasts knock its status as a true cryptocurrency, historically based on Ripple’s reported hefty coin stash. But XRP still gets the job done quite nicely as a method of digital value transfer, and has shown traders and market participants significant price action over the years. (Yes, Blue Moon is also owned by that large conglomerate called MillerCoors, but acknowledging that would collapse the analogy!)The hype around Zombie Dust is real. “Zombie Dust has maintained a level of hype that’s almost unheard of for a daily drinker,” according to a 2018 ChicagoMag article. “One Chicago store even hung a sign: ‘It has been __ hours since we’ve been asked for Zombie Dust.’”The hype is real because the product is real. Zombie Dust beer boasts a “world-class” score on BeerAdvocate.com for its unique flavor and aroma. Chainlink also touts similar hype and a posse. Its loyal fan base is affectionately known as the “Link Marines” on Twitter. The asset is generally well-received in the crypto space, and its project aims to solve the notorious “oracle problem” — a core issue in linking digital assets to real-world assets. Whether we’re talking beer or crypto, it often helps to step back and see the lighter side of the industries in which people reside."

According to the report, Huobi Pool’s operating profit jumped 218% from $2.5 million in 2018 to $6.3 million in 2019.As outlined by the company, the two main triggers for Huobi Pool’s growth in 2019 were Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining. Having accounted for 35.62% of the total net income, PoS continues to be the Huobi Pool’s most profitable business segment so far, the firm noted. Huobi Pool also projected that PoS will continue to be a focus in 2020.As reported by Cointelegraph, PoS is a consensus blockchain algorithm that operates on the basis of the validator's stake in the network. PoS is opposed to PoW, which relies on physical miners instead of network validators.Despite some blockchain projects like Ethereum trying to get rid of PoW consensus, the algorithm is apparently still profitable to date. According to Huobi Pool’s latest report, at least 23.5% of the firm's total net income in 2019 was contributed by PoW mining. Additionally, PoW mining became one of the fastest-growing business segments of 2019 for Huobi Pool, as its Bitcoin (BTC) hashrate reached a high of 6,578 PH/s.In the report, Huobi Pool also highlighted its Huobi Pool Token (HPT) as a central part of the company’s business model. In contrast to Huobi’s native token Huobi Token (HT), Huobi Pool Token is specifically designed for the company’s mining arm, acting as a reward mechanism for hashrate contribution as well as a way for users to participate in Huobi Pool developments.As of press time, both Huobi Pool Token and Huobi Token are seeing significant surges over the past 24 hours, up nearly 15% and 14%, respectively. The growth comes amid a major green trend on crypto markets, with Bitcoin getting back above $6,200 and jumping more than 18% over a 24-hour period as of press time, according to data from Coin360."

Based on the Ethereum blockchain, Paxos Standard is backed 1:1 by the U.S. dollar and is purportedly the second most widely traded stablecoin in the crypto market after USDT. As of press time, PAX is ranked the 33rd-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which amounts to around $266 million according to data from Coin360.Peter Smith, co-founder and CEO of Blockchain.com, outlined that the new development significantly expands the set of services offered to the firm’s users. Specifically, Smith emphasized that Borrow enables retail traders to trade like the “big guys,” stressing that institutional and retail investors have the same financial goals.By offering the retail market access to the same liquidity pool as institutional investors, Blockchain.com intends to address the shortage of USD on both sides of the crypto market, the firm noted in the announcement.The Blockchain.com CEO said: “Institutional and retail investors have the same financial goals — grow wealth and manage risks — but the tools at their disposal are vastly different [...] Now, with our suite of trading products and Borrow, retail users can trade like the big guys without selling the crypto they’ve stockpiled or leaving their Wallet.”Since the launch of Blockchain.com’s institutional lending platform in August 2019, the firm had loaned more than $120 million as of November, significantly increasing loans from $10 million in the first month.Blockchain.com’s new lending product Borrow comes amid a rise in crypto companies launching crypto loan services. On March 5, major Bitcoin payment firm BitGo officially launched its institutional-level crypto lending service. As reported by Cointelegrpaph, BitGo doesn’t plan to roll out the service to non-institutional clients in the near future though.Previously, cryptocurrency lending startup Celsius Network saw its interest payments more than double in the three months since November 2019."

I have previously found that Dr. Wright gave perjured testimony in my presence.”On March 9, 2019, Judge Reinhart ordered Wright to produce a list of his Bitcoin holdings — which Wright again claimed he could not do as it was held by a blind trust that he could not access. Wright estimated that it would take until January 2020 for the list to be delivered by bonded courier.Judge Bloom allowed Wright until Feb. 3, 2020 to file a notice with the court “indicating whether or not this mysterious figure has appeared from the shadows and whether the Defendant now has access to the last key slice needed to unlock the encrypted file.”On January 6, 2020, Wright produced documents evidencing a previously unidentified trust — ‘Tulip Trust III’. Both Judge Bloom and the plaintiffs requested several depositions seeking to establish how Wright obtained the Tulip Trust III documentation, to which Wright objected to numerous interrogatories based attorney-client privilege and spousal privilege.Wright claimed that his wife is the trustee of the Tulip Trust, and received the trust agreement as an encrypted file during December 2019 from the trust’s counsel.As such, Wright asserted that the communications between his wife, Ramona Watts, and the trust’s counsel, Denis Mayaka, are protected by attorney-client privilege, adding that communications between he and his wife are protected by spousal privilege.The judge determined that “the record does not establish that an attorney-client relationship exists between Mr. Mayaka and Ms. Watts,” also disregarding Wright’s “Mayaka Declaration” as it had not been adequately authenticated. Further, the judge found that the Trust document failed to identify Mayaka as counsel, noting that that “he is assigned a different role.”As such, the judge concluded that “the record does not establish that Mr. Mayaka is counsel to the Trustee of the Tulip Trust,” adding that Wright and Mayaka do not have an independent attorney-client relationship.On the same day, the judge requested judicial assistance from the Senior Master of the Queen’s Bench Division of the High Court in the United Kingdom in the litigation between Kleiman and Wright.The ongoing case concerns the effort of Ira Kleiman, the deceased brother of David Kleiman, to claim his brother’s share of the Tulip Trust — a stash of more than one million Bitcoins (BTC) that was purportedly set up by Wright and Kleiman following their supposed creation of Bitcoin."

Guznov argued:“In terms of the functioning of the financial system and consumer protection system, legalization of the issuance and facilitating the circulation of cryptocurrencies is an unjustified risk. As such, the bill explicitly prohibits emission and organization of cryptocurrency circulation, introducing legal liability for violating these rules.” Besides claiming that the crypto bill would ban Russian financial institutions from issuing digital assets, Guznov provided little clarity about the upcoming bill. When asked whether the Bank of Russia wants to ban residents from converting crypto into local fiat currency, the Russian ruble, or a foreign currency, Guznov did not provide a direct answer. Instead, the exec reiterated his stance that the central bank opposes institutions issuing cryptocurrencies, adding that the bank would be unable to impose certain limits on transactions in Bitcoin (BTC):“If a person who owns, for example, Bitcoins, completes a transaction in a jurisdiction that does not prohibit this, we are unlikely to be able to regulate that.”The latest remarks about Russia’s upcoming cryptocurrency regulation come after years of uncertainty as well as multiple delays in providing any regulatory clarity. First introduced in January 2018, President Vladimir Putin has ordered the adoption of the bill “On Digital Financial Assets” twice, but the legislation is still unfinalized to date.While Russia’s Ministry of Finance has been trying to legalize cryptocurrencies in the country, the central bank has apparently been fighting to ban Russians from legally using crypto at all. In February 2020, the Bank of Russia issued a whole set of rules for suspicious transactions, categorizing any crypto-related transaction as a potential money laundering risk.While prohibiting local entities from issuing their own digital assets, the central bank has been considering the emission of its own digital currency. In December 2019, the bank’s head Elvira Nabiullina said that the institution was exploring the possibility of issuing a digital ruble."

CoinDCX also pledged $1.3 million in funding towards initiatives to raise awareness and adoption of crypto in India on March 12.Crypto exchanges Kraken and KuCoin have both issued statements announcing a desire to enter the Indian market.Within one day of the Supreme Court’s ruling, both Binance and OKEx had resumed Indian operations through their respective local partners, WazirX and CoinDCX. Despite the widespread excitement for crypto in India, the sector still faces pending regulatory challenges.In addition to a probable appeal from RBI regarding the Supreme Court’s decision, India’s parliament is yet to rule on the “Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill"" from 2019."

Gox’s rehabilitation trustee notified creditors of a new portal through which they will be able to access all documents to be distributed at tomorrow’s meeting.As previously reported, as many as 24,000 creditors are thought to have been affected by Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox’s 2011 hack and later collapse in early 2014, which resulted in the loss of 850,000 BTC valued at roughly $460 million at the time.Reimbursement of the exchange’s creditors is being handled under the stewardship of Tokyo attorney Nobuaki Kobayashi, who was appointed by a Japanese court to act as the civil rehabilitation trustee to manage Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy estate.Today’s announcement is scant on details as to what will be discussed tomorrow, which will be the fourth creditors’ meeting so far in civil rehabilitation proceedings for the former exchange.The lengthy reimbursement process — ongoing six years after the exchange’s collapse — has galvanized creditors and other community members to self-organize in an attempt to quicken matters. Their coordinated legal action succeeded in securing Mt. Gox’s transition from bankruptcy proceedings to civil rehabilitation back in June 2018.Civil rehabilitation should ensure that creditors are reimbursed in crypto, rather than in fiat currency equivalent to the value of their Bitcoin holdings at the time of the exchange’s collapse.The long-winded process has spurred some investors to repeatedly attempt to buy up creditors’ claims — as, for example, private equity and hedge fund manager Fortress Investment  Group, which increased its offer last month to 88% of the estimated lost value.Michael Hourigan, a managing director at Fortress, said this February that the buyout offer was calculated according to “the likely timeline (3 to 5 years) and financial risk of the ongoing litigations.”Law firm Zheleznikov and Partners has recently claimed that it could recover up to 200,000 of the Bitcoin lost in the exchange’s hack by taking legal action against Russian nationals who allegedly hold the stolen money.In parallel, Mt. Gox’s former CEO Mark Karpeles remains mired in a legal battle over the nature of his role and culpability in the exchange fiasco."

Source: Coin360These movements also meant a further drop in altcoins. However, some outcomes have been doing slightly better than Bitcoin in recent weeks and one of them is XRP.XRP USD 1-week chart. Source: TradingViewThe XRP/USD chart shows many comparisons with the previous cycle, but it also indicates that the price is resting on the final support before a huge meltdown. The price of XRP dropped below the support of $0.15 intra-week (as it hit $0.10) but closed above the support of $0.15 with the weekly close.Through that, XRP price is holding the $0.15 support at a significant level. Losing this area would kickstart a further drop to the next support at $0.06. Moving towards $0.06 would cause the price to make a drop of 60%.XRP USD 1-week chart. Source: TradingViewFractals generally don’t mean much, but it’s interesting to see that the price of XRP is acting the same in the previous cycle. During 2015, the price of XRP came back to the last support for confirmation.A similar move is occurring right now, but this test for confirmation took twice as long as the price came back to this level after 118 weeks. In 2015 the test took 53 weeks.What can be concluded from this? Not much, as the price could easily fall below this level and continue the bear market. However, a natural conclusion can be drawn that this cycle is going to take longer than the previous one.This is not the wrong thing to see. The bigger and more mature a market becomes, the longer new cycles take. With Bitcoin, the cycle of 2014-2018 took four years, while the cycle before that took two years. It makes sense that the current cycle would peak out in 2024-2026 as the market is maturing.Comparing that to the chart of XRP, we can see that this cycle is taking longer, as this level is retested after two years rather than one year. A positive note is if the price copies the movements of 2015, a surge to $0.33 is possible in the upcoming weeks.XRP BTC 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewA common occurrence during 2017 and 2018 was the inverse correlation between XRP and BTC. Once BTC started to rally upwards, the XRP/BTC pair dropped. The moment BTC began to drop south, XRP/BTC jumped upwards.Lately, this correlation disappeared, and XRP used to move alongside Bitcoin, until last week when Bitcoin witnessed a massive crash from $7,500 to $3,750 within one day. As a result, many altcoins saw a significant drop in their BTC pair as well, but not XRP.During these following days, XRP/BTC gained 23%, balancing their USD value. As stated previously, the weekly candle held the vital support of $0.15, mainly due to the strong bounce in the BTC pair.What else does the chart show? There was an immediate rejection at the 0.00002900 satoshis level, as the price dropped down. Similarly, the price of Bitcoin has rallied in the past 48 hours, reaching $5,900.This strong upside move from Bitcoin caused the XRP/BTC pair to drop massively, as the pair is approaching the 0.00002600 satoshis support level again.XRP BTC 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewOne of the essential things to watch for is the correlation between XRP and BTC, as discussed in the previous section.However, the XRP/BTC pair shows a descending triangle structure. There’s strong support found in the green zone, which is found between 0.00002450 - 0.00002550 satoshis. As long as that support holds, it will provide a significant entry.The resistances of this range are mainly found at 0.00002800 - 0.00002900 satoshis and 0.00003150 - 0.00003300 satoshis, alongside with the descending triangle trendline.As the chart is showing, a breakout of the trendline could take until May or June of this year. But, the moment that XRP breaks through the trendline and breaks above 0.00002800 - 0.00002900 satoshis, a clear rally is on the tables with targets of 0.00003800 satoshis. Such a rally would mean a surge of 45% from the current prices.XRP USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewFor the XRP/USD pair, the $0.15 level is a crucial level to hold, as discussed previously. The primary resistance to break is the red zone between $0.182-$0.195. As long as that area remains resistance, there’s no reason to be bullish on the chart.However, what investors would want to see is a bottom formation like the period in December 2019, shown by the blue rectangle.Through that, a period of sideways movements occurred in which a support and accumulation range was established. After this, the price of XRP started to rally significantly.A similar situation would suit the price well, given that it’s on its final support before $0.06. Holding this area and testing the $0.182-$0.195 area would be an exciting development.An apparent breakthrough of the $0.182-$0.195 resistance area would mean a surge towards $0.32-$0.35 as the next move. If that occurs, then we’ll see XRP copying the previous cycle, but only a bit slower.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

At present, it is unclear whether Blockchain markets will be negatively impacted by this news, or provide safety from the storm.","Officially known as COVID-19, the WHO said coronavirus has spread enough globally to warrant classification as a pandemic, CNBC reported on March 11.“In the past two weeks the number of cases outside China has increased thirteenfold and the number of affected countries has tripled,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director general, said at a press event, CNBC noted. “In the days and weeks ahead, we expect to see the number of cases, the number of deaths and the number of affected countries to climb even higher,” Ghebreyesus added. There may be reason to believe that Bitcoin and other digital currencies could help to stem the spread of COVID-19 amongst users.Cryptocurrencies, made famous for their digital method of value transfer, do not necessitate the handling of fiat cash — paper government debt notes that often carry germs from one person to the next. The digital and decentralized nature of the industry means that the blockchain space is not an inherent breeding ground for viruses. Additionally, many projects within the industry function remotely — or, at least, with remote potential — allowing workers to avoid the spread of germs. This allows many Blockchain companies to continue contributing to the economy in a way that workers in other sectors cannot. On the other hand, crypto assets could fall in value as a result of the newly-termed pandemic. Bitcoin and other decentralized assets have seen a sizable decline in the face of falling mainstream financial markets. A connection arguably exists between declining traditional market prices and the coronavirus. Falling traditional markets also may have affected crypto prices as investors flock to more stable assets, according to experts. If Bitcoin can decouple from the situation at hand, however, it may help the asset become a global hedge option for people facing financial crisis around the world."

BitPanda CEO Eric Demuth believes that Bitcoin is “Gold 2.0” or “a better version of gold” for “a younger and ‘more digital’ generation.” While the current economic situation is bullish for cryptocurrencies in the long-term, how does the short to medium-term picture look? Let’s analyze the top performers of the past seven days to find out.Chainlink (LINK) has again found a place among the top performers with a rally of about 3% in the past seven days. Chainlink announced a collaboration with DeFi Money Market to launch a higher-yield money market on the Ethereum mainnet backed by tokenized real-world assets. In another move, Chillz and Chainlink have entered a partnership to create real-time non-fungible tokens based on real-world data and events. RealT tokenizes real estate on the Ethereum blockchain for which, Chainlink will provide independent, trust-minimized property valuations for the real estate holdings. Global taxation and transaction advisory firm EY along with ConsenSys and Microsoft have announced the formation of the Baseline Protocol, which has been developed in collaboration with many companies, one of them being Chainlink. LINK USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThe LINK/USD pair attempted to resume the uptrend but the bulls hit a wall closer to the psychological resistance at $5. The failure to breach this resistance has attracted profit-booking by the traders.If the price can stay above the trendline, we anticipate another attempt by the bulls to push the price above $5. If successful, a rally to $5.6934 and above it to $7.3101 is possible. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought levels, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the pair below the trendline. Such a move will indicate a lack of demand at higher levels. The pair will weaken further on a break below the critical support zone of $3.3113-$3. Crypto.com Coin (CRO), with a rally of about 2% is the second-best performer of the past seven days. Crypto.com Exchange launched soft staking support for 11 cryptocurrencies using which, the investors can earn up to 5% p.a. on cryptocurrencies held in the Exchange. CRO USD weekly chart. Source: TradingviewThe CRO/USD pair had a stupendous rally from a low of $0.025258 in Dec. of last year to $0.084046 in Feb. of this year. Currently, the pair is correcting the huge rally. The bulls are attempting to defend the zone between $0.054652-$0.047715, which corresponds to 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels of the rally from the 52-week lows.After the sharp rally, we anticipate the pair to consolidate the recent gains before making the next directional move. If the buyers can push the price above $0.69, a retest of $0.080 will be on the cards. If the bulls can push the price above $0.084046 and sustain it, the uptrend will resume. The next target on the upside is $0.110396. Conversely, if the bears sink the price below $0.047715, a drop to $0.04 is possible.Tezos (XTZ) has just managed to stay in the green in the past seven days. Can it resume its rally or is it time to book profits?XTZ USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThe bulls have been attempting to resume the uptrend. However, higher levels are witnessing profit booking, as seen in this week’s price action.If the bulls fail to defend the support at $2.5263, which is just below the critical 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the most recent rally, the XTZ/USD pair is likely to extend its correction to $2.28451360 and below it to the 20-week EMA at $1.96.Conversely, if the bulls can keep the price above $2.5263, we expect the pair to remain range-bound for a few more weeks. A break above $3.50 will be a sign that the bulls are back in action. Maker (MKR) also has just managed to remain in the green in the past seven days. The monthly transaction volume in Feb. made a new high of 4.5 billion Dai compared to the previous high made in November of last year, which was about 2.41 billion Dai, which is a bullish sign. Can this result in an up move? Let’s analyze the chart. MKR USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThe MKR/USD pair is currently trading just below the center of the $400-$800 range. This range has been in force for more than a year. The bulls purchase the drops to $400 while the bears defend the rallies to about $550 and above it at $800.Both moving averages are flat and the RSI is also close to the midpoint. This suggests a balance between buyers and sellers. As long as the price remains inside this range, the bulls can buy the dips to strong support levels and sell the rallies to strong overhead resistance levels. If the bulls can scale the pair above $800, a rally to $1,200 is possible. As the pair has been consolidating for more than a year, a breakout is likely to be strong and can exceed the upside targets. Therefore, the traders can buy after the price closes (UTC time) above $800.The trend will turn in favor of the bears if the price dips below $400 but we give it a low possibility of occurring.The top 100 wallets own about 25% of the Ether (ETH) supply according to blockchain data analysis firm Santiment. While this looks to be a huge accumulation by the bulls, it should be noted that the exchanges own about 16.8% of the total ETH supply, according to TokenAnalyst data. Therefore, the traders should not expect an immediate price appreciation.Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin believes that digitalization is inevitable and the users will favor the decentralized privacy currency over the state-controlled Central Bank Digital Currencies. The Ethereum All Core Devs could not arrive at a solution on the fate of ProgPow as both the supporters and opposers stuck to their ground.  ETH USD weekly chart. Source: TradingviewDuring the week, the bulls pushed the price above the overhead resistance at $235.70 but they could not sustain the higher levels. This shows that sellers are using minor rallies to offload their positions.If the bears can now sink the ETH/USD pair below the immediate support at $209.950, a drop to $197.75 is possible. Both the moving averages are located close to this level, hence, we anticipate the bulls to defend this support aggressively.A bounce off $197.75 will be a positive sign and the bulls are likely to make another attempt to resume the up move. The pair will signal strength after the price sustains above $235.70.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the pair slides below the critical support at $197.75. If that happens, it will be a huge negative. The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

director and chairman. Vessenes has provided digital-currency ...",1 month ago,"Welcome back to Cointelegraph China’s Focus talk show. This time around, Peter Vessenes is under the spotlight. He is the founder of CoinLab, the first venture-backed Bitcoin company. He also co-founded the Bitcoin Foundation, serving as its first executive director and chairman.","Vessenes has provided digital-currency consulting services for entities including the United States Treasury Department, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI. He serves as the chief cryptographer for the Deluge Network and Metronome, a project that aims to create a “politics-free digital currency.”Cointelegraph: You were the first one to have talked with the U.S. Treasury Department about Bitcoin. What is the story behind it, and what exactly did they discuss with you that first time?Peter Vessenes: In the early days, governments were trying to get their heads around Bitcoin, and things were so decentralized it wasn't really clear who even to talk to. The Bitcoin Foundation filled that role for a while in a critical time in the industry's development. We were invited out originally to meet with FinCEN, which is the Anti-Money Laundering enforcement section of the Treasury Department, headed by Jennifer Shasky Calvery at that time.They were most worried about and interested in the enforcement side of Bitcoin: knowing what was happening, who was doing what and so on. Ms. Calvery said something I'll never forget: ""We think the toothpaste is out of the tube."" She proceeded to explain her rough idea was to acknowledge they couldn't stop Bitcoin from being a thing, and they would try and work with already regulated entities at the on- and off-ramps for enforcement.This, it turned out, was a really good strategy. It let some early Bitcoin businesses and funds get a commanding lead: Coinbase, Kraken and Pantera all had the regulatory space to work on business models without major fear. I would say the SEC has done much worse by American business in the most recent round of innovation, regulating with a much heavier hand, and we see the results with exchanges like Binance worth billions of dollars, but staying out of the U.S.CT: Many traditional companies are now working on cryptocurrency, but on the other hand, the Securities and Exchange Commission continues to place obstacles before the Libra stablecoin, and it hasn’t warmly welcomed crypto exchange-traded fund applicants, either. What is the exact problem you think the crypto companies need to solve? And what is the SEC or the government looking for?PV: Government agencies that I've worked with are mostly concerned with serious enforcement worries, really objectionable activities, by which I mean things I wish I had never heard were happening and certainly will not repeat. I found this comforting. In 2012, it wasn't clear if there would be sort of “petty” enforcement in the U.S. outside of the SEC. In the U.S., we haven't seen much of that, although perhaps IRS subpoenas of Coinbase records come close. In general, most agencies I've worked with were filled with good people working on good things, and they almost all — big secret — own crypto themselves.As far as companies solving problems: financial inclusion, open access, destruction of rent-seeking behavior by long-standing financial industry participants — those are all pretty good goals. I'll give you a hint, though, and say that JPMorgan won't be destroying rent-seeking behavior, no matter how innovative its crypto group is.SEC behavior is complex, and it's good to remember that the U.S. has multiple regulatory agencies overseeing complex financial products; the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is another. So, you have a mix of internal regulator incentives, including expanding their own remit vis-a-vis other agencies, American imperialism, etc., and then you also have some what I'd call ""good"" motivations, like protecting citizens from scams, Ponzi schemes and so on.I think we'll continue to see real innovation happening in fits and starts in areas that are as lightly regulated as possible. It's just so very expensive, risky and time-consuming to try to innovate in America on the financial side. I really can't emphasize enough the benefits of a lighter regulatory regime for innovation. It's very important.CT: The Bitcoin Foundation was one of the most prominent organizations in the ecosystem. So, how do you see its failings with respect to its governance, transparency and finances? PV: Leaving the Bitcoin Foundation was bittersweet. In the beginning, I wanted it to be a place that built the good brand reputation for Bitcoin globally and provided a venue for both industry and individuals to do some collective work together.It was sweet because it was clear that my idea had been right: There was real demand to organize and work together. Bitter because I failed to bring the best quality leadership to the top of the organization. Two board members went to prison. A third had been accused of crimes, but not tried. I worked hard to try to clear out influencers that I thought shouldn't be there. But in the end, I couldn't keep the leadership at a level I felt good about and decided to leave.There won't be another thing like the foundation in our industry, but I'm still glad I launched it with Gavin Andresen and would do it again, although I would change how we chose board leadership and make it more international from the very beginning. CT: Regarding Mt. Gox, as previously reported, roughly 24,000 creditors are thought to have been affected by the 2011 hack and subsequent collapse in early 2014. It was said you own a stake of Mt Gox and you have submitted a $16 billion claim in the Mt. Gox civil rehabilitation, which is considered an obstacle for other creditors. Can you explain the issue here?PV: Unfortunately, since we are still in litigation seven years later, I can't talk a lot. I will say that we have been diligently and aggressively pushing for a real trial this whole time so that we can get a fair ruling. It looks like we will be getting that trial in Tokyo this year, pending coronavirus slowdowns. So, that's great.“Right now, all creditors — including us — are waiting on the trustee to make a payment plan that can be reviewed. Believe me, we would love to see one as much as any other creditor.”We have had a fair amount of interest from investors and other creditors trying to buy into the lawsuit as a way to hedge out their own risks in the bankruptcy and ideally achieve good returns. So, we may look into providing access to the suit to a broader group of investors in the future, all still TBD.CT: As a cryptographic expert, how do you summarize the technology development of blockchain in these 10 years? After proof-of-work, different consensus mechanisms have appeared, like proof-of-stake, delegated proof-of-stake, practical Byzantine fault tolerance,, etc. What do you think of them? And are there any projects that excite you with their technology?PV: The last project that really got me excited technically was Ethereum. Not to say we haven't seen interesting innovation since then, but it was a massive leap over Bitcoin. We just closed a blockchain fund — Capital 6 Eagle — with my partner in China, and I can tell you what I'm investing in:A crazy paper last year that really got me thinking was the MAST paper out of Blockstream. They provided a way to have provable computation using only software. It's very, very slow, but the idea is profound and interesting for verifiability.CT: You started to pay attention to smart contracts in 2014, and you set up New Alchemy in 2016. What is the main plan for you this year?PV: I'm launching a new project that has been a secret so far, but this can be the announcement: It's a Bitcoin paper-currency project. Unlike some of the other hardware-wallet projects, we are working on having a chip embedded directly into a paper bill. We will have a series of announcements, but we are working with a major global currency producer and have an agreement with one of the best currency designers in the world to make these bills. It's just so very hard to deal with crypto, and I want to give access to regular people to have, hold and trade it.Finally, we're working on launching a Shenzhen incubator, probably in the third quarter. So, that should be really exciting. I love the energy and pace of business in China and want to provide mentorship, capital and advice to another generation of Chinese entrepreneurs. So, that's really exciting.CT: You are also interested in security token offerings. You said in 2018 that there would be a large circulation of STOs in the future, but they haven’t made much progress. What do you think about it now?PV: On STOs: I was obviously wrong about timing, which is the same thing as being wrong. The difficulties in the last few years have been the intersection of the technology, the regulatory pace and the crash all together. Plus, early STOs offered in the U.S. were just bad offerings, poorly priced and definitely worse for the buyer than comparable publicly traded products or crypto products — or both.But I do sort of stand by my prediction, too. Over the years, I believe more and more in the idea of permissionless innovation. STOs necessarily bridge regulated and unregulated worlds, and this is a really hard space because of that interaction. But, I still do believe that we will see tokenized offerings with regulatory oversight.CT: One time you mentioned that you feel a “nostalgia” about the early times when Bitcoin was purely decentralized and only was mined by personal computers. Do you think that the modern ecosystem is the right way for the industry to develop?PV: If I could wave a wand, I would definitely do away with industrial mining. It's a very hard problem to do away with, though. I think mining is not in a stable position right now, though. There will be more innovation on business models. For instance, during the BCH–BTC war, I thought it very interesting that companies like Coinbase used their user platforms to advocate for what they wanted. Why hadn't they invested in mining so that they could actually control voting on the outcome?The answer to that question is at least partly regulatory, by the way, both for Coinbase and their investors, but it's also social; a matter of how different people think of mining. Miners have generally historically not used their influence for more than making money, or at least usually in very soft ways, and this is probably not quite what Satoshi wanted.CT: In early 2018, you said that innovations in the industry should be measured by the question: “What percent of the total innovation that’s going to be done has been done?” And your answer was less than 5%. Do you think we are at the same stage now? PV: I still think we have a lot of innovation left to do, and in fact, I wouldn't say anything super material has shown up in the last two years. We're seeing infrastructure build out right now, which is good. But we need another Vitalik and Gav, or we need one of them to pull a Linus Torvalds and do Git on top of Linux.CT: What would you say to Satoshi Nakamoto if you were to meet?PV: What makes you think I haven't?To Satoshi, I'd say thank you, we got the leader we needed, luckily not the leader we deserved."

Brooks will also serve as the OCC’s chief operating officer effective April 1, the announcement reads.A known sceptic of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Mnuchin outlined Brooks as a “strong leader with extensive experience in the financial services sector,” adding that he is excited to work together to foster the financial system and greater economic growth.Coinbase said in an email to Cointelegraph that the company is pleased to know that their legal officer is joining the OCC to oversee the nation’s banking system, noting that Brooks will definitely bring a more friendly stance to crypto with him. Brooks has been leading Coinbase’s legal, compliance, government relations and global investigations groups since September 2018.Outlining Brooks as “invaluable in shaping the Coinbase legal and compliance programs,” a spokesperson at Coinbase said:“In the midst of a public health and financial crisis, we are comforted to know that Brian Brooks will serve in this critical role overseeing the nation’s banking system [...] We’re always proud of Coinbase alumni who go on to serve in government, bringing a crypto-friendly perspective with them.”Apart from his departure from Coinbase, Brooks will also step down from the boards of directors of the Federal National Mortgage Association — commonly known as Fannie Mae — and marketplace lender Avant. Prior to joining Coinbase in 2018, Brooks also served as founding advisor at decentralized fintech project Spring Labs, member of the compliance and information security committee at Avant and executive vice president and general counsel at Fannie Mae.In early March, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said that the U.S. welcomes responsible digital innovation, still emphasizing that the agency is focused on preventing illicit uses of crypto like money laundering and terrorist financing. Reiterating his skepticism of the industry, Mnuchin said that the U.S. “will not tolerate the use of cryptocurrencies in support of illicit activities.”"

Still, other ...",1 month ago,Cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex deployed its proprietary market surveillance tool to combat market abuse on the platform called “Shimmer.”,"According to an announcement shared with Cointelegraph on March 24, Shimmer is meant to identify and investigate possible manipulative behaviours and suspicious trading on Bitfinex. The exchange expects that the integration of the tool with its matching engine will improve market integrity and visibility.Now, Bitfinex’s team will be alerted via email when potential improper trading activity is detected on any of the exchange’s trading pairs, including futures and margin-enable trades. The firm hopes Shimmer will help prevent activities such as wash trading and layering. The exchange’s chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino commented:“Comprehensive market and trade surveillance capabilities are integral to operating a leading cryptocurrency exchange. [...] Bitfinex has chosen to develop its own state-of-the-art surveillance system. This will help to assure that potentially manipulative practices are rooted out and suspicious behaviour detected.”Ardoino explained to Cointelegraph that “Shimmer processes the entire order and trade data and tries to find patterns for layering, spoofing and other manipulative practices.” He also said that, in order to avoid false positives due to high-frequency bot-based trading the system “can be taught to have different thresholds depending on the activity of the user.”Ardoino revealed that Bitfinex plans to make Shimmer open source in the future, but there’s no deadline for this yet. An exchange spokesperson also explained to Cointelegraph that when anomalous trading is detected the consequences will see the firm take different measures based on the severity of the activity.Being less regulated, the cryptocurrency market has long been accused of being much more vulnerable to manipulation than its traditional counterparts. For instance, in November 2019 research suggested that a single whale was responsible for Bitcoin’s historic price surge in 2017. Still, other sources later contradicted the theory."

created the product with the plan of becoming the top Bitcoin ...",1 month ago,"Aaron Gong, vice president of futures at major cryptocurrency exchange Binance, explained to Cointelegraph how the firm managed to become one of the top crypto futures trading platforms.","As Cointelegraph reported earlier this week, Binance recently overtook BitMEX and became the second-largest platform in terms of 24-hour Bitcoin (BTC) futures trading volume. When asked whether he is surprised by such success, Gong said that the firm created the product with the plan of becoming the top Bitcoin futures trading platform:“We knew we would be there soon, and we made it in slightly more than 6 months’ time.”According to Gong, the three primary reasons behind the success of Binance’s futures products are the low taker fees, new features and a large amount of altcoin pairs. He said that too many exchanges offer negative maker fees:“Too many other exchanges offer negative maker fees, where most orders are just computerized market makers competing for best bid and ask with extremely limited taker interest during periods of low-volatility.”Gong also said that innovation also drives trading volumes when it comes to Binance’s futures. He claimed that the exchange has had a few firsts when it comes to the crypto futures market:“We are the first major crypto exchange to launch max 125X leverage for BTC contracts, and the first of its kind to launch cross collateral and smart liquidation mechanism. These features have gained tremendous popularity amongst our users.”The third reason for the success of Binance’s futures contracts, Gong explained, is the number of altcoin contracts. He said that the firm launched 24 futures contracts on the platform, adding:“As of today, Binance Futures houses half of the top 10 most liquid altcoin contracts, many of which are also the most traded pairs amongst all futures exchanges.”Gong’s strategy to drive the volume of futures contracts on Binance is to continue bringing more functionalities and products to the industry. He said that he believes Binance has outdone its competitors, as other crypto trading platforms suffered problems such as overloads, poor risk management, and counterintuitive product designs. He explained that Binance’s design was largely driven by user’s complaints about other platforms:“We specifically aimed to address these issues and improve the users’ experience. As such, we put tremendous efforts to build an industry-leading matching engine that is able to process more than 100,000 orders per second. [...] Whilst there were issues of system overloads, outages, glitches, and even rollbacks elsewhere, we’ve proven time and again to be a safe, reliable, cheap and liquid venue for hedging.”It is worth noting that Binance’s trading platform ran into a number of issues in February. On Feb. 19, the exchange halted trading to resolve an unexpected technical issue with its infrastructure.As a Feb. 25 Cointelegraph analysis illustrated, this incident took place after a week in which the platform was often unresponsive to trader input as the exchange was unable to manage a large uptick in user volume.In early March, Binance halted trading again to fix a malfunction. The exchange’s co-founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao purportedly blocked Jay Hao — the CEO of competing exchange OKEx — on Twitter, after he publicly offered to help fix the infrastructure.However, Gong said that the malfunctions did not affect Binance’s futures trading infrastructure and that futures traders were not affected:“Our futures system has been proving to be performing well during the most volatile period since we launched. The futures market is running on a separate matching engine.”"

They told Rhule they were bringing Ukranian women to the U.S. for the purposes of prostitution.Special Agent Victor Morales from the Drug Enforcement Agency said in the complaint:“Rhule conducted these transactions even after the undercover agent explained that at least a portion of the cash involved represented proceeds of human trafficking.”Rhule made an appearance before the US District Court of Seattle on Tuesday. He was charged with conducting an unlicensed money transmitting business and five counts of laundering monetary instruments. The complaint noted that he failed to conduct any Know Your Customer ID verification checks.The money laundering charges are punishable by up to 20 years in prison, while the marijuana charges are punishable with a minimum of five years in prison, and a maximum of 40 years.On one occasion while waiting for confirmations the Bitcoin had been successfully deposited, Rhule allegedly boasted about doing “5,10 or 20,000 kilo"" CBD (Cannabidiol) orders.

With only 33 cases of coronavirus confirmed so far, the administration hopes that the emergency measures will prevent its health system from becoming overwhelmed by a rapid increase in infections.Venezuela’s national banking system has been halted “indefinitely” as part of the sudden quarantine, sparking an increase in P2P cryptocurrency trading. After a three week skid in weekly volume, Localbitcoins trade activity between BTC and the bolivar has rebounded back above $3.4 million for the past two weeks.The economic ramifications of the coronavirus appear to be driving cryptocurrency adoption across the South American continent, with Localbitcoins volume jumping over 30% in Peru and increasing nearly 15% in Colombia over the past week. Both Peru and Colombia have closed their borders in recent days.The COVID-19 threat appears to have dampened Venezuelan efforts to force adoption of its oil-backed cryptocurrency, the Petro.Maduro’s last major initiatives to drive Petro use appear to have taken place in January, with the president announcing the launch of a Petro-powered casino from which the profits will purportedly fund health and education programs. The casino was launched approximately one week after Maduro decreed that all airline fuel sales for international flights be conducted using the Petro.Despite Maduro’s efforts to stimulate its adoption, Venezuelans have not warmed to the Petro. Localbitcoins listings have shown Venezuelans to be offloading the tokens at half of their supposedly fixed value of $60."

changing their interest rates on Bitcoin and Ether. 5728 Total views.",1 month ago,Clients of one crypto lending company may soon notice some changes in response to the recent drops in the market. ,"Starting on April 1, BlockFi will be raising the interest account rates on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). According to CEO Zac Prince, BlockFi users holding between 0-5 BTC now will earn a 6% annual percentage yield (APY), while those with up to 500 ETH will earn a 4.5% APY. Stablecoins like the Gemini Dollar (GUSD) and USD Coin (USDC), will retain their 8.6% APY interest rates.With the recent Bitcoin crash caused by the coronavirus restrictions affecting markets, BlockFi has reported “very limited liquidity”. The lending firm said “they did not liquidate USD loan client collateral below a price of ~$4,500, despite the market reaching lows of ~$3,800.”Therefore the decision to raise interest rates is unexpected when considering how traditional financial institutions are reacting to these changes in the market. Even the U.S. Federal Reserve has cut interest rates to 0%. Nevertheless, Prince sees hope in the crypto market, citing that BlockFi itself has maintained “perfect performance” with “zero losses” reported. “Our balance sheet is stronger than ever and shifts in the institutional lending markets have created opportunities that expand our margin.”The CEO went on to describe how BlockFi has processed the largest number and volume of daily deposits and withdrawals in the platform’s history. Tens of millions in trading volume have continued without interruption as a result of the BlockFi team’s efforts.“As the global economy weathers a number of headwinds, including the coronavirus pandemic, rest assured that at BlockFi we will remain a stable source of liquidity, while continuing to provide best-in-class wealth management solutions for our clients and the broader cryptocurrency market.”BlockFi raised $30 million in a Series B funding round in February. Major investors included Morgan Creek Digital, Winklevoss Capital and Arrington XRP Capital.This brings BlockFi’s total funds raised to more than $100 million since it was founded in 2018.

Singapore and Brunei to trade the Singapore dollar against Bitcoin ...",1 month ago,"OKCoin, one of the world’s oldest cryptocurrency exchanges, is continuing to expand its fiat-to-crypto onramps by adding support of the Singapore dollar (SGD).","Starting March 12, OKCoin users can deposit and withdraw Singapore’s official fiat currency — the Singapore dollar — for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).As the Singapore dollar is also officially accepted in its neighbor country Brunei, individuals and institutions in both jurisdictions are able to start trading their Singapore dollars for crypto, OKCoin announced to Cointelegraph.The Singapore dollar is the third fiat currency supported by OKCoin after the United States dollar and euro, the company noted.In conjunction with the launch of the Singapore dollar support, OKCoin is also setting up a new office in Singapore, which is a major financial hub for Southeast Asia and the Asia Pacific region. The company will now be hiring local industry professionals as part of OKCoin’s broader mission to spur global cryptocurrency adoption.Originally founded in China by Star Xu, who is also the founder of the world’s third-biggest crypto exchange OKEx, OKCoin is now officially headquartered in San Francisco and has a number of offices worldwide including Malta. The fiat-focused cryptocurrency platform is available in 184 countries to date, OKCoin says.The exchange apparently intends to benefit from the local crypto-friendly ecosystem as the country has recently passed a new law to bring more clarity to the operation of local crypto businesses.On Jan. 28, Singapore adopted its cryptocurrency legislation, the Payments Services Act (PSA), officially putting crypto firms under the oversight of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the country’s central bank and major financial regulatory authority.As reported by Cointelegraph, a number of local crypto businesses have outlined the potential benefits of the PSA, with some industry players expecting that the MAS’ crypto regulations would attract more credible blockchain companies to be based and licensed in Singapore.  A spokesperson at OKCoin said:“The commitment the Singapore government has shown to the growth and development of Blockchain will put the city-state among the global leaders driving the industry forward, making Singapore a major focus for OKCoin.”According to a 2019 report, Singapore is one of the biggest countries in terms of the number of registered digital currency exchanges alongside major global jurisdictions like the United Kingdom, the United States, and Hong Kong."

Currently, just 12 crypto exchanges hold around 2.5 million Bitcoin (BTC) in their wallets, worth around $15 billion. That’s 13.8% of all Bitcoin mined to date — or, 16%–17% of all Bitcoin in circulation, considering lost Bitcoin (as of March 19).","Exchanges are also some of the largest holders of altcoins, which recently led to a controversy when some of the biggest crypto exchanges used large stockpiles of Steem tokens to take over Steemit.Just like Steem, Tron’s consensus is also delegated proof-of-stake, and its biggest representative is Binance, which holds over 54% of the votes. So, when Changpeng Zhao (aka CZ) made a friendly reminder to Justin Sun that “transparency works,” he had a bit of leverage — albeit not his own, as those tokens were likely customer deposits.How did exchanges become so rich and powerful? After all, an exchange is just a platform that facilitates trading, not a bank or an investment fund. Even the platforms themselves state: “Binance provides an online digital asset trading platform,” Huobi “is a platform dedicated to the transaction of digital assets,” while “Kraken provides you with a simple and convenient way to trade [...] digital assets,” etc.In an ideal decentralized world, there would be no centralized exchanges. Unfortunately, decentralized exchanges are not capable of providing their users with the same kind of convenience and scale. This technological frailty gave rise to the gigantic centralized exchanges of today, which have become the biggest digital asset custodians in the world.Unsurprisingly, their size makes them an irresistible target for hackers and prone to various mishaps, costing their clients billions of dollars and tremendous grief. As Oren Katz, the vice president of engineering at Starkware — a company whose goal is to bring on-chain transactions to exchanges and release them of the burdensome custodial duties — put it:“We have spoken with all the major crypto exchanges, some get very excited about our solution, some don’t. For some, it’s a bug, for others, it’s a feature. They say ‘people trust us, we have a good reputation.’”Not only is custody of customer deposits a feature, but it can serve as a source of additional revenue when exchanges engage in hypothecation — a practice that occurs when an institution uses deposits or collateral for financial gains. Exchanges can lend their deposits and earn interest, they can stake them to earn rewards, or even use their customers’ assets to influence elections in various DPoS schemes that could potentially benefit them as well.Before discussing the issue of whether exchanges should be allowed to use their customers’ deposits for their own gain, let’s look into something that most users never bother reading: the “terms of use” or “user agreements” of some of the most popular exchanges. And since most of the exchanges’ agreements don’t spell out their policy toward user deposits, Cointelegraph has reached out to all the exchanges discussed in this article.Binance’s terms of use don’t seem to shed much light on the issue of using customer deposits. There is a passage that states, “Binance maintains full custody of the funds.” However, this refers only to “remaining funds after account termination due to fraud, violation of law, or violation of these terms.”In addition to not being fully transparent about its handling of user deposits, Binance refuses to disclose its legal status. When a Maltese regulator declared that Binance doesn’t possess “an official license by MFSA,” Changpeng Zhao went to Twitter to say:“Binance.com has always operated in a decentralized manner as we reach out to our users across more than 180 nations worldwide. As well as pushing the envelope in experimenting how to become a true DAO (decentralized autonomous organization).”Binance has not responded to an inquiry for comment.Of all the exchanges that were examined, Coinbase has one of the most explicit and progressive policies:“Coinbase will not sell, transfer, loan, hypothecate, or otherwise alienate Digital Currency in your Digital Currency Wallet unless instructed by you.”Also, the policy states that unless otherwise specified, Coinbase doesn’t support any digital assets that have “staking, protocol governance” functionality.Coinbase did not respond to our inquiry.OKEx’s terms of service explicitly prohibit hypothecation — adding that Aux Cayes FinTech Co. Ltd, a Seychelles legal entity that operates OKEx, will not use funds without user authorization:“Digital Assets deposited or acquired by You through the Aux Cayes order matching platform or the C2C platform will be held by Aux Cayes in the digital wallet maintained by Aux Cayes on your behalf. [...] Aux Cayes will not use your VFAs as security or in any way make use of your VFAs, other than as lawfully directed by you and with your prior authorisation. VFAs held by Aux Cayes on your behalf may be pooled with those of other Users.”In a statement released to Cointelegraph, an OKEx spokesperson reiterated that the exchange doesn’t engage in hypothecation:“OKEx assures clients would have full control in respect to their asset custody in OKEx. We support a proper industry standard on segregation between client money and house fund.”Huobi’s global user agreement doesn’t explicitly mention its handling of the user deposits. The only somewhat relevant information that is available states:“This Website only provides online transaction platform services for you to engage in digital asset trading activities through this Website (including but not limited to the digital asset transactions etc.). This Website does not participate in the transaction of digital assets as a buyer or seller.”Huobi hasn’t replied to an inquiry from Cointelegraph.Bitfinex is yet another exchange that doesn’t include its handling of users’ deposits in its terms of service. However, it admits that “from time to time” it may “act as principal, counterparty, or market-maker in the transactions” and yet “its orders, trades and other transactions will be treated the same.”Its security policy page states that most of the funds are stored offline in cold wallets and “only approximately 0.5% of crypto assets are accessible in hot wallets for day-to-day platform operations.”Bitfinex hasn’t responded to Cointelegraph’s request for inquiry.BitMEX is another major exchange whose terms of use don’t specify how it treats customer deposits. However, it warns its users of the inherent dangers of trading on the exchange:“You acknowledge and agree that the Services should only be used by you if you:i) have knowledge and experience in highly volatile markets;ii) are trading with Bitcoin you can afford to lose; andiii) have a high risk tolerance.”It also asks users to acknowledge that “any Bitcoin withdrawal address you provide is your own and that you have full control over this address.”BitMEX declined to respond to a request for comment, citing the coronavirus threat.Kraken’s terms of service don’t discuss its handling of user deposits. However, there is a proof of reserves page where the exchange declares that it “holds full reserves” and employs ”an independent, cryptographically-verified audit in order to prove to third parties.”Furthermore, Steve Christie, the head of compliance at Kraken, provided Cointelegraph with comprehensive answers regarding their policy on the hypothecation of customer deposits:“Currently, Kraken Cryptocurrency Exchange does not hypothecate customer assets. However, we do look into ways for customers to achieve yield on their assets and continually explore options in this area. For this, transparency is our top priority. We always work with our clients to provide information on how their assets are to be used.”Talking about whether Kraken would support an industry-wide regulation that would control reserve requirements and hypothecation, Christie said:“We don’t typically advocate for industry-wide regulations. Instead we believe open and transparent markets, which allow for the development of innovative products and services. For example, DeFi is a rapidly evolving industry segment that needs space to innovate and ‘experiment,’ so premature regulations on this area could derail development of a potentially industry-altering solution.”Bithumb’s terms of service do not offer much in determining its policy toward user deposits.Cointelegraph has not received a response from Bithumb.The terms of use for Binance.US don’t specify how the exchange handles user deposits. However, it mentions that it charges a 20% commission on staking.Interestingly, the platform acknowledges that a counterparty to a trade could be a market maker affiliated or related corporations of BAM, while most exchanges state that they are never a party to a trade. Binance.US hasn’t responded to an inquiry from Cointelegraph on the matter.Although BigONE’s user agreement doesn’t mention the treatment of customer deposits, the “About” page clearly states that the exchange safeguards all the deposits:“BigONE keeps users' assets in reserves, and will not deploy the assets by no means. The mechanism provided by BigONE allows users to track the status of the assets at any time.”In addition, Cointelegraph received a response from Randolf Zhao, the vice president of operations at BigONE Exchange. Zhao confirmed that the exchange doesn’t practice hypothecation: “At BigONE, we do not hypothecate customer deposit funds under any circumstances.”On the issue of industry-wide regulation, Zhao noted that regulation is “a double-edged sword.” Although it can be useful, the cost of implementation eventually will be transferred to the users.Zhao believes that self-regulation is the optimal approach. Furthermore, he pointed out that if regulation were beneficial for the growth and development of crypto exchanges, one would expect to see United States-based exchanges dominating, which is not the case:“If we take a look at where the biggest and most successful crypto exchanges are registered these days, you have to wonder why American crypto exchanges are not as dominant as its Internet sector.”The terms of use of the London-based exchange CEX.IO do not elucidate the points of the inquiry; however, Alona Dobshynska, the chief product officer at CEX.IO, provided a reply upon request from Cointelegraph.Dobshynska segregates hypothecation into three categories — first, lending and investing of customer deposits; then, staking of customer stake-able coins; and finally, “participating with customer’s coins in governance.” Responding to the first subcategory of hypothecation, she draws comparisons to the traditional financial institutions like banks and concludes by stating:“A crypto exchange is no different from a financial institution. Using the deposits for certain lending / investing activities is in line with maintaining the velocity of digital assets in the market. But the rules about how these funds can be deployed also apply. It means not all, but only low risk and high liquidity, opportunities qualify. For regulated exchanges, such as CEX.IO, and especially in the U.S., the rules for lending/investing are quite shaped, and the perimeter of what’s permissible is clear.”Dobshynska explained that the exchange has introduced staking for its clients that preserves their sovereignty: “The holders remain in full control of their coins — they can pull them out of CEX.IO or trade them any moment.”Dobrynska believes that governance is the most ambiguous area. In traditional finance, brokers are allowed to exercise a vote on the behalf of their customers on a narrow array of issues, but “they have to obtain an instruction from a shareholder on how to vote” on the issue of substance, and she generally agrees with this rule. Noting the latest Steemit controversy, Dobshynska observed:“If we look broadly at some of our colleagues, in light of the recent STEEM situation, absent explicit regulation in our industry, those exchanges made the decisions based on what kind of actors they wanted to be. For clients it is a matter of figuring out whether such a decision aligns with their values or not.”It is understandable that a young, rapidly developing industry that doesn’t yet have universal standards and that various exchanges may choose to take divergent approaches to the way user deposits should be handled. Yet, a user arguably has the right to know how an exchange treats their deposits. And the argument that stands is that decentralization doesn’t work without transparency, just like taxation doesn’t work without representation.With most of the issues discussed here, analogies with the traditional world can be outlined — and governance is no exception. There is no denying that the Steemit affair was botched by some of the leading exchanges in the industry. Many in the community, including Vitalik Buterin, reacted very harshly to what they perceived as a hostile takeover of a decentralized project by centralized exchanges. Perhaps this latest fiasco will be a turning point for the industry on the issue of delegated proof-of-stake governance just like the DAO fork was for the immutability of the proof-of-work blockchain."

Until now, the mysterious mastermind behind the network was known only known as “Berzeck”.","Nerve Network is tackling the same issue as Cosmos (Atom) and Polkadot — a lack of cross-chain interoperability. This is something that Vitalik Buterin has recently lamented about:“We should put resources toward a proper (trustless, serverless, maximally Uniswap-like UX) ETH <-> BTC decentralized exchange. It's embarrassing that we still can't easily move between the two largest crypto ecosystems trustlessly.”Nerve Network has two layers of super-nodes. The first layer consists of 35 nodes and is similar to EOS. On top of that, there is a second layer of 15 so-called “Bank nodes”. These manage various crypto assets that may be deployed on the network. Reaper Ran, NULS founder, believes that Nerve Network is ready to take on competition:“Over the past year, NULS developers have made 4,324 GitHub commits, the fifth most of any blockchain project. Internationally, we see greater enthusiasm as we approach cross-chain functionality, and with our modular functionality, we are on pace to outperform all other incumbents.”In the case of Bitcoin (BTC), Bank nodes will have multi-signature addresses to which users will be sending their funds. If a Bank node misbehaves, it receives a “yellow card”, which denotes its negative activity. Persistent bad behavior warrants the issuance of a “red card”, further increasing the node’s negative status on the network.In addition to providing cross-chain interoperability, developers will be able to use NULS-inherent smart contracts with the Bitcoin network. Similar to the Lightning Network, Nerve Network will make Bitcoin microtransactions possible by lowering costs.Speaking with Cointelegraph, Berzeck explained that his motivation for not disclosing his identity was rather prosaic:“I am a very practical man, in Bolivia, the old government [under Evo Morales] was very much against crypto, so I was afraid. But, now the new government [under Jeanine Añez] is much more friendly. So, I don’t mind publicizing my name if it helps the project gain credibility.”Berzeck’s real name is Mario Blacutt.The lack of interoperability amongst various blockchain networks needs to be addressed if this technology is to gain mass adoption."

The motion pushed for a digital dollar in tandem with a digital wallet, facilitating payments for folks deemed to have financial need. Composed of two parts, the stimulus saw drafts from Financial Services Committee Chairwoman, Maxine Waters, and Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, a Forbes contributor article detailed. Vays states the only difference from the current system is that citizens will receive money straight from the Federal Reserve, rather than private banks. “We already have a digital dollar,” Vays explained. “Ninety-nine percent of all dollars are digital,” he added, referencing the current economic system, which often does not deal in physical cash anymore. Vays also said the digital wallet is nothing new, pointing to mainstream options such as PayPal as a type of digital wallet. “When you see the term ‘a digital wallet’ — that does not have anything to do with Bitcoin or cryptography,” he said. Backing Vays’ point, neither draft mentions the word blockchain directly. Although the stimulus did not mean new technology advancements, it did include additional involvement from the Federal Reserve. “Your money can be held at the Federal Reserve,” Vays said, as opposed to holding funds at banks such as Wells Fargo or Bank of America.“This is Congress’ attempt to nationalize the banking system,” Vays said, explaining that the concepts mentioned look like an attempt toward removing private banking. “This more reminds me of communist Russia, back when I grew up in communist Russia,” Vays noted, mentioning the Bank of Russia as the only banking option back then. “There was no private banking, right, there was just the Federal Reserve Bank of Russia,” he added. “That’s who held your money.”Vays posited this as a negative movement, although he did tally it as a long-term positive for Bitcoin as an asset uncontrolled by governments or borders."

Dr. Paul is an outspoken critic of U.S. fiscal policy, tax policy, and the Federal Reserve as well as a notable supporter of cryptocurrency.Following in his father’s footsteps, Senator Paul has recently voiced his opposition to the proposed coronavirus bailout bill:“Did you know that the bipartisan coronavirus bailout bill will provide nearly everybody in my family with a check?

Here’s how the co-founder contextualizes the recent market downturnBhargava believes that crypto is not a safe haven asset, despite others saying the opposite:“BTC and crypto is currently a risk-on asset, more similar to tech and VC than gold, so with oil prices and the general stock market tanking, the latter more due to coronavirus and the global slowdown associated with it, it's not surprising that there are multiple sellers of crypto right now.”Campbell Harvey, a professor of international business at Duke recently shared a similar opinion with Cointelegraph:“Now, if these cryptos were safe havens, then you would expect maybe no change in their value or maybe even an increase in value. But that's definitely not what we've seen. The cryptos got battered and dropped by more than 10%. So that suggests to me, in a particular situation of great stress where people are realizing that there's systemic risk unfolding, the stock market drops as expected, people flee to safe assets, but they didn't flee to cryptos, they fled to the U.S. 10-year bond.”Bhargava suggests that bitcoin has the potential to become a “counter-cyclical” asset, but “that's just not where it is yet in terms of its evolution, primarily because larger asset managers and macro traders don't trade/own BTC yet, and so you don't see it independent from equity market movements like you do for gold.”Another reason for this massive liquidation could be due to “folks getting margin called on other non-crypto assets.”Some analysts believe that the current downturn is caused by something more trivial: PlusToken scammers liquidating their loot.We have been reminded again that crypto markets don’t exist in isolation from the rest of the world."

After mixers, the funds saw consolidation, and then finally distribution. OXT’s report said:“Approximately 80% of coins entering mixing have been distributed while up to 33,872 BTC remain in the mixer and 3,853 BTC are in the distribution process, resulting in a total of 37,725 BTC that have entered mixing, but not yet been distributed.”Around $1.3 billion worth has been sold off in the past seven months with the report noting that distribution increases into market strength and “pauses” with market weakness. OXT found that nearly 70% of the total hoard has been distributed to date meaning that “most of PlusToken's market effects have largely passed.”A large amount of coins ended up on OKEx. “OKEx is a newly labeled and significant coin destination having received nearly 50% of February distributions,” the report stated, adding that Huobi also remains one of the most significant coin destinations. ErgoBTC, an analyst closely following developments, pointed to an important aspect of the report — the usage of regulated exchanges for offloading BTC profits, as opposed to over-the-counter (OTC) selling. ErgoBTC tweeted:“Regulated KYC'd exchanges have been the main destination of these coins throughout the post-shutdown period. Despite the ‘right narratives’ constructed by vested business interests, ‘OTC’ has not been the preferred destination of these coins.”Governing bodies across the globe have pushed KYC and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements for years, expressing the laws as a method of fraud prevention. OKEx requires KYC to withdraw funds from the platform and so does Huobi.For many months crypto markets have experienced the effects of the unravelling of one of the largest alleged scams in the industry’s history. The operation reportedly began in 2018, ammassing 10 million participants by 2019. Authorities apprehended several of the scheme’s operators in June 2019, although it is uncertain how many involved parties still remain at large. Some headlines note a potential correlation between Bitcoin’s 2019 downtrend — which started around the same time as the PlusToken arrests — and apparent PlusToken dumping. Data from several days ago shows a significant amount of funds were moved from wallets thought to be associated with PlusToken. ErgoBTC noted that roughly 13,000 Bitcoin were transferred to a coin mixer, according to a March 6 tweet. Less than 24 hours later, Bitcoin’s price fell from $9,200 down to $8,850. Bitcoin’s price continued further descent, down to a press time price of $7,930.  However other experts see more of a correlation to declining mainstream markets, explaining that investors are flocking to more stable assets."

to their attackers. There is another way in which crypto and ...",1 month ago,"Cryptocurrency and ransomware have had a long history together. They are so closely intertwined, in fact, that many have blamed the rise of cryptocurrency for a parallel rise in ransomware attacks.","Ransomware attacks are certainly increasing — they rose by 118% in 2018 — but it’s not clear that this is due to cryptocurrency. While the vast majority of ransoms are paid in crypto, the transparent nature of these currencies actually means that they are a pretty bad place to hide stolen funds.In this article, we’ll take a look at the relationship between cryptocurrency and ransomware, as well as what the future holds.There are at least two ways in which cryptocurrency is important for ransomware attacks. The first one is the most obvious — the majority of the ransoms paid during these kinds of attacks are generally in cryptocurrency. This was the case, for instance, in the WannaCry ransomware attacks, still the largest attack of its kind in history. Victims of the attack were instructed to send roughly $300 of Bitcoin (BTC) to their attackers.There is another way in which crypto and ransomware are intertwined, though. Today, plenty of hackers are offering “ransomware as a service,” essentially letting anyone hire a hacker from online marketplaces. If you are so inclined, you can even buy ransomware off-the-shelf from these marketplaces. Both of these “services” can be paid for in — you’ve guessed it — cryptocurrency.Cryptocurrency is also implicated in many other forms of cyberattack. Cryptojacking — a form of attack that uses victim’s computers to mine cryptocurrencies — is also on the rise, and new forms of malware such as Adylkuzz can be used by almost anyone with even a slight level of technical knowledge. Though these forms of attack are not technically ransomware, they further suggest the deep relationship between cryptocurrency and cybercrime.At first glance, it seems obvious that ransomware hackers would demand payment in cryptocurrency. Surely these currencies, based on anonymity and encryption, offer the best place to store stolen funds?Well, not really. There is actually a different reason why ransomware attacks make use of cryptocurrencies. As Coin Center director of research Peter Van Valkenburgh wrote in 2017, it is the efficiency of cryptocurrency networks, rather than their secrecy, that attracts hackers. As he later put it:“It’s electronic cash, so it’s easy to write software that can automatically demand payment and automatically demand that payment has been made.”The value of cryptocurrency during a ransomware attack is actually the transparency of cryptocurrency exchanges. A hacker can simply watch the public blockchain to see if victims have paid up, and can automate the process of giving a victim their files back once this payment has been received.This point also suggests a slightly curious aspect of the role of crypto in ransomware attacks: Cryptocurrency is, perhaps, the worst place to store ransom money. The open, transparent, nature of Bitcoin blockchain transactions means that the global community is closely watching the ransom money. That makes it extremely difficult to convert these funds into another currency, and means that they can be tracked by law enforcement.As the director of research at Coin Center, Peter Van Valkenburgh, stated:“In the U.S., every major bitcoin exchange is regulated by FINCEN. Right now the $50,000 extorted from victims is just sitting on the bitcoin network. ... That [exchange into local currency] is where you’re vulnerable to being identified.”The fact that stolen funds can be tracked in this way doesn’t necessarily mean that the hackers who stole them can be brought to justice, of course. The anonymity of cryptocurrency means that it is often impossible for law enforcement agencies to uncover the true identity of ransomware hackers, though of course there are exceptions. Chief among these, according to Coin Center, is that the “blockchain allows one to trace all transactions involving a given bitcoin address, all the way back to the first transaction. That gives law enforcement the records it needs to ‘follow the money’ in a way that would never be possible with cash.”Because of that, and also in response to a number of recent high-profile ransomware attacks, some have called for cryptocurrency to be regulated more closely. Regulation will need to be implemented carefully, however, because one of the major attractions of cryptocurrency — for ordinary citizens and hackers alike — is the fact that it is anonymous.This means that attempts to regulate the space may make catching criminals even more difficult. As pointed out by Will Ellis, head of research at community advocacy group Privacy Australia, cryptocurrency bans led to a rise in VPN use, as investors seek to circumvent Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering requirements in their home countries.In addition, most governments simply don’t have the understanding or the resources to regulate the crypto space effectively. Some are so far behind that they aren’t even certain how to define what cryptocurrencies are. In this context, it is difficult to see how the close link between ransomware and cryptocurrency can ever be broken.Related: From the UK to Malaysia: How Countries Have Been Classifying Crypto Across the WorldThe lack of governmental oversight of cryptocurrency, combined with the rapid rise in ransomware attacks, means that individuals need to protect themselves.Some companies and individuals have taken unusual approaches. Companies have stockpiled Bitcoin not as an investment, but rather in case they need to pay a ransom as part of a future attack. Some enterprising individuals have even taken matters into their own hands, such as the German programmer who “hacked back” following a cyberattack using his own systems.For most of us, though, protecting against ransomware attacks means doing the basics correctly. You should ensure that all of your systems are up to date, subscribe to a secure cloud storage provider and backup frequently. Companies of all sizes should partner with a managed security services provider to monitor enterprise networks, perform risk assessments and make recommendations specific to their data environment.Ultimately, the relationship between cryptocurrency and ransomware is unlikely to be broken anytime soon. And while cryptocurrencies are certainly involved in the majority of ransomware attacks, we should not make the mistake of blaming crime on the currency it is conducted in.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Sam Bocetta is a freelance journalist specializing in U.S. diplomacy and national security, with an emphasis on technology trends in cyber warfare, cyber defense and cryptography.

Cities” in the world, placing Colombia's capital city Bogotá in seventh ...",1 month ago,"The growing popularity of cryptocurrencies in Colombia has been widely discussed, as there is no unanimous consensus over the key reasons that are driving this momentum.","The fact is that there are several studies, such as the one carried out by Statista, that reflect a significant and relevant interest on the part of the Colombian user, highlighting it as the third country with the largest number of crypto users.According to the Statista Global Consumer Survey published in 2019, in which an online poll was conducted among 1,000 people for each country studied, showed that Latin America is the region with the highest number of crypto users in the world. Another survey conducted in 2019 by the peer-to-peer crypto exchange Paxful, in association with the consumer-insights firm Toluma Insights, claimed that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) adoption was in an uptrend within the Colombian population.The report claims that 87% of respondents knew about the existence of cryptocurrencies, of which 80% showed willingness to invest in crypto. That is not surprising, considering that Paxful processed more than $1 million from Colombian users in 2019.Furthermore, in 2018, Forbes published a list of the “Top 10 of Bitcoin Cities” in the world, placing Colombia’s capital city Bogotá in seventh place due to its 87 crypto-related businesses at the time.There are mixed opinions about what makes Colombia into one of the countries with the highest crypto adoption in the world.In a dialogue with Cointelegraph, Jarek Duque, chief analyst for the Latin America region at UAE-based financial academy Tradepedia LLC, says that inflation cannot be one of the reasons for this crypto popularity boost, as the country has had one of the most stable inflation rates within the region, which currently stands at 3.72% annually.That’s not the case for Argentina, claims Duque, which has unstable and higher inflation, and this explains why it’s the third country with the highest crypto adoption in the world, according to Statista.To explain why there is a crypto boom in Colombia, Duque quotes a DEA report published in 2019 stating that cryptocurrencies are being used for money laundering by Mexican and Colombian cartels. Duque commented on the following regarding the investing culture toward cryptocurrencies in Colombia:“Overall, financial education in our country is low, considering that in the United States around 70% of the adult population has some idea of the financial markets, while in Colombia only 1% have some knowledge about it. The latter would imply that Colombians in general don’t manage enough technical knowledge to understand an asset as complex as cryptocurrencies and reach the point of considering them as a safe haven.”There were attempts to regulate the crypto environment in Colombia, although they were seemingly unsuccessful. For example, on April 4, 2019, a draft with the specifications to regulate the Crypto Exchange Platforms was published. The objective of this law was to define in general terms how companies offering crypto exchange services in Colombia should operate.However, although there is no clear position from the Colombian financial watchdogs, Banco de la República — Columbia’s central bank of Colombia — published an article in 2018 that recognized the existence of crypto assets. The central bank weighed in on whether to consider cryptocurrencies as real money:“Although these assets are presented with the capacity to fulfill functions of means of payment, deposit of value and unit of account, in practice, as stated by several publications of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), they lack the attributes of the legal tender and are not likely to be considered as money.”Alvaro Saavedra, a Colombia-based lawyer, believes that there are contradictions in how the national government views cryptocurrencies, which has made regulating such assets even more difficult. But Saavedra says there is a critical reason that explains the government's unwillingness to establish a regulatory framework, beyond a clear lack of knowledge about cryptocurrencies:""Banco de la República's position towards cryptocurrencies is very valid because the way in which Colombian society is arranged implies material limits to give cryptocurrencies a certain validity from the legal point of view. For example, the existence of an armed conflict and a high number of drug trafficking groups implies that the State is afraid of regulating cryptocurrencies and if they do, they believe that the door would be left open for the creation of illegal economies and thus boosting money laundering.""Cointelegraph reached out to Banco de la República and Ministry of Information Technologies and Communications for further clarification, but has received no response as of press time.Alejandro Beltrán, country manager of Buda — one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in Latin America — spoke with Cointelegraph about the regulatory legal framework in the country. In his opinion: “It is highly restrictive and is doing huge damage to the Colombian people. First, the Financial Superintendence has virtually banned banks from offering services to cryptocurrency companies, which has eliminated many of the good actors who wanted to operate transparently. This has produced that most of the volume traded goes to the black market or more informal instances that often expose people with less experience.” Beltrán also pointed out that the “rigidity” of regulatory issues in Colombia hasn’t been established, while a proper environment for the development of the industry in the country has. But this fact has not prevented crypto sphere companies from continuing to be interested in the Colombian market. Beltrán believes that Colombia is a favorable country for crypto business, adding: “Colombia has three characteristics that convinced us that it was the best country where we should try to position ourselves. [...] Banking is relatively low and existing banking services are very primitive. For example, an interbank transfer between people takes an average of 48 hours to reach the destination account and costs about USD $2 per transfer, compared to Chile, which is free and instant.” Buda’s Colombia country manager also believes that a high flow of Venezuelan immigrants in the country also helps to boost crypto transaction volumes in Colombia, translated into a flow of remittances.It is worth noting that Colombia has received more than 1.2 million Venezuelans, according to Migración Colombia, the state agency responsible for regulating the flow of entry and exit of people in the country. On the regulatory framework in Colombia, Beltran believes that it’s highly complex and restrictive, making the work difficult for exchanges or other crypto-related firms that would like to do business within the territory.The Colombian tax entity DIAN considers Bitcoin and digital currencies as material goods, and the Financial Superintendence sees them as an intangible asset subject to income tax, while the Superintendence of Commerce says that they are not a value.Despite the different concepts that local watchdogs have, the general consensus toward cryptocurrencies in the Latin American country is not far different from the European model.Javier Pastor, chief sales officer of the Spain-based Bit2me exchange, which has Colombian users on its platform, spoke to Cointelegraph about the similarity of Colombia’s legal concept toward cryptocurrencies with Spain: “In the eyes of the Spanish Hacienda [the tax watchdog], cryptocurrencies are assets, not money, as the Euro and the dollar are. It is being considered as just ‘exchange.’”As for how they have been able to penetrate the Latin American market and the problems they have faced, Pastor states that they had no problem with the legal aspect. However, he went on to clarify: “If it is true that [Latin American] banks have limitations and restrictions to send money to crypto exchanges; the same situation that happens with Spain. [...] We see that there is a problem at a general level, not only in Latin America or in Colombia, regarding the transactions that can be made towards companies like ours, because Bitcoin, for example, represents an alternative monetary and financial system that would remove from the environment to traditional systems.”On the other hand, Buda’s Colombia country head proposed a legal framework that clears all the ambiguity that surrounds it. As Beltran states, in Colombia’s case, “everything is ready” so that there can be an appropriate environment where cryptocurrency companies can operate without uncertainty in the market.Although all statistics could point to the idea that the Colombian public knows about the world of cryptocurrencies, Javier Pastor highlights that there is great need to educate the public and state entities about cryptocurrencies:“The perception I have, not only in Colombia, they don’t know what this new technology is about. What this technology represents for countries is an opportunity to generate wealth and new jobs, in addition to generating a new investment movement.”"

Uploaded on YouTube on March 19, the video description promotes a nonexistent airdrop of 50 million XRP tokens and has amassed over 85,000 views as of press time.While the video itself is not fake and is a real interview that Garlinghouse gave in February 2020, the scam lies in the video description.

Source: YouTubeSpecifically, the video description presents users with a bogus airdrop contest taking place from March 20 till March 25, according to the video description. The YouTube scammer asks users to send between 2,000 XRP to 500,000 XRP in order to “participate” in exchange for immediate airdrop of 20,000 to 5 million XRP. For example, the fraudster promises to send 2.5 million XRP back in exchange for sending 250,000 XRP ($40,000) to his/her crypto address. As of press time, the address has 5,135 XRP ($800).A co-founder of crypto podcast SPQR Media, who first reported on the YouTube scam on his Twitter account on March 23, emphasized in a recent tweet that the scam channel is still up and running and is receiving funding for promotion on YouTube. Twitter user @Andy_SPQR told Cointelegraph that he noticed the scam page last night as an ad popped up on his YouTube feed.The SPQR co-founder highlighted that he immediately tweeted to report on the apparent scam as the YouTube account had a “huge number of subs but only one video,” while the description promised a free XRP airdrop scam. According to the executive, the reason for the scam is that YouTube allows users to purchase channels from each other. He said:“In my opinion I think what’s happening is these scammers are purchasing YouTube channels with large numbers of subscribers and then deleting all content and uploading that video. I think that’s how they are able to maintain a presence on YouTube.”The news comes on the heels of YouTube continuing its apparent war against crypto content makers on the platform. As Cointelegraph reported on March 10, YouTube deleted another batch of crypto-related videos from two separate crypto channels. In late 2019, YouTube was also aggressively deleting crypto content from some of the biggest players in the industry. As reported by Cointelegraph, YouTube subsequently admitted that some of its deletions were a mistake, while a lot of crypto YouTubers expressed intention to move to blockchain-based video hosting platforms to share their content."

The result of that is that we've seen central banks that are directly engaging with it without going through the proper process of testing the technology in a proof of concept, selecting vendors through an open bidding process, and having a request for proposals.""Despite an array of distributed systems available to central banks, Davidovic claims that none have demonstrated robust privacy and interoperability. The IMF official added that central banks face magnified risks in implementing these technologies — as they typically outsource development to third party companies.""It's about the weakest link. You can have a secure system, but if the people who're operating the system click on a phishing email or allow a security breach, your most robust system is not going to help with security.""Robleh Ali, a research scientist at the MIT Digital Currency Initiative and a former Bank of England official, predicts that central bank digital currencies will ultimately take on many different “hybrid” forms.""You'll likely end up with a hybrid in the end. I don't think every central bank would choose the same system. How they interact with each other will be key, so you can sort them into a single system.""Bob Bench, the director of applied fintech research for the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, asserted that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin cannot scale to meet the needs of central banks.""BTC is very interesting because it's mostly just transactional values. But if you're trying to build a retail central bank currency – like China, for example, there's 40 trillion in volume last year generated through WeChat alone – you need something that over and over and over again, can move value and do it quickly without breaking.""Despite acknowledging that DLT “might work,” the federal reserve official urged central banks to consider the risks of “putting their full faith and trust of their government’s currency” into DLT.Bench added that Alipay and WeChat have come to comprise the world's digital central bank reserves following the People’s Bank of China’s move to fund both platforms directly since June 2019."

A sizable amount of trades also took place with other methods based on the Unified Payments Interface system.Related: Supreme Court Post-Game: It’s a ‘Historic Day’ for Crypto in IndiaThe high use of digital currency, despite the lack of support from the government and national banking, shows that the people of India appreciate the benefits of cryptocurrency and desire additional resources that will bring them financial freedom. Now that the ban has been lifted, we can assume that, with the right support from the government and proper safeguards in place for the country’s 1.3 billion people, India holds the potential to become a crypto superpower.So, where does the potential to lead the peer-to-peer revolution come from, and why India?India has a population of over 1 billion people and already leads in traditional peer-to-peer lending that connects investors or lenders looking for high returns to creditworthy borrowers looking for short-term personal loans. The Indian population is quite familiar with operations that involve relying on your peers to drive financial inclusion and financial freedom. The inclusion provided by cryptocurrency will allow them to take that to the next level. Not to mention, the adoption of blockchain across India’s service sectors, such as banking, financial services, retail, supply chain and insurance industries, has the potential to add an extra $5 billion to the Indian economy.Related: A Call for Sensible Regulation: The Fate of Future Innovation in IndiaWith an evolving information technology sector and a service sector that is a key growth driver, India has no shortage of labor to enhance the technological advancements that go hand in hand with cryptocurrency and blockchain.

database language. We just want to store information in a decentralized ...",1 month ago,"First, there were property rents. Then came interests. As modern civilization evolves, people always find new ways to earn money without actually producing, or even doing all that much. This concept is today known as “passive income.” Technological progress also expanded the meaning of passive income.","Today, people can claim YouTube advertisement revenues, dropshipping and even creating online courses as their favorite way to earn passive income. Lennix Lai, the director of financial markets at OKEx, believes there is another method to add to this ever-expansive list: crypto staking. He was a keynote speaker during the Blockchain Economy 2020 conference in Turkey, where he explained why crypto is an ideal way to earn passive income. He also told Cointelegraph what would be the benefits of a more matured blockchain-based financial system.Cointelegraph: What do you believe is the next logical step for blockchain and crypto?Lennix Lai: The rising number of cryptocurrency wallet users creates an entirely new ecosystem. First, there are going to be regulators and central banks. People enter this new ecosystem by storing their digital asset wallets on their mobile phone or their computer first.Then the ecosystem will start to build decentralized applications, DeFi projects or stablecoins. Right now, we have about 35 million cryptocurrency users. But after central bank-issued stablecoins, we will talk about billions of users.We are stepping into the next generation. The next generation is happening right now with national bank-issued stablecoins, I believe. I would say it will grow the cryptocurrency user base like 10 times or more.CT: It looks like the next generation of blockchain is ""blockchain for everyone,"" not just companies or exchanges?LL: Bitcoin is the first use case leveraging the blockchain concept. Without Bitcoin, blockchain is simply a decentralized database. It's just a database language. We just want to store information in a decentralized manner. But adding the element of cryptography to this decentralized database has resulted in the creation of Bitcoin. [...] But still, it was a very ""geeky"" project, really concentrated on heavy believers and visionaries.For the next generation of blockchain, we need to maintain the beauty of blockchain first, immutable, scalable, open to everyone, super low entry-level in terms of transaction costs, super high efficiency. Then, we need to tackle the technical difficulties of blockchain in terms of security, scalability and decentralization.At the same time, we need to take governments and regulators into consideration as well. They should have a superior monitoring authority that can see the transactions within the blockchain. That's why we expect governments and regulators to be a part of this decentralized ecosystem we're building with OKChain.CT: How do you utilize crypto for a passive income concept?LL: The combination of cryptocurrency and DeFi creates an alternative way for users to earn passive interest that was not possible before. Because traditionally, you may need to deposit to the bank or reserve a depository for saving interest. You can buy bonds, and you can lend to somebody with some interest. But that's a limited way, and it involves many evaluation criteria. Sometimes, it's challenging to secure a loan, especially for small and medium enterprises.Crypto, first of all, introduces a permissionless way for passive interest. Everyone can securely borrow and lend within the protocol according to the design of a smart contract. You can have borrowing and lending without the bank sitting in between.This substantially drives down the barrier of entry, especially the unbanked population of the world, who doesn't have access to the traditional banking system. Right now, we have around at least one-fifth or one-sixth of the global population without any banking support. They can't open a bank account at all for various reasons.But right now, we are talking about a protocol that can serve even rural populations around the globe, without a bank. That is very exciting because we can now create a vision that says your mobile phone will be your bank. Without any bank accounts. You can do anything that usually a bank enables you to do via your mobile phone with a cryptocurrency wallet. You can pay, receive money, earn interest and make an investment — all executed in a decentralized manner.CT: Do you think passive income by staking crypto will be a popular way to earn in the future?LL: Staking is a unique passive income profile that could never be available in the traditional banking market. There's no staking product in banking and finance. Because what staking does is, basically: You deposit your token in a certain protocol. That token will then help to secure the stability of the whole network.By staking, you become part of shareholders/validators/protectors of the network. You are a part of the network itself.The interest rate return right now is much higher than traditional banking. So, it could be a very hot topic. Because one of the great benefits of adopting crypto is, aside from simple transfer and protecting assets, to earn passive interest.CT: Do you have any other plans for making crypto available to a much bigger audience?LL: We have to make crypto simple first. Right now, all the tech you hear like blockchain, smart contracts or private keys are still super complicated. Most of the blockchain industry consists of high-end developers. And traders' world needs very complex derivatives which we provide at OKEx.But when you talk about mass audiences, we have to make it very simple. We don't talk about private keys or any other tricky concept. We aim to launch a new product that any ordinary user can sign up, buy a cryptocurrency with their local currency, and earn passive interest by staking coins.CT: The more blockchain-based finance evolves, the more it resembles the traditional finance industry we all love to hate. How will the ""blockchain economy"" differentiate itself from the current centralized finance system?LL: That's a great question. Can we put everything on the blockchain that's in the centralized system right now? I don't think so. First, the centralized system right now is working quite well. It is slow sometimes, it might not be very efficient. But the size is so big, with volumes of trillions of dollars. It's a robust financial system right now.Also, because of the increased regulations, the traditional market is getting a lot more efficient than before. A lot of regulation that we talk about is related to checking, to disclosure. For example, the bank needs to disclose their balance sheets, and the security firm needs to disclose the access of the client, the fund manager needs to disclose the buy and sell orders, and so on.If you think about the blockchain concept, you don't need a regulator to play this role because everything can be executed on a technological basis. It's immutable. It's transparent. Everyone can see it, along with regulators. Each move and transaction is logged on-chain. In summary, we can serve the exact same regulatory purpose with a fraction of the costs that the regulators are spending right now.So, with blockchain technology, the cost of maintaining a healthy financial system would be much smaller while serving the same goal and purpose. That's why I believe the traditional finance world will eventually adopt blockchain technology to reduce costs and increase efficiency, especially in terms of regulatory processes and cross-border transactions.The interview has been shortened and edited for clarity."

With its growing influence on individual consumers and large economies alike, the internet has become a crucial part of our day-to-day lives. Moreover, acceptance of the World Wide Web is growing faster than ever with the rise of mobile technology. Many studies reveal to us an exciting revelation: The development of the web is driving acceptance of cryptocurrency.","The speed of internet adoption is growing fast. According to estimates compiled by Statista, mobile data traffic worldwide is on pace to surpass 77 exabytes per month by 2022, up from 11.5 exabytes per month in 2017.However, truly revolutionary opportunities are quite often missed. For example, the pioneering video-content company RealNetworks was the first to create a video-streaming service, doing so before YouTube was introduced in 2005. But it emerged before the market was ready. as the hardware power of 20 years ago did not allow for mass adoption. Back then, global media found this sort of innovation laughable, while nowadays we see clearly that many YouTube channels greatly outpace television networks in terms of audience numbers. Streaming wasn’t adopted much because the internet was not ready for such innovations back then, but the customers were. This is precisely where the crypto industry is today: There is high demand and the market is trying to keep up.The very same is happening right now with the advent of blockchain and cryptocurrency. This field is greatly underappreciated. According to data from Statista, the number of blockchain wallets has been growing since Bitcoin (BTC) was created in 2009, reaching over 42 million users by the end of September 2019. This represents major progress, especially considering that it took place within a three-year timeline. In the third quarter of 2016, this number was fewer than 9 million.Other recent data suggests that global blockchain-technology revenues will experience significant growth in the coming years, with the market expected to climb to over $23.3 billion by 2023. The financial sector has been one of the quickest to invest in blockchain, with over 60% of the technology’s market value concentrated in this field.According to recent research from Deutsche Bank, acceptance of the internet and of blockchain go almost hand in hand.The report from Deutsche Bank includes a graph that shows the starting points, middle points and projected forthcoming adoptions of both technologies. It clearly shows that both had a rough start during their initial years. However, after less than a decade in existence, internet adoption stood at around 500 million users. During the same timeframe, blockchain was used by approximately 50 million people. This ratio of 10 to 1 is clearly visible throughout the whole chart.Judging from the Deutsche Bank data, both indicators are set to quadruple in 10 years, with blockchain reaching 2,000 users and the internet reaching 200 million users.Estimates may vary, but we can say that as internet technology further progresses during the next decade, the distributed-ledger-technology industry will follow along. Perhaps not in leaps and bounds, but with steady, robust step-by-step increases.There are particular challenges on the path toward global adoption: legal, technical and regulatory. However, I see 2020 as the year when blockchain technology will finally encounter real trouble in the world of finance and technology, allowing for new commercialization cases to be built upon this basis. There are so many opportunities that can significantly boost crypto adoption to millions — if not billions — of people. The blockchain disruption of acquiring, remittance and corporate settlement will be the very driver that will provide a new, large-scale wave of crypto adoption.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Gregory Klumov is a stablecoin expert whose insights and opinions appear regularly in numerous international publications.

The proposed sandbox is reportedly part of a broader agenda by authorities in Zimbabwe to revamp the nation’s financial sector, which has seen massive hyperinflation since 2007.","Meanwhile, Zimbabwe’s government is also partnering with Apollo Fintech to develop a gold-backed cryptocurrency for the country. The collaboration is expected to allow Zimbabweans to have access to the Apollo wallet for digital-currency payments.Despite the government’s 2018 crypto ban, peer-to-peer trading of cryptocurrencies continues to thrive in Zimbabwe, as the country’s faltering monetary policies seemingly push investors toward digital currencies. In mid-2019, cryptomania in Zimbabwe reached such a fever pitch that false rumors about the price of Bitcoin (BTC) reaching a 600% premium began to spread.The RBZ’s plan to create a regulatory testing environment for local crypto companies also comes at a time when the government is reportedly exploring plans for a central bank digital currency.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the RBZ has reportedly proposed a regulatory sandbox for local crypto businesses. Cointelegraph has since confirmed that Josephat Mutepfa, the RBZ’s deputy director for financial markets and national payment systems, revealed the plan in a speech delivered at the Sound Prosperity Economic Forum in Bulawayo on March 13. An excerpt from Mutepfa’s address reads:“We have already started to come up with a fintech framework because in regulation everything should be well-structured. The framework, which is a regulatory sandbox, will be assessing cryptocurrency companies as to how they are going to operate. The sandbox will be an experimenting zone. Once the sandbox is there, there will be an application criterion, which will also act in the same capacity as the sandbox.”According to Mutepfa, Zimbabwe’s central bank is keen on creating a robust vetting framework to ensure that participating crypto businesses model their operations to suit existing financial regulations in the country. As part of its initial plans for the crypto-regulatory sandbox, the RBZ is reportedly focusing on companies dealing in cryptocurrency-related trading and remittance.For Mutepfa, the proposed sandbox signals a pivot by the RBZ and the Zimbabwean government regarding its stance on the emerging digital economy, following a 2018 ban on financial institutions participating in crypto transactions.Related: Countries That First Outlawed Crypto but Then Embraced ItGiven the popularity of digital assets among the country’s younger demographic, Mutepfa opined that it was incumbent on the RBZ and the country’s government to work out methods for regulating the industry rather than focusing on prohibition. By ensuring greater government involvement in the digital sphere, he argued that issues such as access to capital can be mitigated, thus allowing small- and medium-scale cryptocurrency businesses to blossom in Zimbabwe.Commenting on the RBZ’s plans to create the regulatory sandbox, Marius Reitz, the general manager of Africa for the Luno crypto-exchange platform, hailed the decision as a positive one for Zimbabwe’s digital-currency space. In an email to Cointelegraph, Reitz declared:“The new sandbox is excellent news. It will be critical for bringing more clarity and protection, which will only help crypto’s transition into mainstream use. Some people believe that regulation will stifle adoption but we believe it can play a major role in boosting trust in our sector, which we know is a huge barrier for adoption.”According to Reitz, the creation of the regulatory sandbox will open the way for constructive dialogue among crypto businesses and regulators, stating, “It’s important that there’s a strong relationship between these two stakeholders so crypto firms know what regulation to expect and how they can best protect their customers.”According to Mthabisi Tshuma, a business correspondent at the Zimbabwean daily The Chronicle, the government appears keen on legitimizing the crypto industry as part of its drive to improve the country’s financial sector. In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Tshuma remarked:“The cryptocurrency market in the country is under review and if all goes well the government will adopt it into the financial sector as stated in last year’s monetary policy.”In its monetary policy statement from February, the RBZ revealed that its focus was on stabilizing its currency. Having suffered massive hyperinflation since 2007, the bank appears intent on eradicating the volatility of its exchange rate through the establishment of a currency-stabilization task force. According to the RBZ, exchange-rate stabilization will result in a corresponding decrease in inflation, thus leading to significant economic recovery for the country.As part of the currency-stabilization efforts being spearheaded by the country’s finance minister, the RBZ plans to set up a Reuters-based platform for electronic foreign exchanges that will allow free forex deals among participating banks. Authorized currency-exchange agents will also be allowed on the platform via authorized dealers. While there is no official word from the government, a crypto regulatory sandbox established by the RBZ could be a precursor to the legalization of cryptocurrencies in the country. For now, crypto remains largely unregulated in sub-Saharan Africa, where the two Southern African nations of Zimbabwe and South Africa appear to be on a trajectory toward cryptocurrency legalization. For Zimbabwe, the goal might be tied toward leveraging its digital economy as a means of alleviating economic issues, while for South Africa the emergence of clear-cut laws might help to combat the many instances of virtual-currency scams in the country.So far, however, there have been reports of commercial banks in South Africa closing accounts belonging to crypto exchanges, citing the absence of regulatory clarity for the country’s cryptocurrency industry. As reported by Cointelegraph in December 2019, the South African Reserve Bank is considering the introduction of new cryptocurrency regulations. These laws reportedly focus on rules that will prevent the use of digital currencies for money laundering and tax evasion.According to Reitz, the South African Reserve Bank is in consultation with industry stakeholders to craft a meaningful regulatory framework for South Africa’s crypto space. As part of his email to Cointelegraph, the general manager of Africa for Luno revealed:“The SA Reserve Bank has established a working group (including players from the industry) to craft a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency, so it could be explored in the future. With South Africa ranking as the third-highest country with Google searches for bitcoin, crypto is definitely a growing industry in South Africa and we’re sure the authorities are keeping a close eye on developments.”Zimbabwe’s government is also reportedly partnering with Apollo Fintech to launch a gold-backed digital currency for its citizens. On Friday, Apollo announced that it has signed a memorandum of agreement with CBZ Bank — one of the country’s largest commercial banks — to develop three national fintech projects. The proposed gold-backed digital currency is one of the three projects currently being developed by Apollo for CBZ with the backing of the Zimbabwean government. Given the less-than-stellar record of Zimbabwe’s government on matters relating to its national currency, crypto adoption might present a viable solution. However, asset-backed digital currencies have yet to show any evidence of success.Venezuela’s oil-backed Petro has so far failed to make any significant progress despite concerted efforts by the country’s government to enforce the adoption of the digital currency. Like Zimbabwe, Venezuela is also suffering from massive hyperinflation, a situation further worsened by economic sanctions imposed on President Nicolás Maduro’s administration by the United States government.Related: Venezuela President Maduro Is Not Pro-Crypto, He Just Likes PetroApollo Fintech CEO Stephen McCullah said he was excited to work with the Zimbabwean government. In a tweet published by the company on Thursday, Apollo identified Zimbabwe as a “priority country” for the live implementation of its suite of national crypto and financial solutions.If the other yet-to-be-announced projects include an interbank settlement network, then Zimbabwe will be joining the likes of Iran in utilizing fintech to revamp its ailing financial sector."

Throughout the year, Binance posted achievements such as hosting the first major initial exchange offering, launching its own blockchain, U.S. subsidiary, decentralized exchange, and derivatives platform.Many of its co-founders, notably the CEO Changpeng Zhao, have repeatedly stated that their vision for cryptocurrency has a much wider reach than just an exchange — their goal is to disrupt and revolutionize the entire financial system.The cryptocurrency card is the natural evolution of that vision. As Goodbody elaborated, the company plans to make the card available globally:“We’ll first introduce the beta version of the Binance Card in Malaysia this April, and we’ll add more regions throughout the rest of this year. We see this as a global product.”Binance is also constantly expanding its fiat bridge options, integrating multiple banking and debit card partners to let users purchase crypto as easily as possible anywhere around the globe.The exchange’s leadership in the Blockchain space carries a responsibility toward the community. Binance was recently embroiled in a scandal where its customers’ funds were used as a weapon in Steem’s governance battle."

Scott filed his motion to dismiss the case with the court last month.The government asserts, “It was entirely reasonable for the jury to conclude that the defendant knew that he was dealing with the proceeds of an unlawful activity.” “Legitimate investment funds whose transactions involve proceeds from lawful activities do not forge documents and create false records on a routine basis,” the memo asserts. The prosecution’s evidence included testimony from 17 witnesses including victims of the OneCoin scam, employees from U.S. banks allegedly deceived by Scott, government agents, and Konstantin Ignatov — a leading figure from the OneCoin scheme.Scott said the witnesses’ testimony was based on “innuendo and hearsay” and “was insufficient to support a conviction” on either charge, requesting that the court enter a judgment of acquittal on both counts.Scott was charged with conspiracy to commit bank fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering after being arrested in 2018.The indictment alleges that from September 2015 until 2018 Scott conspired to launder $400 million in proceeds for the OneCoin scheme after being introduced to its chief operator Ruja Ignatova — who disappeared in 2017.The scheme involved defrauding financial institutions located in numerous jurisdictions worldwide, with Scott setting up numerous accounts to move OneCoin’s proceeds under the guise of various investment funds."

The published data includes sensitive data on medical test volunteers such as id documents like passports, medical background and details of the tests. Emsisoft threat analyst Brett Callow said:“[The data] is on the clear web where it can be accessed by anybody with an internet connection. [...] The criminals almost certainly haven’t published all the data that was stolen. Their modus operandi is to first name the companies they’ve hit on their website and, if that doesn’t convince them to pay, to publish a small of the amount of their data — which is the stage this incident appears to be at — as so-called ‘proofs.’”Fortunately, ComputerWeekly reports that the Hammersmith Medicines Research was able to make the systems operational by the end of the day. Callow noted that “it would appear they were able to quickly restore their systems from backups.” He also said that the data previously published on the hacker’s website is no longer available:“Note that, since the ComputerWeekly report ran, the data stolen from HMR has been ‘temporarily removed’ from the criminals’ website. [...] But here’s the problem. Other criminals download the data posted on these leak sites and use it for their own purposes.”Callow told Cointelegraph that he does not know how high the ransom demanded was. Still, he pointed out that the group has previously asked for about $1 million in Bitcoin for restoring access to the data and another $1 million in BTC to delete their copy and stop publishing it.As Cointelegraph reported in early February, Maze also compromised five United States law firms and demanded two 100 Bitcoin ransoms in exchange for restoring data and deleting their copy. Callow said that ransomware groups nearly always request to be paid in Bitcoin:“99% of ransom demands are in Bitcoin and, to date, it has been the Maze group’s currency of choice.”In previous incidents, Maze also published stolen data on Russian cybercrime forums recommending to “Use this information in any nefarious ways that you want.” Callow also criticized “a not inconsiderable number of publications” that recently reported about how some ransomware groups — including Maze — stopped their attacks for the time of the pandemic. He said:“A not inconsiderable number of publications recently reported that some ransomware groups, including Maze, had declared an amnesty on attacks on medical organizations for the duration of the Covid-10 outbreak and I’ve since seen them described as ‘Robin Hood-esque.’ This clearly demonstrates that, to the surprise of absolutely nobody, criminals cannot be trusted and it is a mistake for them to be given a voice.”Callow said that the threat level is the same that it has always been, or possibly higher. He also insisted that “these groups should not be given a platform which enables them to downplay that fact.” This is in line with the recent Emsisoft report according to which ransomware attacks have a seasonal aspect and the number of attacks spikes during the spring and summer months."

As such, the county board is considering proposing it as permanent zoning, local news outlet The Missoulian reported on March 27.The board has not made changes to the rules, which means that miners will still need to exclusively use renewable energy, as well as ensure that all electronic waste generated will be handled by a relevant recycling firm.Authorities approved the extensions after a public hearing during a commissioners meeting, where only one citizen spoke out and compared crypto mining operations to the coronavirus outbreak, saying:""Just as coronavirus, it's a prolonged consequence where if we don't act immediately to lower our demand for electricity and introduce renewable electricity, our planet is going to be degraded tragically in the future. It is an emergency. It's just not one that we can perceive on an hour-to-hour basis like the virus.""The regulations, however, will not apply to crypto mining facilities existing before April 4, 2019.Some crypto industry players have already developed eco-friendly crypto mining solutions, with German Bitcoin (BTC) mining infrastructure firm Northern Bitcoin AG completing tests for its new air-cooled mining container last year. The firm operates mining hardware that uses renewable energy sources and aims to attain optimal efficiency and sustainability.In January, researchers at Ireland’s Economic and Social Research Institute proposed that using a blockchain-based “forward trading system” can provide a more effective incentive for the smart management of renewable energy consumption.

The Bank of China has completed development of the basic functions of the official digital currency and is now drafting laws that will help its implementation. The Global Times also mentioned a number of Shenzhen-based private companies including Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei and China Merchants Bank have participated in the development of the digital currency. Cao Yan, managing director of Digital Renaissance Foundation, told the news agency that these private companies were selected based on their rich blockchain and third-party payments experiences.  Alibaba’s Alipay and Tencent’s WeChat Pay together have more than 1.7 billion active accounts across China — 300 million more than the country’s population. They have blended social media, e-commerce and payments to create an advanced online commercial infrastructure. Alipay reportedly publicized five patents related to China's official digital currency between January 21 to March 17. The patents cover several areas of digital currency, including issuance, transaction recording, digital wallets, anonymous trading support and assistance in supervising and dealing with illegal accounts, industry media reported.Cao believes that accelerating the CBDC plan can help turn a crisis into an opportunity, as cryptocurrency is seen as the most convenient tool to translate a central bank's zero and negative interest rate policy into commercial banks. He added that: ""If there is a chance China is considering lowering its interest rate into negative territory as an final option and directing such policy to commercial loans and lending, a circulated digital currency rather than M0 will be able to achieve that.""Cointelegraph previously reported on China’s plan to implement the digital Yuan among countries involved in its Belt and Road initiative.

Partly driven by a massive boom in interest caused by Bitcoin’s stellar bull run in 2017, blockchain technology quickly became the new catchword in tech. A swathe of startups entered the fray during that period as entrepreneurs looked to cash in on the hype in the space.","Bigger companies that weren’t looking into the benefits of the technology faced the risk of being left behind and began to carefully explore solutions to their own business mechanisms. Others had already begun exploring the potential benefits that blockchain could bring to various systems. That included some of the biggest names in the tech space, including IBM, Samsung, Google, Sony and Apple. American tech giant IBM has made waves in the space for filing a multitude of patents that use blockchain technology. The company has been a leader in adoption since 2014, putting it well ahead of most when it comes to developing and using blockchain-based solutions. One of IBM’s earliest forays into the technology was exploring the capabilities of blockchain technology to power the Internet of Things. The Address Energy in Parallel Technologies project, or ADEPT, was born in collaboration with Samsung, which allowed domestic appliances to autonomously interact with its environment. The project’s use case was proved by a Samsung washer autonomously ordering its own detergents and replacement parts. The ADEPT concept used Telehash for communication, BitTorrent powered its file sharing, and the Ethereum blockchain was used for functions that required more in-depth contract capabilities.The company’s most defining work came in 2015 with the launch of the IBM Blockchain. The platform is built on the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Fabric — which IBM contributed to developing alongside a host of other companies.The IBM Blockchain is an enterprise blockchain solution aimed at large scale businesses and corporations. The platform allows users to join existing blockchains or even create new platforms suited to their needs. The IBM website estimates that it has over 500 live, working blockchain projects. These projects cover a broad spectrum of industries, including trade finance, supply chains and identity services. Notable blockchain projects include supply chain management platform TradeLens, which was developed by shipping giants Maersk together with IBM. The system tracks real-time data of shipping transactions and progress in a permissioned network.Related: Walmart’s Foray Into Blockchain, How Is the Technology Used?IBM’s Food Trust Blockchain is another notable platform that has onboarded some major conglomerates over the past two years. The blockchain-based food tracking platform is being used by the likes of Nestle and Unilever, as well as America’s leading retailer, Walmart.Since its inception back in 1975, Microsoft has been a leader in the IT and technology spheres. It’s operating systems have made it famous, but the company has branched out to provide a wide range of technology goods and services. Blockchain technology has not gone unnoticed by the company either. Although like IBM, it has focused on the development of private enterprise solutions as opposed to open-source, decentralized blockchains.Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing service is the backbone of its move into the space and allows businesses to build and manage applications to improve a wide variety of internal and external services. A branch of the platform is the Azure Blockchain Service, which allows users to create their own consortium networks and applications using prebuilt networks and software. The Azure Blockchain Workbench allows developers to deploy a network, using existing infrastructure that is touted to reduce the amount of development time it would take to create an in-house solution. This includes automatic ledger deployment, network construction and pre-built blockchain commands.The platform has been employed by a number of companies around the world. American coffee company Starbucks deploys the Azure Blockchain platform to track coffee beans from its source farmers to its many stores around the world. Global aviation company GE Aviation also uses the Azure Blockchain service to record and track the details of aviation parts. The process has traditionally been done on paper, which is both time consuming and costly. The likes of Singapore Airlines, the Nasdaq, 3M and Xbox have used the Azure Blockchain platform for various offerings as well.South Korean tech giant Samsung has played an interesting role in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space for a number of reasons. Samsung is a major player in the electronics manufacturing industry in particular, and this has also spilled over into the cryptocurrency sector. The company is among the top producers of smartphones and semiconductors — two products that are actively used by crypto enthusiasts. Samsung’s processors became highly sought after during Bitcoin’s bull run in 2017, as users flocked to buy ASIC cryptocurrency miners. From the beginning of 2018, the company began designing and creating ASIC chips specifically designed for mining.Samsung also integrated cryptocurrency support into its smartphones in 2019 with the launch of the Blockchain Keystore application market. The major application launched was a password wallet for users' private keys. The functionality was rolled out with Samsung Galaxy S10 smartphones and is now supported on six of its devices, including the S10e, S10, S10+, S10 5G, Note10 and Note10+. A number of blockchain-based applications have been made available on the Blockchain Keystore since, and the Galaxy S10 smartphone now supports an even greater number of cryptocurrencies. Last but not least, Samsung SDS, the company’s IT arm, has also joined the fray in the enterprise blockchain space. The platform was launched in 2017 and competes with the likes of IBM and Microsoft’s enterprise blockchain solutions. The blockchain platform allows businesses to create and manage their own services for payments, supply chains, identity credentials and smart contracts.Japanese IT firm Sony is well known for its electronics, but it’s made some interesting moves utilizing blockchain technology. The company has taken a slightly different approach in its appraisal of the possibilities of the technology and has earmarked areas that would benefit the most — education, music rights and sampling.In 2017, Sony announced that it was exploring a pilot project with Fujitsu to record and manage educational subject matter, records and grades using the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Fabric. The platform allows educational institutions to virtually store and share academic learning records for individuals in a cryptographically secure, distributed blockchain network.This allows educational institutions or companies to have access to verified, tamper-proof educational records of the respective applicant or student. Conversely, it allows students and academics to have real-time access to their own academic records.Sony has also identified an interesting use for AI and blockchain technology in the music industry. According to their Soundmain description page, Sony began to make inroads in a particularly challenging space for artificial intelligence around 2013. In the field of sound and music production, differentiating different instruments and sounds in music is incredibly difficult for machines — it is a uniquely human capability.However, Sony’s developments in AI have led to some breakthroughs in audio separation technology. Its Soundmain platform enables users to separate different sounds into multiple channels from source audio that has already been mixed down to single or double channels.The software is intended to be used as a remixing and audio rights tool. Artists would be able to record a full set live and use the software to identify and mix the different instruments into individual sound channels afterward. Blockchain technology comes in to address issues around the rights to different music samples, enabling composers or individual musicians to be compensated if their samples are used by other production studios.Google and Apple are undisputed giants in the IT space, but both companies have kept blockchain technology and anything specifically related to cryptocurrencies at an arm’s length over the years. Both companies have copped criticism from the cryptocurrency community for their tough stance toward decentralized applications that are listed on the Google Play and Apple App stores. In response, the companies said that they act in the interest of safeguarding users from malware.The harsh stance has seen major exchanges like Coinbase have its cryptocurrency wallet DApp removed from the Apple Store over unresolved issues pertaining to developer guidelines. As recently as the beginning of March 2020, Google Play has even removed the applications of various cryptocurrency news platforms, including Cointelegraph’s app. Google had previously removed a plethora of cryptocurrency mining apps from the Play store.Nevertheless, Google has provided infrastructure assistance to cryptocurrency software firm Blockchain.com. The company uses Google’s Cloud service to handle its various databases for its Blockchain Wallet and Explorer services. The platform handles an enormous amount of data across various databases and has switched over to Google’s Cloud Spanner to streamline its processes.Meanwhile, Apple announced the development of the CryptoKit framework in 2019 that was initially met with much fanfare from the cryptocurrency community. As Cointelegraph reported at the time, the hype around the project was somewhat unjustified once the company gave some clarity into the project.The CryptoKit tool allows developers to carry out a variety of cryptographic operations. This includes the use of public-key cryptography to create and manage digital signatures. The software effectively allows developers to improve authentication and encryption services to improve security."

A perfect storm.”At the end of last year, Emsisoft released a report claiming that in 2019, at least 764 healthcare providers were impacted by ransomware. Now, the firm suggests that with the ongoing pandemic such attacks “could tip the balance and result in a significant loss of life.”Chart of ransomware cases reported per month. Source: EmsisoftSince the stakes are higher than usual, the firms will offer technical analysis of ransomware and decryption tool development for free. As a last resort, the free services also include ransom negotiation, transaction handling and post-ransom payment data recovery management with a custom decryption tool.Ransomware is a growing risk in an economy that is becoming ever-more dependent on technology for providing goods and services. In a recent meeting, the United States Senate examined new measures to enhance the homeland security cybersecurity measures, including addressing ransomware.Recently, a group of particularly opportunistic hackers started spreading ransomware by claiming that the software they are sending provides information on the spread of the coronavirus."

Youssef added:“Through working with Paxful, Chainalysis is evolving its policy and will evaluate P2P exchanges on a case-by-case basis before labeling them as risky, just as it does for other cryptocurrency exchanges.” Prior to working with Paxful, Chainalysis viewed P2P organizations as having questionable safety, due to their lack of required user data, a press statement said. “Paxful is setting a new standard for compliance at P2P exchanges,” Paxful CEO Ray Youssef told Cointelegraph. “Chainalysis is changing its policy based on the strides P2P exchanges like Paxful have made.”At its core, crypto’s pioneer asset Bitcoin came into the world as an anonymous digital asset. Over the past 11 or so years since the industry’s beginning, a movement has pushed forward, touting the importance of data privacy. Historically, many crypto users have gravitated toward P2P outfits, such as LocalBitcoins, as a way of trading value while controlling their own privacy and data. Such a partnership between Paxful and Chainalysis could thus seem antithetical to the crypto industry’s founding ethos of privacy and anonymity. “The Paxful marketplace is for the honest users,” Youssef said in response to questions on the matter, adding:“Like in other industries, there are bad actors who try to scam and steal money anonymously from the honest users. They are the ones who fail to provide appropriate verification and are left with only one option: to flee. KYC and KYT keep the honest users in the platform, and give them more confidence to trade.”Anonymity and privacy are part of a double-edged sword. Authorities express the desire to protect users from fraudulent players, while some honest traders also prefer to guard their personal data. The topic remains up for debate."

un-Bitcoined.” Trading support for the South African rand is expected to go 
live ...",1 month ago,Impressive use-cases of blockchain technology have come to the fore after the conclusion of the 2020 Blockchain Africa Conference in South Africa.,"The event went ahead as planned in early March despite the global coronavirus pandemic that has made headlines around the world. The viral outbreak led to keynote speaker Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, cancelling his trip to South Africa due to travel restrictions.The event also suffered a drop-off in attendance due to fears around the virus, but there were still over 230 delegates present on day one while day two numbers dropped slightly.Renowned cryptocurrency investor and analyst Tone Vays managed to fulfil his commitment to the conference with an insightful presentation on the value proposition of Bitcoin. His talk was praised by event organizers for bringing back a focus on cryptocurrencies,  which has become a neglected talking point at the African event in recent years.The majority of speakers at the conference weighed in on a wide variety of subjects within the blockchain ecosystem with specific focuses on trade finance, self-sovereign identity and regulation.One of the announcements made at the conference was Binance’s launch of a fiat gateway for South African users to make rand (ZAR) deposits on the global platform.Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao made the announcement in a pre-recorded message to the conference. The support would include initial trading pairs with Bitcoin (BTC), Binance Coin (BNB), Ether (ETH), Tether (USDT) and Binance USD (BUSD).The company currently has trading support in 35 African countries. Zhao believes the continent has massive potential for cryptocurrency adoption:“Africa illustrates one of the largest demands and instrumental use cases for cryptocurrency, notably for financial access. According to the World Bank, approximately 66% of Sub-Saharan Africans are listed as unbanked. So instead of trying to bank the unbanked, let’s try and Bitcoin the un-Bitcoined.”Trading support for the South African rand is expected to go live within the next few weeks. In addition to that announcement, the Binance Charity Foundation has also put forward a $1 million donation to support the growth and development of blockchain education in South Africa. The organization will be looking to partner with local companies in order to deliver effective educational programs to drive the development of the sector in South Africa. Binance South Africa country manager Tanya Knowles told Cointelegraph that the Foundation check that organizations that receive funding are making a tangible difference in the blockchain ecosystem: “We’ve got one or two NGOs that we are already having discussions with and the criteria is really the traceability of those contributions to beneficiaries to reach end users. We’re also trying to make sure that there is an educational element in that.”Trade finance and supply chains were another major talking point at the conference that already have working use-cases being powered by blockchain technology.Tech industry heavyweight Microsoft was represented at the event by its South African Data and AI specialist Thavash Govender. The company already has it’s own blockchain-enabled enterprise solution Azure and is working hand-in-hand with Ethereum among other projects.Govender believes that blockchain technology is specifically suitable for overhauling trade finance by improving traceability, transparency, auditability, efficiency and security of a wide variety of working parts, data and real life goods.At the same time, Govender said that blockchain technology should only be considered in certain scenarios. This would include instances where projects need to process trust boundaries where multiple parties are using the same data. This prevents intermediaries from controlling or tampering with the data and will address tedious manual verification processes.Nevertheless, Govender believes that Africa could become a leading force in integrating blockchain technology to improve trade finance and supply chains. He referenced the construction of cellphone towers in East Africa that allowed the development of the MPesa mobile payments systems in Kenya:“Africa became a leader in mobile payments and it's still something that the rest of the world struggles with. Will we see the same necessity in fostering innovation by blockchain? Absolutely.”Carlos Teixeira, global industry principal of Finastra, began his address at the conference by stating that “trade finance is deeply enabled by blockchain technology.”Teixeira highlighted the fact that the trade finance sector has a massive number of moving parts, making use of an example of a pilot project that tracked a shipment from Kenya to Belgium. The shipment involved over 30 completely independent institutions, from the buyer and sellers to customs officers, logistics partners and financiers:“Companies and banks are forming consortiums using new technology to overhaul current systems. We are looking at leveraging wider networks to give companies and banks information to make the right decisions.”The South African Reserve Bank — or SARB — also delivered a fairly positive update on its stance towards cryptocurrencies in the country. Anrich Daseman, senior fintech specialist at the Reserve Bank, told delegates that the institution had acknowledged that cryptocurrencies were “here to stay,” proven by the fact that a task force had been set up to develop regulatory frameworks for the sector.Daseman also confirmed that the SARB would be issuing a draft policy paper on the regulation of cryptocurrencies in the country that would be released for public input in March. The SARB has classified cryptocurrencies on how they are used and how they derive value. Daseman said that cryptocurrencies can be used as a method of payment, investment as well as other utilities, but the SARB does not recognize virtual currencies as legal tender.The Reserve Bank has taken a keen interest in the space due to a number of reasons. Firstly, the institution is tasked with regulating monetary policy and in theory, when demand for cryptocurrencies increases then the demand for fiat money will decrease.There is also the consideration of cryptocurrencies becoming a parallel payment system and the SARB needs to protect its national payment system. Financial stability is also a consideration, considering that crypto market capitalization growth could expose conventional financial systems to the inherent risks of cryptocurrencies volatility.Exchange control regulations also need to be considered in the cryptocurrency space in regard to the movement of capital. Market integrity is another area that is a focus, in an effort to create a fair and transparent space that also considers Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terror Financing concerns.Daseman said that there is still a perception that the very nature of cryptocurrencies works hand in hand with illicit activities:“Many feel that we shouldn’t have exchange controls for the space but the reality is that they are there in conventional markets for a reason and we need to look at it.”Members of branches of the South African government also made some positive statements about the potential of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to uplift South Africa and the wider continent.As Cointelegraph reported at the conclusion of the conference, Mpho Dagada, Commissioner on the Fourth Industrial Revolution for the South African Presidency, made a bold statement that touted blockchain technology’s potential to help reduce unemployment and bolster the country’s Gross Domestic Product.Related: South Africa Looks to Blockchain to Reduce UnemploymentDagada said that the technology could plug into existing artificial intelligence systems in the mining sector:“When we look at where the world is going, it’s important to leverage our strengths and align with that. If the world is moving towards more blockchain systems that are transparent and people want that, we know there is strength in Africa’s minerals and why not plug that in on top of the sector? We might find that we’ll solve the problems we have, like corruption or bringing access to markets. These problems could be solved by us bringing in these solutions and allowing them to plug and play.”South Africa’s Office of Digital Advantage is also pushing to invest and support blockchain-based projects according to Akhona Damane, who heads up the department.Damane highlighted the fact that the ICT sector in South Africa had already outgrown the country’s agricultural industry in terms of GDP. That has led to a drive to increase investment in the sector and explore new technologies like blockchain:“We reali`ed we can go into the blockchain space and drive development that goes a lot further than cryptocurrencies. While there are limited tech skills in the country, the local blockchain ecosystem is growing, driven by startups. The space now wants government involvement.”A major takeaway has been the formation of the South African National Blockchain Alliance, which will be officially launched next month. The working group will look to develop opportunities for the blockchain industry.Self-Sovereign Identity was a particularly important talking point at the conference that addresses a major problem across the continent.Victor Mapunda, founder and CEO of FlexFinTx, presented data that estimates that around 400 million Africans do not possess proper identification documents.As a result many Africans are unbanked and have little to no access to insurance services. Mapunda said that institutional problems are a main reason for the status quo. Slow processing services and a lack of information sharing between governments, financial and healthcare institutions has exacerbated the problem.On the bright side, Mapunda said that the situation has led to the development and proliferation of mobile money systems in Africa that do not need to meet Know Your Customer requirements.The investigation into potential solutions has led to blockchain technology representing a not yet seen ability to tackle these problems. Mapunda told Cointelegraph that African governments have a lot to benefit from having mass, nationwide identity solutions. He said that a primary problem for African governments are massive tax gaps. Mapunda used his native country of Zimbabwe as an example, highlighting massive unemployment rates which means most people exist within the informal economic sector:“Most of their earnings and business transactions go completely under the radar of the government and they lose billions of dollars as a result. By having a system or platform where everyone is participating in a semi-formalized system on a digital scale they’ll be able to know what’s going on in their own communities.”The uptake of these digitized solutions should benefit government, private companies and citizens alike according to Mapunda:“Digital identity platforms typically move people from that informal sector to a digital, formalized scale where both government and the private sector are able to start offering better products and services to those people.”There was an air of optimism at the 2020 Blockchain Africa conference driven by insightful presentations from various industry leaders.There seems to be a strong sentiment that blockchain technology could provide the backbone for new solutions to uniquely African problems. Furthermore, a number of speakers went as far as saying that the continent could become a driver of development and adoption in the future.The proliferation of mobile payment services was often referred to as a prime example of a space that Africa has completely adopted and dominated.Related: Blockchain Africa Forges Ahead Despite Coronavirus Concerns"

Android users can use debit cards, while Apple iOS device users can purchase using Apple Pay.Purchasing via the mobile browser — branded Opera for Android, or Opera Touch in the Apple App Store — has been open to residents of Sweden, Denmark and Norway for over a year, and an Opera spokesperson noted that the company intends to roll out seamless crypto top-ups in other countries “very soon”.Although Opera is a relatively small player in the United States, with a 0.48% market share according to Statcounter, it has a more significant 2.12% market share in Europe. According to Opera, it serves 320 million people with browser and AI content delivery solutions.The company also claims that its Apple Pay solution allows users to go “from zero to crypto in less than 30 seconds”.“In the past, obtaining cryptocurrencies was a cumbersome process that took hours or even days. When you compare it with this seamless solution, which takes less than 30 seconds, it really is a gamechanger,” said Charles Hamel, head of crypto at Opera.The NASDAQ-listed company explains that it intends to continue seeking ways to eliminate barriers to cryptocurrency adoption.Although Opera has been publicly available for 24 years in various guises, it is seeking to differentiate its offering from runaway market leaders Chrome, Safari and Firefox through the addition of Web 3.0 features such as the crypto wallet and a DApp explorer, as well as security and privacy tools.The crypto-enabled Brave browser has garnered significant usage since launching with a similar set of features, and passed 10 million monthly active users in December 2019."

Today, half of Binance’s employees are female — and in India, women make up the majority of crypto investors.","Does this mean that gender equality has come to the market? Or are cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology still a men’s business? On the eve of International Women's Day, female representatives of the blockchain industry told Cointelegraph what attracted them to the market and which difficulties they have faced.Until 2018, the cryptocurrency industry was almost absent of women — but male crypto enthusiasts created their brotherhood with private conferences and meetups. At one such conference held in Japan in 2018, only two of the 42 participants were women. And in the United States, one conference was held at a strip club.In general, the lack of women in the blockchain market — until 2018 — can be explained by the historical dominance of men in the tech, financial and scientific industries, whereas the number of women, although growing, is still far from being equal. In these areas, women compose 10%–30% of the total workforce.Related: Diversity and Inclusion Major Themes at Hyperledger Global Forum 2020For the same reason, women have been facing difficulties with finding jobs in blockchain startups for several years. The results of a study published by LongHash in 2018 show that among 100 blockchain startups, female employees accounted for just 14.5%, while the percentage of managers was a measly 7%. Even worse, there wasn’t a single female leader in 78 out of the 100 startups. Arijana Koskarova, a founder of the training center Creative Hub in North Macedonia and Kosovo, told Cointelegraph that this is due to the commitment it takes to be in the blockchain industry:“Women have other priorities in life, such as raising a family, so the majority often choose jobs that are easier to handle rather than insecure.”The risk associated with cryptocurrency investment and its association with crime are other reasons why less than 10% of women invested in cryptocurrency in 2018. Some believe that this is because digital money was initially used mainly for the purchase of weapons, illegal pornography or drugs. Many people still associate BTC with the Wild West, the darknet and crime.However, in the world of blockchain, there have been more and more women mastering new professions: investors, traders, analysts, developers, journalists and even heads of companies.Notably, few people know that there are now more women holding leadership positions in the blockchain and crypto industry than in Silicon Valley. Leading crypto companies such as Bancor and Binance are clear proof of this, with 40%–50% of employees being women — and perhaps the latter’s success is indeed partially due to this fact.Related: As the WEF Warms Up to Crypto, Its Head of Blockchain Talks EmpowermentThe list of female blockchain startup leaders turns out to be quite long. Here are just a few examples. The blockchain divisions of IBM and JPMorgan Chase are led by Marie Wieck and Amber Baldet respectively; Blythe Masters led blockchain firm Digital Asset Holdings and became a managing director at JPMorgan Chase when she was 28 years old; and Kaitlin Breitman co-founded Tezos, which raised $232 million in its initial coin offering.The growing interest of women toward cryptocurrency can be explained by the attractive investment opportunities of the market, as blockchain entrepreneur Nisa Amoils explained to Cointelegraph:“Women can get more income through trading, investing and virtual spending of Bitcoin. And the token economy can democratize access to capital through, for instance, security token offerings.”Many of today’s projects created by women are not only competitive with those created by men but also can outperform their peers. The implementation of the well-known Lighting Network protocol was made possible by its founder, Elizabeth Stark. Key decisions at Coinbase are made not only by Brian Armstrong but also by Katherine Hawn, a member of the company's board of directors. Also, Tony Lane Casserley co-founded Cointelegraph, and the chief operating officer of ConsenSys is Carolyn Reckhou.Coindance data confirms that the Wild West is slowly but surely acquiring a female face — the number of women in blockchain technology has grown from 8% to 12% in the past two years. This includes bad projects as well, as the infamous scam project OneCoin — which reportedly raised 4 billion euros — was founded by Ruzha Ignatova. Isn’t it also the Wild West in its female manifestation?It is also worth noting those who write about blockchain and cryptocurrencies: Some of these women have hundreds of thousands of subscribers, a strong Twitter following and are considered industry influencers. The number of female journalists and editors of crypto columns is growing — Laura Shin, Lily Katz, Kristina Lucrezia Corner, Rachel Wolfson — and these ladies are holding the keys of knowledge.Another honorable mention is Hope Liu. In 2018, she received $20 million in funding for her startup, Eximchain — a public and scalable blockchain that ensures privacy for businesses — after she was told by an unnamed, influential man that she would “never be able to make it,” as she is a woman.On Jan. 25, 2018, Alexia Bonatsos, a venture capitalist and Fobes “30 under 30” in the media category, tweeted the following message:“Women, consider crypto. Otherwise the men are going to get all the wealth, again.”More and more women are following her example, even those in developing countries, for whom blockchain is a great opportunity to gain financial independence. In Uganda, for instance, Tricia Martinez launched the Wala blockchain platform, which allows women to quickly and easily transfer small amounts of money. In another developing country, Afghanistan, Roya Mahboob and Fereshteh Forough launched Women’s Annex, offering women the opportunity to write blogs and earn cryptocurrency from advertising. Kristin Boggiano, a co-founder of the Digital Asset Regulatory and Legal Alliance (DARLA), believes that the technological revolution in the digital economy is excellent for women, adding:“It is bringing financial inclusion and economic empowerment to females globally, which is having a strong impact on reducing poverty, increasing education and overall household nutrition for families. Through compelling evidence from a number of sources, including the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation, it is clear that empowering women and improving gender economic equality leads to economic growth for the community.”Another woman in blockchain, Singapore-based Yuree Hong, managed to raise the number of female speakers at her conference, S/HE Blockchainers Asia, to 30%–40%. Hong explained that having female speakers encouraged other women to participate. Ksenia Semenova, development director at Cindicator, shared some advice with Cointelegraph:“Often, the question arises whether it is difficult to be a woman in the male world of business and technology. In my experience, being a woman in the crypto business is easier. [...] Your virtual investors are practically indifferent to who you are. They don’t communicate with you personally, they look at the totality of data: a team, an idea — your gender does not matter.”However, Manasi Vora believes that being a woman who works in a male-dominated environment, or being the only woman to speak at a conference, is not easy. This is a solvable problem, though, as she told Cointelegraph:“We need to celebrate and highlight the women that are already leading in this space, and that would be inspiring for others to join.”But what do men think? Have they started to take women seriously in the blockchain market? How are they accepted in the workplace? Binance, one of the leading crypto exchanges, has been leading by example, showing that women can not only successfully work in the crypto industry but also make vital decisions for the company. Thao Trang, a Binance representative who organizes events for female employees, believes that:“Maintaining gender equality leads to not only a balanced working environment for employees but also to diversity professional skills, creative thinking and problem-solving capabilities for businesses.”As such, the exchange doesn’t pay attention to gender or marital status during the hiring process. Helen Hai, the head of Binance’s charity foundation, used a Chinese saying when describing the company’s policy: “It doesn't matter whether the cat is black or white. For as long as it catches the mice, it is a good cat.”World-renowned women also contribute to gender equality in the blockchain industry, such as baroness Michelle Mone, who launched her own cryptocurrency to increase women's interest in investing in the technology. Another woman, Italian entrepreneur Katerina Ferrara, founded the Neuralia project aimed at achieving gender equality in the crypto industry. On the matter of inclusion, Manana Samuseva — founder of the Women in Crypto community — said:“I believe that it is necessary to implement a number of projects for more effective entry of women entrepreneurs into the sphere of blockchain and cryptocurrency. We held more than 40 meetings for women from the crypto community to teach them crypto trading and blockchain investments. As a result, in New York, the contact base grew to 7,000, and women from various financial companies — such as J.P. Morgan, GE, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup — became involved.”Other women believe that unless you do something yourself, no one else will do it for you. And if women will not be more actively involved in the crypto world, they again risk giving all the “laurels” to men. He Yi, co-founder and chief marketing officer of Binance, said:“Blockchain and crypto is an emerging industry, one at a very early stage. […] You have to jump in early enough. […] Never expect others to give preference to women.”Arijana Koskarova seems to agree with that last point, telling Cointelegraph:“I don't think women are naturally discriminated [against], but probably we also need to work harder and take [our] place in this industry.”A lack of knowledge of cryptocurrencies among women is also among the reasons why men prevail in the market. As such, payment company Circle believes that accessible educational resources will help increase the number of women in the blockchain market. Blockchain was supposed to bring equal opportunities to everyone around the world. At least that's what Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, intended to achieve. And while the hierarchy has not yet been built, there is a chance to build it in such a way that gives people more freedom to choose which position they want to take in the market — and it does not matter whether they’re men or women.Arwen Smit, founder of blockchain startups Dovu and MintBit, and author of the book “Identity Reboot,” believes that gender is not so important in order to participate in today’s blockchain industry and that Satoshi Nakamoto could be a woman. In an interview with Cointelegraph, she added that the contribution of both sexes is valuable:“If we believe that an information is absolutely essential to how society functions nowadays, what is essential is that the people building this technology, the people deploying this technology, and the people auditing this technology, the people putting balances on this new technology is a diverse group of people.”In the blockchain industry, it’s not too late to reduce the gender gap that has existed for many years in the financial and tech industries, according to Vora. She explained to Cointelegraph how exactly this can be accomplished:“We need to have conversations and initiatives to change this early on when the blockchain space is still evolving. Not 10 years down the line in retrospective.”"

However, the balance has now tipped in China’s favor. Data indicates that in 2019, the percentage of deals enacted by U.S. startups fell to 31%. During the same year, China’s market share grew to 22%, thus consolidating itself within the blockchain sphere.Speaking with Cointelegraph, Tomer Weiss, co-founder and head of partnerships at Upright, explained the following:“I think that China sees the potential of blockchain for enterprises to understand better, track and get an insight about the financial activity of individuals and business since the announcement of Xi [Jinping] about blockchain, there are a lot of investments.”Referencing blockchain, China’s president, Xi Jinping, called on the country to accelerate its adoption of such technology as a core for innovation during a speech on October 24, 2019. President Xi issued the following comments to the Politburo Committee session, which discussed blockchain technology trends:“We must take blockchain as an important breakthrough for independent innovation of core technologies, clarify the main directions, increase investment, focus on a number of key technologies, and accelerate the development of blockchain and industrial innovation.”Weiss clarifies that most of China’s blockchain-related investments are directed towards enterprise implementations and government infrastructure. Considerably less money is going towards developing customer-facing DeFi solutions.Weiss further clarified the following regarding crypto project investments:“Investors think that maybe it’s not the right timing to bet on DApps, wallet or DeFi - and regulation indeed is a major reason for that.”The CB Insights report also concludes that Bitcoin continues to behave like a risk-on asset and is therefore not yet a feasible store of value.However, despite the recent market sell-off, the research ensures that companies will continue to build and launch products which benefit the maturing blockchain ecosystem."

Testnet",https://cointelegraph.com/news/self-proclaimed-worlds-lightest-blockchain-rolls-out-phase-three-of-its-testnet,"The Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain has a current blockchain size of roughly 
260,900 MB — with nodes needing to download the entire chain in order ...",1 month ago,A new cryptocurrency ecosystem claiming to be “the world’s lightest blockchain” has ostensibly grown to become one of the largest layer 1 testnets by peer count in the industry.,"Speaking Cointelegraph on March 24, the developers behind Coda Protocol said that phase three of the network’s testnet launch has now drawn over 400 users — with 300 users signing up to stake, and 143 maximum concurrent users.When compared with data from block explorers for other testnets — as well as anecdotal information from professional validators — Coda claims this peer count already makes it competitive with established testnets such as Celo, Solana, Cosmos, and Cardano.The Coda Protocol, created by software development firm O(1) Labs, uses recursive zk-SNARKs, or zero-knowledge proofs, to improve scalability and operate as a “tiny, portable” blockchain that can be downloaded on smartphones and browsers, or integrated into decentralized applications.As reported, zk-SNARKs are a cryptographic primitive that can sever any tractable piece of data between two parties over a public medium, such as a blockchain. They are therefore commonly used to enhance digital privacy for transactions using cryptocurrencies, as with the anonymity-focused altcoin Zcash (ZEC). Yet beyond their privacy potential, they are also, as Coda’s developers emphasize, extremely lightweight, and therefore well suited to lighten the overall data size of a given blockchain.The Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain has a current blockchain size of roughly 260,900 MB — with nodes needing to download the entire chain in order to verify that it is correct and reach consensus. Such resource-intensivity, Coda’s developers argue, places increasingly high barriers to entry for participant nodes, compromising decentralization and potentially rendering the network more vulnerable to a 51% attack. In trying to tackle this problem, they write:“What we’ve done with Coda is replace that whole transaction history with a lightweight, zero-knowledge proof (recursive zk-SNARKs), which is only about a kilobyte, or the size of a few tweets, so you only need to look at that small proof to know that the current state of the blockchain is correct.”In this view, the lighter a blockchain, the larger and more inclusive the pool of eligible validating nodes can be.Alongside its testnet launch, Coda has rolled out a token program called “Genesis,” distributing 6.6% of all tokens to founding members to prepare them to become block producers on the network. The team has reportedly already received 1,300 applicants wanting to join Genesis and has onboarded 40 founding members to its first cohort.Among these members is Libra Association founding member and blockchain infrastructure provider Bison Trails, as well as Figment Networks — a validator on the decentralized Ethereum-compatible network Skale."

He argues that once the virus reaches the jail, “it will be nearly impossible to stop its spread,” adding that “the risk to Mr. Goettsche’s health and safety grows with each day that he remains incarcerated” at the facility.According to Weeks’ representation, the county jas has “an exceptionally poor record of maintaining detainee health.”He cited the findings of the United States Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General, who last year reported that the facility poses “significant threats to detainee health and safety.”The inspector general identified “leaks causing mold and mildew growth 'in every housing unit holding detainees,” and food safety issues including “'raw, spoiled, or expired' meat, 'raw chicken,' 'expired and moldy bread,' and 'hamburgers that were foul smelling and unrecognizable’.” Weeks’ lawyer argued:“Given the noted risks of illness through inadequate food service and environmental safety at the Essex County Correctional Facility, a swift outbreak of COVID-19 at the facility is virtually inevitable.”The lawyers also argued that a lock-down at the facility would make it impossible for the suspects to comply with discovery requests in their ongoing proceedings.Goettsche, Weeks, and two other defendants are accused of operating a $722 million Ponzi scheme from 2014 until December 2019 under the guise of running the cryptocurrency mining pool BitClub Network. The group allegedly solicited funds from investors in exchange for purported shares in their mining pools, also offering referral bonuses to those who recruited new members. The prosecution accused BitClub of distributing false and misleading documentation to investors that claimed to demonstrate profits generated by the mining pool.Goettsche and Weeks are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, while all four of the scheme’s operators face charges of conspiracy to sell unregistered securities."

Crypto traders can also take advantage of the measure to ease the strain from the market fall due to the coronavirus outbreak.,"According to a March 18 statement from the Department of the Treasury, individuals and non-corporate entities can defer their tax payments for three months without suffering any penalty or interest. Corporations are also exempt for up to $10 million of income tax payments.The tax returns will still need to be filed for their original deadline of April 15, but the payment can be delayed until July 15. As Bitcoin (BTC) fell from a price of more than $9,000 at the beginning of March to about $5,500 as of press time, the crypto market was hit even harder than traditional markets like stocks.Cointelegraph spoke with Robert W. Wood, managing partner at tax-focused law firm Wood LLP, to learn more about how the decision impacts crypto investors. Briefly explaining the new measure adopted by the U.S. government, he said:“With life safety concerns paramount, it can be easy to forget for a time about pedestrian issues like taxes. Today, the IRS main tax filing deadline remains April 15, but there is a 90 day reprieve on payments to the IRS — until July 15.”While the delay only concerns payments and not the tax return filing, Wood suggested a potential solution for it as well. He continued:“Unless the IRS says differently, you should go on automatic extension so your tax return is due October 15.”An automatic extension, if requested, allows taxpayers to delay the tax return filing for any reason — provided they offer an estimate of their tax liability and pay it within the usual terms. Delays would normally result in penalties and interest, but they are deferred due to COVID-19 measures.Wood emphasized that the measures do not free crypto traders from their reporting duties, saying:“Crypto investors should still gather records for 2019, and those who need to fix their past reporting should not forget about that either. When we all come out the other side of this, we should remember that the IRS still cares a lot about crypto taxes.”Crypto tax reporting requirements are considered to be a “nightmare” by many small businesses and users. There are currently no exemptions on the amount or type of transaction, which means that using Bitcoin to pay for coffee is a taxable event that must be reported. Crypto-to-crypto exchanges are also not considered “like-kind” transactions and are taxable.The agency held a summit on March 3 to discover how regulations can be reconciled with the need to let the sector grow. Specific measures are yet to be announced, however."

crowdfunding models replacing the initial public offering for funding ...",1 month ago,"In a world where blockchain technology is rapidly breaking barriers and disrupting industries one at a time, the emergence of new models to replace classical crowdfunding ventures is just a matter of time. More than a decade after Bitcoin’s introduction, we’ve witnessed new crowdfunding models replacing the initial public offering for funding blockchain-fueled projects — the initial coin offering, decentralized autonomous organization DAO, the security token offering and the initial exchange offering.","History indicates that if you have honey, the bees will follow. However, countless illicit schemes and scam projects have caused some misguided investments. So, why have there been so many attempts to establish an ideal crowdfunding approach for the maturing technology industry, yet still, none of the introduced models can change the standard venture success rate when it comes to investments?The traditional model of third-party investment to fund private business development is considered an outdated, time consuming and complicated process. The similarity between IPOs and ICOs is that these financial models are special cases of crowdfunding. Stock IPO is the most respectable form of crowdfunding so far, with the prospect of a financial return for its sponsors. However, the downside of this model is its high entry threshold for both the sponsors and, primarily, the organizing company. Sponsors must access the exchange through a broker, while the company undergoes a complicated listing procedure. The advent of blockchain technologies, new projects and markets, and as a result — the emergence of initial coin offerings worldwide — has become a significant turning point in how developers can find a way to fund their perspective idea or project, significantly lowering the entry threshold.The creation of an ICO itself is an attempt to apply exchange IPO rules in a more democratic and free environment of the cryptocurrency market. During an ICO procedure, the company does not place shares, but tokens instead, which are regarded the same as cryptocurrencies. Tokens are the new shares, but tied to a specific project and usually do not represent anything new technically.The higher democracy of the ICO procedure means it usually involves more independent and smaller players than the more traditional IPO. When it comes to investors, no one can compare with Vanguard Group, and among the issuers — for example, with Amazon. ICOs were used not by top companies with a well-known and established reputation, but by high-tech startups and teams with a promising idea and no danger of suffering reputational damage.Compared to 2016, the blockchain crowdfunding market was overheated with capital already, which has inevitably led to less potential benefit for possible ICO investors and almost collapsed the model a year later. ICOs were the red-hot trend, as 853 projects collected over $6.2 billion. This increased the following year, with 1253 ICOs raising $7.8 billion. However, this success was scuppered by dodgy projects and an increasing number of Ponzi schemes, making investors question whether ICOs were a genuine investment at all. Right there, the initial exchange offering stepped in. In total, token generation events during 2019 raised $3.2 billion, while ICOs raised ten times less during the same period.Companies like Coinbase and Circle raised money from venture capitalists. By the middle of 2019, VC funding in cryptocurrency startups accounted for $822 million. Moreover, a Gartner study suggests that blockchain is estimated to generate $3.1 trillion in new business value by 2030.Related: Venture Capital Financing in Crypto, Explained One of the well-known cases of a successful ICO is the creation of the Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency. In 2014, the company issued tokens, which rose radically in price some time later. In 2014, only $16 million was collected in total for various ICO projects, and by 2016, this figure increased to $90 million, while 2017 broke all records for market capitalization. Moreover, during the period from 2015 to 2017, funding increased from $6 million in 2015 to more than $6 billion. The overall venture capital market amounted to over $76 billion in the United States that year.Related: What is Ethereum. Guide for Beginners.So, can decent projects be distinguished from scams? Of course it is not easy, particularly since the number of fraudulent projects increased to a whopping 80% in 2017.The attractiveness of the ICO mechanism resulted in the global downside trend the year after the hype started and catastrophe for blockchain crowdfunding, slowing down global acceptance drastically. While it was suitable for raising funds and launching projects, a settlement mechanism for distributing dividends was absent.The strategy of reimbursement to ICO shareholders had two significant drawbacks: a change of shares ownership upon repurchasing the tokens, which does not exist in the classical system, where shares are separated from the dividends; and the liquidity of any ICO tokens is lower than the liquidity of fiat money from the very beginning, because the coins are derived from a particular project of the company, and the real money is a derivative of the economy — that is, all companies combined.In the latter case, the company has to pay a margin for the difference between the purchase and the sale of the ICO coin to conduct the repurchases. Due to the low liquidity of the ICO coin tied to a specific project, the margin cost will be high. Also, the liquidity of the ICO coin is lower than the liquidity of the universal coin tied to the economy or particular assets as a whole.The cryptocurrency environment has fundamental differences from the traditional economy, and it is hardly necessary for the state to deal with its regulations. Specific methods and solutions to bring the reliability of crypto investments closer to the standards of the classic stock market are required but with maximum democratic rules. They must and will be developed over time.The advent of IEOs in late 2018 to early 2019 has introduced another approach to regulation over the chaotic and already infamous market, shifting the power of a token sale from the hands of unknown amateurs and third parties to exchanges.Related: A New Trend in Crypto Funding Campaigns: Companies Resorting to IEOsIn fact, IEO fraud has become additional proof that many well-established crypto exchanges fake their trading volumes on a constant basis. Even the IEO model was intended to be a more trustworthy alternative to the more traditional ICO — an activity that became infamous due to global regulatory heat, exit scams and countless illicit actors. The concept of an exchange serving as the white knight that screens out the unworthy market participants and questionable projects had merit, though eventually compromised itself in less than a year. As IEO integrity can’t be trusted anymore, some cryptocurrency startup projects are already lamenting and showing the public how exchanges have defrauded them.Bitwise presented a white paper to the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission, which showed the results of studies performed on cryptocurrency exchanges. It was reported that only ten exchanges show their real volume, while other cryptocurrency exchanges fake their volume. This results in the truth that 95% of all Bitcoin trading volumes are faked. The most important reason was to gain visibility on data-aggregating platforms like Coinmarketcap and also to inflate their listing fees.Then again, why is the VC still at large in 2020? Venture funds have such things as venture capital power. They can capitalize on “liquidation preference,” which means gaining power on everything that an investment comes with. For example, when closing a particular project, a corporation can get its hands on everything that comes from the investment: equipment, merchandise and so on.Initial coin offerings don’t have a mechanism for legal regulations. So, 5% of paybacks were an optimistic number in this case when it comes to returns.Crypto projects will never be able to fight the gravity of venture success rates, especially without legal bounds. Without it and due diligence, 2% is a good number. So, we can tell that 40 out of 2000 established successful projects is not a very significant achievement, but rather a reality that comes along with mathematic calculations.95% of VCs aren’t actually returning enough money to justify the risk, fees and illiquidity that their investors are taking on by investing in their funds.To summarize, venture capital is a tough business. Investors struggle to get paid in excess returns for the risk, fees and illiquidity they take on for investing in venture capital. Entrepreneurs struggle to scale and grow their companies and position for great exits. It’s not natural for a founder at stage one to know how he’ll grow from zero to billion. So many things will change along the journey. VCs struggle to generate the returns they promise, and only a very few manage to deliver.But VCs enjoy the only downside protection in the business — they can rely on fees to pay themselves when their investments are mediocre. The long feedback cycle means that VCs can raise a few funds — and lock in a few fee streams — before their less-than-stellar returns catch up with them.ICOs, STOs, IEOs and the later initial DEX offering, or IDO… We have seen and learned a lot of new abbreviations during the last few years and there is no doubt that the show, and the model list, must and will go on.Security token offerings seem to be a new cure for the modern crypto investment market and its harsh conditions. In fact, they are now considered the next and logical evolutionary step. First of all, such models intend to issue digital assets in full compliance with securities legislation to provide a higher degree of protection for investor rights and lower regulatory risks for token issuers. In addition, STOs are guided by a different target audience — only professional (accredited) investors can participate in such a placement.Security tokens have many pros when compared to traditional financial products. Despite lacking intermediaries such as banks and other organizations, they provide a completely different environment for investing and concluding deals — more solvent and more responsible.Polymath, a security token protocol platform, estimates that security tokens will soon win the race with the now-dominant “utility tokens” like Bitcoin, and sees security tokens exploding to a value of $10 trillion by 2020.Despite the rising trend for the STO model, some market players will still continue to adhere to the principles of traditional ICOs and try to fund their creative project through the infamous model. In its essence, STO is closer to a classical IPO than an initial coin offering. With their strict rules, STOs are a product of a new time, invented to avoid an “illegal” approach to fundraising. Moreover, these rules create a real investment opportunity for institutional investors, which can lead to a plentiful flow of funds into the blockchain field.Speaking of the later model’s emergence, the forthcoming revelations may be different as market participants may envision and implement various models in the future, aimed to go toe-to-toe with strict regulations implied by the global and local watchdogs. We need a very precise and reliable system, in which tokens will ultimately fall into the capital structure. What this model may be, we’re about to see in the year to come.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Gregory Klumov is a stablecoin expert whose insights and opinions appear regularly in numerous international publications.

Furthermore, the assets of other blockchains can be swapped with Zilliqa-based tokens.A Zilliqa spokesperson said that any ERC-20 compliant token is supported by the DEX. The firms involved in the project plan to build a liquidity pool to facilitate trading.As the cryptocurrency space matures projects looking to decentralize their market infrastructure are gaining traction. One of the main advantages of a well-built DEX is the lack of a central point of failure.Switcheo CEO Ivan Poon pointed out the advantage of DEX platforms over their centralized counterparts:“Decentralized exchanges have been recognized for the absence of centralized governance which enables greater security and safety for users and their assets.”As Cointelegraph reported in December, developers of inter-chain architecture Komodo launched AtomicDEX, which runs a full peer-to-peer node in the web browser of its users. That same month, the Waves DEX upgraded to adopt a hybrid architecture that adds features typical of centralized trading platforms to the exchange."
