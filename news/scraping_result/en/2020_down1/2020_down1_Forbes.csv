If bitcoin were to fall below the key $1,000 level it would be the first time since bitcoin's epic 2017 bull run pushed cryptocurrencies into the international limelight.Others in the bitcoin and cryptocurrency community are more upbeat, however. ""Bitcoin should enjoy a nice run back through $10,000 towards $20,000 by year end,"" Arthur Hayes, the chief executive of Seychelles-based bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange BitMex, wrote in his regular market report published on Thursday morning, pointing to expectations central banks around the world will ""cut rates to zero"" and begin ""open-ended quantitative easing.""The U.S. Federal Reserve has announced it will pump $1.5 trillion into the economy along with a raft of other measures.However, bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets went into free fall yesterday after struggling for the last few days. Last weekend's sudden bitcoin sell-off, which caught many off-guard, was attributed to oil cartel Opec's failure to reach supply cut deal over the weekend, though others think bitcoin's crash began the day before for completely different reasons.

Some analysts have warned this market rebound could be what's known as a ""dead cat bounce"" and markets, possibly including bitcoin and crypto, could soon fall back again. ""We've had a massive asset bubble that is now crashing,"" said economic analyst Jesse Colombo via Twitter. ""Right now, most people are shell-shocked—they’re still in the denial phase. I believe we are primed for a powerful bull trap very soon [especially] with all these stimulus announcements. The market will probably bounce hard, which will suck in all the dumb money ...

(Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via ... [+] Getty Images)","Right now, the global economy is in total shock. The Washington Post reports, “Nearly every asset class—stocks, bonds, gold, oil—came under siege, with the Dow plunging more than 1,300 points.” On March 12, this sent the crypto markets tumbling into panic mode. During the panic, bitcoin was oversold. In just 24 hours, $93 billion was wiped from the crypto markets, resulting in a 48% plunge in bitcoins’ price which came quickly. Bitcoin bull, Tim Draper says, “It will be bitcoin, not banks and governments that save the day.” With the bitcoin halving event scheduled to take place in May, Draper believes that the price of bitcoin could reach an all-time high of $250,000 by 2022. With the bitcoin halving event around the corner, here’s what you could expect to happen.Extreme price volatilityDespite the recent downturn in bitcoin prices and the crypto market as a whole, Richard Ells, the CEO of Electroneum believes that the global economy hasn’t seen anything like what is happening right now since the Second World War. Ells says, “For the very short term, it would be foolish to expect anything but severe volatility in the crypto market. However, once the dust settles, I’m positive that we will see it flourishing again.” As of the time of writing, bitcoin has since had an impressive 80% rebound off its price low of $3,800 to $6,206.Ells further goes on to say, “The next bitcoin halving is right around the corner and crypto adoption has been rising all around the world in the past few months. For instance, our recently launched freelance platform AnyTask has recorded more than 51,000 signups only within a week.”Bitcoin resilience Dan Schatt, CEO of the crypto lending platform Cred believes that whilst the current global liquidity crisis has the potential to destroy some asset classes, in the short-term bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will prevail.“Bitcoin has proven to be very resilient. It is still up 33% from a year ago. Why? It continues to gain favor as a store of value that will not be diluted. A dollar in 1970 is worth $0.15 today due to inflation. 50 years from now, we will not see the same rate of inflation on bitcoin,” says Schatt.Schatt adds, “Bitcoin could have a massive run if more investment funds are permitted to invest in the form of ETFs or other financial vehicles. The floodgates will open when the regulatory environment becomes more clear for pension funds, insurance funds and endowments.” ""Especially here in Australia, the regulators will have a field day in this asset class with regards to ETFs. They [the regulators] are conservative, risk-averse. Volatility in bitcoin is one thing but also liquidity provisions required for ETFs are another"", says Camilla Love Managing Director, eInvest, an active ETF provider in Australia. ""It will be a while before a bitcoin ETF is quoted on the exchange in Australia.""Bulls to buy up bitcoin lowsJust over a week ago, the price of bitcoin dropped an unprecedented 50%, falling from $7,700 to $3,800 in 24 hours. However, that price-point didn’t last for long and is now up 80%. Jeffery Liu, CEO of the crypto processing company XanPool says, “It's been quite heavily argued that the recent bitcoin price plunge was primarily caused by the future markets.”""Despite recent bitcoin sell-offs, we're still very bullish on the bitcoin price. Through our XanPool platform, which has over 20,000 transacting users across South East Asia—we currently see customers heavily buying, and very few customers selling. This indicates that the recent price movement downwards was derivative market heavy."" This means that when institutional investors pull out of bitcoin, bulls step in, to it buy up. Liu further adds, “With the bitcoin halving event around the corner, there will be less than half of the usual supply of bitcoin being sold on the open markets. As a result, ""Assuming the demand stays relatively similar, the outcome of the event will trigger an increase in bitcoin price.""Bitcoin prices could be bolstered by closed economiesWith the global economy in turmoil, bitcoin prices are likely to be bolstered by closed economies. Tim Shaler, the Chief Economist at iTrustCapital believes, “Investment product prices are driven by investors' demand for future returns for that particular product, which is a function of the overall economy and the possible returns from other products.” “We believe digital currencies have many constituent markets. Ripple seems to be driven by investors who believe digital currencies will have some future role in the interbank lending market and/or in international bank transfers. Bitcoin demand seems to be bolstered when people in closed economies (I.e. China, Iran, Venezuela) purchase bitcoin to protect their wealth—when they feel that their domestic currency is likely to lose value,” says Shaler.Shaler adds, “As the threat of war between the US and Iran intensified in January 2020, bitcoin went from $7,000 to about $10,000. The run-up in 2017 may have been partially caused by China's growing effectiveness at capital controls. So, bitcoin seems to be a great purchase consideration for many well-diversified portfolios.”Bitcoin prices may not rise during the halvingBitcoin halving is an event that takes place every four years, which halves the rates at which new bitcoins are created. The next halving is scheduled to take place in May. From a historical standpoint, bitcoin prices have increased due to supply and demand. This leads to two situations:Bitcoin halving historyMany crypto traders are bullish on the upcoming May halving, however, not all are convinced. Nikolai Udianskyi, CEO of BTCU and co-founder of Coinsbit Exchange says, “Many people think that after halving, the price of bitcoin will increase. But they all do not take into account one fact —the previous 2 halvings raised a stir around bitcoin. During that time, the market was full of enthusiasts who were ready to invest money and take risks.” Udianskyi adds, “Now the situation has changed a lot. There is no longer a line of people who want to buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, almost all investors already have similar experience and made some conclusions for themselves whether they want to continue or not. Halving is not a key argument in the issue of bitcoin price growth.”"

When investors in the East Asian nation woke up several hours ago and began their day, they realized “the destruction that the global financial markets caused while it was their night time,” he stated. “The psychological stance as well as global virus pandemic are playing perfectly into one another to see cash as the only possible current safe haven,” said Iadeluca.

Last Saturday, ahead of the traditional market rout caused by Opec, PlusToken scammers moved a little over $100 million worth of bitcoin to so-called mixers, designed to disguise the origin and destination of the coins.

Bitcoin's latest fall comes as the U.S. Federal Reserve, working with the U.K., Japan, the eurozone, Canada, and Switzerland, tried to shore up financial markets with massive stimulus—but many feel the central banks haven't gone far enough and some have warned the bitcoin price could crash even further. Bitcoin prices had stabilized over the weekend but have now begun sliding again.

long- ...","Mar 16, 2020,10:35am EDT","TOKYO, JAPAN - JANUARY 25: An employee shows a Gold Bitcoin Ver 2.0 gold medal produced by ... [+] Sakamoto Metal at a workshop on January 25, 2018 in Tokyo, Japan. ","One of the unlikely outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic, oil price wars, and subsequent financial crisis has been the idea that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like it should perform similar to gold or other commodities: a “safe haven” that works somewhat counter to how equities perform. This has led to several comparisons between the two, with a less favorable light cast on Bitcoin, which is losing more short-term value. This comparison isn’t quite valid for a few reasons though. First off, Bitcoin’s value doesn’t reside in an established history of commercial usage due to its anti-corrosive or conductive properties or long-established cultural tradition of how shiny is better. It resides in both the future value of online transactions conducted through its networks, but also in a sense of belief that eventually, there will be a need to delegate financial trust and authority. It’s more of an ideological argument than a practical one. For economists trained to value assets, you can argue that Bitcoin has more “speculative” value, and a shorter track record than gold itself. However, this is what makes Bitcoin such an interesting technological and economic experiment: it has certainly proven the first plank of its thesis that individuals organizing and cohering together with a set of technologically implemented rules can create value without the stamp of a fiat authority. In contrast, gold has thousands of years of fiat stamping, from the kings and emperors of old, to the bankers of today. Secondly, as a result, the degree of institutional ties that Bitcoin holds is lower compared to gold, and this affects its volatility as well as how governments regard it. It means, for example, that in Canada (to give you an example that’s top of mind for the author), registered accounts that are used for tax savings cannot be used on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies without quite a bit of work. Meanwhile, gold exposure can be bought with ETF purchases or in other formats quite easily, and still garner government approval. This means that when push comes to shove, it’s likely to expect that dramatic investor losses in gold may be backed by the government and they might be compensated for their losses. In its current state, it would be foolhardy to expect the same of cryptocurrencies. This has more interesting implications than just adding volatility from a speculative perspective. It also, again, harkens back to the point of cryptocurrencies being a stronger counter-force and more weakly linked to markets than just gold. Gold is an investment in the same financial system, just a counter-cyclical one. Bitcoin is an investment, though not mostly financial, in alternatives to that same system. The latter fares worst from a risk management perspective if one is solely focused on a flight to safety, as the market seems to be these days. Thirdly, Bitcoin is, even in its earlier days, a more fluid medium of exchange vs. gold, which acts more as a static store of value. Bitcoin gives you access to different cryptocurrencies that are have very few or don’t have any fiat on-ramps. It’s also used in more e-commerce settings and cross-border payments. While central banks will transfer large amounts of gold as a store of value amongst each other, and some people do accept gold as tender, even in a short amount of time, Bitcoin has proven to be a more useful and viable medium of exchange with potential to grow as commerce shifts more online.Cryptocurrency companies also tend to do income-sharing in cryptocurrency — say what you will about the bubble-like potential of that, but it does align incentives and it’s not something you often see with gold mines and their employees. Because new cryptocurrency initiatives do not have to be as well-capitalized as mines (even if ICOs might try to make you think otherwise), the potential of new innovation is higher among ecosystems that can draw in talented thinkers and creators.This leads to the final point of difference: while gold is mined and discovered using a fairly conventional financing model, innovations in cryptocurrency are supported by teams that raise funding, yes, but also by a strong open-source community deeply dedicated to the principles of Bitcoin. It’s true that Bitcoin on the face of it seems to have some commonalities with gold, especially from a speculator’s lens. Both are positioned as “counter-cycle” to equities and as “safe havens”. When you scratch the surface, however, you find that those shallow commonalities mask deep, fundamental differences — which should nuance any comparison."

The digital currency dropped to as little as $7,625.19 this morning, CoinDesk figures show. At this point, it had lost more than 17% of its value since surpassing $9,200 on Sunday, additional CoinDesk figures reveal. Further, it was trading at its lowest in more than two months. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]Bitcoin Decline’s Many Causes“The BTC plunge quite clearly has a variety of causes,” said Tim Enneking, managing director of Digital Capital Management.“The background cause was a healthy run-up to $10.5k in mid-February and an equally healthy pullback that had just about run its course,” he stated. “Near what would have normally been the end of that pullback, the PlusToken news hit, weakening markets that hadn’t quite yet begun to again show strength,” said Enneking.He was referring to reports that scammers associated with PlusToken, a Ponzi scheme that drew significant funds from investors, were possibly unloading their cryptocurrency holdings, placing downward pressure on bitcoin prices. PlusToken, which promised returns between 10% and 30% per month, attracted approximately $3 billion from unwitting investors, according to Bitcoin Magazine. On Saturday, individuals in control of PlusToken’s wallets transferred 13,000 units of bitcoin to so-called mixers, a move that many analysts interpreted as the scammers selling their cryptocurrency, CoinDesk reported. Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, spoke to these developmens, emphasizing that “concerns surrounding sale of BTC from PlusToken did cause initial panic and the global sell-off also impacted market sentiment.” However, he also highlighted technical factors, stating that “the price falling below the 150-day moving average was a major setback, opening up lower supports at $8,000 and $7,800.” Kiana Danial, CEO of Invest Diva, also weighed in, leveraging the Ichimoku Cloud, which consists of several technical indicators. “BTC has dropped below the daily Ichimoku cloud, a bearish indication that could take the price to at least $7,331,” he stated. Analysts also highlighted the concerns surrounding the coronavirus, with Enneking stating that the news surrounding this health epidemic caused “the proverbial bottom” to fall out of the digital currency markets. Safe-Haven ImplicationsSeveral market observers expressed concern that bitcoin has fallen in tandem with more traditional assets lately, emphasizing that this development undermines the case that the world’s most prominent digital currency is a safe haven. “The aspect of this drop which is far more concerning than the drop itself is the sudden, very high and direct correlation with fiat assets,” said Enneking. “This lowers the attraction of the crypto space as both an alternative to highly correlated fiat markets, and also damages the argument that crypto (and BTC specifically) is a ‘haven’ investment asset like gold,” he stated. “To me, Bitcoin should be acting like gold and a safe-haven during a crisis as repeatedly its price has been inversely correlated to the stock market,” said Danial. “So the fact that both the crypto market and the stock market are dropping at the same time, shows that many investors may not yet accept Bitcoin as gold 2.0 as broadly during the Coronavirus outbreak,” she stated.

Bitcoin and crypto exchanges saw their daily inflows increase by 250% during the second week of March compared to their 2020 average, according to Chainalysis research. From March 9 to March 16, exchanges around the world received 1.1 million bitcoin per day, 712,000 bitcoin more than average with trading activity increasing as bitcoin flowing into exchanges was sold. Chainalysis found that bitcoin trading was driven primarily by new bitcoin entering exchanges, rather than bitcoin already held on exchanges.""The majority of excess bitcoin arriving at exchanges has been sold, and the worst of the oversupply appears to be finished for now,"" Gradwell wrote, adding that due to the ""uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s hard to predict where the bitcoin market will go next.""""We also expect that professional traders will continue to drive events, as opposed to retail exchange users, simply because they are responsible for much larger volumes,"" Gradwell wrote.Bitcoin exchange inflows rose dramatically during the second week of March, just ahead of the ...

Bitcoin exchange deposits have previously increased along with the bitcoin price, with deposits falling back during bear markets, however, average bitcoin exchange deposits dropped sharply over the last six months even as the bitcoin price rose—suggesting the last bitcoin rally wasn't driven by retail investors."

traditional ...","Coronavirus|Mar 19, 2020,08:38pm EDT","As bitcoin's price appears to be correlating with traditional markets, it's undergoing an identity ... [+] crisis that could kill it, or see it evolve.","Bitcoin is no longer the magic internet money that it’s long been branded. There are no dark forces causing it to behave the opposite of traditional markets. There is no algorithm that forces it to zig when the rest of the world zags. In large-part, there are just a lot of freaks and weirdos, disenfranchised idealists, citizens of countries with untrustworthy central banks, doing things that traditional investors think are crazy.From the outside, all these seemingly irrational early bitcoin owners doing unorthodox things with an asset that doesn’t rely on any central bank or securities depository, gave the appearance that bitcoin wasn’t correlated to traditional markets, or even safe-havens like gold. After all, when the S&P 500 dropped, bitcoin shot up. When banks in Cyprus collapsed, bitcoin was bolstered. And it was a narrative bitcoin purists—perhaps foolishly—propagated. If normal people, the enfranchised, the folks in countries with stable currencies, started buying, it could only drive the price of the scarce asset higher, or so was the thinking. Then came the coronavirus, wreaking havoc on global finance, and everything changed. Or to be more accurate, people started to see what bitcoin really was. Starting around March 11, as concerns about the coronavirus escalated closures of everything from some of the largest companies in the world, including Apple and Tesla, to local bars and restaurants, the price of the S&P 500 and other global markets collapsed by 10%, taking bitcoin with it. Bitcoin, the digital asset that had come to be identified with its non-correlation, was broken, many warned, and if it was correlated with traditional markets its use and value were gone.There’s a couple problems with that narrative though. If bitcoin’s value was being driven by it being a non-correlated asset, then the moment it did correlate, its value should have gone down towards zero. Nevertheless, bitcoin’s price has already started to recover, right along with traditional markets, increasing by 16% over the most recent 24-hour period. If non-correlation was core to bitcoin’s value, why was it increasing right along with traditional markets? Second, people were buying, and more importantly, using bitcoin long before traditional investors started talking about bitcoin being non-correlated at all. Early bitcoin users bought bitcoin for largely ideological reasons. In loosely chronological order, they used it because: it was fun and weird; it let them buy things online without needing to use a bank, much less a central bank; it let them buy things online, like drugs, that they couldn’t use a credit card for; it couldn’t be seized if their government found them unsavory for any reason; it couldn’t be manipulated by printing more. And that’s just to name a few.There was no talk of hedging in those early days. There was no talk of diversifying a portfolio, and what percent one should have on hand. Back then, they weren’t even really called “investors” at all. They were “holders.” To be sure, fortunes were made, and lost, due to lack of those considerations. Accidental millionaires were created, as was complete financial devastation.Then, over the counter trading became a thing. Grayscale paved the way in 2015 by securitizing bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, letting accredited and institutional investors who might not otherwise be legally allowed to touch the asset gain exposure. Then traditional financial institutions like Fidelity and CME Group got involved, not only making it easier for traditional investors to participate in the nascent economy, but expanding the kinds of behaviors exhibited by the people who own bitcoin. These were the hedgers, the portfolio makers, the day-traders. The frenzy caused by such vaunted interest in part helped drive the price of bitcoin to nearly $20,000 at the end of 2017, before it collapsed to $4,000. By June 2019 the price had recovered to $13,000. Then, in the Fall of 2019, something happened. We’re still not sure what it was, but it appears a bunch of new investors started buying bitcoin, according to data created by cryptocurrency data firm, CoinMetrics and others. Very little is known about this spending spree, but from September to December, those investors filled up their coffers with crypto. The price rather benignly moved from $10,000 to $7,100 over the same time. A relatively small movement, especially for seasoned bitcoin traders who were used to seeing that kind of action in a single day. However, we wouldn’t learn about this new breed of investor until March 11, that fateful day when fears over coronavirus started to reach a frenzied note. That day, 281,000 bitcoin that its owners had held for a mere thirty days were sold, according to CoinMetrics, while only 4,131 bitcoin that had laid dormant for a year or more moved, indicating that the vast majority of the volatility was almost certainly from new buyers. The following day, those actions had aligned bitcoin’s movements with the S&P 500 more than it had ever been before, based on CoinMetric’s calculation of what is called the Pearson correlation, which shows the similarity between two sets, and has stayed at about that level for the past five days, according to the firm. A separate analysis by financial services firm Unchained Capital found that over a longer time period, from March 11 to March 15, a majority of the volatility, or about 458,000 bitcoins, came from accounts that were between one month and one year old. To be clear, we don’t know anything about the investors who triggered the sell-off, or what were their motives. All we know is their accounts were new, they all started selling at about the same time, either corresponding with, or triggering the tightest market correlation with the S&P 500 bitcoin has ever experienced. Even as they were making their trades though, whispers of “buy the dip” could already be heard among the old-school bitcoin holders. Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has actually seen an 83% increase in the amount of account signups over the week of the collapse, compared to the week before—people looking to capitalize on the low price.In the fall-out surrounding coronavirus, banks once again started printing money to create the liquidity that’s crucial to keeping the global financial gears lubricated. Could bitcoin’s limited supply still prove to be an antidote? Some asked. Might bitcoin evolve into something else entirely? For an open-source currency, constantly being recreated by the very people who own it, anything is possible. Until then though, don’t be surprised when bitcoin behaves exactly the way its owners do.So, if bitcoin isn’t magic, what is it? At its core, its underlying blockchain technology is just the ability to prove that a digital item is only in one place at a time. That ability laid the foundation for it to possibly, someday, acquire value, which it has. But unlike other assets, it’s also a payment rails, a way to move that value. How much is an asset with its own native payment rails worth? Right now it’s worth $6,200 per bitcoin for a total market value of $113 billion, not counting the vast infrastructure in place to support it. For some comparison though, Visa and Mastercard together are worth about $500 billion dollars.Really though, what makes bitcoin different, is it was the first financial innovation ever adopted by cooky retail investors first. And when traditional investors, used to seeing their own image reflected in innovation, saw something else, they assumed it was magic. When all it really was, is a payment system, and dare I say, a store of value, that lets people own the asset and the infrastructure. Everything else is up in the air.Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus"

[+] problems. (Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images)","Bitcoin prices have fallen sharply lately, extending their recent losses and pushing the digital currency below $6,000 for the first time this year. The cryptocurrency declined to as little as $5,678.14 around 6:45 a.m. EST, CoinDesk data shows. At this point, bitcoin was down roughly 29% from yesterday’s high of $7,984.60, additional CoinDesk figures show. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]The world’s most prominent digital currency is certainly not the only asset that has been having a hard time lately. At the time of this writing, all of the top 10 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap were in the red. Stocks were also suffering, as the benchmark S&P 500 index was down more than 6% for the day at the time of this writing, Google Finance data shows. Bitcoin’s Recent Price DropDenis Vinokourov, head of research for London-based digital asset firm Bequant, noted that the market has declined “sharply” in the last 24 hours, with bitcoin falling more than 20% in an environment characterized worries about coronavirus, U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest travel restrictions and panic-driven selling. He noted that the desire of investors to sell off their holdings triggered “a liquidity crunch as the cost of capital spiked up across trading venues.”“This tightening was exacerbated by the fact that the market is highly dominated by sell-side liquidity providers/market-making firms, with only a limited buy-side demand,” added Vinokourov. Safe Haven ConcernsBecause bitcoin has been falling during times of widespread concern over the coronavirus pandemic, “many are disappointed” that the digital currency “has not been acting as the ‘safe haven’ it was promised to be,” said Kiana Danial, CEO of Invest Diva. “However, a quick look at gold prices shows that even gold has not been able to live up to its ‘safe haven’ standards as it has dropped dramatically over the past few days,” said Danial. She elaborated on this situation, stating that: “To me, this simply suggests that Bitcoin has been caught in the Coronavirus global turmoil along with all other assets where investors are no longer looking to invest at all and prefer to hold cash in case of a doomsday scenario.”Technical SupportWhile bitcoin has suffered some notable losses lately, the digital currency could recover soon, according to technical analysis provided by a handful of experts. “Bitcoin is currently trading in a very strong support zone between $5,600 and $6,200 and is likely to bounce back from here,” said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital.Danial offered a similar perspective, stating that “the Fibonacci retracement level tracing the uptrend that started in February 2019 and ended in June 2019, suggests the current support level is at around $5,700.”“This level also falls on a previous resistance back in April 2019 and acted as a support multiple times in 2018 and 2017,” she noted. While bitcoin may have strong support, “the coming week will be crucial in establishing a floor for this recent drop,” said DiPasquale. “If Bitcoin closes below $5,500, then $5,000 would be tested very quickly,” he stated. “The upside, on the other hand, remains limited to $6,500 and $7,000 for now,” concluded DiPasquale.

Yesterday’s high was $7,969 and the low was $3,596, which amounts to a 55% fall, epic by any market’s standard.I have bought. This sounds more grand than it is as my doctrine on this is to buy a chunk every $1,000 down, which saw me buy three chunks at $7,500, 6,500, 5,500, missing $4,500 and $3,500 because I was asleep. When I awoke it was a little above $5,000.That is a shame but in these kinds of markets you simple have to forget a tight view on price because the markets are malfunctioning and in a way rightly so.They are behaving like this because a lot of people are getting margin calls on their borrowings and are liquidating their uncollateralized liquid assets. That will be crypto for some. This is why gold fell yesterday, too. Gold is the classic haven asset and of course if your banker is banging on your door you have to sell it to cover your margin because the fancy car, yacht and houses are already standing as collateral for your borrowings.I wrote earlier here that the market would be the thermometer of the virus because of China. This would be driven by the demand for flight capital there. The need has gone because there is no possibility of flight because no one will accept you at the other end. What is more, the need for cash not just for margin, but for propping up business, is now acute. The driver of the trade war is also moot because who knows if the Chinese currency is going to be relatively weak or strong in a world where every government is going to be hosing cash at this problem to bridge the “demand shock” that will be shaking the global economy as the developed world goes into lock down.So what to do now?The critical call is, are you a crypto believer? If you aren’t, stay away. No matter what bitcoin does, up or down, if you don’t believe in bitcoin in your gut and marrow, do not get involved. This is the most volatile of assets even without the ability to halve overnight. If you don’t believe, this is not the game to play.If you believe, it is simple. You buy the dip and you buy the crash and you acquire bits and bobs as if you had a special savings account. This is a kind of ultra-extreme “buy and hold” dynamic.In this construct, you aren’t looking at making money in the short or medium term, you are simply looking to acquire as much bitcoin as is sensible without a broader portfolio of long-term investments.To do this you have to believe in the asset and have to be comfortable with being potentially utterly wrong. That means having the right amount of exposure to it among your other investments and having a clear and simple plan.If you believe, you have to buy this crash. But how?Here is a guide:The best way to buy a crash is on the second leg of the W bottomThis is the best way to buy any crash. Crashes can be V bottomed but they are rare. The best way to buy a crash is to let it run its course and buy on the last leg of the W or buy across the base of what you think is the bottom.So here we are:The Bitcoin chartThe first leg of the W is in, it might not be all of it but if you are a believer you can see it’s time to be dipping in to buying. When the W starts forming as time passes, the certainty that the bottom is in increases and with that it increasingly becomes time to buy the crash.If you are not a bitcoin believer you should stay away because in this all market crash, cash is king and playing is not for the faint-hearted.Whatever market you are in the key is to buy the crash by buying the recovery.

The bellwether digital currency is now trading at $7,770, down an eye-watering 13% on the day. Those 2020 highs around $10,400 punched back in February now seem very, very far away. No Safe Haven! Bitcoin’s plunge over the weekend and in start-of-week trading might come as a surprise to some. The price action of mid-2019 might be a foggy memory amid the frantic volatility of financial markets right now. However, back then plenty of commentators were piling in to proclaim that the asset’s time as a creditable safe-haven asset had come. There was some logic to this thinking, too. Bitcoin sailed to within a whisker of $12,000 in June as a myriad of geopolitical and macroeconomic worries weighed on market mindset. Trade wars between the US and China were worsening. Brexit fears were intensifying, and economic data from the eurozone was becoming increasingly worrisome. Meanwhile, central banks the world over were cutting interest rates to help rescue the slowing global economy. There was even some talk that cryptocurrencies would topple gold as the most popular flight-to-safety asset. In a world that is becoming increasingly digitalised this school of thought in theory had at least a little merit. Gold Gains What today’s falls show, then, is that such thinking was clearly built on very sandy foundations. Indeed, compare Bitcoin’s crash in beginning-of-week business to the performance of gold. Yellow metal prices are within touching distance of setting new seven-year peaks around $1,700 per ounce. One thing is for sure. Saying that digital currencies are already as valuable as eternal rush-to-safety assets like gold is, well, baloney. It’s clear that investors are only interested in safe havens with long track record behind them (the yield on 10-year US Treasuries hit record lows of 0.318% overnight as buyers piled in). Better Buys than Bitcoin So forget about buying Bitcoin, I say. I’ve long voiced my worries over the legitimacy and thus the long-term outlook for the cryptocurrencies. We are still waiting for the Federal Reserve to sign off on a crypto-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF), after all. The volatility of recent sessions has done nothing but make me even more cautious. I’d much rather buy into ETF backed by gold instead, say the Aberdeen Standard Physical Swiss Gold Shares ETF. Alternatively, purchasing a similar vehicle containing shares in gold-producing stocks (like the iShares Gold Producers UCITS ETF) is another strong option. My personal preference would be to buy shares in one or more of London’s quoted gold miners. These stocks aren’t immune to Monday’s selloff and major producers like Polymetal International and Centamin were down (albeit marginally) in today’s trading. However, once the worst of the investor panic is over I reckon such companies are in great shape to record spectacular share price gains."

Earlier this week, the U.S. Federal Reserve slashed interest rates to almost zero and fired a $1 trillion stimulus bazooka in an attempt to protect the world's largest economy from a coronavirus-induced shutdown. This followed similar interest rate cuts around the world as governments and central banks scrambled to reassure markets. The rushed action largely failed, with the Dow suffering its worst day since the Black Monday market crash in 1987 and its third-worst day ever.Today, U.S. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said he was poised to write checks to millions of Americans to try to offset the economic burden of the coronavirus pandemic—an unconventional economic stimulus measure that's been popularized recently by some left-leaning economists as universal basic income (UBI) but was once known as helicopter money: freshly-printed cash that appears to drop from the sky into the pockets of the public (a concept some crypto investors will be familiar with).""We are looking at sending checks to Americans immediately,"" Mnuchin said, speaking at a White House press conference. ""Americans need cash now, and the president wants to get cash now—and I mean now in the next two weeks.""Elsewhere, Spain is apparently weighing similar helicopter money style stimulus—something that could play havoc with the economically joined-up eurozone.Many traditional economists dislike helicopter money. They say it's harder to remove from the system and could cause long-term inflation to soar.The world's central banks are being forced to consider such extreme options due to the lingering effects of the 2008 global financial crisis, with many of their less radical policy tools still in effect. ""The U.S. is about to be addicted to that helicopter money really fast,"" bitcoin proponent and co-founder of hedge fund Morgan Creek Digital, Anthony Pompliano, said via Twitter.Meanwhile, some market watchers are worried the broad sell-offs, combined with helicopter money proposals, could cause a cash glut. ""At the moment, what we're seeing from the market is an unprecedented move to cash,"" said Mati Greenspan, founder of financial advisory firm Quantum Economics.

Bitcoin was more-or-less unmoved by the news and has been treading water since taking a big step lower last weekend—hovering around $5,000 per bitcoin. ""Bitcoin is built for these events,"" said Keld van Schreven, co-founder and managing director at blockchain investment firm KR1. ""Bitcoin, ether and other crypto networks needs no bail out or QE. They just need a handful of servers to run, verify and complete transactions. Bitcoin, ether and other crypto has taken the weakest link (us) out.

""We are opposed to the fact that there are institutions that organize the release of cryptocurrency and facilitate its circulation,"" Guznov said, adding the coming bill ""directly formulates a ban on the issue, as well as on the organization of circulation of cryptocurrency, and introduces liability for violation of this ban.""The move echos China's tough stance on cryptocurrencies, with Beijing banning companies from raising funds by initial coin offerings, known as ICOs, and shutting down bitcoin and crypto trading platforms in 2017.Russia's coming bitcoin and crypto trading ban was seen as all but inevitable by some cryptocurrency regulation experts. ""Representatives of the Russian central bank have repeatedly voiced their view: the rouble, as the law says, is the only legal means of payment in Russia,"" said Alex Kuptsikevich, senior financial analyst at FxPro. ""Attempts to define them with a status of 'digital financial assets' took so long because lawmakers were hoping that the crypto-boom would fade away, and they wouldn't need to create a new legal environment.""The bitcoin price has taken a beating in recent weeks, with cryptocurrency prices across the board ...

""Nobody is going to ban owning cryptocurrencies,” Guznov said, adding people will not be punished for owning crypto ""if they made their deal in a jurisdiction that does not prohibit that.""The bill, which is meant to clarify rules on digital assets more broadly could be passed as soon as this spring, is seen as part of Russia's strategy to grow its digital services economy. ""The Kremlin set up a digital agenda as one of the most important national projects in the history of Russia,"" said Vladislav Ginko, an economist at Russian state think tank RANEPA. ""This national project is slated to outshine Stalin's industrialization and to capture the political faith of the modern youth to invigorate its enthusiasm to make the country a world digital superpower based primarily not on factories but on digital-based services."""

Recently, the world’s most prominent digital currency suffered some notable losses, falling close to 20% in a matter of days. Stocks have also had a hard time, with major indices experiencing significant declines. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, a benchmark index containing the stocks of 30 large companies, fell more than 2,000 points today, its largest drop in history, according to the BBC. Oil, a risk-on asset, also had a rough day, with U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude plunging more than 24%, CNBC reported. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]Amid these conditions, some bitcoin enthusiasts have started voicing doubts about whether the digital currency does indeed provide investors with safety during times of macroeconomic turmoil. Analyst ViewpointsWhen analysts were polled for this particular article, they provided a range of perspectives. In an effort to explain the recent correlation between bitcoin and risk-on assets, some market observers pointed to a liquidity crunch, emphasizing that a lack of liquidity in stocks might cause similar problems in digital currencies, helping fuel losses in both asset classes. Denis Vinokourov, head of research for London-based digital asset firm Bequant, spoke to this matter. “A liquidity event in equities will likely translate into worsening liquidity conditions in crypto because market participants will be forced to adjust their portfolios and deal with margin calls, alternative assets are unlikely to be prioritised,” he stated. “The same goes for commodities such as oil and gold.”Further, Vinokourov stated that the current “broader market and liquidity event” was the main cause of bitcoin’s recent declines. Michael Conn, founder and managing partner of financial services firm Quail Creek Ventures, offered a similar point of view, stating that “gold and other traditional safe-haven assets” have been “selling off recently due to the liquidity crunch.”“I still see BTC as a safe haven asset when the fundamentals come back into the market,” he said. Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, agreed, stating that “bitcoin is positioned very well to be a safe-haven asset.” He added that “crypto’s correlations are very dynamic as of now, shifting from equities to gold, depending on the prevalent situation.” “The recent crypto sell-off, in tandem with global equities, merely represents a general risk aversion going into a possible economic crunch, and does not necessarily invalidate Bitcoin's safe-haven status,” said DiPasquale. Evan Kuo, CEO and cofounder of digital currency firm Ampleforth, provided a different point of view.“I don't think Bitcoin is yet a safe-haven asset,” he stated. “I think it’s an uncorrelated risk asset, which is important to distinguish from a safe-haven asset.” “To protect from losses, investors will likely first retreat into dollars and bonds,” he added. “Later, if they’re looking to add risk that’s uncorrelated with broader macro-factors they should consider Bitcoin due to its potential for appreciation.”Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether and EOS.

If the U.S. moves to create a digital dollar, which we've seen this week there is some appetite for ... [+] in Washington, then it will spark a fresh wave of interest in digital assets such as bitcoin. Plans for a new digital dollar were included in a draft stimulus bill put together by the U.S. Democratic Party as a means to make payments to people and businesses hit by coronavirus-induced economic turmoil.According to the plans, the U.S. Federal Reserve would offer bank accounts to all Americans, branded FedAccounts. The FedAccounts would allow the government to bypass commercial banks and turn retail banking into a public service—everyone would have a FedAccount just as they have a social security number that they could use to send and receive dollars. It's unclear whether a new digital dollar would use bitcoin's blockchain technology or a traditional, centralized database. Though the new digital dollar plans were ultimately cut from the bill before it was put to the the House vote, its brief inclusion rekindled a conversation about mainstream digital currency that was started by social media giant Facebook last year when it began work on its libra cryptocurrency project—something that caused the bitcoin price to more than double in under six months.Last year, the bitcoin price was pulled out of a deep bear market by rumours some of the world's biggest technology companies, from iPhone-maker Apple to social media giant Facebook, were poised to jump into the cryptocurrency game. Facebook moved first, revealing its plans for stablecoin libra and attracting a wave fresh criticism of the company that was still trying to repair its reputation following a string of privacy and data-sharing scandals. The regulatory backlash against Facebook last summer almost derailed its libra plans and discouraged other technology or finance companies from trying anything similar, putting the bitcoin price back on a steep downward trend—with bitcoin interest and adoption struggling. ""[A digital dollar] would be a first step towards crypto technologies being widely adopted,"" executive director of Washington-based lobby group the Blockchain Association, Kristin Smith, told bitcoin and crypto news site Coindesk. ""Through dollar-backed stablecoins, people could [grow to] understand that they can have full access to their financial lives.""The bitcoin price has struggled to climb along with traditional markets this week after taking a big ... [+] step down earlier in the month--though bitcoin bulls remain confident the bitcoin price will climb in the medium to long term. Other senior bitcoin and crypto industry figures are unconvinced a new digital dollar will be a positive development for bitcoin adoption, however. ""[A digital dollar] would be ... fascinating and a good move in the direction of leading the U.S.,"" chief executive of BinanceUS, Catherine Coley, told crypto new site Cointelegraph, adding: ""In terms of how that actually affects the adoption rate or the financial inclusion that we see as benefiting from digital assets, it's a little bit different.""Meanwhile, the massive coronavirus-induced stimulus that propelled the digital dollar to the forefront of policy maker minds is itself pushing people toward bitcoin and other scare digital assets—with the bitcoin and cryptocurrency community convinced the ""largest rescue package in American history"" will mean a surge in bitcoin and crypto interest.Some think the historic emergency rescue packages being readied by the Fed and other central banks around the world will still not be enough to support markets and the economy in the face of a prolonged pandemic-preventing shut down.Meanwhile, after the digital dollar plans were scrapped from the coronavirus stimulus bill, a similar proposal cropped up in a draft Senate banking bill unrelated to the coronavirus pandemic—suggesting this conversation is far from over. With a new digital dollar now on the table and confidence in Fed about to take a hit, bitcoin has a lot to gain. "

[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]“A combination of factors are driving the market higher today,” said analyst Denis Vinokourov, head of research for London-based digital asset firm Bequant.Specifically, he pointed to “profit taking flow in the options market” as well as “some degree of stabilisation of the liquidity conditions, with the cost of liquidity continuing to come off the extreme levels observed over the recent sessions.” He also spoke to the vastly different performance of bitcoin and stocks, which had been falling together recently. “While Bitcoin may have been trading in lockstep with risk assets and in particular S&P500, it is not the first that the the digital asset has established some degree of correlation to traditional assets,” said Vinokourov. “Everytime, this correlation proved to be short lived,” he noted. “This deviation is another win for an asset that prides itself on its non-correlated and asymmetric performance,” Vinokourov stated. Catherine Coley, CEO of Binance.US, also weighed on the recent changes in the global asset markets. “Last week’s nosedive in crypto markets was part of a universal rush to cash among investors in response to unprecedented panic and uncertainty, but Bitcoin’s appeal as a safe haven and deflationary asset is once more apparent amid the raft of fiscal and monetary stimulus from governments and central banks around the world, reminding investors just how precarious the existing financial system really is,” she said.

""The blockchain industry can and will survive through tremulous current events,” he stated. “The current situation shows that the global economy needs transparency and blockchain,” noted Ardoino. “You can not keep printing money out of thin air leaving our children to pick up the debt.

","The bitcoin price lost a staggering 18% over the last two days, dragging the wider cryptocurrency market down and causing double-digit percentage losses for the likes of ethereum, Ripple’s XRP, bitcoin cash, and litecoin.The bitcoin price has almost given up its 2020 gains. The cause of the sudden sell-off wasn't immediately clear, though some have pointed to wider stock market and commodity turmoil in the face of the spreading coronavirus. On Sunday evening, bitcoin was seen trading as low as $7,684 per bitcoin on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange. On Saturday, bitcoin had looked poised for a rally, climbing as high as $9,192 before beginning it's steady plunge. Meanwhile, oil prices crashed by 30% yesterday after Opec members, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, failed to agree on deeper production cuts to offset weaker demand caused by the coronavirus outbreak, effectively sparking a price war.Major U.S. index futures, including the S&P 500, the Dow, and the Nasdaq, all plunged around 5% following the oil cartel's decision. The latest fall in the bitcoin price will all but destroy any remaining expectation that bitcoin has begun acting as a so-called safe-haven asset, which are expected to move higher in times of greater risk and uncertainty. ""Bitcoin is down 8% in the last day, much more than global equities,"" economist and outspoken bitcoin critic, Nouriel Roubini, said last night via Twitter. ""Another proof that bitcoin is not a good hedge versus risky assets in risk-off episodes. It actually falls more than risky assets during risk-off.""Some bitcoin and cryptocurrency watchers tried to downplay the crypto market meltdown, urging bitcoin investors to take a long-term view.

Bitcoin has been battling against falling trading volumes and stalled adoption in recent months—but that's not stopped some from betting big on the number one cryptocurrency.However, the bitcoin community was last week rocked by a warning from the chief executive of the largest U.S. bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase that it might not be bitcoin that pushes the cryptocurrency ecosystem ""from [around] 50 million users to 5 billion."""

(Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images)","Concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which has been declared a pandemic by The World Health Organization, helped drive bitcoin lower last month, in spite of various bullish factors that helped provide tailwinds earlier in February. The digital currency rose nearly 13% during the first few weeks, climbing from $9,388.88 at the start of the month to $10,598.03 on February 14th, CoinDesk figures show. Analysts cited multiple factors as causing these gains, including anticipation surrounding the upcoming halving, as well as Lightning Labs raising $10 million in order to grow its payment network. Some market observers also pointed to technical analysis, with Charles Hayter, cofounder and CEO of digital currency data platform CryptoCompare, emphasizing that bitcoin had surpassed its 200-day moving average, something he described as “usually a very positive signal.”[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]Coronavirus ImpactFollowing this strong start, bitcoin gave up all these gains and finished the month in the red, as global markets responded to worries surrounding the coronavirus. The digital currency fell to as little as $8,459.70 on February 28th, having declined more than 20% from its intra-month high, and finished the month at $8,639.59, additional CoinDesk data reveals. While the digital asset had been “performing well this year,” a growing number of coronavirus cases helped push it into the red, said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital.Denis Vinokourov, head of research for London-based digital asset firm Bequant, also spoke to the market’s reaction, noting how global equity markets also suffered a “dramatic correction” because of these concerns. Liquidity CrunchVinokourov shed further light on the cryptocurrency’s losses in February, emphasizing that a lack of liquidity also contributed to these declines. “Bitcoin can behave as a safe haven, portfolio diversification asset, but when there is a global liquidity crunch, cash is king and even safe haven assets fall in price as market participants are forced to cover positions to meet the liquidity constraints,” he stated. Other analysts also weighed in on this matter, with Michael Poutre, managing partner of blockchain-focused hedge fund Terraform Capital, noting that while “bitcoin is easily the most liquid digital currency,” it is nowhere near as liquid as gold, to which it has frequently been compared. The market for bitcoin is still very small compared to the markets for some assets, he noted, which helps contribute to the digital currency’s sharp price fluctuations. Bitcoin VolatilityDuring February, bitcoin’s 30-day volatility dropped to its lowest in more than five months, according to figures provided by David Martin, an independent cryptocurrency analyst and former chief investment officer of Blockforce Capital. This measure of bitcoin’s price fluctuations fell to 39.3% on February 14th, its lowest since September 23rd, said Martin. This compared to its value of 51% on February 1st. In the second half of the month, volatility pushed higher, finishing February at 48%. “Bitcoin’s volatility has generally been range bound between 40%-60% since August of last year, significantly lower than its long term average of 70%,” said Martin. The chart below helps illustrate these developments:Bitcoin's price against its 30-day and 60-day volatility. Market SentimentThe sentiment of bitcoin traders, as measured by 30-day average tweet volume, peaked in mid-February and then declined, according to Joshua Frank, cofounder of digital analytics platform TheTIE.io.“We saw a pretty steady increase in the number of tweets on Bitcoin from January through to the middle of February this year alongside price appreciation,” he stated. “From mid-February until the end of the month, tweet volume fell slightly but remained significantly above January lows,” said Frank. The chart below helps illustrate this situation: Bitcoin tweet Volume versus price in January and February.Frank emphasized that many digital currencies have followed a similar pattern, as their price movements correlated with sentiment.

Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]As a borderless digital asset not controlled by governments or centralized companies, bitcoin’s price should, in theory, travel its own path, independent of other currencies and markets. Crypto’s pioneer asset, however, has seen varied views suggesting correlations to traditional markets, such as stocks, “safe-haven” investments such as gold, or even arguments that bitcoin is not correlated to anything. Available data shows no firm answer, as bitcoin’s correlation seems to change with the wind, while a number of experts have varying thoughts on the matter.“I believe that bitcoin does have a correlation with traditional stock markets because they are both private assets,” analyst and trader Tone Vays told me in a March 18 comment. “Bitcoin benefitted a lot from the ten year bull market because people got generally wealthier, and they were more willing to speculate on something like bitcoin,” Vays added, mentioning the thriving market seen over the last decade. Vays expects a positive reaction from bitcoin during relatively uncertain economic times, such as a country’s withdrawal from the eurozone for example. “People will be scared, but they still have their jobs and they’re looking for a place exit,” he said, referencing people prospecting for investment opportunities. The analyst, however, said the current situation differs. “When it comes to a major situation like we have now with the markets crashing, and people worrying about their jobs, they’re not going to speculate on bitcoin,” Vays said. As an asset that has only been in existence for roughly 11 years, the analyst explained bitcoin is not yet primed to take the place of cash across the globe. Amid global coronavirus fears and oil trade wars, recent days have seen traditional markets plummet. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), a common barometer for market health, fell more than 20% from its 2020 highs by March 11, and faced continued decline in the days following. Bitcoin suffered similar carnage around the same time frame, diving from $10,500 on February 12, down to $3,870 by March 13. Between March 12 and 13, BTC fell from $8,000 down to $3,870, while the Dow fell from 22,840 to 21,150, according to TradingView.com price charts. The Dow’s March 12 drop totaled over 7% — which is less damage comparative to bitcoin’s dump, but still a severe market loss by traditional market standards. Bitcoin Sometimes Travels Its Own PathBitcoin’s price has not always travelled in line with traditional markets, however. Based on bitcoin’s chart, compared to the S&P 500 index, another popular mainstream benchmark, crypto’s pioneer asset has acted oppositely at times. An article from Cointelegraph compared historical price data between 2018 and 2019 from the S&P 500 and bitcoin, showing inconclusive data for any firm trend. At times, bitcoin did not react, or acted oppositely when the S&P 500 moved sharply. During other periods, the two seemingly moved in sync. According to Vays, bitcoin’s price does not follow traditional markets during times of decreased price swings, also known as low volatility, sometimes seen when markets are level or marginally trending upward. “If the volatility of the stock market isn’t huge, bitcoin is not correlated at all,” he said. “When the market is going up very quickly, or when the market is crashing, I believe there is a correlation to bitcoin because they’re both private assets.” In recent days, amid the mentioned traditional market fears and falling prices, bitcoin has held rather steady. Specifically, on March 16, the Dow suffered another red day, while bitcoin traded largely sideways, ranging between $4,450 and $5,370, rather than posting new 2020 price lows like the Dow. The asset has held strong since March 16, regardless of traditional markets, sitting at a press time price of $6,648. Crypto’s Largest Coin Stated As A ‘Non-Correlated Asset’ Morgan Creek Digital cofounder and crypto aficionado Anthony Pompliano noted bitcoin’s comparative action in a March 16 tweet. “Bitcoin is basically flat today and the stock market is down double digits,” he said. “Don't hear many people yelling about ‘BITCOIN IS CORRELATED!’ today,” Pompliano added. “Truth is correlation doesn't matter over short periods of time. Over months and years, bitcoin remains a non-correlated asset.” Over the years, Pompliano has piped up many times, defending his stance of bitcoin as a non-correlated asset. “Bitcoin is definitely a non-correlated asset,” Pompliano told CNBC in a December 2018 interview. “If you look at the correlation between the digital asset and the S&P 500 over the last 180 days, it’s at zero,” he noted. “If you look at it compared to the dollar index, it’s near zero,” he added. As of a January 2020 interview with Cointelegraph, Pompliano said his position on the matter had not changed. “The most important part of bitcoin, when it comes to the global hedge, is the fact that it’s a non-correlated asset — meaning that, as stocks go up or down, bitcoin doesn’t have correlation to that,” he told the media outlet. Centralized Investor PopulationEmmanuel Goh, CEO of crypto analytics company Skew, explained bitcoin’s price action relative to stock market investors. The top 10% wealthiest households own 84% of available U.S. stocks according to a 2016 report from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). Goh told me Baby Boomers comprise most of these numbers while holding almost no bitcoin. “Millennials who own bitcoin also have a small allocation to stocks,” he added. “That should make, in theory, bitcoin more immune to liquidations and margin calls during a global sell-off,” Goh explained. “Bitcoin was still down 10% in sympathy today - a muted reaction in our view given the context for global markets and bitcoin high volatility,” he said on March 9, noting a relatively small move for bitcoin given its regular tendencies. As bitcoin continues to age, gaining further recognition with time, the asset may develop a more predictable correlation or lack of correlation to traditional markets or world events. At this point, however, crypto’s pioneer asset appears to be finding its way one step at a time, changing its correlation at times.

Meanwhile, the economic ramifications of a coronavirus-induced shut down have triggered a surge of interest in scarce digital assets like bitcoin, with many aghast at central bank and Federal Reserve plans to flood countries with never-before-seen levels of freshly-minted cash. Interest in bitcoin has been boosted by the spreading coronavirus COVID-19, with social media ... [+] playing a major role in how people are reacting to the disease. Since the coronavirus COVID-19 first hit the headlines in early 2020, misleading and outright wrong information has been shared digitally but from February there has been explosion of coronavirus-related fake news. The likes of Facebook, Instagram and Twitter have tried to stem the flow but on Facebook-owned WhatsApp and other end-to-end encrypted messaging services there's no way to measure the scale of infection or slow its spread. WhatsApp has become a breeding ground for unsourced and false claims during the coronavirus COVID-19 crisis.WhatsApp groups with member counts stretching into the hundreds receive forwarded messages from other massive groups, from digitally-infantile seniors and from panicked teens alike. Much of that misinformation is economic—grocery stores are closing, banks have run out of cash. But some accurate reports are so outrageous they would have appeared false to many as little as two weeks ago. The Fed could mint not one but two $1 trillion coins. The U.K. government will pay 80% of wages. A global recession of record proportions is a near certainty and coming as soon as next month. Stock markets around the world lost trillions of dollars in value in a matter of hours. This morning, the Fed promised an open-ended commitment to keep buying assets under its quantitative easing measures—effectively offering to buy the entire market if necessary.As the COVID-19 crisis rolls on, with some forecasting lockdowns could last well into 2021, people are counting the cost of long-term business closures and unprecedented central bank stimulus. ""Extraordinary times require extraordinary action,"" Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank, said last week via Twitter. ""There are no limits to our commitment to the euro.""""There’s an infinite amount of cash at the Federal Reserve,"" Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, told CBS over the weekend. ""We will do whatever we need to do to make sure that there’s enough cash in the banking system.""Internet denizens opposed to the Fed's record coronavirus COVID-19 stimulus have begun lampooning ... [+] central banks--with many claiming bitcoin to be the antidote to ""infinite cash.""Similar comments have been made by other senior central bank and government officials, driving the popularity of the ""money printer go brrr"" meme and leaving many economists concerned over the long-term consequences of the extreme measures.The measures put in place to dampen the economic effect of the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic echo those brought in to offset the 2008 financial crisis—measures designed to make a potentially catastrophic short, sharp, shock milder but at the same time much longer.In 2008, the Western world broadly decided it would rather spread pain over decades than try to absorb the direct loss of jobs, capital and economic output the crash brought. The same choice is being made now, though the situation has changed. Measures enacted in the aftermath of the global financial crisis remain in place, limiting policy-makers effectiveness. The world has become more globalized, hobbling individual government's ability to act. Social networks have digitalized and decentralized the media.Perhaps most importantly, bitcoin, created in the midst of the last economic crash, has shown there is a possible alternative to the central bank-controlled debt-based economy—an alternative that is yet to be truly tested, however. The enthusiastic, seen by some as bordering on desperate, spending by governments and central banks has already pushed many toward bitcoin. “Up to now, gold has been known as the ultimate safe-haven asset, but bitcoin—which shares its key characteristics of being a store of value and scarcity—could potentially dethrone gold in the future as the world becomes increasingly digitized,"" said Nigel Green, the chief executive of financial advisory group deVere.Bitcoin searches on Google have risen sharply in recent weeks as the coronavirus crisis forces ... [+] central banks and governments into uncharted territory. In China, the search engine Baidu has seen a rise in searches for ""bitcoin""—up 183% over the past thirty days, according to local reports. Google searches for bitcoin spiked ahead of the traditional and crypto market crash, more than doubling from the start of the month. Meanwhile, many bitcoin and crypto exchanges have reported a surge in users and trading volumes. ""Despite the market downturn, Binance.US is seeing unprecedented trading volumes, with especially active trading in bitcoin,"" said Catherine Coley, chief executive of Binance.US, part of the world's biggest bitcoin and crypto exchange, Binance. ""Bitcoin’s recent jump while the rest of the market tumbles proves that unlike traditional companies, bitcoin can and will survive without bailouts.""The bitcoin price, which plummeted along with almost everything else earlier this month, has rebounded even as stock markets around the world continue to fall—underscoring bitcoin's reputation as an uncorrelated asset. The bitcoin price has lost all of its 2020 gains in recent weeks, falling back to around $6,000 per ... [+] bitcoin. ""Bitcoin will continue to be volatile over the next few months but the macro backdrop is why it was created,"" bitcoin advocate and founder of bitcoin and crypto hedge fund Galaxy Digital, Mike Novogratz, said via Twitter after warning just last week confidence in bitcoin has ""evaporated"" following its price crash. ""This will be and needs to be bitcoin's year,"" Novogratz added. For better or worse, and regardless of whether such measures are justified by the coronavirus crisis, the Western world is heading for the largest crackdown on civil liberties it's ever seen—coupled with the largest ever increase in the Federal Reserve's and central bank's balance sheets. Bitcoin, a borderless and permissionless substitute to government-sanctioned fiat money, is going to be in high demand in the post-coronavirus world."

It’s about putting the power of money back into the hands of the people. The more people familiar with basic financial concepts, the better off we're all going to be, he says.","Greenspan has traded paper gold, silver, and copper since the age of 12 or 13. Over the years, the biggest adjustment he’s had to make has been the jump from paper trading in the newspaper to trading online. “The internet is the real revolution here,” he told me. “After that, online brokers paved the way for everything that we're seeing in the crypto space.” The best tools are charts and social media, he says. “It's really about how you get your news, and how you get information,” he said. “Social media has helped, because the financial markets are traditionally a very closed door industry. People speak about Wall Street in the 70s and 80s as a pack of wolves. All of the traders run together as a pack. And then, if there's some poor schlub who comes in with his $10,000, they eat him alive.”Bitcoin is going to the moon, proponents say. This particular 'Satoshi' made it already.The internet gives people some of that power back. “Even somebody who is an absolute novice in the financial markets can come in, join a group, or even copy somebody with a copy trader activity, and do quite well in the markets. Even with no prior knowledge, they can come in, and in several hours learn enough that they actually stand a chance in the market.” Greenspan spends a lot of time on Twitter and on LinkedIn pruning his feeds, ensuring that he gets the relevant information. He follows people whose opinion about the markets he respects.He cites Twitter and Reddit as two platforms where one can customize the information they receive. “A lot of people, who don't spend the time get put off quite quickly, because they get a lot of garbage in their feed,” said Greenspan. “But, if you go through and see who you are following on Twitter, or which subjects you're following on Reddit, you're actually going to get a lot of very useful information.” Useful information includes anything from different types of analysis to deep dives on the news or technical aspects. He supports his social media use with search engines. He uses Twitter as a listening tool, monitoring the digital conversations to understand what people are saying about a particular asset. “I would see who was into the financial markets and had a large following. Those were the people that I would start following immediately,” he said. “I would also see people on TV, for example, or people who are in the news, and think, ‘Okay, I want to know what this person has to say’. So, I go look them up and see which social accounts they're active on. I still do that to this day. If I see an analyst or even a world leader, who I want to be in touch with, I'll go ahead and look them up on social media.” In part, that’s why social media is so helpful when studying cryptocurrencies. “If people think that it's a bit overvalued at the moment, or if people think that it's going to go down, then you might want to reduce the amount that you're investing. Whereas, if people are very bullish, and they think that it's going to go up, that's when you can increase your exposure.”At the same time, when using social media for analysis, it is important to be cautious. “You don’t want to rely on social media too much,” said Greenspan. “There are a lot of nefarious players out there who tend to know how to manipulate social media.” He uses the tools and charts of trading differently, depending on if he is trading long-term or short-term. “If I'm thinking about a specific company’s stock that I want to invest in, for example, I'm going to use long term analysis, because that's not a trade that I want to jump in and jump out of. I want to say, ‘Okay, this company has room to grow, it has potential.’ I'm going to use it as a long term investment. If I'm trading more short term, then I'm going to be looking at breaking news, for example, to see how it's going to impact the market.” When looking at the news for trading signals, you’ll want to see the news, look at how markets react, and then make your move. “In the crypto market, that is a bit less relevant, because crypto doesn't react to the news as much as traditional markets,” said Greenspan. “Traditional markets, for example, have regular news events.” He cites the U.S. jobs report in the United States as one. “It's huge.” It happens on the first Friday of every month at 8:30am Eastern Time. “And, when it happens, everybody knows it's going to happen,” said Greenspan. “Everybody's in front of their computers waiting for the results. As soon as the results are published, everybody's trading immediately.”That leads to a lot of volatility. “You can see huge movements in the market,” said Greenspan. Crypto doesn't really have news announcements for which everybody's waiting—not all too often, at least.“Momentum is going to be a much more powerful way for you to trade crypto, simply because you can tell when something is moving, when it's moving fast, and in which direction it's going. If you can gauge the direction and speed of the markets by looking at the charts or other platforms or looking at social media sentiment, that's going to be the best way to trade in the crypto markets, especially high risk cryptocurrencies on a short term basis.”Google Trends is one of Greenspan’s favorite analysis tools. “It shows the fundamentals of the market, and how many people around the world are thinking about it at any given moment. The more people who are thinking about it, the better off it is. Cryptocurrencies by nature are networks. Even Dogecoin. It may be a joke, but it's a network at the end of the day, and it's the people that contribute to the network that help it.”Greenspan suggests studying one hour charts, for example, in which each candlestick represents one hour. “This gives you an idea of the performance over the last 24 hours of a specific coin that you're trading on this overall market. That's a great way to gauge momentum.” Greenspan notes Coin360.io for its clear week, day, and hour charts.“If things are green over the last hour, two hours, and three hours, it is very likely that they'll continue to go that direction, at least until you see them slowing down or starting to reverse,” said Greenspan, who is the founder of QuantumEconomics.io. “That's even just looking at the numbers and being exposed to it, you're going to get more and more experienced with it.”During 2017, as the Bitcoin price increased to an all-time high of nearly $20,000, Greenspan thought the party might be over when he saw a very large, sudden drop on the chart. It was time to start taking profits.“That was a good indication it's time to take some of that risk off the table,” said Greenspan. He held a webinar in December 2017 about how to take profits and redistribute them into other markets. Greenspan began buying stocks and commodities to get away from crypto. “You'll see [the signals] first in the momentum once things start to turn red,” said Greenspan. “Second of all, you'll see it in the sentiment on social media.” Looking back, Greenspan recalls how the Bitcoin network had become congested. Too many transactions had led to long confirmation times. “Bitcoin was overflowing with activity, and I felt at the time that it might be a good idea to reduce the exposure.” He sold out of Bitcoin at $10,000 per coin. Within about two weeks, it went up to nearly $20,000. During that time, Greenspan felt some ‘Fear of Missing Out’ or ‘FOMO’ for short.“In retrospect, selling was the right thing to do, because 2018 was not such a great year for price,” he reflects. What’s Greenspan seeing today? “All over the social media analysis and social media analysis websites, you can see the halving event is quite prevalent on people's minds,” he said, referring to the reduction of Bitcoin’s block reward, which transpires about every four years. “Anybody writing an article about Bitcoin price is very likely talking about the halving as being a main driver.”  As the US government announces plans for a $6,000,000,000,000 bailout, the halving event becomes all the more significant. “The halving event is a stark reminder of the concept of digital scarcity on which Bitcoin was created,” said Greenspan. “You can have something that is digital and also strictly limited in supply. The halving event is basically a big reminder of it, especially with everybody talking about it all at once.”  How is it going to affect the price in the long term? “As far as the network is concerned, you've got to factor in what the miners are doing, what the full nodes are doing, what the ‘hodlers’ are doing, and what the exchanges are doing. What we can see at the moment is that the halving is one of the driving factors of the market.”"

If they are afraid to go out and spend money in a restaurant, mall, or store because of their own health concerns or those of their family, they will stay at home.Still, there is a saying “when you are a hammer, everything looks like a nail,” and yesterday the Fed took a very big swing with its hammer. The Fed dropped its policy rate by a full percentage point to a range of 0% to 0.25% and promised to inject $700 billion in liquidity through asset purchases.There was some hope that this might work because of the soothing effect of President Trump’s press conference Friday afternoon, which saw the S&P 500 surge 9%, for its best day since 2008.Fool Me OnceUnfortunately these interventions fell on deaf ears.

The FTSE 100 fell 6%, having lost as much as 9% in early trading. Markets fell all across Asia.It is not hard to see why. First, the Fed did not wait for its next scheduled meeting this week, instead choosing to take these actions right away. Second, it dropped the rates down to levels not seen since the Great Recession. The second point is far more consequential, as it suggests that governments are expecting a far bigger shock than almost anyone had anticipated even 2 weeks ago.

Wineries in California are closed. Spain is under lockdown and Germany is closing its borders.Until people feel comfortable enough to come out of hiding, monetary intervention will be largely ineffective.

By backstopping the whole global economy from the lockdowns against the coronavirus we are entering a whole new ball game of an everything everywhere bailout.In the modern world of just in time supply chains, razor thin margins and huge leverage, there is simply no room for the world going offline for 14-90 days.Central bank policy is not designed to cope with such a situation but we will soon find out if the technocrats in charge of global money supply have the necessary Zen to smooth out this extreme bump in the road.The basic idea with the kind of financial maneuvers is this. Imagine a vault with all the money in the world locked up in it. There is a fire and all the money burns. So now all the money is now gone. Everyone is broke, there is no money to pay for food or for that matter anything, so without this money, the world will end. But wait, the central bank runs the money printing press and makes a delivery replacing all the burnt money and puts in a sprinkler system. What now? Nothing has changed, a little money was spent on paper and ink, so the world goes on as if nothing happened. Locking down a large proportion of the productive members of society will remove a percentage of GDP forever but it is only a pinprick in comparison with the assets that drive that GDP. If no companies go bust then they will make up for that loss and over time the negative effects will wash out. The governments and central banks are trying to make this happen.Now a major fear will be a rebirth of high inflation. The global economies will be getting an injection of cash and if it creates demand without a supply increase to match, that will lead to inflation. Many old timers will be thinking of this. It could happen.However, what if demand is not stimulated by this new money and instead demand remains suppressed? Then the new money will drop into savings or deleveraging and there will be deflation. You can’t make people spend, they have to feel good and safe to spend and that will take time. People and companies are just as likely to stash the cash than to splash it.So QE everywhere on everything will create an incredibly difficult challenge for the powers that be. They will have to do an incredibly difficult balancing and, what is more, juggling act.The more likely outcome is recession and deflation with a shocked populace spending months recalibrating their expectations and refusing to come out and spend.This is not what parts of the market thinks. It sees inflation and that is showing itself in bitcoin (BTC), which spiked immediately the Federal Reserve made its intent to buy all and almost any bonds to the moon. Bitcoin is a tiny asset and extremely sensitive to issue effecting “haven” and “flight capital” so once again it is a signal un-muddied by intervention and regulation. The China quarantine story is long over for BTC and now it is the QE story that will be driving the price and fears that inflation is bound to rear its ugly head. Gold will move, too, but slower. There is so much more gold than bitcoin. Inflation fears are endemic among lots of old powerful investors who knew the 1970s and it is natural for them to imagine inflation following every economic disaster. They will gravitate to gold and silver, too. Inflation might come, but it won’t be a chronic issue anytime soon. Supply will be more flexible than demand and keep it at bay in the short term. China is likely to get its production capacity back long before demand resumes in the West. With governments everywhere ready to bridge the gap in the finances of their populations and corporations, it is down to how long the quarantines will last and how much GDP will be lost. The debt to GDP of all countries is going to balloon and it will be that result that will be a key long-term outcome of this disaster. Tacking 20%-30% debt to GDP onto countries’ finances will create interesting situations in a couple of years but how that pans out is hard to guess right now.What people want to know though is where is the bottom of the market. The answer is we are closer to the bottom than the top and possibly within 20% if you want to be righteously pessimistic. However, the Nasdaq is far from its bottom, which is strange and for me a wild card suggesting we need to look out for a small chance of a once in a lifetime final capitulation. The way forward is therefore to either wait for a couple of months until the caravan of shocks has passed, or simply buy a little every now and again when you see a stock so cheap you absolutely cannot resist buying a few.  Averaging in is the most sensible way to proceed.I am averaging in and have perhaps been buying too greedily. Even so, 25% back into stocks doesn’t feel too aggressive...Yet.It remains the ultimate stock market truism that you can’t sell at the top or buy at the bottom but in the end we must try.——Clem Chambers is the CEO of private investors website ADVFN.com and author of 101 Ways to Pick Stock Market Winners and Trading Cryptocurrencies: A Beginner’s Guide.

[+] to build an optimal multi-asset portfolio in this environment.,"The drop in global markets over the past few weeks is forcing Wall Street and leading fund managers to reconsider what truly is an appropriate diversified multi-asset allocation in the current market environment. In our attempt to answer this question, we look beyond basic correlations and consider other non-linear forms of price relationships to help us better understand how to build a multi-asset portfolio with Bitcoin.We are looking at a portfolio made up of the following assets in order to figure out how they have been moving during current sell-off as the Coronavirus epidemic worsens:What we discover is that it is easier to build a diversified portfolio simply by focusing the majority of the portfolio allocation on Bitcoin, SPY, USO and TLT. Since all these assets are inherently US Dollar exposed, adding UUP to the mix would simply increase exposure to the US Dollar. The strength of SPY’s correlation with IWM and EFA suggests an increase in either ETF would simply increase our potential exposure to stocks (which appear to highly correlated globally!) while TLT has a natural obvious price relationship with HYG.Conventional approaches to portfolio construction is built around the concept of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) which assumes that asset allocation should be built around the volatility of assets and their related correlations. Volatility simply measures how much the price change of an asset changes from its average expected change while correlation measures how different assets in a portfolio move together. As an example, if you own Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL) and Citigroup (C) in a 3 stock portfolio with FB (FB) and Apple (AAPL) exhibiting strong positive correlation, MPT would say you should own more of Citigroup (C) to mitigate the high correlation between Facebook (FB) and Apple (AAPL)…assuming the volatilities of each stock were similar. The biggest issue with this approach is that it is backwards looking, meaning it does not consider future returns but rather “assumes” past performance will be indicative of “future performance”.  On top of that, a simple MPT approach favors lower volatility assets; since it is backwards looking, the approach “assumes” a low volatility asset in the past will continue to be a low volatility asset in the future. That is a pretty big assumption! In addition, simple linear relationships do not properly explain how assets might cluster during shocks, like the Coronavirus epidemic we are experiencing at the moment, or just simple clustering in general.A simple correlation analysis points to a rapid rise in “positive” correlations in between Bitcoin, IWM and HYG. Notably, the correlation between IWM and Bitcoin seems the strongest though the relative jump between Bitcoin and HYG is the strongest. A positive correlation simply means that Bitcoin is moving in the same relative direction as both IWM and HYG (when Bitcoin is up, IWM is up, and vice versa). While it is worth noting that correlations between Bitcoin and USO (and great proxy for oil and commodities in general) and EFA (international stocks proxy), there hasn’t been a material uptick in the cross-sectional correlations of the other assets in our target multi-asset portfolio. In other words, while the sensitivity of other assets in our target multi-asset portfolio remain more or less the same, Bitcoin appears to have a heightened sensitivity. There is probably a US Dollar effect in play here though correlations between UUP and Bitcoin have not markedly increase. The US Dollar effect on Bitcoin is probably worthy of its own standalone article!Correlation analysis of assets in Q.ai target multi-asset portfolio that includes Bitcoin. ... [+] Correlation analysis is based on price moves from February 20, 2020 through March 20, 2020While correlation and volatility analysis is useful, we do not think alone it helps to build truly “robustly diversified” portfolios. The limitations of MPT is that it’s analysis is purely linear and backwards looking in general but, in reality, markets are anything but linear...and past performance is never a useful predictor of future returns. As a result, we like to use clustering techniques based on artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies to see if we can discover more interesting and non-linear relationships that a basic correlation-volatility matrix might miss.For our analysis, we use a basic Affinity Propagation algorithm. The ease of use with Affinity propagation is that while it is a centroid algorithm, it is does not require us to estimate the number of clusters like other similar algorithms such as K-Means. What we are looking to see if how the different assets in our target multi-asset portfolio “cluster”.Outside of tight clustering between SPY, EFA and IWM, we do not observe other examples of clustering in our target multi-asset portfolio over the past month. As expected, we see the strength in relationship between BTC and HYG increasing over the past month. Previously, the relationship between both BTC and HYG would be described as nominal at best. The relationships between SPY, IWM and EFA are relatively strong but what is more interesting is that there are no other significant relationships between the other assets in our target portfolio and Bitcoin – this is a major deviation from what our correlation analysis implied. Analysis of clustering of assets in Q.ai target multi-asset portfolio that includes Bitcoin. The ... [+] methodology that is used is Affinity Propagation. Price data is for the period February 20, 2020 through March 20, 2020.As a result, based on our analysis of both correlations and how different assets in our target portfolio cluster, we think it makes the most sense to focus the majority of the portfolio allocations on Bitcoin, SPY, USO and TLT. Since IWM and EFA both have high correlations with SPY at this time, allocating between the 3 becomes a nominal exercise though SPY will offer better diversification vis-à-vis USO and Bitcoin."

(Photo by Omar ... [+] Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)","The crypto market experienced one of it’s worst days in history with a nearly 50% one-day drop in the price of bitcoin. Economic uncertainties from the coronavirus pandemic and liquidity crunches have caused massive selloffs of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Alt coins and DeFi platforms are experiencing similar issues as well. Not all hope is lost however. A downturn like this presents unique tax saving opportunities, especially in the cryptocurrency space. A brief lesson in the tax code could help you save thousands — or more — when you file your 2020 taxes.It is extremely important to know that, claiming losses for tax purposes is different than having a loss in your portfolio. In most cases, the tax code only allows you to deduct realized losses.It is likely that most of your cryptocurrency positions are in the red. For tax purposes, you can not deduct mere decrease in market value of your positions because they are unrealized. When you sell your position, these losses become realized and you can deduct the losses on your taxes.For example, let’s say David bought 1 bitcoin (BTC) at $10,000 on January 15, 2020. On March 11, 2020, the price of BTC drops to $3,000. In financial terms, he has lost $7,000 worth of value. However, from tax point of view, even though he has lost $7,000 worth of value, he has not realized this loss because he has not sold the position yet. If he were to keep this position without selling, he would NOT be able to deduct any losses for tax purposes despite having a financial loss. Converting unrealized losses into realized losses allows David to get a deduction when he files his 2020 taxes. In order to realize his losses, he simply  has to sell his positions that are at a loss. He also has an option to buy back into the same positions at a much lower price (without compromising the ability deduct losses) because wash sale rules are not applicable to cryptocurrencies under current guidance. Some crypto tax software helps you harvest tax losses. Realizing some of your losses is super important to offset unexpected capital gains arising from margin liquidations. If you are a margin trader, it is likely that your initial margin has been liquidated due to large swings in prices. If you are trading on high leverage, even slight market fluctuations can trigger liquidations, and may result in capital gains taxes.For example, assume Jennet deposited 1 BTC into her margin account on February 10, 2020,  when the price of BTC was $9,000. She originally obtained this BTC in 2010 at a price of $1,000. She sets the leverage to be 5X so her notional buying power is 5 BTC (1 BTC x 5) or $45,000 ($9,000 x 5). Let’s say Jennet  goes long on ether with her full notional value of $45,000. At 5X leverage, if the $45,000 position goes down by 20% (notional value down to $36,000) her initial 1 BTC deposit will be liquidated by the exchange.Assuming the BTC price is $9,000 at the time of the liquidation, she would end up having to pay taxes on $8,000 ($9,000 - $1,000) of capital gains. This is a tricky situation where Jennet actually owes capital gains taxes despite losing her investment. Under the tax code, you can claim a maximum of $3,000 of capital losses on your tax return. However, the good news is that losses in excess of $3,000 can be carried forward indefinitely to future years. These losses can be used to offset future gains arising from crypto and stock transactions. To get advantage of this provision you need to realize your losses as explained above. Knowing these simple tricks and executing them before the end of the year can help you get significant tax relief when you file for taxes. For the most part, the tax code only cares about your realized losses, not your real world loss in economic value. Use this to your advantage to reduce your taxes.Disclaimer: this post is informational only and is not intended as tax advice. For tax advice, please consult a tax professional."

However, the technologists who have been working with and developing blockchain since it first debuted in 2008 have likely long realized that the advance in software architecture that it represents has long-lasting implications far beyond cryptocurrency.Today, we are beginning to see some of those implications come to life. Across industries and verticals, many business leaders have realized that blockchain has massive potential to upend and streamline supply chain operations. As the executive vice president of growth and delivery at a company that offers blockchain services, I believe the supply chain is ripe for blockchain disruption -- from back-end inventory management processes all the way to front-end customer experiences.Why Supply Chain?Before we delve into some of the most innovative ways companies are using blockchain, it’s worth revisiting how we got to where we are today.Blockchain eliminates the need for many third-party intermediaries that exist to ensure the security and authenticity of a transaction. This lends itself quite well to cryptocurrency. Financial transactions between multiple parties are securely facilitated through blockchain’s transparent, verifiable and immutable ledger, which allows users to bypass banks, credit card companies and other traditional financial institutions. Essentially, blockchain is a way for two or more parties who don’t know or trust each other to directly transact with more confidence.A supply chain is a series of transactions between multiple parties, including manufacturing, procurement, wholesale, retail, inventory, shipping, stores, consumers and so on. With many organizations, countries and regulations involved, I've noticed that these transactions have traditionally suffered from a lack of transparency. This is inefficient at best and potentially dangerous for consumers at worst.As such, there’s a huge potential for blockchain to introduce a more efficient way for supply chain ecosystems to record and share information.Blockchain In The Real WorldWith that understanding, we can take a look at some real-world examples of how blockchain is changing business as usual for supply chain operations.Ethical SourcingWhat do farm-to-table, a social movement that has spawned a new generation of eateries, and blockchain, a deeply complex technology related to software architecture, have in common? The practice of ethically sourcing ingredients by tracking the journey from where they originate (farm) to where they end up (table) is actually the perfect use case for blockchain.In fact, Starbucks recently announced a blockchain system to track its beans from “farm to cup.” Blockchain will give consumers access to details on where their beans were sourced and roasted, while growers will be able to see data around where their products ends up.Product RecallsLimited visibility into where products have been and when can be hugely detrimental when people’s health and safety are at risk. Whether it’s a defective infant car seat or contaminated spinach at the grocery store, retailers need to know exactly where in the supply chain the contamination or defect occurred in order to remove dangerous products from the market and identify other affected products.Walmart was one of the first retailers to implement blockchain for its live food business (paywall), and others like Danone are following suit with blockchain systems to track food provenance.Fraud Prevention From fine wines to designer handbags, fraud runs rampant in the market for luxury goods. Counterfeit wines alone could account for billions of dollars of false products, according to one expert's estimate; there was even a Netflix documentary made about one man’s ability to swindle the most elite wine collectors in the world for millions of dollars over many years.This type of fraud likely wouldn’t be possible using blockchain. By borrowing from Starbucks’ “farm to cup” initiative, it’s easy to see how winemakers could translate this into a similar “vineyard to glass” blockchain-based supply chain to ensure the integrity of each bottle’s contents. Companies like EY are reportedly building blockchain platforms to make this possible.Across luxury retail goods, RFID tags and sensors can effectively and veritably track the production of handbags, clothes, shoes and other goods to ensure their brand integrity, mirroring the degree of supply chain visibility described above. This could become increasingly important with the rise of e-commerce sites for second-hand luxury goods, such as Depop or The RealReal; sellers can show their goods are actually from the brands they claim, and buyers can rest assured that they are getting what they paid for.Smart contracts, one of the first use cases for blockchain, certainly applies here as well. Smart contracts fulfill payment agreements one step at a time and don't move forward to the next step until the previous step has been verified. For example, a consumer purchases a Prada handbag secondhand. Their payment is held until the package has been noted on the blockchain ledger as shipped from the seller. With this immutable digital footprint, it would be much more difficult to deceive consumers.Looking ForwardBlockchain could potentially eliminate the fraud problem plaguing the luxury goods sector, and companies could apply it more broadly throughout the retail environment to streamline supply chain operations with increased transparency. We have, however, only begun to scratch the surface of blockchain’s potential. Cost and scale currently pose some of the biggest challenges in implementing blockchain on a widespread basis for retail, though as sidechain technology becomes more sophisticated, we may begin to address the challenges related to scale.These are just some of the use cases for how blockchain can be applied to improve supply chain operations. Through a single, verifiable, immutable and open record of each movement in the supply chain, blockchain can provide an uncorrupted and comprehensive view of a product’s journey from start to finish, across countries, through different organizations, and into the hands of consumers."

The U.S. dollar has taken a beating, however, dropping almost 4% against a basket of currencies this week—its biggest weekly loss since the height of the global financial crisis over 10 years ago.The U.S. dollar has sunk against a basket of major currencies this week after posting record gains ... [+] earlier this month. Some think the massive stimulus offered by the Trump administration and the Federal Reserve will undermine the dollar and open the door to alternatives such as bitcoin. This week's losses come on the back of the dollar index's biggest weekly gain since the financial crisis, with the dollar surging as investors scrambled for the world’s most liquid currency amid crashing stock and debt markets. ""In short-term, huge dollar demand because short-covering, but it won't last,"" Wall Street veteran and founder of Wyoming-based crypto bank Avanti, Caitlin Long, said via Twitter, adding she expects the U.S. Federal Reserve's balance sheet to top $10 trillion before the coronavirus crisis is over and predicting the dollar's eventual crash.On top the of the massive economic aid package, the Fed has been working hard to prop up plunging markets—with mixed results despite its shock-and-awe firepower.Potential risks of the combined cross-party rescue bill and Fed's biggest-ever bazooka include out-of-control inflation, the dollar's displacement as the world's funding currency, and the complete destabilization of the U.S. financial system. The Fed has pumped over $1 trillion to the system in recent weeks, with its chair Jerome Powell promising never before seen levels of money printing and so-called quantitative easing to infinity through an unlimited bond-buying program. The Fed has also cut its benchmark interest rate to near zero and made sure commercial banks will continue lending to companies, cities and states—all told the extraordinary measures are expected to grow the Fed's balance sheet by $4.5 trillion this year. Throughout and in the aftermath of the global financial crisis the Fed grew its balance sheet by a paltry $3.7 trillion.""The beautiful thing about our country is $6.2 trillion—because it is 2.2 plus four [combining the Fed's action and the cross-party rescue bill]—it’s $6.2 trillion, and we can handle that easily because of who we are, what we are,"" Trump said, speaking after the bill's historic White House signing ceremony, and boasting the package was ""twice as large"" as any prior relief bill.The bill will see individuals and companies whose livelihoods and businesses have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic receive direct payments, with every American earning less than $75,000 per year picking up a one off payment of $1,200, as well as $500 per child.""It’s our money; we are the ones, it’s our currency,"" Trump said.

One of the most unfortunate ones is censorship of the Internet.NetBlocks, a “civil society group working at the intersection of digital rights, cyber-security and internet governance”, reported on strange Internet outages in Wuhan during certain nights when the COVID-19 epidemic was starting to gather steam. The Farsi version of Wikipedia was blocked for about 24 hours in Iran.VPN company Surfshark reported that its VPN infrastructure in Iran was seeing a dropoff of 50% in connection rate after the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 13th. Their cybersecurity advisor Naomi Hedges claims “that since 13 March - when [COVID-19] was labeled as a pandemic - Surfshark's connection rates in Iran have dropped by 50%. Meanwhile, our website traffic from Iran has decreased fivefold of its usual rate. Before the announcement, we haven't experienced notable fluctuations in Iran's connectivity rates, so the numbers indicate the increased attempts to censor the internet.”It comes amid reports that China too is clamping on access to the Internet outside the Great Firewall, with VPN providers and connections under strain. Chinese social media networks such as WeChat have also been reported to have censored COVID-19 related terms since December 31st — in a notable incident, Dr. Li Wenliang was censured by the Wuhan police for posting about COVID-19 in a private WeChat group. This is a threat that many cryptocurrency and Bitcoin advocates are aware of. The Internet itself is a protocol Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies depend on in order to communicate data. If the Internet is shut down or content within it is filtered/blocked, peers within a certain country would not be able to communicate with one another effectively. If content is being censored or tracked, cryptocurrency miners and peers within a country could see their connectivity attempts to the global network be denied, effectively shuttering their ability to transact and to get the global status of the Bitcoin network. It’s why Blockstream has tried to diversify away Bitcoin from its dependency on an uncensored Internet by launching a satellite network that broadcasts data from the Bitcoin blockchain and any other data people choose to pay to upload through the Lightning Network. This makes the cost of censoring Bitcoin and other information more expensive: nation-states go from needing to cut off domestic broadband communications to having to deploy kinetic force in space — an option few countries have access to, and which would be politically unenvious even for the boldest of political leaders. Beyond just the blunt question of on/off censorship however, cryptocurrencies and their relationship to the Internet at large pose interesting dilemmas. As central banks look more and more at digitizing their currencies and the legal attitude towards digital privacy is being redefined by COVID-19, broad changes may threaten Centralized digital currencies will have access to lots of metadata associated per each account, including possible location data, that can be tracked and compiled. This may be necessary in a pandemic, but in general, governments who gain hard-fought emergency powers are loath to return them. The post-9/11 period saw a spate of renewals of the authorization of military force and Patriot Act, stretched to give cover to different government powers until reform only came more than a decade later. This fact led Edward Snowden to warn that “temporary” surveillance powers may well outlast the COVID-19 pandemic. As governments look to respond to COVID-19, some will look to censor the Internet and some will look to use digital tools to track their population during the crisis period, perhaps with long-lasting consequences. Both have the potential for abuse, and both pose different but ever-present threats for cryptocurrencies and our liberty at large. "

Bakkt has been bolstered by Microsoft's M12, PayU, Boston Consulting Group, Goldfinch Partners, CMT Digital, Pantera Capital and Intercontinental Exchange, the latter being its parent company.Bakkt was touted to be a big turning point in the evolution and uptake of cryptocurrency for the traditional and institutional investors. The company began its journey some two years ago with the first year focused primarily on achieving solid regulatory approval.The platform allows for Futures trading on the price of Bitcoin with the notable exception being that the payout from such contracts is done in Bitcoin, rather than cash such as is done at CME.“Bakkt launched two years ago with the vision of building trust in and unlocking the value of digital assets for institutions and consumers alike,” newly appointed Bakkt CEO Mike Blandina wrote. “Since then, we have been focused on delivering that vision. In 2019 we helped launch the first end-to-end regulated market for Bitcoin and an institutional bitcoin custody offering too.”Part of the plans for this new injection of funding at Bakkt is the launch of a cryptocurrency exchange app due to be released in the Summer. In order to assist this move, ICE had recently acquired Alpharetta-based Bridge2 Solutions, a provider of loyalty solutions for merchants and consumers, which was then acquired by Bakkt. It was earlier speculated that Bakkt would use Bridge2 Solutions technology to design a platform that would allow users to cash in and trade loyalty program points for Bitcoin and cash. It appears that this could well be the idea, according to Blandina’s description of the new Bakkt app.“Bakkt gives users control over their digital assets. Whether it’s miles from your favorite airline, loyalty points from the local grocery store, or Bitcoin you’ve purchased, the Bakkt app enables you to aggregate all of these assets into a single digital wallet,” The CEO wrote. “In just a few taps you can use those assets to shop at your favorite merchants, send them to family and friends, or convert them to cash. We believe that you hold more value than you realize and we’re here to help you track, spend, and send your digital assets however you want.”The current market conditions are of course not very amenable to any sort of investment or growth as the stocks, gold, and other commodities including Bitcoin have shed masses of value. This has seen many investors, especially of the institutional nature, pull away from any sort of investing, and leaving platforms like Bakkt and CEM — with regards to their cryptocurrency offerings — wondering when normality will return.It is a market of great fear, and there is high volatility which is also driving investors away. However, the offering from Bakkt, and the investment in the platform, is clearly one more focused on long term usage. “We have the unique opportunity to leverage the technology, infrastructure and partners across our businesses to bring innovative new products to market and in doing so expand access to the global economy,” Blandina wrote."

(Photo by Ernesto Ruscio/Getty Images)","China is rightfully being blamed for its slow reaction when COVID-19 was first discovered. The government was afraid of being perceived as weak, incompetent, and untrustworthy, and the rest of the world is now paying the price.That said, China also deserves praise, and perhaps even a degree of awe, for how it clamped down the city of Wuhan and Hubei province, preventing a truly global calamity.  Still, the virus spread, and now the onus is on the western world to prevent a global pandemic. However, most do not have the means or inclination to completely lock down a state, province, or nation the scale of Hubei. Plus, they are afraid to sacrifice their western values of open borders, free flow of goods and people, and even democracy. At least right now.And this is bad for Bitcoin. What are You Prepared to Do?There is a famous scene between Sean Connery and Kevin Costner in The Untouchables when Costner’s Elliot Ness tells Connery’s Jim Malone that he wants to get Al Capone. It ends with Malone telling the wet-behind-the-ears Ness that getting someone like Capone requires pulling out all the stops and pressing the limits of the law, because “they won’t give up the fight until one of you is dead.”There are some interesting parallels between Mr. Ness and the west, who are trying to do this “by the book”.The most obvious place to look is Italy, the most effected country outside of China. It recently locked-down the entire country after its quarantine in the north proved ineffective. However, citizens can still travel to work, go food shopping, and even eat at restaurants. While the measure has certainly limited people on the streets, it is also a half-measure.Other Nations Are Reluctant to FollowIn the U.S. there is talk of financial packages to eliminate the payroll tax, subsidize shale producers, and protect hourly workers from lost wages. Several states has declared states of emergency to unlock public health funds. At the same time, President Trump and the White House continue to stress that the administration is responding well to the crisis.WASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 10: President Donald Trump talks to reporters at the US Capitol after ...

(Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images)Scaling out, central bankers and policymakers from around the world met recently to discuss ways to synchronize fiscal measures and stimulus packages.They don’t have many options given that interest rates remain at or near all-time lows, so the hope is that these measures will buy some time to combat the virus.It is a pretty big bet, and not one that is guaranteed to succeed. After all, this crisis is not demand driven, but the result of a supply shock. It does not matter how much money people have if they cannot spend it on anything.Implications for the Bitcoin PriceIn the short term we may see the price of Bitcoin rise. After Monday’s massive sell-off, equities markets rebounded on Tuesday in response to the expectations of further interest rate reductions and fiscal measures. It also appears that former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden is maintaining his momentum in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, which will further soothe markets.Why does this help Bitcoin? Well, COVID-19 has shaken Bitcoin’s narrative as a stable store of value, at least for the time being. Where the price of U.S. Treasuries and Gold are reaching all-time highs in price and lows in yield, Bitcoin is behaving more like traditional equities.However, in the long-term Bitcoin appears to be vulnerable if these half-measures proposed by western governments do not succeed and markets continue to fall. Given the fact that we still do not know everything about how the virus is transmitted and people are still allowed to congregate in large crowds across the U.S. and E.U., we may still far from the end of this crisis.PHILADELPHIA, PA - MARCH 10: Nate Thompson #44 of the Philadelphia Flyers skates with the puck as ...

This could lead to some difficult questions, because in this highly polarized world many people do not trust what they are hearing from their elected leaders.Nevertheless, governments may be forced to belatedly take more draconian measures a-la-China. In this case we should all hope they work, but they could also turn into a pyrrhic victory for the governments. People may lose faith in their ability to protect constituents, and they will likely have lived through yet another period of qualitative easing and loose monetary policy.At some point they may look for alternatives that take certain policy decisions out of government hands, such as Bitcoin."

Mohammad, sometimes called ""Mr. Dark,"" has been accused of operating Dark Scandals, websites that featured violent rape videos and depictions of child pornography. According to court pleadings, Mohammad was the administrator of the DarkScandals Sites, which he began operating in or about 2012. The sites were available on the darknet (""DarkScandals Darknet"") and the clearnet (""DarkScandals Clearnet""). The dark web, also referred to as ""darknet,"" refers to content that you don't typically access through regular internet browsing activities. A ""clearnet"" website is accessible using traditional web browsers like Internet Explorer; these websites use traditional designations like "".com"" or "".co.""Users of these sites rely on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to pay for services because they offer the illusion of anonymity. However, it is often possible to determine the identity of an individual involved in these transactions through several different tools. The DarkScandals Darknet and DarkScandals Clearnet sites were virtually identical. They largely offered the same service: directing customers on how to obtain obscene content, including videos that depicted sexual assault and child pornography. Specifically, the sites boasted over 2,000 videos and images, and advertised ""real blackmail, rape and forced videos of girls all around the world.""Users could either pay for the videos using cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, or upload new videos to add to the Dark Scandals sites. The Dark Scandals sites included specific rules for the video uploads to the websites, which included ""real rape/forced"" content, and stated a preference for ""own made material."" The site expressly forbade ""fake, amateur…or acted movies,"" and would reject content if it did not portray real sexual violence. A quick word of warning: the indictment (downloads as a PDF) contains language and descriptions that may be disturbing. In fact, Don Fort, Chief, IRS Criminal Investigation, declared, ""The types of crimes described in this indictment are the most disgusting I've encountered in 30 years of law enforcement. It is a special kind of evil to prey on and profit from the pain of others.""""Darknet sites that profit from rape and the sexual exploitation of children are among the most vile and reprehensible forms of criminal behavior,"" said U.S. Attorney Timothy J. Shea. ""This Office will not allow predators to use lawless online spaces as a shield. We are firmly committed to working closely with our partners in the Netherlands and around the world to bring to justice the perpetrators of these abhorrent crimes.""According to the forfeiture complaint (downloads as PDF), law enforcement was able to trace payments of bitcoin and ethereum to the Dark Scandals site by following the flow of funds on the blockchain. The 303 virtual currency accounts identified in the complaint were allegedly used by customers across the world to fund the website and promote the exploitation of the victims.Mohammad allegedly received almost two million dollars from selling this obscene and illicit content, and the complaint seeks to recover these funds and return the illegal funds to victims of the crime. The complaint also seeks to forfeit the previously seized website domains associated with DarkScandals.The charges against Mohammad include various counts of Distribution of Child Pornography, Production and Transportation of Obscene Matters for Sale or Distribution, Engaging in the Business of Selling or Transferring Obscene Matter, and Laundering of Monetary Instruments.The charges come months after the largest dark web child pornography site was taken down. According to the IRS-CI, agents became aware of that site, Welcome to Video, because of their work on previous dark web marketplaces. As a result of the investigations, Jong Woo Son, 23, a South Korean national, was indicted by a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia for operating the site. Son was sentenced to 18 months in prison in Korea; he still faces charges in the United States. Additionally, in that case, 337 site users residing in 23 states and Washington, D.C., as well as the United Kingdom, South Korea, Germany, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the Czech Republic, Canada, Ireland, Spain, Brazil, and Australia were arrested and charged. The Dark Scandals investigation was jointly investigated by the IRS-CI (Washington, D.C.) and Homeland Security Investigations (Colorado Springs and The Hague). The Dutch National Police of the Netherlands, Europol, and the German Federal Criminal Police (the Bundeskriminalamt) provided assistance and coordinated with their parallel investigations.Chief Fort noted, about the investigation, ""Criminals should know if you leave a digital footprint, we will find you. If you exploit our children, we will put you behind bars. If you thought you were anonymous, think again. The dark web is not quite as dark today due to the hard work of IRS-CI and our partner agencies."""

and ...","Mar 9, 2020,09:00am EDT",2020 IRS Virtual Currency Summit,"On Tuesday March 3, 2020, the IRS held an invite-only Virtual Currency Summit at the IRS headquarters in Washington DC. This event included stakeholders in the crypto community such as exchanges, crypto tax software companies, tax practitioners, crypto advocacy groups. The event consisted of four 90-minute panels and Q&A with attendees. The purpose of the event was to learn more about the crypto industry and compliance challenges. This post highlights some of the discussion items specifically related to crypto taxes. It is a common misconception that Bitcoin is anonymous. Actually, bitcoin is quite traceable. In fact, the event opened with the IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig highlighting a new indictment against two individuals who laundered $100M of stolen crypto. To bring the case forward, the IRS Criminal Investigation division used tools like Chainanalysis to track the funds of the defendants across 113 wallets and exchanges. The IRS is increasingly paying attention to where users are storing their crypto.“We have no idea where the dollar bill in your pocket was before you had it. We know EXACTLY where your Bitcoin was before you got it.""— IRS Cryptocurrency tax eventGiven the traceability efforts the IRS is taking and increased cryptocurrency revenue flowing in, expect to see more IRS cryptocurrency cases.One of the IRS agents who contributed to the very first crypto tax guidance, Notice 2014-21, noted that the “property” classification of cryptocurrency is causing a lot of confusion. In 2014, property classification made sense — the cryptocurrency space was basically synonymous with bitcoin at the time. However since then, the number of cryptocurrencies and types of use cases have increased considerably (e.g. Ether, stablecoins, decentralized finance, lending, thousands of new coins, etc.). The IRS is fully aware of the evolution in the industry, and acknowledged this general “property” treatment may not be suitable for all cryptocurrency instruments like stable coins and other crypto related derivatives. There was also discussion about how various regulators are classifying cryptocurrency in different ways. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) treats some tokens as securities, the Commodities Futures and Trading Commision (CFTC) believes that some cryptocurrencies are commodities, and the IRS is taxing cryptocurrencies as property.An attendee brought up the proliferation of cryptocurrency tax calculators in the past year or so.  Many of these software claim to be accurate, though an informal study done by Coindesk found that each platform provided different results with the same input data. Taxpayers need to be careful when choosing a reputable crypto tax solution. In particular they should pay attention to whether there are endorsements from cryptocurrency exchanges, accounting firms, and users.The IRS proposed a Central Depositary (CD) to help improve cryptocurrency tax compliance. The idea is to have all the cryptocurrency exchanges transmit all user transactions and crypto activity to this CD so regulators have access to it if/when needed. However, both Coinbase and Kraken representatives pushed back on this proposal due to high security and privacy risks.Tax practitioners raised several questions regarding the new cryptocurrency question added on the Schedule 1 (Form 1040). There is a lot of confusion about what precisely this question covers because the instructions are very limited. For example, it is unclear what is covered under the “financial interest” category of the question. An American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) panelist discussed their latest comment letter to the IRS on cryptocurrency taxes. In particular, the panel discussed cryptocurrency donations. Crypto donations are subject to non-cash property donation rules. Generally, if you donate a crypto asset and deduct more than $5,000, the IRS requires that you use a “qualified appraiser”. However, there is no certification nor specific set of rules that explain what a “qualified” appraiser is for cryptocurrency. Additionally, unlike traditional physical property, cryptocurrency property (primarily bitcoin) is highly liquid with spot pricing easily available to anyone with an internet connection. The AICPA suggests that crypto donations should not be subject to qualified appraisals; they should be treated similarly to publicly traded stocks for which qualified appraisals are not needed. Overall, this event shows the IRS’s ongoing effort to learn more about the industry and related compliance challenges. These discussions with various stakeholders in the crypto community will have a significant impact on future tax guidance issued by the IRS.Disclaimer: this post is informational only and is not intended as tax advice.

The assembled fund has been touted as a “rescue package” for startups and blockchain companies that are treading water while the economic crisis plays out.The pair have pledged $10M so far, with a further $50-100M available if required. At present, the funding is limited to businesses that meet the following requirements:1. Must be in operation with a founding team in place that has fixed monthly expenses.2. Must have raised previous round(s) of funding.3. Must have an updated pitch deck.“There is a lot of talk of big stimulus and even helicopter-style money drops,” explains Yossi Hasson. “But it’s evident that neither the banks nor the government will be stepping in to assist entrepreneurs as their focus is on big corporations. We’re also hearing that VCs are re-negotiating terms and of delays in providing capital.”The fund aims to help companies with recurring monthly expenses to survive—until more favorable conditions exist. Neuner has been quite vocal about the U.S. Federal Reserve’s $2.2 trillion stimulus draft bill and the economic conditions facing the world.Ran NeunerUS handouts may result in a massive bitcoin price surgeRecently, the U.S. government admitted that bitcoin had the potential to undermine the U.S. dollar's status as the world’s reserve currency. Yet, the Fed’s $2.2 trillion coronavirus stimulus plan may threaten the very foundations of the U.S. currency and could drive bitcoin prices to all-time new highs.In response to the Fed’s move, Jimmy Song, a blockchain programming instructor, and lecturer at the University of Texas said on Twitter:Jimmy SongThe Fed’s move stands for everything that bitcoin is against—inflation, the printing of money and centralization. With bitcoin, there are only 21 million coins that can ever exist. That means if the world is undergoing times of financial hardship, as the case of now, then 2.2 trillion bitcoins cannot be printed. And, this is what the Fed is intending to do with the U.S. currency.Mike Novogratz said, “If there was ever a time—debasement of fiat currencies, monetization of trillions of dollars of debt, this is the time for bitcoin.” With the much-anticipated bitcoin halving event around the corner, bitcoin bulls are waiting to see if the price of bitcoin hits all-time new highs as many such as Tim Draper predict."

[+] hearing in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Thursday, June 22, 2017. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg","Author’s note: Just four hours after the publication of this article, the Federal Reserve has in fact made an unscheduled rate cut to zero percent and said it would restart quantitative easing, essentially placing American monetary policy in a liquidity trap. A liquidity trap is perhaps best summed up in this quote by Paul Krugman: “a situation in which conventional monetary policies have become impotent, because nominal interest rates are at or near zero [...]”, a quote that sums up what’s happening with US and generally, monetary policy around the world. When nominal interest rate targeting, the preferred mechanism of central banks including the Federal Reserve nears zero, monetary policy can no longer move the needle effectively — you can’t really go to negative numbers without there being unforeseen consequences (though certainly, there are a few central banks who are trying). In response, central banks are either stuck on the sidelines, or they have to resort to a wide array of unconventional monetary policies: quantitative easing and the addition of financial assets directly to its balance sheet being the tool of choice for the Federal Reserve, while the European Central Bank has already been aggressively working on how to implement negative interest rates. Both are also likely to signal further actions or rate cuts before they take place and they may even create cash assets without any corresponding entry in the balance sheet. The Fed Funds target rate is between 1% to 1.25% now, with an effective Fed Funds rate of about 1.1%. This was decreased from the original 1.5% - 1.75% target rate change in an emergency unscheduled rate change after the worst one-day percentage selloff of stocks since 2008 (since then, the Dow Jones has recorded an even worse one-day percentage selloff than any period since 2008). As a result, the Federal Reserve is taking other steps to provide liquidity to the markets, including providing liquidity for repo operations. While these are in the vein of conventional open market monetary operations, the level of aggression on them is something we haven’t really seen from the Fed for a few years. JPMorgan has projected that the Fed will look to lower rates to the 0%-0.25% range, the lowest since 2015. This would happen at or before the March 17th - 18th policy meeting where the Fed usually rolls out its interest rate decision/monetary policy determination. With its earlier unscheduled rate cut announcement, the Federal Reserve has shown a determination to be aggressively proactive against what it sees as contagion from the effects of COVID-19 and market prices. At that point, unless the Fed aggressively embraces negative interest rates or other unconventional monetary policies as it did during 2008, it will be stuck in a classic liquidity trap. This has implications on inflation levels in the future and how individuals and businesses will think about saving money — we may see a repeat of the post-2009 period. So, if the Fed is close to a liquidity trap and may be close to restarting unconventional monetary operations, what exactly does that mean for cryptocurrencies?It’s important to note that skepticism about monetary policy is one of the rationales behind Satoshi creating Bitcoin in the first place. The genesis block of Bitcoin refers to the brink of a second bailout of banks from the United Kingdom — though this is fiscal policy, it speaks to the general weakness of the central bank-supported banking system. Since its earliest days, Bitcoin seemed posed as a counter-example for central banks who had embraced inflationary policies to solve policy issues. Bitcoin posited a strict cycle of value creation that would resist many attempts to arbitrarily decide value by algorithmically determining when blocks would be mined and imposing an upper limit. By using a decentralized network of miners and peers, the system was designed to be less dependent and more decentralized than its central-bank propped consensus, which is a largely homogenous mixture of structure and policy that defined the post-WW2 economy. Cryptocurrencies have clustered around this new consensus, with most adapting many of the key principles of Bitcoin, if not their exact expression. Through the course of its short almost decade-long life, Bitcoin has now become an institutional force, and this ironically has given it exposure to the very force it was seeking to counter. Stacked as another portfolio option among many in good times, seen as a “spicier” version of gold, perhaps, Bitcoin and the cryptocurrencies it is a gateway to are now, for better or for worse, tied to larger market forces. This means unpredictability as institutional and retail investors start weighting towards the backing they feel safest in when it comes to a financial crisis: government fiat. Investors have poured into the US dollar, Treasures, and government debt regarded as safe, because they come with the full backing and faith of the existing system. Meanwhile, “risky” assets are being shed by people with a short-term view: cryptocurrencies, facing government scrutiny rather than any backing at all, would fare especially poorly in such a comparison.So in the short-term, it’s likely that cryptocurrency prices will be very volatile, and possibly tending to the downside. Interestingly, if the Federal Reserve decides once again to fill its balance sheets with financial assets like it did during rounds of quantitative easing, this short-term effect will likely be replaced with a surge in asset prices, including cryptocurrencies. This, however, is not the most important effect. Short-term price fluctuations will let long-term thinkers fill the gap if they choose. And it’s clear, given how central banks are currently reacting, that the conventional financial system is quickly running out of conventional options and is in a precarious spot with a crisis that is not so correlated with monetary policy. This shows the need to store value in a diverse and heterogenous way: as a hedge, perhaps, or even as a potential replacement for the vast majority of financial instruments. After all, the COVID-19 pandemic has already forced many to work from home, and shown the perils of global crises treated by individual countries and individual stores of value. The long-term horizon for cryptocurrencies and the need for them should not be dampened by short-term price fluctuations — but instead be inspired into an examination of the founding principles within cryptocurrencies and why they mattered in the first place.

On Ethereum",https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2020/03/25/trillion-dollar-stimulus-jumpstarts-project-to-issue-central-bank-currency-on-ethereum/,"Inspired by bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology that lets

[+] Printing on March 24, 2015. In the future, digital versions of the dollar could be issued on the ethereum blockchain and other similar platforms.","Digital dollars exploded into mainstream headlines earlier this week. As the U.S. House of Representatives scrambled to craft a draft bill that would authorize trillions of dollars in payments to “consumers, states, businesses, and vulnerable populations during the COVID-19 emergency” it introduced the digital dollar concept that could potentially let the Federal Reserve, responsible for printing U.S. dollars, send stimulus money directly to individuals.Inspired by bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology that lets individuals send value to each other without any middlemen, the concept had been percolating behind the scenes in blockchain skunk works for months when millions of people around the world saw first hand evidence of how the technology could impact them personally. Why give the money to banks and hope it trickles down, if the intended recipients are actual citizens?A previously scheduled meeting at blockchain consortium Hyperledger, about a new project called eThaler using the ethereum blockchain to create a central bank digital currency (CBDC), took on new meaning, and urgency. Until the bill, sponsored by California Congresswoman and chair of the House Financial Services Committee, Maxine Waters, mentioned the use of digital dollars, their benefits were largely theoretical. Now, all of a sudden, there was a very clear use.Such a prominent mention of digital dollars in a House bill, in relation to the Federal Reserve, means that the largest economy in the world has officially entered what is an increasingly heated race between a number of advanced projects at central banks around the world to be the first to issue this new kind of currency. “The concept of the CBDC seems to have gotten an imprimatur from the house finance committee,” said Vipin Bharathan, 59, chair of the Hyperledger identity working group, and a former senior developer at JP Morgan Chase, speaking at the meeting. “That’s a significant step, and I argue that such crisis situations always produce new ideas, and acceptance of new ideas, that will live on long after the coronavirus has burned through the world.”At the time of publication, an estimated 21,000 people had died from the COVID-19 globally, resulting in countless business closures, and wiping out billions of dollars in wealth. While it seems unlikely that any of the digital dollar projects currently in the works would be ready in time to transmit the trillions dollars being sought by the Congress, eThaler is a great example of the race to accommodate law-makers’ increasingly opened minds.Another bill, offered by California Democrat and Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi and other democrats, originally also included the “digital dollar” language, which was stripped shortly after it started circulating in media reports. Earlier today, the Senate approved a $2.2 trillion stimulus package, without mention of a digital dollar, now awaiting a vote by the House.First conceived earlier this year, eThaler gets its name from the thaler, a silver coin used throughout Europe for hundreds of years, from which the word “dollar” is derived. A group of professionals from consulting firms Accenture and InfoSys and the Itau Bank in Brazil, have been working on the open-source project in their free time for the past six months to explore the future of central bank currency issued on a blockchain.The token-issuance system will comply with the Token Taxonomy Framework, a collection of standards for enterprises using ethereum, developed by JPMorgan Chase, ConsenSys, and other members of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, in April 2019. The group, informally called eThaler Labs, is building on Hyperledger Besu, an enterprise version of ethereum submitted  by ConsenSys subsidiary PegaSys to Hyperledger and approved last August. A slide presented at today’s meeting by Bharathan, who worked for 16 years at BNP Paribas before founding blockchain startup DLT.NYC, laid out how eThaler would work. First and foremost, eThaler is being designed to be fungible, meaning regardless of what central bank might end up minting its currency using the technology, every token will have the same value as the underlying asset, regardless of whether the token had been previously used for some nefarious purpose. Like traditional fiat currency, any initial supply of eThaler-based tokens would need to be increased through further minting by the central bank, or destroyed through a process called burning. But like bitcoin, it would also be able to be divided into as many decimals as the bank desired, a crucial component for so-called micropayments, tiny online transactions not currently feasible with fiat currencies. Lastly, and perhaps most controversially, the asset must be “pausable” in case a bug in the software is discovered, or an update is being implemented.The important part about this, and other more advanced work, is that the role banks play, or don’t play, is little more than a design decision. Another slide reviewed by Bharathan showed that eThaler could be implemented as a wholesale solution, meaning it would only be issued to institutions with Fed accounts, and could be used to instantly move large values directly to one another without needing to go through the Fed itself. Another implementation, for retail however, would operate just like cash, except it could be disseminated from a central bank directly to the people.In addition to complying with the Token Taxonomy Framework, eThaler-based tokens will comply with the ERC-1155 token standard.  Unlike other ethereum token standards like ERC-20, 1155 is a single standard designed to support multiple kinds of tokens. So, for example, a central bank could use it to mint fungible digital dollars or bonds, according to the project’s lead developer, Mani Pillai, president of Swapshub capital markets infrastructure firm, who was also at the meeting. In the coming weeks, the entire structure is expected to be offered to open source developers, meaning anyone will be able to build on it. While developement of the codebase and launch of a test network will be governed by a capital markets special interest group, formal admittance to Hyperledger could take months.However, none of this is guaranteed. A diverse set of skeptics have long expressed doubt in the idea of a central bank digital currency. On one side, bitcoin purists argue that the central bank itself is a middleman that blockchain makes unnecessary. On the other are traditionalists who point out that the vast majority of global currency is already digital, no blockchain needed. According to Bharathan though, speaking in the meeting, a wallet issued by a central bank, and filled with cash, would remove the counterparty risk of the bank in the middle going under. “There is nothing standing between you and the central bank guarantee,” he said.In an interview with Bharathan after the meeting he was quick to point out that his team’s work is among the youngest projects in the space. Perhaps the most prolific organization in the burgeoning digital dollar space is New York-based R3, which is funded by $120 million venture capital from big banks and others, and is already in advanced stages of work with four different currencies. Specifically R3 says it is now working with the Swiss National Bank to explore a central bank digital currency for settlement; the Bank of Thailand for interbank settlement; Sweden’s Riksbank on a digital version of the Swedish krona; and the European Central Bank to explore CBDCs in Europe.On the other hand, “China has been doing this for four years,” says Bharathan. In fact, the Chinese government’s secretive work on its own CBDC, is likely a contributing factor to Congress’s interest in digital dollars. In June 2019, Facebook revealed its own plans to help launch a “stablecoin” backed by a basket of global currencies, designed to make it easier for those without traditional banks to engage in global commerce. The news reportedly accelerated China’s own plans and prompted comparisons between China’s CBDC and Facebook’s stablecoin. So serious is the competition to be first, that this January, the former chairman of the CFTC, Christopher Giancarlo, co-launched the Digital Dollar Project with consulting firm Accenture specifically to advocate for the creation of a U.S. digital dollar.As the world of fiat and cryptocurrency increasingly merges, it's not the currency itself that most has Bharathan’s attention. Rather, he thinks the biggest opportunity is for smart wallets that store the currency that can be programmed to automatically execute any number of tasks, from moving funds to a savings account, investing, or being made aware of changes in tax codes, not just for individuals, but institutions. “It may not start off with a bang with a wallet holding a trillion dollars,” says Bharathan. “But over time, it may.”Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus"

IDC estimates spending on blockchain will rise from $2.9 billion in 2019 to $12.4 billion in 2022.People see blockchain opportunities everywhere. That long list includes banking, connected cars, food safety, healthcare, identity, insurance, smart contracts and more. The thinking is that anything requiring preservation of the integrity of a record could benefit from blockchain.Some even call blockchain the new internet -- offering traceability, trust and transparency.But while blockchain offers a lot of promise, it also presents a variety of risks.A Cautionary TaleMt. Gox serves as just one example of how blockchain can go horribly wrong.Users relied on the giant bitcoin exchange to manage their bitcoin transactions. Mt. Gox failed to properly secure its customers' bitcoin, which led to a litany of concerns, including fraud, mismanagement and bitcoin theft.Bitcoin was easily stolen by bad actors who exploited poor security practices including leaked credentials and transaction malleability, allowing attackers to hijack transactions to their own gain.Mt. Gox lost a half-billion dollars’ worth of its customers’ virtual currency as a result. The company then filed for bankruptcy protection and suspended operations.Bitcoin and blockchain represent a new paradigm. People thought they could implement these technologies without having to worry about security. Mt. Gox showed why that thinking is wrong.A Lack Of AccountabilityTraditionally, liability has resided with banks, which are regulated businesses. That way, if something went wrong, you could point your finger at the financial institution. You could call out their weak authentication and demand that they cough up your money.With blockchain, the model has changed. There is no central regulatory body. You have no recourse, no way to dispute things or get things corrected.Users have to manage their encryption keys, shifting responsibility from entities like banks to individuals. If you lose your key, you have nowhere to go.Who is accountable? No one.That’s part of the challenge -- because with blockchain we’ve turned the model upside down.A Brief Word On Smart ContractsSpeaking of liability, the smart contract also warrants consideration.Smart contracts are computer programs or protocols running on blockchain. The smart contract says that if A does something to B, then C must happen. You only get your reward if you do things in the correct manner.But contracts are typically the domain of lawyers, who understand and deal with intent. Managing disputes is not something that we can easily encode into an algorithm. Yet, smart contracts encode that behavior onto blockchain, and they are written by coders -- not lawyers.An Inability To ChangeAnother challenge with smart contracts and blockchain is that they are really hard to change.You can’t verify what the contract is doing and that it’s executing as intended. And you can’t alter it if it’s incorrect.Blockchain’s immutability also conflicts with privacy regulations, like the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). GDPR and other rules provide individuals with “the right to be forgotten,” but blockchain never forgets.The fact that blockchain is difficult to edit also makes it attractive to bad actors. Privacy poisoning can easily render an entire blockchain unusable. The attack involves using blockchain to store illegal data or defamatory records, putting the entire network in conflict with local laws.A New Kid On The BlockSome of the risk attached to blockchain has to do with its maturity level. It’s important to remember that blockchain is a technology -- it’s not a process or a framework.Blockchain is simply a ledger that can’t be corrupted. The actual practices of how users do things with and around blockchain, however, are unclear.It doesn’t have the security development life cycle of security technologies like encryption and key management systems. A security development life cycle includes everything involved in how a solution provider or an implementing organization produces something. That goes from design to implementation, testing and operational maintenance.Know Who Holds The Keys To The CastleThe key life cycle is critical because the one holding the key controls everything.So, you need to know who is holding and controlling the encryption key.You need to have a plan for what happens if the key gets lost, too. Again, it’s not that simple on blockchain. It’s up to the blockchain designer to build a backup process for such situations.Choose Use Cases with CareDevelopers and users may be able to avoid “the blockchain graveyard” by selecting use cases wisely. Blockchain works best in situations not bound to the constraints of data or subject to volatile markets. It’s also smart to choose use cases in which the data is not that important from a financial perspective.One potentially appropriate blockchain use case is a supply chain. Then you can actually have peer review with other people. Blockchain could also be used for airline loyalty points.These are good use cases because they don’t require tight time constraints. If you want something instantly, blockchain is not going to be your friend. But if my loyalty points don’t appear on my frequent flier account immediately, that doesn’t really bother me.Be Selective About What Goes On The ChainAlso, think about whether you really want to put certain data on the blockchain. And if you have personally identifiable information (PII), don't put it on a blockchain.Blockchain does not allow users to easily exercise their right to be forgotten or to correct their data. And PII creates legal risks for the organizations that implement blockchain.Build An Escape HatchThere's a growing appetite for automation. Against this backdrop, having no method of intervention or error correction is a big problem.If there’s no escape valve to error correct, you're in dangerous territory. That said, if you're designing a system, make sure you build in error correction.It’s not always possible to get ahead of the game with blockchain. But it is important for blockchain designers and users to appreciate these threats on the blockchain landscape."

Video Player is ...","Mar 20, 2020,01:38pm EDT",NurPhoto via Getty Images,"Largely as a response to a rapid bear market and an evolving pandemic, central banks have gone all-out and thrown out the kitchen sink: everything from conventional monetary policy taken to the most aggressive level possible, such as the Federal Reserve lowering nominal interest rate targeting to essentially zero — to more unconventional monetary options: the Federal Reserve restarting quantitative easing, and the European Central Bank announcing that it would purchase distressed commercial assets on its balance sheet.Much of the post Great Recession response has been reactivated in this latest round of monetary policy with surprising speed and ferocity. Central banks around the world are being aggressively proactive and deploying every tool they have. This includes reactivating currency swaps between different central banks — one tool that the Financial Times called the “most important Fed action so far” in an opinion piece.What are currency swaps, and why do they matter so much to the global financial system? Currency swaps allow central banks to open channels between one another, transferring domestic currency for foreign currency and letting foreign central banks loan out the exported currency at their own policy preferences and terms. This is specifically important for the Federal Reserve and the US dollar, since USD acts as a safehaven asset of sorts during financial contractions. Banks and other entities around the world that operate in USD will suddenly find their costs elevated and in order to fund operations that require USD, they will themselves increase the price for USD — potentially undermining Federal Reserve policy. Currency swaps are important for exactly that reason. From this example, one can see how foreign demand for the US dollar affects US monetary policy outcomes — in order to assuage broken markets for foreign demand, the Federal Reserve cannot legally extend loans to non-American banks that are not under its jurisdiction — so it must rely on foreign central banks to provide that liquidity under their rules and procedures. In short, if there is global demand for US dollars, and a global imbalance for them, the Federal Reserve must work with other central banks to resolve these issues.The Federal Reserve has just launched a new program of currency swaps with nine other central banks, promising to exchange US dollars for foreign currency to alleviate US dollar demand in different markets. They are “capped at $60 billion for six central banks in Australia, Brazil, Mexico, Singapore, Korea and Sweden. The exchange lines are capped at $30 billion for central banks in Denmark, Norway and New Zealand.”  As part of the response to the Great Recession, the Federal Reserve extended currency swap lines to old political allies, such as the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of Canada. Currency swaps and their implementation were something that some central banks piloted with blockchain experiments. The Bank of Canada cited distributed ledger technology or DLT as one way central banks could save up to “$20 billion a year in global back-office costs”, especially with cross-country currency swaps. This was a major focus of the Bank of Canada’s DLT experiment with Project Jasper. Though the Bank of Canada had mixed feelings about their DLT experiment in contrast with existing systems, it lead them to comment that “together we can support a smooth evolution to tomorrow’s financial system – safe, sound and serving the people who rely on it.”The Monetary Authority of Singapore then connected their payments network with the Bank of Canada’s payments network to effect a small cross-border currency swap of about 105 Singapore dollars. Practically speaking, it’s a small amount — but this does auger well for the new reality we live in. Central banks are aggressively extending currency swaps to one another, a trend seen just recently in the last two decades. In doing so, they are already turning central bank orthodoxy on its head — highlighting and perhaps furthering the need to incorporate new approaches to currency swaps. After all, here, we’re talking about central banks transferring values among different national ledgers and systems. DLT and blockchain could be used to settle differences between those two different accounts more rapidly and with cost savings, allowing for central banks to extend their decisions to other cooperating central banks, and allowing for more fluid global responses. There are also political and trust considerations for currency swaps, which is why central banks usually impose a limit and are careful about choosing which countries to extend currency swaps with. This matters all the more now, with the COVID-19 pandemic driving extreme volatility in markets. A global response requires fluid coordination with minimum delay. It’ll be interesting to see if central banks rely on DLT and blockchain more often. The reactivation of emerging currency swaps once again prove that distributed ledger technology and blockchain can help with unprecedented financial and economic problems. The market is no longer responding very strongly to individual central banks taking extremely proactive actions: it now takes a global coordinated response to spark rallies lasting longer than 30 minutes. In this environment, currency swaps may be one of the most important and potentially still effective monetary tools available for central banks to help support the response to the COVID-19 pandemic — and blockchain can help.

You ponder how your mind will be stimulated as well as your entrepreneurial spirit with how blockchain is a game-changer. You are about to be entertained by Dr. Muneeb Ali, CEO and Co-Founder of Blockstack PBC, and hear about a ‘light’ blockchain design, a ‘Stacks’ token, the smart contracts programming language called ‘Clarity’, and its decentralized cloud storage system called ‘Gaia’. As the presentation begins, this computer scientist from Princeton University starts off with a list of disclaimers. ","Muneeb AliDr. Muneeb Ali, is also the Co-Founder of Blockstack, the privacy-centric, decentralized computing network pioneering applications that returns online data ownership to developers and consumers. I had a chance to interview Muneeb, who shared how he sees his compliance and transparency with U.S. regulators as equal in importance to his innovate development of blockchain. He also shares how the U.S. response to Coronavirus could benefit from the lens of a Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur who is well-versed in understanding exponential growth curves. Jason Brett: You’ve obviously had success with launching the first compliant crypto token six months ago. You have made an ongoing effort to be transparent with the SEC by filing reports. How have you found this to be impactful to your business both positively and negatively?Muneeb Ali: On the positive side we basically took the approach that the alternative was locking out all the U.S. people, both investors and users, and open our network to only non-U.S. people. But that didn’t feel right given we are a U.S. company, and also some of our early backers and users who are community members are U.S. people and developers. We wanted to open our network to the U.S. market as well. That is much harder to do given the regulations here in the U.S. But we did that hard work up front, working with the regulators, with the SEC, and not only coming up with the legal frameworks but also the accounting frameworks and everything else to have a SEC qualified offering here in the U.S. Even though the securities regulations have been around since 1933, this was the first time that the SEC qualified an asset that was a crypto asset and not traditional equity in a company. It takes a huge amount of work to get there. In general, it’s good because the SEC rightly thinks that in the crypto market people as speculative and hype-driven and the markets are not as mature as those in your traditional equity markets. People just don’t have access to the right kind of information. This is our attempt to disclose all the information that any potential investor should have access to if they are making a decision to buy our Stacks cryptocurrency. This is similar to how a company goes public and discloses all the relevant information to everyone.I think WeWork was a great example recently, where they tried doing an IPO but when they were doing their disclosures, people discovered all sorts of things about the company that were red flags. And WeWork eventually was not able to do that IPO. These checks and balances are good for the public health of markets, and we don’t see them in crypto. So that’s the reason that we did it. On the downside, there is a lot of overhead. We are a 30 person company; there’s the company and then there’s the open source project. Blockstack PBC, the company, built some of the core open-source software and protocols. The company had to build internal muscle for legal and accounting and all those things that you wouldn’t traditionally expect from an open source engineering and R&D focused project. I can’t even tweet without getting my lawyers to take a look at it. Our blog posts go through rounds of legal reviews, which is not typical for crypto markets or tech in general.Jason Brett: You mentioned WeWork. There’s been a lot in the news about how the WeWork CEO and Founder behaved. You strike me as very much the opposite of that in your attempts to provide transparency. What’s your interest or modus operandi as far as why you are leading this company the way that you are, both in terms of regulation and being careful to be as transparent with the public and investors as possible?Muneeb Ali: Great question. So, my background before starting Blockstack was more in traditional cloud computing and Internet protocols types of environment, so more traditional tech. I was doing my PhD at Princeton. If you look at traditional tech, imagine engineers that work at Google and Amazon, there is a huge difference between the professionalism level of that crowd and the crypto industry. And the kind of problems we were working on from a purely research perspective were centered on building a better secure, more secure, more scalable user-owned internet. And we discovered blockchains as a very elegant solution to some technical challenges we were solving. However, if you are using blockchains, if you are using crypto assets, it comes with the rest of the industry as well. It is not a very mature industry. There are some outright bad actors, and some unsophisticated players in this industry.We were able to get some of the top VCs and institutional investors in the world. These are investors who might otherwise be hesitant to invest in the cryptoindustry. Our approach was that we just need to do more work and help mature the crypto industry. Blockchains are fundamental to the design of our decentralized network and we’re willing to put up with the baggage that comes along with this industry. It’s also an opportunity to take a leadership position and try to raise the standards for everybody. This happens a lot in our recruiting. For example, there are computer scientists that we’ve been able to hire who wouldn’t normally consider working in this space. We were able to recruit them and tell them how our team is different or how our approach is different, and the SEC qualification and framework also plays a role there. They can look at our SEC circular, and see that our head of finance used to work at BlackRock as their CFO Canada among other responsibilities. That kind of professional standards are currently not in the crypto industry. I think our team is mostly comprised of people who might be hesitant to work in the crypto industry but they feel comfortable enough in our structure and under our way of doing things.Muneeb Ali, co-founder and chief executive officer of Blockstack Inc., speaks during the Token ... [+] Summit in New York, U.S., on Thursday, May 16, 2019. The Token Summit discusses the economics, development, regulation and best practices around blockchain-based tokens, protocols, and crypto-assets. Photographer: Alex Flynn/BloombergJason Brett: One of the interesting things that I noted when looking at your white paper and learning about your company before this interview was what I have often heard about blockchain is that it is compared to the Internet and the World Wide Web. I noticed that you’ve made comparisons to when the first personal computer (PC) was created versus the mainframe. In looking at your structure, including Gaia for decentralized cloud computing, what is it you believe your firm can offer in terms of not just fixing the internet but providing this next breakthrough that maybe is more analogous to the PC mainframe than to the worldwide web?Muneeb Ali: I think it basically boils down to empowering the users. This is what happened when we shifted from mainframes to personal computers. With mainframes, only a very select group of people had access to computing. And it was very expensive. You were dependent on that room-sized computer. And some of the excitement around when Apple was starting, for example, was all about power to the user. You were giving everyone the ability to own a computer and run whatever they wanted to on their device and use it however they want to use it. There are these pendulum swings in the industry. We went through that revolution of power to the people and then back to having these large tech monopolies. Imagine the entire anti-trust work that is going on, the legislation that is being proposed, along with this growing, strange relationship that we have with the large tech companies. We are very dependent on them. Users don’t trust them anymore- they think, I was having a conversation in the privacy of my home and then I start seeing ads about what I was talking about. People are starting to feel that these companies are not their friends and that they are being exploited by them. But they don’t yet have an alternative. If you start viewing Facebook and Google as a mainframe and you want to run away from it, and you want to empower users again, then that is the kind of movement you are starting. It’s all about user owned software. For example, so many people use an iPhone. However, Apple restricts that device and what you can do on it. It’s not like the good old days of running any software on your personal computer that you want. The work that we are doing is enabling the return to users in control vs big companies.Jason Brett: How do you see your Stacks token and blockchain having a competitive advantage where it seems that part of the economics of it is to support developers on your ecosystem? Also, I had read recently about how you had achieved one million users, and there were a few questions about were they were new users or how do you verify it? It seems that you are very much working on how to incentivize the developer community to work on Blockstack, and with the transparency that you offer, how do you prove out something that they want to know, such as whether the platform actually had a million users or whatever the question might be?Muneeb Ali: The high level picture here is that we believe that a Web 3.0 will emerge on top of Bitcoin. Our Stacks blockchain interconnects with Bitcoin in a way. Instead of asking miners to burn electricity, which is done for the Bitcoin blockchain and some other proof-of-work blockchains out there, we build upon the work that the Bitcoin miners have already done. We have this interesting consensus mechanism that has an interplay between Bitcoin and the Stacks cryptocurrency. We basically reuse the power of Bitcoin and have interconnected blockchains that benefit from the security of Bitcoin. At a high level, we believe that eventually everything will be anchored to Bitcoin rather than happening on smaller disconnected networks i.e., smaller blockchains that areseparate from Bitcoin. That is a very different approach. Everyone is trying to build their own small island, whereas we are trying to benefit from the network effects of Bitcoin. Bitcoin remains the most secure blockchain out there. We are adding the missing features that Bitcoin doesn’t have in a way that has synergy with Bitcoin. In terms of growth, we are mostly focused on developer traction. For our apps, we went from 20 something at the start of last year to more than 350 by the end of the year.When we did our original fundraising in 2017, at that time we imposed a couple of self-imposed milestones on ourselves, which was our way of showing discipline. The first one was building out the core technology. We wanted to address the issue that some of these projects raise capital but they effectively do nothing afterwards i.e., they never launch. Within a year after the raise, we were going to develop the core network and push it live. We met that goal. And the second milestone was about going out and introducing our technology to a lot of people. Given the privacy nature of the network, you can’t actually track if anyone is using apps or not using apps- that would just go completely against everything that we stand for; we knew that, even back then. So the way a milestone was structured is that we are only looking at registered usernames on the network which is public information that anyone can see. We did business deals with certain parties e.g., Blockchain.com to introduce Blockstack to more users, in addition to the 400+ apps on the network. Such partners can also introduce KYC or other requirements on the users at the partner level. Our intention with this was getting our technology in front of a lot of people through different distribution channels and getting the initial traction on the network.Jason Brett: I want to shift for a moment because it would be almost negligent about the current atmosphere with the economy impacted by the Coronavirus. I’m curious how has this impacted your company and what are you doing as the CEO under these circumstances to keep your growth going? You have shown support on Twitter that Balaji Srinivasan should have been appointed by Trump two years ago to better handle this crisis, so I am very curious to know what your thoughts are and what your lawyers said to you before you started tweeting out with concerns about how the U.S. has been handling this?Muneeb Ali: My lawyers get more concerned when I actually comment on the crypto industry and any regulations involving crypto rather than anything else. Usuallyif I am rambling about things that don’t impact our work they are actually happier. In general, I think we knew pretty early to strongly encourage everyone to work from home. Blockstack PBC has roughly forty percent remote team members. There is Blockstack PBC the company and there is the open-sourceproject. The project has a global community and that is all remote. We do town halls, to which 100 to 200 people generally show up, which in a way is the real Blockstack ecosystem. We have open source contributors. We have more than 5,000 people who participated in our cryptocurrency offerings. We now have 300,000+ owners of the Stacks token through the distributions we had. As far as Blockstack PBC the company, we made the call ten days ago to strongly encourage everyone to work from home. Most people took the option. We are trying to be supportive, giving people time- for example to go out, get supplies, and take care of what they need to take care of without worrying about work. We are fortunate that we already raised capital, we did a $23 million raise about six months ago so and continue to execute against our roadmap. Blockstack is a very ambitious project, and we are going after very hard challenges, but short term situations and financial markets don’t really impact us because Blockstack PBC has enough capital in the bank.Coming back to Balaji, he’s a friend of the project. He’s been involved since 2014 or so, giving advice and trying out different things. He’s amazing. He has a very deep background in genetics and in computer science and cryptocurrency as well. He’s sold both a biotech company and a crypto company, which is a very unique set of expertise. I think in general he started raising the alarm back in January. We were hosting an event with him in Austin around February 12th. Talking to him in person and going through his reasoning for why he thinks this is going to turn out to be so much of a bigger deal was powerful. You look at the data. You look at the probability. If 10,000 get infected, then the probability of 100,000 people getting it is high. You just run the numbers and see that this is an exponential curve and not a linear curve. Most people don’t think in exponential curves. VCs and entrepreneurs are an interesting category in that they think about exponential curves a lot on a day-to-day basis, so when you see an exponentially-growing problem, you start start raising alarms before other people.We started expanding to Asia last year. Whenever I would go to the airports or facilities in some of the cities in Asia and then land back in JFK, I would just have this feeling that the U.S. is becoming the old world with crumbling infrastructure and that the policies or regulations here might not be the most efficient way of doing things anymore. For the virus, compare people who are landing back in the U.S., even now, who can just walk into the country without going through any testing at all. Even in countries like India, there are pictures of people in biohazard suits outside standing six feet apart from each other getting tested for temperature and what not. It is very surprising to see how here in the U.S. the response is worse than in other countries.Jason Brett: Recently Bill Gates stepped down from Microsoft to focus on philanthropy, and obviously in the life cycle of a CEO leading a company, obviously you are way at the beginning of this, and yet you are looking at what the Coronavirus is doing and perhaps how the U.S. is not taking the best measures. If you could either waive a social philanthropy wand, or could be a leader in ideas for what the U.S. should be doing to try to change the tide at this point, what would be your recommendations?Muneeb Ali: I think there are some people who are in a better position than me right now for actually being able to make a change. Sam Altman, the President of Y Contributor, is one of them. He started a public spreadsheet of different ideas that he is willing to fund. Within hours, people had 70-80 different startup companies ideas. The number might be much higher right now. He basically scoped it out as capital being this pool of money that can go to ambitious entrepreneurs who are trying to solve a timely problem. I think a lot of the Coronavirus responses checks all of the boxes. There are people who are trying to build ventilators or people who are trying to build better ways of checking temperatures. There are all these sensors available. There are actually categories of startups e.g., if you are in 3-D printing, you could potentially work towards this, you could work towards printing certain materials like these devices. If you are in IoT sensing-type devices, you can potentially work towards this as well. If you are in mechanical engineering or robotics, you could potentially do something. I think people are going to come together very quickly. Sometimes, I can be critical of the U.S., but it remains the land of opportunity. I am animmigrant here. I am a U.S. citizen now, but I came here because I saw a lot of opportunity in coming here. I think there are many other people like that. My reason to be here is the Silicon Valley culture and the entrepreneurship culture and how people not only are ambitious and they want to solve these challenges and problems, but they also have access to capital and resources to actually be able to do that. To imagine that we were able to raise $75 million for an ambitious moonshot idea, i.e., that we are going to build a new internet, is a pretty crazy thing, but it can happen here in this country, and I think similar things can happen around our response to the virus as well.The disappointing thing is mostly on the government side, where they have been slow so far. They probably don’t have the right kind of advisors or policies in place. That’s why a single person like Balaji can make a huge difference. He can effectively come up with a threat framework or a decision framework that highlights the things that are super important to do at this time. And then you execute against it. If the people at the very top are not fully grasping the problem or they don’t have their thinking straight, it just goes downstream from there. I don’t think we are in a situation right now where there is censorship of information. But that is one area where I think a decentralized network like Blockstack could help the community; peole can self-organize in a decentralized way and share information in a completely free way. We would be happy to help with any opportunity like that.Jason Brett: It’s definitely amazing the trajectory that your company is on. With your regulatory success, do you anticipate or would you like to see Blockstack move towards an IPO at some point to become a public company?Muneeb Ali: That is something that has been on the table because our network needs to open up to miners. We have been discussing would miners operate under a full filing like an IPO. We’ve disclosed in our SEC circular that this is a decentralized network and these tokens have utility and get used in smart contracts or for registering digital assets etc. It’s mostly about the level of decentralization i.e., with increased decentralization everyone can feel comfortable, including us and potentially regulators like the SEC that the network can be opened up as a decentralized utility similar to Bitcoin or Ethereum. These are some of the things that we are looking at i.e., increased decentralization frameworks. Especially the launch of our Stacks 2.0 blockchain, gives us an opportunity to make the company less important for the decentralized network and focus more on the broader ecosystem. Also, this is one of the areas where I need to be careful about how much can I talk about it right now. More details will come from our official communication channels.Jason Brett: Any last thoughts?Muneeb Ali: For crypto industry to reach mass adoption, I think regulators would have to clearly define that these crypto assets are within the legal frameworks and people are not doing anything ‘illegal’. Look at Facebook for example- they are having a hard time getting through the regulators. They are working to enable broad ownership of crypto assets like us. Mainstream adoption cannot happen unless we clearly answer all the regulatory questions. That’s why we do so much work with on the regulations front. Thank you.Jason Brett: My pleasure- thanks!"

Getty Images.","Top Advisor/SHOOK|Mar 16, 2020,07:16pm EDT",Sometimes they are not as secure—or as uncorrelated to stocks—as you thought.,"Safe haven in hard times? Not.Portfolio theory: You can add certain assets to a portfolio to make it less volatile without sacrificing too much in return.That theory is getting a severe test this year. It will get another test in the near future, as the Federal Reserve tries to shock the economy back to life.Diversification across categories is a valid goal in portfolio construction. But sometimes it fails to live up to its promises. The seemingly safe category may prove to be dangerous if held too long or at the wrong time. The supposedly uncorrelated asset that was going to take the edge off your volatility may make your volatility worse.We’ll look at four kinds of portfolio additives that investors see, to varying degrees, as doing something to lessen volatility in a stock portfolio. Three of them have fared pretty well in the crash of 2020. All of them have their downsides.Treasury bills. Short-term debt from highly rated borrowers (like the U.S. government) is thought to be the ultimate in safety. It’s represented in the table with a money market fund from Vanguard.This category has held up well this year, with a 0% return. It always looks good over a short period that includes a stock market crash. But it’s hazardous if you have too much of it for too long.Money manager Mebane Faber points out a surprising fact about 3-month Treasury bills. If you consider real returns over the last century, a pure bill portfolio would have suffered a maximum drawdown of 49%, almost as bad as the worst drawdown on a much better performing mix of stocks, bonds and bills.How on earth did that happen? Over a 20-year period beginning in March 1933, bills offered tiny returns but the cost of living more than doubled.Ancient history? Yes, but history could repeat. The Federal Reserve has manipulated the overnight money rate to less than 0.25%. Inflation could reappear in a stricken economy where the government is disbursing cash but the supply lines are all choked off. The market doesn’t expect this—the spread between yields on conventional and inflation-protected ten-year bonds suggests inflation less than 1%— but it could certainly happen.Seeking safety in a portfolio allocationTIPS. For safety from the rising cost of living you could buy Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. The ten-year TIPS has a real yield of 0%. So you could prefund your year 2030 retirement spending by buying one now and accepting a nothing return.Not a bad idea for scaredy-cats, but don’t look at your brokerage statements. TIPS prices jump around. The Vanguard short-term TIPS fund has had negative returns in 7 of the past 28 quarters.Gold. Bullion, by itself, is risky, but it’s supposed to provide insurance against inflation and financial crises. Investment advisors who advocate allocating 5% or 10% to the metal can come up with hypothetical gold-spiked portfolios that would have looked pretty good in past decades in the trade-off of return against volatility.Gold has held up this year. But it doesn’t always do well during panics and recessions. It had a 27% drawdown over an eight-month period in 2008. Its long-term real return is meager. It has a negative dividend: You have to pay a fund to store the bullion.Cryptocurrency. Bitcoin fans were hoping that this asset would deliver nice returns uncorrelated with stock returns. That’s magic dust in a portfolio.Van Eck Securities, a money manager trying to get approval for a bitcoin ETF, came to this back-tested conclusion a few months ago: “A small allocation to bitcoin significantly enhanced the cumulative return of a 60% equity and 40% bonds portfolio allocation mix while only minimally impacting its volatility.”I recently checked out the three-year period ended in December. Crypto enjoyed a fabulous return and its correlation to stocks (measured with logarithms of daily price movements) was 0%. Magic.The magic ended. So far this year crypto has had a positive correlation to stocks and has suffered an even worse crash.Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus"

In the U.K., Prince Charles, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Health Minister Matt Hancock and Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty have all tested positive for the coronavirus. The UK has had over 700,000 people volunteer to help with the health system and community support to fight the coronavirus.

It is a global health crisis creating a global financial crisis, and a social crisis of unfathomable comprehension.The impact to the economy created by the millions of people staying at home has hit many business sectors from airlines to restaurants hard. Over three million Americans lost their jobs last week and applied for unemployment insurance, the largest number in history.Tracey Alloway of CNBC described it best, “The financial system is just not set up for a temporary forbearance on payments. If someone doesn't pay for something, then someone else is owed something. (Buyers of credit protection *will* ask for money due)."" The U.S. President Donald Trump signed the $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act on Friday the 27th of March to bolster the country’s health system and the fight against the coronavirus. As importantly, the act offers economic relief, not just for big business, but critically to individuals and families and small businesses.   What is not clear is how quickly this money is going to people and businesses.An earlier draft of the act considered a digital dollar as a means of getting money to people faster. This would see a U.S. dollar central bank digital currency (CBDC). Experts believe it is a bit too early for a U.S. CBDC as the technology is not in place today and should not be rushed. Former CFTC Chairman Giancarlo and Daniel Gorfine the former chief innovation officer at the CFTC proposed a “digital dollar” earlier this year. ConsenSys delivered a white paper on CBDCs at Davos in January as did the World Economic Forum and there are number of projects in train. R3 is currently working with a number of central banks on CBDC projects, most notably the Swedish Central Bank which has begun testing. Libra would make a strong candidate for the distribution of funds, were it up and running.U.S. dollar stablecoins are also proving popular in this time of economic volatility like Coinbase's USD Coin. Stablecoins are blockchain based crypto currencies that are backed by assets like U.S. dollars, typically pegged one coin to one dollar. These coins offer an excellent vehicle for moving money quickly removing the risk of volatility of other crypto assets.Bitcoin is proving to be a popular route to get money to people who need it. In my global professional community, there are a number of anecdotal cases of intermediaries working with charities to help them process bitcoin transactions to get money to the front line fight of the coronavirus. Given the size an complexity of many government funding programs, it is not clear who or as importantly how quickly businesses and citizens are going to receive desperately needed money to sustain themselves. Governments around the world would be advised to consider mobilizing the global crypto and digital assets sector now to deliver solutions to get money to people faster during this on-going crisis."

As a peer-to-peer exchange of digital currency, blockchain’s first use case in 2009 was bitcoin.’ Jim sees the conflation of these concepts as a negative for how the technology can be leveraged in health care. ‘The more we talk about other use cases, the less we talk about bitcoin, the better.’ Regarding his view of what is distinctive about blockchain, he states, ‘Blockchain is a platform for computational trust.’ To understand the benefit of blockchain to this visualization, data from the CDC, World Health Organization, and clinicaltrials.gov is digested into the system and a reference file including the data and metadata is created that matches this information to the source. This file is confirmed by a blockchain or distributed ledger technology where a ‘timestamp’ of when the information was received and from what source is securely recorded and publicly available for others to review.Jim states the distributed ledger technology he uses (known as Hedera Hashgraph) is a way to ‘provide the public a tamperproof transaction log of everything that has happened on Hedera,’. With extremely efficient and computationally sound aspects that makes Hedera Hashgraph one of the trusted platforms he uses to ‘offer a computational trust layer to prove what I have done’. Victoria Adams, a leading blockchain influencer, notes, ‘It is vital that we understand the provenance of these data and be able to trace back how it has been used. Blockchain is vital in this respect. We much know not only what we know but how reliable that data is. Tools like the Hedera Hashgraph DLT can be vital in providing this information.’ Avoiding Tradeoffs Of Health Care Privacy To Fight COVID-19Heather Leigh Flannery, Founder and CEO of ConsensSys Health, also includes blockchain technology in helping to achieve ‘computational trust’ of public health data. ‘At ConsenSys Health, Covid-19 response is our number one priority. We are working on constellations of tech for the benefit of humanity as this pandemic is continuing.’ Heather does not believe we need to give up all of our rights to personal privacy when it comes to healthcare data in the rush to fight this pandemic. ‘The current ethos is to give up all our personal privacy. This is problematic in the long term, and we should be prioritizing technology that can help us advance public health while preserving personal privacy. Blockchain alone does not deliver this privacy. However, this technology used in concert with two other families of technology: zero knowledge cryptography and federated analytic and machine learning does.’ As U.S. citizens accepts the reality of a major pandemic and the information on coronavirus is at an all-time premium, the idea of whether blockchain technology can engender trust in the information provided on the coronavirus will certainly be put to the test.Disclosure: Jason Brett has worked at ConsenSys.

Behind the scenes, however, as evidence begins to mount to the contrary, the public is showing concern that this may be yet another global financial crisis. AdobeStock_288593322Could coronavirus be merely an accelerant that is revealing what was already broken within our financial system? Could our economy have real and un-fixable issues masked by a few years of a bull cycle and unlimited consumption?As financial professionals, business owners and blue-collar American families are all feeling uncertain about our collective financial futures, many are looking to sell assets and sit on cash for a rainy day, causing a liquidity crisis in the market. To combat this fear, the Federal Reserve issued several new policies this week, which left most of us more confused than optimistic. As reading the financial news becomes more and more an exercise in frustration, we hope this article can help.The Federal Reserve (“the Fed”) is America’s central banking system, first created in 1913 to deal with financial panics and crises. During the Great Depression in the 1930's, its powers were significantly expanded. The Fed’s main job is to monitor and control our money supply, which is the total value of money available in our economy at any point in time. Think of the economy as a rubber band that expands and contracts. When the band contracts, the Fed seeks a way to apply pressure.To achieve its goals, the Fed uses tools from the Keynesian school of economics. Keynesian economists argue that aggregate demand is volatile and unstable (especially during a pandemic!), and that recessions can be mitigated by monetary policy actions to stabilize the business cycle. If you are thinking that this sounds like ‘big government’ and anti free-market, you are not entirely wrong. To accomplish its goals, the Federal Reserve has two main levers to pull during turbulent times: lowering the federal funds rate and issuing stimulus into the economy in the form of quantitative easing. The federal funds rate is the rate at which banks and credit unions lend funds to each other overnight. Why do banks lend money to each other? Because banks are required to maintain 10% of their total balance in reserve at the end of each day. This is done so that if someone wants to withdraw a balance the next morning, the bank has the funds available. The banks lend out and invest the other 90% in order to make a profit (more on this later). When a bank is short on its capital reserves at the end of the day, it may ask the neighboring bank to lend it money at the overnight rate, which often has a range. For example, last week the range was 1.00-1.25%, and as of yesterday, the range is 0-0.25%. By contrast, before the financial crisis of 2008, the rate was 4.75%.Federal Funds Rate over time. This overnight rate serves as a basis for all other credit products such as mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, business loans, student loans and more. For example, say your mortgage lender has a business model where he makes a 3% spread on top of the overnight rate. If the overnight rate goes down, you should be able to get a cheaper mortgage. Lowering the cost of borrowing across all products is the most obvious way of stimulating activity within the economy. When the cost of borrowing goes down, you are more likely to buy a house, start or expand a business or even use a credit card for the shopping spree you can’t afford. In a debt-driven society, low interest rates keep the wheels turning. But how do you stimulate the economy further when the rates are already 0%?During times of uncertainty such as the ‘dot-com bubble of 2000’, the ‘financial crisis of 2008’ or what will be known as the ‘pandemic of 2020,’ businesses and workers start to panic. They are unsure of what the next three to six months will look like, so their instinct is to hoard as much cash as possible. The economy starts to slow down and head into a recession. To increase activity and alleviate fear, the Fed needs to put more money into the system. The Fed currently may not have enough sitting in its vaults, so it decides to create new money to put in the markets. This process, known as ‘quantitative easing’, is implemented by the Fed buying government bonds and treasuries directly from large financial institutions, thus raising the prices of those assets, lowering yields and increasing money supply. Let’s take a look at previous quantitative easing events. During the financial crisis of 2008, the Fed started buying $600 billion in mortgage-backed securities (‘MBS’) and by March of 2009, it held $1.75 trillion of bank debt, MBS and Treasury notes. The financial crisis of 2008 was largely caused by banks and other financial institutions dealing in mis-priced bonds and derivatives which represented a fraudulent mortgage-lending system. To stabilize the economy, the Fed chose to bail out several large institutions including AIG, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. Similar measures were enacted in the UK. During this crisis, unemployment went up to 9.3%, and many lost their homes and life savings. With frustration, the same people watched the institutions that caused the crisis being propped up by a government that should have protected them from fraudulent financial practices in the first place. The Federal Reserve continued to engage in several more rounds of quantitative easing in 2010 and 2012, pumping trillions of dollars into the system, and tapering the program in 2013 as the economy began to ‘recover’. Things started to get more interesting this past year. On October 11, 2019, in response to a slowing U.S. economy and ahead of reports of any virus in China, the U.S. decided to issue additional stimulus into the economy of approximately $60 billion in Treasury bills per month. This was the first alarm that our economy might once again be experiencing a liquidity crunch.Just a few weeks earlier, on September 18th, the Fed lowered the overnight rate from 2% to 1.75%, and again from 1.75% to 1.5% on October 30th, indicating that we could be heading towards a recession. Critics began to argue that we never recovered from the financial crisis of 2008 and the economy was being propped up by continued stimulus and low interest rates. On January 5, 2020, the first case of coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China. By the end of February, several cases had appeared in the U.S. and by March, it had become clear that we were past the point of ‘containment’. Fear and panic ensued, the economy slowed down, and the Fed was once again tasked with solving a new problem. On Sunday, March 15, 2020, in its most historic move yet, the Fed dropped overnight interest rates to 0% and issued a $700 billion stimulus package to mitigate the economic effects of the coronavirus. The Fed stated that it would increase this number to $1.5 trillion as needed. But it did not stop there. The Fed has now decided to pull a third and lesser known lever, and that’s the overnight reserve requirement. Simply put, banks are required to hold 10% of their total money in the vaults at the end of each day. The 10% is a requirement chosen based on the statistical possibility of how many people might want to pull out their funds at any given time. During a financial crunch, this number may increase to prevent a ‘run on banks’, something we have seen in many countries during a liquidity crunch. Think of lines at ATMs in Venezuela, Hong Kong and Lebanon, to name a few. Stated on the Fed’s website, “As announced on March 15, 2020, the Board reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent effective March 26, 2020.  This action eliminated reserve requirements for all depository institutions.”This news was barely discussed by major media, yet this third lever is perhaps the one most relevant to the average American. If too many people choose to pull out cash too quickly, the institution may temporarily suspend withdrawals or even become insolvent.After all three levers were pulled on Sunday, March 15th, 2020, the markets awaited the opening bell Monday morning. Many were hoping for a profitable first day of trading after the decision, but that was not the case. Futures fell by 5% ahead of trading. The Dow Jones fell nearly 3,000 points —its second worst one-day decline ever since the “Black Monday” crash of 1987. The market essentially said - “not enough stimulus.”The next day, the Fed made yet another announcement. To provide liquidity to a struggling system, the Fed would conduct an additional $500 billion overnight repo operation.These multiple shocks to the market within days, caused the Volatility Index (“VIX”) to spike to its highest level since 2008. It seemed that our financial system has pulled on all of its levers, unsuccessfully. One has to wonder why the Fed continues to pour all of this stimulus onto an economy while residents of all major cities are being asked to stay at home. Would it not have been wiser to hit a pause button on all activity, issue aid and then use stimulus to kick-start the economy when we get through this quarantine period? The Fed has now used all of its tools within a matter of days. The markets have some time to go before any sort of recovery and are unlikely to respond to additional monetary stimulus at this time. For those sitting on cash, this creates great investment opportunities both in the private and public sector of undervalued assets.For those who did not anticipate this crisis and are now in a tough spot financially, these monetary policies will be of little help. In fact, quantitative easing has been referred to as the ‘Universal Basic Income for rich people, as it does not directly affect those in need during a crisis. The government is currently considering fiscal policy measures that do have a direct effect such as tax breaks, federally funded sick leave, and even checks mailed to Americans. Secretary of Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, warns that the American unemployment rate could go up to 20%. Mnuchin is also pitching up to $250 billion of checks sent directly to Americans. Despite these measures, it is certain that many citizens will come out of this crisis feeling once again betrayed by both their financial system and their government.There is no one solution to what we are facing. During times like this, investors often pull their capital out of public and private markets and store it in less volatile assets such as cash, gold and more recently, Bitcoin. Although Bitcoin fell more than 30% last week with the rest of the market, as the Fed announced multiple stimulus measures, its price began to slowly recover. Notably, Bitcoin was born as an antidote to the last financial crisis in 2008-2009. It was meant to represent a new digital unit of account, that was independent of banks and governments. Bitcoin was also created to be finite at 21 million units, and with its “production” to decrease over time, it was immune to monetary stimulus.This new digital money was created as a direct response to quantitative easing as evidenced by a famous footnote in the very first block of coins, quoting that day’s headline from the UK Times: “1/03/2009 - Chancellor on Brink of Second Bailout for Banks.” Today’s perfect mix of chaos and mishandled monetary policy, could be Bitcoin’s ultimate test. Will it go down like many other assets in a liquidity crunch or will it hold true to its promise and become an antidote to a shaky financial system?"

like Bitcoin, both quickly took to Twitter to push back on the bill.","Mar 14, 2020,09:14pm EDT","The United States has a long tradition of businesspeople who look to sway regulations and political wills in Washington D.C. for the benefit of their industry. Whether in the form of individual lobbyists, non-profit trade associations, or think tanks, business entrepreneurs have a host of options to have their big ideas represented - typically accompanied by big checkbooks.","After months of strategy meetings and coordination with political strategists, attorneys, and Congressional offices, the business owners or entrepreneurs will choose from a number of options that may include writing a letter to a regulatory agency, holding a public hearing on a policy matter, or introducing new legislation.The story of the introduction of the Crypto-Currency Act of 2020 and the supporters behind the bill last Monday involve none of the traditional approaches just described. As I had originally broke the story in December with an initial draft of the bill that was circulating in Congress, I was contacted by a PR representative for Erik Finman and Marshall Hayner, where in a conversation I had the chance to hear from both individuals how the bill had come to fruition and the next steps after the bill’s introduction this last Monday.Erik started the interview by joking how I was the one that ‘leaked’ the bill. He described his interactions with various staffers in Congress as ‘nice’ and said he felt like he was starring in the movie ‘Mr. Smith Goes to Washington’. He was excited that - as last Monday revealed - the Crypto-Currency Act of 2020 would be introduced in Congress, to be followed by them holding an evening press conference, reception, and open bar on Capitol Hill. Marshall led the discussion on the policies behind the bill and raised to my attention that he and Erik were both not attorneys and that it was their first time working on a piece of legislation.The innocence and youth sitting around the table that was developing Federal legislation was striking. Erik is 20 years old - one year from legally being able to partake in the open bar he was offering at his own reception for the bill and five years away from being able to run for Congress, where the minimum age to serve is 25. When Erik shared he felt like he was in the movie ‘Mr. Smith Goes to Washington’, the storyline involved him as a protagonist against the widespread corruption faced by Jimmy Stewart in the film.Screen Shot 2020-03-13 at 9.48.19 PMFor a week in the United States that will likely be remembered for historic stock market declines amid a global pandemic as a result of the coronavirus, Monday’s effort to introduce the Crypto-Currency Act of 2020 was undeterred. Representative Gosar (R-AZ) introduced the bill in the House of Representatives while in self-quarantine and the evening festivities were still held even though the D.C. Blockchain Summit - an annual gathering of leaders in the blockchain industry with policymakers - was postponed.The reactions of the D.C. establishment that represents the cryptocurrency and blockchain interests was swift and brutal. The Blockchain Association, a non-profit trade association in D.C., and Coin Center, a non-profit think tank in D.C. focused on the policy issues facing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, both quickly took to Twitter to push back on the bill.Kristin Smith, the Executive Director of the Blockchain Association, described to news outlet CoinDesk that the bill was ‘Dead on Arrival’. Their position of the bill was clear - it has no chance of ever becoming law. The Blockchain Association has been separately advocating for the Token Taxonomy Act, a similar bill in its comprehensive approach to regulations for cryptocurrencies. Screen Shot 2020-03-13 at 9.45.54 PMJerry Brito, Executive Director of Coin Center, tweeted how the bill was not serious and described how the bill should be opposed ‘on principle’. This sparked an immediate response from Marshall Hayner who commented on how he felt that this was part of D.C.’s ‘entrenched crony capitalism and corruption’ that he was fighting against.Screen Shot 2020-03-13 at 9.44.55 PMScreen Shot 2020-03-14 at 7.33.16 PMIn spite of the ad hominem attack, Jerry Brito has been consistent on the concept of avoiding the U.S. government from the ability to surveil over consumer transactions in cryptocurrency, whether as a new provision of the Crypto-Currency Act of 2020 or the recent idea of creating a U.S. digital dollar to combat a central bank digital currency from China. None of this has not stopped the work of either Marshall or Erik, who noted to Forbes that they have received support from others in the industry and already been contacted by two of the U.S. regulators identified in the bill to learn more. For the nascent and dynamic cryptocurrency industry, this story represents some of the growing pains the space is experiencing as it grows bigger and the stakes get higher. Ultimately, the overall concept of Congress providing a framework that will allow for regulatory clarity and the ability of blockchain entrepreneurs to operate in a business environment where the rules of the road are clear is a good thing. There is no monopoly on good ideas that Congress should pass into law. "

As such, there are no flight to safety assets except cash. With fear and volatility at heights, the classic playbook says gold should rocket. Instead, it has fallen heavily. Bitcoin, the new “flight capital” pretender, has collapsed.This is not because they are great hedging assets in the long run, it is because there are forced sellers in the market that must raise cash to meet “margin calls.” The man on Main Street might not understand how his works, but for those with fat chunks of assets it has been a world of near infinite access to borrowings using assets as collateral for credit lines.If you have a million dollars in stocks, you can easily buy $800,000 more of stocks. Now you have $1.8 million in stocks and that extra $800,000 gives you an extra $600,000 in stock-buying power, which when bought gives you nearly $500,000 more stocks you can buy. As such, if you push the envelope you can get $4 million of stocks on your $1 million of capital. Happy days. Buy a Picasso and use that collateral to buy a house, to buy some Lamborghinis. The fun never ends, until it does.So with $4 million in stocks, with $3 million borrowed, suddenly the market is down 25% and your friendly banker says, please give me collateral to cover your $3 million loan.You say, ‘Oops.’ You can’t sell the Lambo because that just pays out the loan on it, covered by the house, and you can’t sell the house fast and the Christies auction won’t be held for six months and if you are a forced seller of those assets you are going to have your face ripped off. So you sell you gold or your bitcoin.This is the trouble with crashes, they can easily become vicious circles. Happily the government got its training in how to respond in the global financial crisis or as it was called then, the credit crunch. They simply print money and get it into the system, so that no lender runs out of cash or is forced to pull funds in and instead is pressured to themselves push money out into the market to the cash hungry. As such, there is zero chance of a repeat of 2007-2009, in so much as the banking system will not be a “single point of failure.”However, this is a new emergency because the future is going to be about a demand shock, in so much as people are going to slow down spending dramatically for a period and perhaps even a supply shock if China and other economies don’t come back onstream fast enough.Lots of new credit and insufficient supply could create an unexpected outcome, but we have to expect supply capacity to catch up faster than new money reaching the hands of spenders. So the biggest risk is how the developed economies will bridge the demand shock already underway.We may well be on the brink of helicopter money as a solution that will come in the form of tax cuts, financial holidays and/or jubilees of one flavor or another, but the trouble is you can’t make people spend money. When they are scared they stash it, so handouts do not create the desired demand.All this says to me is that this remains the beginning of this situation and while we might bottom in the markets in the next few days/week, we won’t get a fast recovery, instead we will be in for a lazy one as per 2008.There is one critical question that will need solving and it is yet to be addressed. Who and how are the mountains of corporate debt going to be rolled? We live in a highly leveraged world and there will need to be a way big business can roll their bonds. A high yield is simply not going to be enough to create investment appetite from a cash hoarding world for many businesses. This is where the governments of the West need to be building solutions.When you try to bridge a gap, which economically is exactly what this crisis will create, an inch is as bad as a mile. It is that economic gap that needs to be bridged and the criticality will be corporate debt in the form of bonds. This is not really that much of a liquid market and somehow a lot of liquidity will need to be injected into it. Somehow a new deeper kind of QE (quantitative easing) will have to be engineered that can reach into a tier or two lower than the current reach of U.S. and European QE programs.Until that is mooted or we see the pieces come together, investors need to be very careful about the equity markets because right now the U.S. market is not seeing the sort of crash Europe has seen—hitting 2016 levels—and who is brave enough to say the U.S. won’t follow that path?The “demand shock”’ ahead guarantees an extremely bumpy road ahead and cash will be king for a long time to come.Free From Forbes: Get important investing news and information delivered to your inbox from Forbes Investing Digest.

It’s after your passwords, and it will harvest credentials from browsers, gaming apps, and even cryptocurrency wallets.MalwareHunterTeam discovered the CoronaVirus ransomware being distributed as what looks like a legitimate (and very popular) system maintenance app called WiseCleaner. The bogus website is an almost exact replica of the real thing — and many might not notice that it’s being served up from a deceptive web address.Once it finds a victim, CoronaVirus moves on to downloading KPOT. It’s installed in the background as the ransomware begins encrypting files and dropping ransom notes.CoronaVirus even injects itself into the boot process. Threats appear when victims power on their systems and delay Windows startup process for the better part of an hour. It all seems pretty serious... except for the actual ransom amount.It’s about $50 worth of Bitcoin. So far, Bleeping Computer says that no funds have been deposited into the attackers’ wallet.If raking in cash was the primary goal, that might be disappointing. If you’re looking to steal the keys to your victims’ accounts and just need a good cover, however... it might not be that concerning.For anyone who does become a victim of the CoronaVirus ransomware, your primary concern shouldn’t be the $50 ransom. Ignore that for the time being and take Bleeping Computer’s advice: get on an uninfected computer as soon as you can and start resetting every password you can. Start with more sensitive accounts, like email, social networks, banking, and any online stores where you might have saved credit card information."

It was the longest run in history and preceded in a day by its brother, The Dow. The bull had several brushes with death throughout its long history, from debt crises to oil crises and interest-rate hikes, coming within arm’s length of the end, but never fully giving in until catching a lethal case of Covid-19 on February 19. Whether it was the fundamental economic complications from the illness or a panic surrounding it, history books will decide. But the selling contagion moved fast once it hit, taking just 16 trading days after its peak to finally give in, the fastest descent in history. Coronavirus is most dangerous to the elderly, and indeed this bull was starting to show its age. A handful of preventative rate cuts in 2019 against the backdrop of what would turn out to be a shockingly strong economy sent household optimism soaring and the S&P 500’s forward valuations to the highest of the bull market yet. In its final days, the bull enjoyed record-breaking rallies in a handful of exciting companies that gave us a taste of a breathtaking future filled with space travel, self-driving cars and software stocks that would never stop changing the world.Some will say it was untenable and that the bull was bound to collapse under such a heavy weight at such an old age. Others will say that improving economies and an amicable relationship between the world’s two biggest economies would be the source of a fountain of new youth and earnings around the corner. But the black swan arrived. Doctors at the Federal Reserve and the White House tried to revive the bull in its final hours but it was too late. In an ironic stroke of fate, the bull’s long-time morphine seemingly turned to kryptonite, as emergency moves by the Federal Reserve no longer packed the punch of rescue-missions past and investors gave up hope. A collapse in oil prices turned pain to misery and a rush of selling ahead of an expected economic crisis sent it to its demise.It passed surrounded by friends and family, including bitcoin, the Russell 2000, OPEC+, the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate, and eveyr scheduled sporting event in the United States.

In mid-2018, 
after seeing a dearth of blockchain companies that met Lumenary's 
criteria, ...","Mar 8, 2020,09:00am EDT","The parent company of the Fatburger franchise is planning on buying a new chain of restaurants, and ... [+] they're raising the capital using the ethereum blockchain.","Fatburger just got a little more juicy thanks to a historic $40 million capital infusion that not only involved securities issued on ethereum, but marks the first time investment ratings giant DBRS Morningstar rated securities issued on a blockchain. While the rating itself is on a traditional paper debt security that closed on Friday, Morningstar cited faster access to data about the securities as a result of the increased transparency from using ethereum in its rating document, paving the way for a more pure class of crypto-assets native to the blockchain.While the investment in Fatburger parent company Fat Brands (Nasdaq: FAT) isn’t huge in terms of total dollars, the firm that structured the investment has several more projects in the pipeline, with the goal of raising a total of $500 million by the end of 2020, in a total debt securities market estimated to be $117 trillion. “It'll be a transformative event for Fat Brands,” says the company’s president and CEO, Andrew Wiederhorn. “And I'm certain that there will be a number of smaller franchise companies or restaurant companies that want to access the whole business securitization market to access capital rather than term loans from lenders.” In total, $20 million worth of Class A notes were rated BB by DBRS Morningstar and another $19.7 million in Class B notes were rated B, and sold at a discount. The fixed rate notes averaging 7.75% per year, are backed by the royalties and initial upfront fees charged to Fat Brands franchisees, including Fatburger, Buffalo’s wings and Ponderosa Steakhouse. In total, 400 stores are contracted to pay these fees, according to the rating, with 200 more scheduled to open. Wiederhorn says $25 million of the debt security will be used to refinance existing debt at a rate he believes will save the company $2 million annually, with the remaining funds being used to acquire additional restaurant brands in the second quarter of this year. “We're buying a couple brands a year that are primarily franchise brands, adding them to our portfolio and combining the back offices.”Notably, the Morningstar rating specifically mentions a “shorter forecast performance period and higher visibility into the viability of brands,” as a factor in the rating, something Wiederhorn credits to the tokens issued on the ethereum blockchain. While the rating goes onto specifically mention that the structuring consultant, New York-based Cadence, would issue security tokens to all investors and record the transactions on ethereum, it added a caveat that the security tokens are only “digital representations” of ownership and that the use of blockchain “will only occur outside of and parallel to this transaction and will not govern actual ownership of the notes.”However, the blockchain does play a crucial role in the actual investment process and distribution. On Friday, the trustee distributed a “waterfall” of payments to investor wallets on the ethereum blockchain, with quarterly payments to come, according to Cadence founder and CEO Nelson Chu. In total the waterfall includes three different ERC-20 tokens issued on the ethereum blockchain, one set of tokens representing each of the tranches and another, called a stablecoin, pegged to the U.S. dollar. A screenshot from the Fat Brands pre-sale report, issued by DBRS Morningstar.Nearly $40 million worth of stablecoins, called $CDG were transferred to trustee UMB Bank’s wallet, and the issuer, FAT Brands, held approximately 20 million tokens for each of the two tranches in their wallet. When the trade settled, the approximately 80 million tokens were transferred to the respective transaction parties as outlined in the code, also called a smart contract, until all the ownership stakes and all the investment dollars were in the right wallets. In total, there will be 26 steps, all visible to via ethereum block explorers like Etherscan, which similar to what Google search does for the internet, lets anyone search publicly available ethereum information.“You'll see when the money that came in, when it went out and how that whole waterfall works,” says Chu. “It's definitely the first rated securitization with a digital asset element, and we're using it the way it was intended: to provide that level of transparency.” A pre-sale report prepared by Morningstar goes a step further than just describing some of the potential benefits, providing a definition for blockchain and its potential to improve the debt securities market: Blockchains digitally record information in a continuous manner and data is stored using distributed ledger technology (DLT). DLT decentralizes and encrypts the storage of information, making manipulation by third parties difficult, which ultimately reduces the potential for fraud. Fat Brands started working with Cadence in September 2019, shortly after ratings agency Morningstar purchased then-competitor DBRS for $669 million. According to Wiederhorn the merger delayed the ratings process, which ended up taking three months, during which the ratings agency came into his offices to “kick the tires and open the hood,” he says. Then, the official rating was discreetly published in January and after finding the right investors and negotiating the final transaction a week ago, the investment finally closed on Friday. In addition to logging potentially valuable data about how cash flows, including average unit volume (AUV), royalty rate, external party fees, management fees, and other expenses, move from the trustee, UMB Bank, to the backup manager Vervent, the control party, Citadel, and to others, the public ethereum blockchain shows that a single individual bought into the debt instrument, with even more transparency to come.“If you look up on the Bloomberg terminal, for example, who are the holders of the company's securities, you can tell in two seconds, right?” Wiederhorn ways. “Anybody who's got a material position in the company, they're required to file it and list it in this way.” Cadence CEO Nelson Chu added: “What we’re doing is laying the foundation for a future where securitization will be on-chain from start to finish.”So far, Cadence has issued 65 smaller, unrated securitizations on the ethereum blockchain, from 12 originators, generating $1 million in interest for investors, with 40 more originators in the pipeline. Similar to the larger, rated securitizations, each of these smaller investments is also searchable on any ethereum block explorer. Chu says the number of new investors has been increasing at a rate of 30% a month for the past few months. Those investors typically start making the $500 minimum investment, before upping the stakes, to an average investment of about $25,000, he says. Since launching in July 2019, the company has facilitated $70 million in investments, with the goal of about $250 million in investments this year using the smaller service, and another $250 million in total rated issuances on the institutional platform, also this year. “People are getting comfortable with the platform,” says Chu. Cadence charges a 1% annualized fee for its retail platform notes, but doesn’t reveal the fees for the institutional securitizations, which vary per deal.When an investor signs up for the platform, Cadence automatically gives them a wallet address. Then, when the investment opportunity goes out to market, the company creates a temporary contract that is a placeholder for when the deal actually closes. Finally, when the deal does close, an ethereum token that complies with the ERC-20 token standard is minted for every dollar raised and dispersed, or “airdropped,” as it’s called in the blockchain world, to the appropriate wallet. For users who are looking for more detailed, traditional access to the data, Cadence submits the contract addresses to Bloomberg, where the debt instruments address, notes section and term sheet are among the very first crypto-assets available on the terminal. “It's because our assets look and feel like commercial paper that they fit very nicely into Bloomberg ontology,” says Chu. “It's all kind of tied together.”However, the blockchain component here is more of an additional value Cadence hopes will attract investors by showing who has invested in what, and what else they have invested in. The actual securitization has an underlying paper contract behind it, Chu explains, adding that the extra step, though more complicated, is crucial in attracting new users. “This takes no adoption from anybody,” he says. “The ability to actually click into the contract, see who's invested, see how much they put money for, see how often they transact and for how much, is incredibly valuable.” Even the ethereum fees, called gas, automatically changed every time an ethereum transaction is conducted, is paid for by Cadence. “We pay for it as a cost of providing that level of transparency, that we're hoping to be the foundation for the future,” says Chu.Prior to founding Cadence, from 2008 to 2012, Chu worked as an analyst at Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, and then BlackRock. In 2013 he founded Lumenary, a consultancy that helped founders who were also early employees of companies with successful exits. He helped the elite demographic raise a total of $300 million by guiding them through product decisions and helping craft pitch decks and other early stage processes. One of those companies was New York-based BlockFi, which makes loans in cryptocurrency, triggering Chu’s interest in other ways the technology made popular by bitcoin could improve traditional finance.In mid-2018, after seeing a dearth of blockchain companies that met Lumenary’s criteria, Chu and a group of the company’s early employees decided to wind-down operations and start a blockchain business of their own. Briefly, Chu considered issuing shares of real-estate on a blockchain, or helping startups raise capital through initial coin offerings, before settling on debt-issuances, which he says are optimal for using blockchain. The typical small businesses Cadence is courting are expecting a 50% to 60% profit for work done for a larger business, but end up having to wait months for the payment. With such a large margin, the companies can instead pay for the debt security and get paid in a few weeks or days, while only losing a small percent of the profit.“You have very repeatable, very standardized, very normalized processes,” says Chu. “So they'll gladly take a loss of 8% just be able to get paid on time in a more prompt manner.” The typical capital provider, on the other hand, is a high-net worth, accredited investor who traditionally doesn’t have access to this kind of debt, Chu says, which is uncorrelated to a traditional equities portfolio. Chu says most investors get started with a small investment, and increase the amount after a few successful rounds. “This is just an opportunistic way for them to diversify,” says Chu.In January 2019 Cadence raised a $2 million pre-seed round from insurance company Argo, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, Fantail Ventures, INBlockchain, a group of Chinese bitcoin whales, and a “multi-billion dollar Chinese family office who has ties to several of the largest asset managers in the industry,” according to Chu. An unannounced seed-round has also just closed. While the retail platform is designed for smaller debt issuances, the Fat Brands deal is the first to use Cadence’s term securitization business, for debt issuances of between $30 million and $75 million. Institutions like credit funds, insurance companies and pension funds are able to buy these securities, which are expected to be rated DBRS-Morningstar. Chu says the actual act of creating the debt issuance for Fat Brand taught Cadence how to do it again for other companies, adding that two retail partners in the pipeline, are ready to “graduate” to the larger term securitization service by the end of this year. “We know how to create a structure, who to talk to, how to make it all work,” says Chu. “And so we have several originators in our retail platform today that are going to be graduating to this second pillar, that term securitization side of the market, in the coming months.” Now that Chu has mapped out how both retail and institutional debt securities can be coded into smart contracts, he says he’s got his sights on a third source of revenue, software-as-a-service, that is currently in the works. “If we play our cards right in 2020,” ways Chu, “we'll have set the foundation for the future.”"

(Photo by Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images)","The first quarter of 2020 has been one-of-a-kind. What started as business as usual morphed into unprecedented times with the growth of corona virus. Despite the distraction caused by the virus, there were some noteworthy events occurred in this quarter in the cryptocurrency tax space.The Virtual Currency Fairness Act was introduced to the House on January 6, 2020. This bill  includes a de minimis exemption of up to $200 of capital gains for personal cryptocurrency transactions. Essentially, this would allow cryptocurrency users to buy the proverbial cup of coffee without having to calculate their taxes on the transaction. This was well received among crypto enthusiasts. Making small personal cryptocurrency transactions nontaxable is a great initiative to promote cryptocurrency usage as a medium of exchange for every day use as opposed to a speculative asset.It’s hotly debated how to report staking income for tax purposes. Experts take different positions as to the type and timing of income. In the absence of any tax guidance, it could be argued that staking rewards are taxed similar to rental income, at the time of the receipt. Meanwhile, some experts argue that staking rewards should NOT be taxed at the time of receipt; rather they should be taxed only when they are disposed of. The controversy in this area seems to be an ongoing discussion in the crypto tax community.We also saw several comment letters being addressed to the IRS and other regulators by various organizations such as AICPA, NY State Bar Association, and the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance.These letters demanded more clarity on tax treatment for various types of cryptocurrency transactions such as airdrops, forks, as well as timing of income recognition and valuation challenges.On February 12, 2020, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) published the “Virtual Currencies: Additional Information Reporting and Clarified Guidance Could Improve Tax Compliance (GAO-20-188)” report after analyzing IRS’s efforts in the crypto tax compliance space. The GAO reviewed IRS forms and interviewed various stakeholders such as IRS officials, FinCEN, other federal agencies, tax practitioners, and crypto exchanges to produce this report. The GAO pointed out that 2019 FAQs issued by the IRS may not be binding and demanded the service to strengthen information reporting standards and provide more clarity on Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) reporting. This report also asked FinCEN to provide clear guidance on FBAR filing requirements for cryptocurrency users.Until early February, gaming tokens such as Robux and V-bucks were also considered to be virtual currencies per the IRS website “What is Virtual Currency” section. The IRS added and suddenly deleted this guidance from their website raising many eyebrows in the tax space. If it had stood, this guidance would have subjected millions of parents to calculate taxes on their childrens’ online video gaming habits to the same degree of detail that American taxpayers have to take with their cryptocurrency tax reporting. After many legitimate questions were raised by the public and the media on this matter, the service removed gaming tokens from the definition of virtual currency on the IRS website. For the first time ever, millions of US taxpayers had to start answering the “crypto question” on the IRS Schedule 1. The question asks “At any time during 2019, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?”On March 3, 2020, the IRS held an invite-only Virtual Currency Summit at the IRS headquarters in Washington, DC. This event included stakeholders in the crypto community such as exchanges, crypto tax software companies, tax practitioners and crypto advocacy groups. This was the first of its kind and showed the service’s effort to learn more about the intricacies of the crypto compliance industry.As we came closer to the end of this quarter, COVID-19 lockdowns started affecting everyones’ day-to-day lives. In order to provide tax relief during this difficult time, the US Department of the Treasury and the IRS extended both the tax filing and payment deadlines to July 15, 2020. This offered cryptocurrency taxpayers much needed relief when it comes to paying their taxes. This is the first time in the US history this has happened.In conclusion, Q1 2020 revealed that the IRS has started showing some notable steps towards improving cryptocurrency tax compliance. Although these efforts have been somewhat slowed by COVID-19 crisis, it’s clear that the service will actively look into the cryptocurrency space as the situation returns to normal.Disclaimer: this post is informational only and is not intended as tax advice.

This is by far the largest crypto tax crackdown reported by a tax regulator. According to an ATO spokesperson, ATO obtained this information through crypto exchanges through a program called Data Matching Protocol for cryptocurrency. Those who receive the letters will have an opportunity to amend the return and pay the applicable taxes. Regulators commonly send tax letters to educate and alert cryptocurrency taxpayers. During July 2019, the IRS sent out 10,000 tax letters to US taxpayers with crypto activity. These letters came out in three variations: Letter 6173, 6174 and 6174-A. It looks like the ATO is taking a similar approach to improve cryptocurrency tax compliance in Australia.Tax treatment for cryptocurrencies under Australian tax code is similar to the US tax code for the most part. Under the Australian tax code, crypto currencies are treated as a “form of asset” and subject to capital gains taxes. Therefore, selling, trading or exchanging cryptocurrency and converting it into Australian dollars or a foreign currency or using it to obtain goods or services can trigger taxable events. Record keeping is also essential similar to the US tax system.This story confirms that — contrary to popular opinion — crypto transactions are traceable and being monitored by tax regulators around the world. The IRS also recently discussed the ability to track cryptocurrency transactions at the IRS Virtual Currency Summit. As always, staying compliant with your virtual currency taxes is the best approach to avoid government scrutiny.Disclaimer: this post is informational only and is not intended as tax advice.

Italy has enacted a nationwide lockdown of its 60 million people under which all businesses except pharmacies and grocery stores are closed—it’s the most extreme measure of any affected country. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced a ban on gatherings of more than 500 people and declared a state of emergency for the city, and the National Basketball Association has suspended the current season indefinitely. 127,863 people are now infected with the coronavirus and 4,718 have died, according to Johns Hopkins. Big number: $1.5 trillion. That’s how much the Federal Reserve said it would inject into its overnight funding operations (the repo market) over the next two days to address the “highly unusual” disruptions caused by the rapid spread of the coronavirus. The moves are designed to preserve liquidity in the market; in other words, the Fed wants to prevent “freezes” and make sure buyers and sellers still have the ability to trade and banks still have the ability to lend. It’s the third time in four days that the Fed has bulked up lending in the repo market. Crucial quote: “Historically in pandemics, stocks have usually begun to recover as the number of new diagnosed cases stabilized, not necessarily even declined,” said LPL Financial Managing Director and Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “While this volatile environment is challenging, it can also present opportunities for suitable investors, as we still have confidence in the long-term fundamentals and prospects for the US economy.”Chief critic: President Trump insisted that markets would be “just fine” outside the White House on Thursday, even as they continued to tumble. "

They work hard, earn a salary, deposit to the bank and struggle as they use that cash on expenses, all the while being dependent on their bank. Furthermore, in an attempt to protect low- and middle-income consumers, regulators inadvertently created an askew system where wealthy accredited investors have tools at their disposal that are inaccessible to the rest.Capitalism can do better. We should allow those who work hard and save responsibly to have more control over their financial progress. This is a difficult problem of an entrenched and complex system. However, there is a silver lining.The invention of bitcoin in 2008 introduced an alternate financial system, based on decentralization and digital currency — a system that, in effect, does not rely on banks to provide banking. The current version of decentralized finances, or DeFi, allows people to either use providers that offer specialized cryptocurrency-based services, or use trustless systems where funds are sent to software called “smart contracts” that run on the blockchain. Both have drawbacks and are far from enabling the non-savvy. Current solutions are still raw, immature, and difficult to explain and onboard for anyone who is not a techie with an “early adopter” mindset. For one, ownership of a cryptocurrency wallet means being responsible for a private key, which can be stolen or lost, rendering all funds inaccessible.The Next Step: Multiparty ComputationAn emerging subfield of cryptography called multiparty computation, or MPC, may hold the answer. MPC is a clever mathematical way to split the private-key ownership between several entities in a way that no single owner can control the wallet, but a quorum — for example, two out of three — can assemble the key to allow wallet transactions. This opens a compromise solution between solo key responsibility and complete third-party dependency. Think of MPC as a layer on top of the blockchain infrastructure.New companies, coming mostly out of Israel, are introducing a variety of MPC-based innovation. The coming MPC technologies can help move funds management from the exclusive domain of private financial institutions to the people who earn them. Soon the smartphone will become a safe custodian of our digital assets, operating financial instruments that work on our behalf. Imagine performing banking functions such as interest income, loans and payments from your mobile wallet, without the use of a bank. I call this new breed of personal finances “MeFi.”How Would MeFi Look And Act For The User?First, wallet setup should be as easy as getting a new smartphone and setting up an app. The user would be able to open a private account and delegate some control to loved ones, communities or trusted third parties. This control delegation would allow more security and a recovery path in case keys were lost. It could also allow joint accounts, which are currently not possible. Second, with MeFi, the earner may receive income, converted to digital currency, directly into their personal wallet. Third, any income held in the personal wallet would be managed by a “smart personal assistant” that could maximize yield, manage risk and negotiate payment transactions. Assets would be managed quietly and work for the exclusive benefit of their owner.MeFi Versus Traditional Bank AccountsFor everyday folks, banks basically offer the following: safe custody of funds, gains on assets via interest and investments, payment system through cards or cash, and a source for loans. All of these have already been proven to work in crypto; interest gains are being offered via several providers and DeFi solutions. Payment systems are also starting to emerge; for example, Visa recently gave Coinbase the ability to issue bitcoin debit cards. Loans are also gaining traction as current DeFi and centralized providers locked billions in collateral for fiat and dollar-pegged stablecoins. Eventually these products will converge into the owners’ wallets becoming seamless and automated, acting as a money-making engine for the user. Once banking services on MeFi are cheaper and easier and provide better yield, the choice will be easy.When Will All This Happen?There are many pieces to this puzzle, and all are already laid out. Technology and market sentiment are aligned, but the powers working against this change are enormous. Governments and banks will undoubtedly try to keep the status quo, but progress and civilian discontent, as well as adoption by smaller economies, may force regulators to embrace MeFi as a positive disruption. Regulators and tax authorities would also need to adapt as people shifted to MeFi. However, we’re already seeing a push by some major tech companies, such as Facebook with its Libra project and Square researching a bitcoin-based payment system with its LDK program. If enough pressure from citizens and industry materializes, it will surely motivate democratic governments to act faster in accepting and supporting the next generation of financial freedom."

Even though it could end up being not much more powerful than the flu, its impact on the world economy — and the global psyche — will leave a jarring scar.Yet, the wound is still open and the pain it causes will probably intensify, as it has become the catalyst of a worldwide financial crisis that could match the 2007-2008 global financial meltdown that began with the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States. Already, Wall Street has suffered its fifth worst day in history, and the most calamitous since Black Monday in 1987, as tens of millions have been put in quarantine throughout China and Western Europe.In a globalized world, the fear of contagion has led to a closing of borders as nations scramble to repatriate estranged citizens while prohibiting incoming flights from “infected areas,” which according to preliminary statistics from John Hopkins University now represent 155 nations with more than 175,000 cases having caused nearly 7,000 deaths worldwide by press time. The brutality of the market’s reaction to the coronavirus pandemic, coupled with potent declines in oil prices due to a cock fight between Saudi Arabia and Russia, have catalyzed a cycle that has already caused irreparable damage to the global economy, exacerbated by governments’ overreaction to a major public health issue. Despite a “dead cat bounce” last week, we’re in for some serious trouble.Before getting into an analysis of the violence of the market correction — which is intimately tied to a global market that has been propped up by monetary largesse that appears to have lost its power, therefore setting the stage for intense financial volatility across the globe — it’s important to put the reaction of governments across the globe in context. The current Covid-19 outbreak has been declared a pandemic, and it follows in the footsteps of at least eight severe pandemics since the 20th century. While it is unlikely that an infectious disease will wipe out humanity from the face of the planet, there are more than enough reasons to fear a potentially apocalyptic pandemic, as the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board explained in a recent report at the behest of the United Nations, indicating our lack of preparedness. The Spanish Flu of 1918 infected some 500 million people (about a third of the global population), killing 50 million over two years or nearly three times as many as World War I. The Asian Flu of 1957 and the Hong Kong Flu of 1968 each took out one million people, while AIDS is responsible for 32 million deaths since 1981, according to a piece by Perfil.A proper government response to infectious disease based on scientific evidence and preventive action is needed, and indeed would generically cost around US$4.5 billion according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). Instead, the annual cost of influenza in the US from hospitalisations tops US$10 billion, along with 20.1 million days of lost productivity, says the US Center for Disease Control (CDC). Yet, ill-prepared nations and politically motivated action undermine noble attempts to contain the virus, such as US President Donald Trump’s initial mocking of the coronavirus outbreak, only to be forced to react once the stock market went haywire, unilaterally closing his nation’s borders with the European Union while pointing to China as the epicentre of the disease. The Donald is in electoral season, of course.In a working paper for the US National Bureau of Economic Research authored by Victoria Fan, Dean Jamison and Larry Summers, they estimate the annual cost of pandemic flu to be between 0.2 to 2 percent of global income, similar to climate change, with some 700,000 deaths which, added to US$80 billion in income loss, take the figure to US$570 billion. A “moderately severe” pandemic could cause over two million deaths and cost four to five percent of global output, about US$4 trillion. It is clear that governments must react to avoid unnecessary loss of life, but also act in a coordinated and rational manner so as to not exacerbate the serious economic disruptions caused by infectious disease. Already we are seeing the impacts of the Covid-19 outbreak, with a global paralysis in industries including transportation and hospitality, a growing impact on retail and industrial production, and the slowdown of global trade. It is still too early to estimate the global economic cost of coronavirus, but there can be no doubts that the knock-on effects of the paranoid fear that has taken over will only exacerbate the macroeconomic disruptions. China alone could shave 0.2 percentage points off global growth, sending it to its lowest levels in a decade since the financial crisis.ONLY PART OF THE PROBLEMCoronavirus is only half of the problem, or even less. Global financial markets have been brewing a deep crisis that appears to have been kicked into high gear these past few weeks. Wall Street’s see-saw last week, tanking 10 percent on Thursday only to surge 9 percent Friday, is but one of the several indicators that things are not right. Volatility won't slow down, as we can see. And an oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia sending crude down more than 20 percent in a single trading session just adds jet fuel to a forest fire.Since the global financial system imploded under the weight of excessive leverage and reckless lending in 2007-2008, it came down to the major central banks to save the day. Former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke took the lead through aggressive interest rate cuts which led to quantitative easing, or monetary stimulus. Europe soon followed suit, with then-European Central Bank president Mario Draghi telling markets he would do “whatever it takes to preserve the euro,” adding, “and believe me, it will be enough.” Soon enough major central banks were pumping billions of dollars, euros and yens into bond markets, pushing down interest rates close to the zero-bound, with yields in Europe going negative — which means bondholders were actually paying sovereigns to hold their debt — as a “wealth effect” in financial assets was expected to trickle down into the real economy.Markets became hooked, as the Financial Times’ Gillian Tett put it, on monetary “morphine,” and every time the Fed tried to back off, they freaked, forcing the sitting Chairman to come up with a new “monetary fix.”“Bad news is good news,” was a phrase knocked around Wall Street, indicating the Fed would come to the rescue in the face of negative economic indicators. And it worked, to a certain extent, having pushed stock markets — particularly in the US — to record high after record high, while unemployment has dropped to some of lowest figures on record. Yet, several market watchers have been arguing that these massive gains in asset prices were artificial, and that a major correction was inevitable. Keen investors like Jeffrey “the bond king” Gundlach and even the Oracle of Omaha himself — Warren Buffet — warned that asset prices were ridiculously high. Markets were completely distorted as valuations became excessively rich, yet this time the world’s leading central banks didn’t have the “ammunition” to face a severe crisis. According to Ámbito Financiero, interest rates in 2008, before Lehman Brothers went bust, were around 4.15 percent in major economies, and central banks cut rates to the order of 500 percentage points in the heat of the financial crisis. Today, the ECB is at the zero, while the Fed is expected to get there next week, after a 50 percentage point last week that was widely considered ineffective.Furthermore, the Fed pledged US$1.5 trillion to support repo markets that provide short-term liquidity last week, but ended up seeing the yield on US 10-year bonds rise, indicating bondholders were dumping supposed safe-haven Treasuries amid an equity bloodbath, which is completely unexpected. Even gold prices dropped on Thursday when the market panicked, both of which suggest investors were forced to sell even the most valuable assets in the face of a liquidity crunch (so did Bitcoin). “Investors may be starting to contemplate a world in which financial morphine no longer functions,” Tett argues, “a shot of cheap money [no longer] works in the face of medical uncertainty, a global recession, looming corporate defaults and weak political leadership.” Sunday night came more emergency measures: cutting the rate to the zero-bound and more quantiative easing. The market was not impressed.UNNATURAL SWINGSIt’s unnatural to see 10 percent swings in massive markets such as the S&P 500, and Friday's rebound — possibly a response to Trump seeming to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation — is a clear sign of trouble ahead. This is extremely bad news for Argentina, as its main exporting partners (China and Brazil) have suffered a deep economic blow from the coronavirus-financial madness of the past few days, its major exports have seen prices fall off a cliff (soybeans and commodities in general), and the fall in oil prices makes shale production increasingly unprofitable, dooming Vaca Muerta in the short-to-medium term. Furthermore, it casts a major shadow over Economy Minister Martín Guzmán’s already complex plan to restructure a large debt pile, not only asking jittered bondholders to accept an aggressive haircut on their holdings of Argentine sovereign debt, but pushing bond prices very close to levels attractive to “vulture” hedge funds that are begging for a change to litigate.Global financial markets had relied on monetary stimulus to carry an unsustainable rally for too long. Finally, the Covid-19 outbreak broke the camel’s back, and it’s tough to see where the light at the end of the tunnel will come from.This piece was originally published in the Buenos Aires Times, Argentina's only English-language newspaper.Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus"

And Litecoin Soar—Here's Why ...","Mar 24, 2020,10:27am EDT",(Photo by Stefano Guidi/Getty Images),"Forte, a blockchain technology company with a strong focus on gaming, has recently partnered with a host of well-regarded game developers to try and implement blockchain and unlock new business models in the ever-evolving space. Forte has announced that Hi-Rez Studios, Netmarble, Magmic, nWay, and DECA Games are all part of its next induction of gaming partners. They join previously announced developer partners, Disruptor Beam, Other Ocean, and Kongregate. Part of the reason that Forte and its blockchain solution is becoming more and more popular and attractive to game developers is that the blockchain platform benefits both existing and future titles. It has the potential to unlock never-before-possible revenue streams in traditional game designs, while being versatile enough to serve as the economic and creative foundation for blockchain-native experiences. What makes Forte and its partnerships even more interesting is that the company is backed by a $100 million War Chest from Ripple; the company behind the XRP cryptocurrency and the company that is focused primarily on integrating blockchain and cryptocurrency into traditional banking. The affinity for blockchain and the gaming space was identified early on as there are many different areas that blockchain technology, as well as the cryptocurrency side of things, can be applied in the industry. However, the partnership between these two different sides is still very much in development, with a lot of future potential. I spoke with Kaiser Hwang, Vice President of Marketing at Forte, about the current state of blockchain penetration into the gaming market.“We're just at the beginning, but games are a perfect use case for blockchain technology. Games today already involve millions of players participating both in a community and an economy. Blockchain technology allows developers to safely and securely provide players a way to own in-game assets, trade with each other, and even earn income through playing with each other. The technology offers ways to address many economic issues found in the games industry today by unlocking more equitable and sustainable business models,” he said.“While the sector is absolutely ripe for penetration, in order to take advantage of blockchain technology and the new creative designs it unlocks, game developers first need easy-to-use tools and comprehensive services to properly integrate blockchain technology into their games. They simply don’t exist today. But once they’re in place, we’ll see blockchain penetration in the games industry make large strides, and begin to see mass adoption. These necessary solutions are what we’re building at Forte, and are focused on ease of use, versatility, and accessibility.”So, while there is a lot of potential out there for the integration of the technology, it is about finding the best way to implement this, and that is why Forte is partnering with traditional game studios who are always looking to push the boundaries. “A great thing about blockchain technology is that it can be integrated in games in a nearly infinite number of ways. The technology itself is just a means to an end. At Forte, we’re working with highly respected game studios to explore and create new experiences for players inside traditional game designs—the first games of which will be going live later this year—as well as those that are being built from the ground up with blockchain technology as their foundation,” added Hwang. When Ripple announced that Forte would be working with a $100 million fund for game development and blockchain it seemed a little out of the scope of the XRP-bearing company who had been mainly focused on banking relationships. However, while Forte cannot speak for Ripple, they do attest there is a future in this for gaming.“Ripple is a close and valued partner of ours. While we operate separately and can’t speak directly for them, we both believe in a future for games that is open and interoperable. That’s why we’re leveraging open source protocols like Interledger, which seamlessly facilitates cross-chain transactions, in our platform. This directly benefits game developers by letting them focus on creating great experiences instead of worrying about a particular technology or the need to become an expert in blockchain,” said Hwang.Many have even pegged gaming, with its need for in-app purchases and other pain points, as a sector ripe for blockchain disruption. The technology is still searching for its killer application that is solely removed from cryptocurrency; some see this in the supply chain, but in a more futuristic way, gaming could really be the key. Gaming is constantly evolving and requires a foot up from new hardware and technology periodically. If blockchain can get a foot in the door with gaming and change its face, the uptake of the technology could be massive with both sides of the coin benefiting. "

[+] the southern Israeli city of Ashdod. March 16 2020. ,"The COVID-19 crisis has put unprecedented strain on the global supply chain of every product, but most acutely on critical medical supplies.Companies in the US are converting supply chains to manufacture critical supplies such as personal protective equipment, COVID-19 Test Kits and ventilators. New open source movements are stepping up around the world to try address growing ventilator shortages.Internationally, as COVID-19 cases in China have fallen, factories are slowly coming back online. This is at the same time as demand around the world is starting to skyrocket for critical supplies.Multi-million dollar contracts that usually take months to negotiate, are being inked within hours. However, one of the key bottlenecks has been the lack of trust between demand, supply and the financing mechanism.Broken medical supply chains Goods stored in a distribution center of the Perekrestok retail chain at the Sofyino logistics ... [+] technopark in Moscow, Russia - MARCH 20, 2020:Governments and Health Systems around the world have particular requirements for each system (e.g., a confusing array of EU standards, US FDA standards, non-EU standards). These standards are being updated almost weekly to allow for more supplies to come online to meet forecast demand.Governments around the world are battling to overcome legacy procurement systems that cannot move at the pace this crisis demands. This means countries around the world are missing out on supplies because they cannot get financial mechanisms in place in time (hours, rather than weeks).Many suppliers around the world are insisting on upfront cash payment as they try to distinguish credible buyers from brokers and middle-men distributors. There has been widespread reports of fraudulent production and fraudulent claims across the medical and personal protective equipment supply chain. There are risks that equipment may not arrive in the right specifications at the right locations at the right time.There is essentially a trust breakdown across the medical supply chain globally.The 5 Trust Challenges facing the medical supply chainTrust in the global medical supply chain is broken1.      Product Requirements: standards vary across health systems and countries, creating confusion for what each factory should be producing.2.      Supplier Credibility: there is uncertainty over which suppliers can produce equipment to the right quality, at the right production volume, at the right time.3.      Financial Payments: factories and freight companies are requiring financial payments be made upfront as their workers slowly come back online, and they themselves are trying to prioritize credible purchase requests.4.      Customs Certifications: Customs Certifications need to be rapidly validated to allow rapid transportation of equipment internationally, given that medical equipment is highly regulated.5.      Transportation Tracking: transport options need to be validated to ensure the right shipments can move from factories to airports to distribution centers to health centers around the world, under the right conditions (e.g., temperature controlled for pharmaceutical products).What is blockchain?Blockchain can unblock the global medical supply chain, strengthening trust among all parties.Blockchain is a novel smart contract technology that has been used to guarantee crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin, as well as ensure provenance of supplies. In the sustainability world, blockchain has been used to verify the ethical source of minerals, seafood, fresh produce and forest products, among others.It uses a deep encryption system, which enables contracts to be regulated in a more decentralized manner, and secure enough to allow financial payments to flow through such a mechanism. There are both private and open-source blockchain systems, with each system encouraging coordination and collaboration, above one particular party having too much control over the market, and rapid dispute resolution.What role could blockchain play in the medical supply chain?Cardboard boxes at loading dock in warehouseCurrently there is no centralized procurement system governed by a central body (as Central Banks regulate the financial system centrally).  It is a situation where demand for critical supplies are spiking around the world, these Healthcare Systems are unable to verify which ones have credible manufacturing capacities, traditional supply chains have been globally disrupted, new vendors are appearing with credibility challenges, and suppliers are trying to distinguish credible purchasers or ensure their production inventory will be purchased.Traditional tools of excel sheets and google forms are currently being used to govern supplies, with legal contracts being uncertain, inability of individuals to fly to verify factories’ capacity and breakdown of trust of the trade finance and letters of credit traditional payment mechanism.Lack of trust is the biggest bottleneck preventing this market ramping up quicker, and speed is of the essence in the next few weeks.5 Ways Blockchain can helpBlockchain can help with Certification of supplies1.      Product requirements: provide a mechanism for health systems to continually update factories with the latest product requirements and specifications, almost like a production auction.2.      Supplier credibility: provide a way for health systems to credibly assess which factories have high quality control, and can meet the specifications and production volumes needed.3.      Financial Payments: act as a trade finance mechanism to ensure upfront blockchain-backed payments to factories that is then released as working capital upon pre-agreed production milestones and as supplies move to the next step of the supply chain.4.      Customs certifications: blockchain-based Customs Certifications have been used to regulate export of many products from wildlife trade to pharmaceuticals, and can be applied here.5.      Transportation tracking: supplies need to be securely tracked around the world to ensure transparency in the supply chain, which can occur with blockchain-based provenance tracking.Is there a broader role for blockchain?From L to R: Financier J.P.

Storj lab claims, “By using client-side encryption by default and spreading file pieces across 80 or more uncorrelated nodes, the Tardigrade platform is more secure and private than legacy cloud storage solutions, giving users the confidence that their data cannot be compromised or mined.”Centralized cloud storage models, like Amazon or Google, have dominated the storage industry. Barriers to entry are significant because of the large economies of scale needed to compete in a centralized model. While systems like Amazon’s S3 are resilient, secure, and widely available, Mr. Golub  believes that a distributed cloud model is more reliable and cheaper to operate.“We feel that the solution is not a new kind of license, but a new kind of cloud,” said John Gleeson, Storj Labs Vice President of Operations. “While most cloud service providers charge a significant premium for providing cross-region support, files stored on Tardigrade are distributed across many regions by default, at no additional charge. Because any 30 of a file’s 80 pieces can be used to reconstitute a file, and since each of the 80 pieces is stored on statistically uncorrelated nodes (with separate power supplies, operators, equipment, and networks), the system is exceptionally resistant to outages or breaches, whether caused by natural disasters, human error, or malicious actors.”From the press release, Storj’s beta period saw thousands of users and storage node operators worldwide. Tardigrade claims during this period, they never lost a file, maintained performance on par or better than S3, and delivered over 99.95 percent availability. Mr. Golub also serves as an advisor at Mayfield, a global venture capital firm with over $2.7 billion under management. He was previously co-founder and CEO at Docker, the leader of the container and microservices movement.

Indeed, that Facebook received criticism for blocking other cryptocurrencies from advertising on its platform only to roll out its own cryptocurrency later on, then saw the Libra project somewhat slowed down by Congressional hearings, only to have the U.S. roll out a digital dollar of its own, might just be enough of a dramatic comeuppance that Hollywood is already penning the sequel to ‘Social Network’.

","It might go down as one of the worst financial market calls ever, akin to BusinessWeek declaring the death of equities on the eve of a booming era for stocks. Ray Dalio, the billionaire who founded the world’s biggest hedge fund firm, had a message for the billionaires and CEOs who met at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January. “Cash is trash,” Dalio said. “Get out of cash. There’s still a lot of money in cash.”Two months later, cash has become king across global markets and the economy. Dalio’s big Bridgewater Associates macro hedge fund, meanwhile, has plunged by 20% in 2020. Businesses and investors have rushed to cash as known cases of Covid-19 passed 140,000 globally and the World Health Organization has declared the virus is now a global pandemic. With global stock markets plunging, investors have sought the safety of cash. U.S. money market funds experienced $87.6 billion of inflows in the seven days prior to Wednesday, according to Lipper. Bank of America reported that last week investors plowed a total of $136.9 billion into cash. The U.S. banking system entered the coronavirus pandemic in strong shape and is much more resilient than it was during the financial crisis. The Federal Reserve moved on Sunday to further safeguard the financial system by launching a $700 billion quantitative easing program. Last Thursday, as stock were plummeting, yields on 30-Year U.S. Treasuries were rising and gold fell. Bitcoin, which its proponents have advertised as a safe haven, crashed. Cash was where nervous investors wanted to be. It isn’t just any currency that is king. U.S. dollars are in particular demand as borrowers around the world start to pay a premium to obtain U.S. dollars. Corporations also moved to make sure they had sufficient cash on hand. Boeing, already dealing with the grounding of its 737 Max aircraft, moved last week to tap a $13.8 billion credit line it had secured about a month ago. Other companies like Hilton, Wynn Restorts and Seaworld Entertainment, which are dealing with a swift deterioration in their business related to Covid-19, also drew on credit lines last week. There have been reports that private equity firms are looking to push their portfolio companies into considering tapping their credit lines as well. The big U.S. banks that are funding those credit draws, like Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, all moved on Sunday to put their stock repurchasing programs on hold to conserve cash. States also moved to tap their rainy day funds to help them fund efforts to deal with Covid-19. Washington state, for example, is drawing $200 million from its rainy day fund, mostly to support public health efforts.  The rush into cash has been intense enough to include physical cash. Over the weekend The New York Times reported that a Bank of America branch in Manhattan for a short period ran out of $100 bills as customers were pulling out tens of thousands of dollars at a time. Bloomberg News reported that a Chase bank branch in the Hamptons had fielded a request for $30,000 in cash that it had to review under its protocols.   Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus"

[+] Yegor Aleyev/TASS (Photo by Yegor Aleyev\TASS via Getty Images)","While global markets continue to teeter and traditional safe havens like treasuries and gold spring leaks and face questions, the Chinese bond market has become a sanctuary for investors seeking stable returns with limited risk.In fact, as investors drove the yield on the 10-year down to record levels, its counterpart in China is offering an almost a 2% higher yield. As of this writing, 10-year treasuries are at 0.807% and the 10-year Chinese bond is paying 2.703%. This is the largest spread in almost a decade.What’s more, we are not seeing a temporary shift. Instead it is a harbinger of things to come. According to Hayden Briscoe, Asia-Pacific head of fixed income at UBS Asset Management, “This is going to be the single largest change in capital markets in anybody’s lifetime.” Timing is EverythingChina is starting to dig itself out of the COVID-19 pandemic just as the rest of the world descends into a recession.Throughout the country factories are restarting, employees are going back to work, and even travel restrictions are being lifted in Hubei province. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is stuck in a form of purgatory. Governments are trying to stem the virus without crushing their economies or disrupting daily life, but they are slowly finding out that things are not so simple. Due to concerns about infringing on privacy rights or civil liberties, democratic nations have so far been unwilling to replicate China’s model.This hesitation clouds the true scope of the problem, exacerbating investor panic and flights beyond safety to just maximum liquidity. Additionally, these trends are likely to continue in the months and years ahead. This means that while the rest of the world sputters, China is going to be starting along the long road to recovery. The country has already taken bold steps to stabilize the banking sector, and now any stimulus efforts will have a better chance to succeed given the fact that the country has a proper assessment of the extent of the problem.This type of certainty is a siren call to investors, who avoid making moral judgments with their money.Plus, the domestic recovery will be wind in the sails of China’s multinationals that are expanding across the globe and stepping over the U.S. in the process.By Land and SeaAs an example, domestic telecommunications champion Huawei is making progress in penetrating 5G networks in the U.K., Europe, and several other nations throughout the world, despite vehement protestations from the U.S.Need another example, while the U.S. is struggling to give its front-line medical workers necessary equipment such as face masks and ventilators, Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma is busy donating masks, testing kits, protective suits, ventilators and thermometers to dozens of countries in Europe, Asia, and Latin America.Countries will remember who helped them out in a time of need.Plus, all of this is separate from China’s Belt and Road initiative, which aims to link China with Central, South, and Southeast Asia, as well as the Middle East and Europe through the expenditure of over $1 trillion.A Word of CautionHowever, China still has a few obstacles in its path before it ever becomes the center of the financial world.First, even if China’s economy rebounds, which is uncertain given that COVID-19 could return, it will be unable and likely unwilling to decouple itself from the world economy. This exposure will leave some vulnerabilities.Additionally, as the scope of the problem becomes clearer around the world and the bear market bottoms out traditional safe havens should recover and behave normally again. It remains to be seen if investors come back in the same way however.The Case for BitcoinWith all of that said, by the time all of this plays out the world will have absorbed trillions of dollars in new stimulus measures. This manufactured inflation will depress returns and shake the confidence of investors, especially those of younger generations that did not live through the Great Recession. They will want to protect themselves against what they expect to be another round of dovish policies into response to the next crisis or stimulus package, and so they may find bitcoin appealing for no other reason than its built-in scarcity.While bitcoin crashed nearly 40% earlier this month along with the rest of the market, dropping down to $3,867 on March 13th, it has since recovered to $6,629.Perhaps this will become the next, next, big shift in capital markets."

Well, here’s another variation on that theme, with a warning that tempting “Coronavirus Maps” are now being used to plant malware on victims’ computers. Reason Labs delved into this particular threat, albeit warnings about the map’s website had been issued before, cautioning users that such downloads will “steal credentials such as user names, passwords, credit card numbers and other sensitive information.”The specific malware this time around is AZORult, which has been in the wild for four years now, stealing user information and acting as a dropper for other malware strains. AZORult has been doing the rounds among cybercriminals, changing hands on Russia’s underground forums, helping to fuel a range of malicious campaigns. There’s no real limits to the data that AZORult has been known to sniff out on infected machines, and so for users the risks can be multifaceted—standard credentials, bitcoin wallets, chat platform history and messages, as well as installing backdoors into systems for further compromises.Reason Labs researcher Shai Alfasi investigated the threat and explains in a blog that “when victims get infected, the malware extracts data and creates a unique ID of the victim’s workstation—The C2 server responds with configuration data, which contains target web browser names, web browser path information, API names, sqlite3 queries, and legitimate DLLs.”It appears that credential theft is the primary target fo the malware this time around, and those credentials can be used for targeting other sites, contacts, financial platforms and even enterprises. “The password-stealing operation process is simple,” Alfasi says, “because the malware steals the ‘login data’ from the installed browser and moves it to ‘C:\Windows\Temp’.”Infection process.Users do not need to download apps to run risks, malicious websites can also infect computers. And so you should avoid accessing any unknown coronavirus sites or clicking random links under any circumstances. This particular .exe file pretends to come from Johns Hopkins, and mimics the university’s real map. It’s difficult to tell—but if you search for the legitimate site you will find real information there. The developers behind the Johns Hopkins map have provided a statement to clarify this.It isn’t difficult for hackers to play on our fears and use legitimate brands to disguise their ploys. As ever, the advice whether it’s websites, apps or emails, is only to seek information from legitimate health services and government bodies on original sites. When a story becomes as universal as this one, it’s a hackers’ paradise. It’s critical that we don’t play into their hands."

As the group of 60 students, enrolled in the class, Global Health Policy: Advanced Topics, reviewed a module on how governments can slow or accelerate the spread of infectious diseases like SARS, H1N1 and Ebola, the new virus emerged, changing his class in more ways than one.While government response was initially slow or non-existent, his new teaching material quickly started to pile-up. He has now worked details about that response into a number of government policy courses, including one on how blockchain can be a powerful tool to spread knowledge about rapidly spreading diseases. By facilitating cooperation, such knowledge, he believes, could eventually slow infection rates and help prevent pandemics. “This is likely just the beginning of a norm of the globalization of infectious disease outbreaks,” says Mackey. “And we can’t effectively respond without leveraging technology to enable better international cooperation.”For the past four years Mackey, 40, has been studying how moving medical supply chain records to a blockchain, a kind of distributed, shared ledger popularized by bitcoin, could shine a light on the obscure processes. By opening up the records to increased scrutiny, he came to believe that international health officials could more easily identify “choke points” in medical supply chains, and anticipate shortages based on outbreak locations. By eliminating this drag in the system, those officials, and the businesses themselves, could more easily identify which hospitals around the world were prepared to treat COVID-19 patients and others in need of acute care.  As his studies developed, two years ago, he co-hosted a workshop with the IEEE Standards Association, inviting blockchain engineers and healthcare professionals to learn more about how much the two groups knew about what each other did. The result of that work is an accredited certificate program at UCSD, developed with Lipscomb University and advisors from Bayer Health and IEEE, called Blockchain Applications for Healthcare. Students learn blockchain fundamentals and how to develop a model for a wide variety of healthcare supply chains. In addition to changes to the certificate program and the undergraduate class currently underway, Mackey has incorporated the coronavirus response into a masters class on global health policy. Because of concern over the virus, however, the classes are changing in another way too: Mackey will soon have to start offering many of his students remote access using Zoom video conference and the Canvas tech platform.In addition to teaching how blockchain can enhance health care supply chains, he cofounded a government-funded venture in April 2018 that does just that. San Diego-based S-3 [Social, Surveillance, Security] is working on a way to prove the chain of custody for information discovered online about drug dealers and illicit pharmacies. By logging the information on Amazon’s Quantum Ledger Database—similar to a blockchain—the program could help prove the source of online data even after it changes, eventually reducing investigators’ reliance on subpoenas to get that information. S-3 is funded by a small business contract with the National Institute of Health and a grant from the Department of Health and Human Services.Among the most advanced healthcare blockchain efforts Mackey identifies is Mediledger, a supply chain platform using a permissioned version of ethereum, designed by San Francisco-based Chronicled, a venture-backed blockchain startup. Designed to comply with the 2013 U.S. Drug Supply Chain Security Act to crack down on prescription drug abuse, the platform has so far signed up pharmaceutical giants AmerisourceBergen, McKesson and Cardinal Health, and is expected to be phased in over the course of the next year. An even more ambitious project is at an earlier stage. In June 2019, Walmart and Merck were among a group of companies that announced they were experimenting with blockchain to secure the pharmaceutical supply chain. Mackey says both platforms could eventually help more quickly identify when a region is running low on treatment supplies, shining a light on its preparedness for pandemics, “particularly as some of these actors start sharing data across multiple manufacturers and multiple wholesalers.”Why would companies share? While the coronavirus outbreak is making painfully clear how interconnected the global economy is, few industries are built so firmly on that recognition as blockchain. The network effects of using a shared, distributed ledger of transactions are only as strong as the number of organizations that use it. As a result, the first step to building a blockchain application, especially around a global supply chain, is establishing a consortium of competitors willing to work together for common cost savings, a topic also covered in Mackey’s courses.Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus"

But its absence from headlines belies the fact that blockchain is more important in 2020 than ever before. Leaving the bitcoin association completely out of the equation, the blockchain paradigm now underpins the best hopes for future function in the increasingly complex and digitalized business world globally.At a fundamental level, blockchain was developed to be an irrefutable database and log for distributed exchange and reconciliation. The ability to digitally establish and manage trust and transactions among multitudes of far-flung individuals and/or organizations is blockchain’s source of power. It is no wonder, then, that trades as divergent as journalism and diamond sales have turned to blockchain infrastructure to retool business practices and operations for the modern age.The healthcare sector is no exception. Over the past few years, there’s been a lot of investment and experimentation on how to best use blockchain technology to alleviate serious choke points and inefficiencies hampering U.S. healthcare modernization.Those efforts are now beginning to bear fruit. We’re finally starting to see the roll-out of potentially transformative healthcare applications using blockchain as the connector. Here are two important areas I predict blockchain’s real impact on healthcare will become evident early in the new decade:Payment TransformationBecause blockchain was initially designed as a public transaction ledger for cryptocurrency, related finance functions formed the obvious first wave of expanded use cases. The ensuing proliferation of blockchain-based fintech capabilities for digital payment has matured to the extent that it’s not just represented in the infrastructure of finance upstarts like Ripple, but is functional in interactions among institutional banking entities and even central banks.Basic payment reconciliation within healthcare ecosystems represents the low-hanging fruit, and blockchain solutions are already entering the space. I expect blockchain payment mechanisms to become even more prominent in the next 18 months to two years.The benefits of blockchain payment mechanisms in healthcare cannot be understated. Consider the way Square revolutionized point-of-sale systems with mobile technology so that small merchants could accept payment digitally without expensive hardware, massive service fees or the cost burden of waiting 30 days for credit card fulfillment. If you can reduce the amount of time and equipment required for a transaction, you reduce your overhead. And payment processing overhead is a big pain point in healthcare. Blockchain can digitize that process.Blockchain-based healthcare payment solutions can address partnership agreements through smart contracts that execute when conditions are met — securely and automatically. The introduction of real-time applications for payment authorization will institute vastly improved mechanisms for validation and remittance without having to wade through reams of paperwork.Such efficiencies in payment infrastructure could invite new organizations to offer insurance, different types of self-pay models or cooperative payment plans. Better payment processing might seem like a small thing, but improving the way it is handled in healthcare represents massive cost savings and makes grander improvements possible.Pharmaceutical PioneeringForging a path for the greater healthcare ecosystem, blockchain is already making an impact on the pharmaceutical industry in a number of ways. For example, information about pharmaceutical research and development is traditionally very siloed, and surfacing information requires enormous expertise and effort. Even for knowledgeable medical professionals, such details are spread among myriad old-school databases and incompatible platforms.Being able to pull drug development information from, or push queries out to, a distributed mechanism that ensures they’re relayed to applicable pharmaceutical organizations would be of tremendous help to researchers, patients, care providers and drug manufacturers especially.Blockchain makes that possible. Just last year, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) announced an initiative to leverage blockchain in clinical trials because “the estimated $44.2 billion global clinical trials market is facing a number of challenges related to patient recruitment and retention, rising costs to meet regulatory policies, data governance, and more.”Further, by being able to “spend” information securely and anonymously, pharmaceutical companies can also better digitally manage functions such as supply chain, quality assurance and fraud prevention. If you look at what’s happening with Walmart and its foray into IBM’s Food Trust blockchain for tracing grocery provenance or its enormous supply and logistics blockchain, this same type of infrastructure can apply to better managing medications (not coincidentally, Walmart is also pursuing drug tracking blockchain systems with pharmaceutical partners).Pharmaceutical companies are also using blockchain to enable other revolutionary technologies in the pursuit of new treatments and products. In Europe this past summer, the blockchain-based Machine Learning Ledger Orchestration for Drug Discovery (MELLODDY) was launched to train machine learning on chemical libraries from Amgen, AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Janssen, Merck and Novartis, among other participating companies. According to The Lancet (registration required), MELLODDY will “accelerate the drug discovery process by making it easier to identify promising compounds” without having to pool data and while still preserving each company’s intellectual property, privacy, and control. Why Now? Blockchain’s emergence now springs from legacy technology’s inability to adapt to the enormous amounts of data now flowing from every interaction. There’s value in all that information, but only when it can be properly exchanged and digested while preserving the security and privacy protections essential to the sector.But there is no single blockchain platform for the world: It’s not like the internet. What we do have today — that was not available even a few short years ago — is a host of increasingly cross-functional blockchain-as-a-service platforms supported by reliable technology companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, IBM and others. Such off-the-shelf infrastructure frees healthcare organizations from needing to create their own blockchains and lets them simply develop or adopt more efficient applications that are built on a blockchain. That shift is game-changing.Because of this, we’re going to be using a lot more blockchain-powered technology platforms and apps to improve a lot of things in healthcare, including transaction logging, validation, contracts, health records, credentialing and more.Payment practices and pharmaceutical projects may lead the way, but 2020 will be the start of the blockchain decade across healthcare."

The industrial sectors are no exception, and they are being digitalized very quickly. According to the forecast from Huawei, conducted with Oxford Economics, digitalization will reach 24.3% of global GDP by 2025, which is about $23 trillion. Among the innovative tech tools used by industrial sectors is blockchain. In this article, I’ll discuss the areas where distributed computing technology is being used and the benefits it offers.Blockchain appeared in 2009 as the core technology of bitcoin, which was created by Satoshi Nakamoto. A few years later, blockchain became independent, affecting markets such as online finance, insurance, law and logistics, as well as other areas. Now, blockchain is also being used by various players in the industrial sectors.What Exactly Is Blockchain?Blockchain is a structured database based on chains of data blocks. The structure is subject to certain rules laid down by its creators. The difference between blockchain and all other databases is the complete absence of a single center. In this case, the database is available simultaneously to all users. If someone changes something, then all data from other users is almost instantly synchronized.The advantage of the technology is that the data added to the database cannot be deleted or changed by one user without displaying the changes to all the other owners. All changes are fixed; you cannot hide any operations. These properties make blockchain the most important tool available for exchanging data and protecting information.The benefits of blockchain are attractive to businesses. According to a study from PwC that polled 600 executives across the globe, 84% of respondents said they already use blockchain in their organization. In addition, 10% to 20% of the global economic infrastructure could operate based on blockchain. According to forecasts made by analytical agency Gartner, by 2030, the blockchain solutions market will be worth about $3.1 trillion.As co-founder of a blockchain investment platform, I have the opportunity to observe the blockchain market moods closely. From my point of view, now that they are quite familiar with blockchain's capabilities, industrial enterprises are beginning to implement it. Oil and gas companies, mining companies, pharmaceutical corporations, manufacturers of consumer goods and network technology developers, among a host of others, are beginning or continuing to implement blockchain technology.The Oil And Gas And Energy Sectors Blockchain in the energy sector allows users to monitor transactions, control output and verify the origin of certificates.There is a blockchain-based trading project with participants such as BP, Shell, and Statoil, as well as Gunvor, Koch Supply & Trading and Mercuria commercial enterprises and, from banking, ABN Amro, ING, and Societe Generale. They developed a digital platform for managing transactions in the energy market. The goal of the project’s authors is to reduce the dependence on traditional paper contracts and the kilograms of paper documentation used in favor of a digital registry.My opinion is that blockchain will give the energy sector the chance to reduce operating costs, accelerate domestic trading operations for all its energy supply chains and increase the reliability of their operations. Most projects are currently under development, but their relevance and importance have long been understood by representatives of industry. There is no doubt that over time, the number of blockchain solutions in various sectors of the economy will increase significantly, and the benefits of their implementation will become quite apparent.The Auto Industry Blockchain in the automotive industry is seen as a tool for the storage and transmission of data by smart cars. In addition, the technology can be used to store data about specific cars in various registries. Blockchain will not allow for the falsification of data about a car. For example, after a vehicle is put on the market, all data about it, including information about service and repairs, will be stored using blockchain. As a result, the owner of a car will be able, at any time, to check the number of repairs it has undergone, accident data and other information.Auto industry players have been exploring the possibilities of blockchain for several years. Two years ago, Toyota announced a new program to introduce blockchain into its smart car technology where a distributed registry is used as the basis for exchanging data between smart vehicles. A similar project is being implemented by General Motors, which patented its own technology in 2019. Volkswagen is developing a type of blockchain technology that allows smart cars to exchange information about road conditions. According to its developers, the project could reduce the number of accidents caused by poor-quality road surfaces, difficult weather conditions or other accidents.Consumer Goods Manufacturing Blockchain technology makes it possible to track the entire path of manufactured goods, from the shipping facilities at a factory to customers in stores. Due to the fact that blockchain is completely transparent, it makes it possible to coordinate transaction details among all participants in the production chain.One example of this is the tracking of counterfeit spare parts. In appearance, it is often difficult to distinguish these spares from the original ones. The percentage of low-quality spare parts among all after-market parts is quite high, and many of them quickly fail, which damages the reputation of dealers and car manufacturers alike. Using blockchain, an identifier can be created for each part that permits the tracking of the entire path of the spare part from the manufacturer to the client.For the world's largest companies, blockchain is no longer just technology of the future. Many companies are already implementing and using blockchain solutions. I believe that blockchain will have a positive impact on the fundamental principles of the systems that dominate the world today. I believe that blockchain has the potential to change this world more than the internet did."

[+] shops are likely to struggle due to the coronavirus. ","Square, the San Francisco payments company that helps small businesses accept credit cards, is getting hit much harder than most U.S. stocks. It was down 29% on Monday compared with 12% for the S&P 500. Since the market’s peak on February 19, Square has slumped more than 50%, versus a 30% fall for the S&P 500. That’s likely because American cities and states, spanning from California to Ohio and New York City, are ordering restaurants to shut their doors and limit their business to delivery and take-out orders. Historically, restaurants and coffee shops have been Square’s primary customers. Square makes money when consumers swipe their cards through the white credit card readers that sit near registers. If people can’t set foot in restaurants, Square’s revenue will fall, and its customers will suffer. “Barring a really aggressive response by the government to support these small businesses, a substantial portion will go bankrupt,” says Brett Winton, director of research at investment manager Ark Invest. As of last Friday, Ark had a $130 million position in Square in its flagship fund, making it the fund’s second-largest holding.E-commerce payments are a small part of Square’s business, says Jamie Friedman, an equity research analyst at quantitative trading firm Susquehanna. Sixty-five percent of Square’s revenue comes from the transaction fees merchants pay when they accept cards, and nearly all of that originates from swipes at physical stores. That’s likely why Square’s stock is falling faster than Visa and Mastercard’s, which are down about 13%—the credit card companies still make money when consumers place online orders. The current environment is a dramatic shift from three weeks ago, when the small business landscape had a bright outlook, Friedman adds. American Express’s 2019 annual report showed healthy demand from its many small business customers. “The overall risk to Square’s business is pretty unknowable,” he says. “But it doesn’t look good.” Winton has strong conviction that over the long term, Square will keep growing strongly, as it has since its 2015 IPO. “Generally, for the companies that we hold, we hold them on the basis of what the world will look like five years from now,” he says. He sees some silver linings in the coronavirus chaos. One is that business closures will force entrepreneurs to open new stores and to finally change their credit card readers. “People don’t like to change, so when they’re forced to change, they’ll often choose the disruptive-innovation company that was having trouble convincing them to get off a legacy system,” he says.  Winton also thinks the coronavirus will spur people to shun physical cash, which can carry germs, and move to electronic payments. Square would benefit from that through its Cash App, a money-transfer app that competes with Venmo and has 24 million active users, up from 15 million in December 2018. Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus"

As with Equifax, cyberattacks are often targeted at sites that will yield millions of SSNs at a time, allowing cybercriminals to steal “in bulk.”Which helps explain the revelation that any individual SSN can retail for as little as $4 on the darknet.And for that low cost, buyers often receive more than just somebody’s Social Security Number. According to Flashpoint, services sold on the dark web can be divided into four primary categories:For $4, in addition to the SSN, PII packages typically include the victim’s full name, driver’s license number, passport number, and email address.Financial information tends to be slightly more expensive than PII. Atlas VPN found that access to:Notably here: a victim’s credit score also impacts the price, with better scores going for higher price tags. A good credit score makes it easier for cybercriminals to commit fraud without financial institutions cutting them off. More like this on Forbes:Google Data Reveals 350% Surge In Phishing Websites During Coronavirus PandemicNew Survey Finds 22% Of Americans Have Been Targeted By Digital Fraud Related To COVID-19Interestingly, the price also depends on the victim’s credit score. The better the score, the higher the rate. Financial institutions view a good credit score favorably, which makes it easier to commit fraudulent transactions.Forged documents command the highest asking prices, with physical passport prices ranging from $2,980 to $5k. Meanwhile, the report found that a one-hour Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack, in which targeted servers are overwhelmed and effectively shut down, cost approx. $165. That cost increases by 2-5x when it involves attacking a government or bank website.This chart indicates the approximate cost of popular goods and services on the dark web.While these types of hacks and sales are ultimately impossible to prevent, individuals can take critical steps to safeguard accounts and information. Obviously, be as careful as is humanly possible with SSNs and passwords, and try to select security questions that involve answers that aren’t easily discoverable on the web.But two of the best steps you can take to secure your accounts that are often overlooked are freezing credit lines and securing your mobile devices. Credit accounts can be frozen for free at the three major reporting bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion). This restricts access to your records so new credit files cannot be opened in your name until your account has been unfrozen.Mobile devices, meanwhile, are notorious sites of scamming. There are simple techniques that will make you more difficult to hack, and to make it easier for you to identify if you’ve become the victim of identity theft.These steps are especially important amid an increase in cybersecurity threats as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.The full investigation can be found here."

Similarly to IPFS and its distributed web, content on the Internet now has the fortune of being permanently stored for eternity before it can be deleted and taken off the web by authorities, thus letting the power of information reign supreme.Arweave’s “permaweb” is identical to the normal web except everything is stored and timestamped permanently from documents, applications, data, images, and history altogether, through decentralized blockchain. The number of permanently stored pieces of data is more than a million, while almost 200 applications have been developed on Arweave’s platform. A “collectively owned hard drive that never forgets,” according to its website, which will allow full proof preservation of the Internet without the ability for disruption. “The normal web, where information is stored and centralized is only in one location. With a decentralized web it can shift over time,” explained Arweave founder Sam Williams. “The idea is to build a ‘Library of Alexandria’ that doesn't suck, with records of history and knowledge of every fact,” Williams explained further about Arweave’s goal of everlasting storage. “We can use modern blockchain technology to achieve that goal.”Knowledge, as Williams said, often takes the form of Arweave’s community-built perma-apps such as WeiBlocked, which discovers probable censored content on popular Chinese social media app Weibo. Once discovered, the content is indexed and decentralized in Arweave, then allowing for it to be checked at a later time if it is censored and highlighting it if so. All content is archived so if a post is removed by Weibo, it will still remain on WeiBlocked, thanks to Arweave.“We want to put power of the information space back in the hands of people,” said Williams of Arweave’s potential of everlasting content. “Once information is in our network, it is difficult to block, even in China.” Shining a light on questions to be asked in the future of ‘what is happening here’ or ‘what happened at this point in time’, are now able to be seen with the network’s capabilities.Arweave’s blockchain tokens are what its users pay for its permanent data storage on the permaweb. Storing data is supplied through an “economic endowment structure” meaning users pay a principle upfront then accrue interest in the shape of storage purchasing power. By offering hard drive space, users can earn profits through interest on storage contributions while allowing the ability for the network to live forever.Accomplishing this infinite longevity in data storage is owed in part to a $8.3 million funding round Arweave received from Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures, and Coinbase Ventures recently. With the money, the company plans to re-invest “directly into Arweave’s community: from builders to archivers and beyond.” The company wants to put the money back into its developer community though Arweave Grants, where users propose ideas for further use adoption of its protocol, and Arweave Boost, which offers up to $50K in data storage and mentorship for startups on its permaweb.In the case of clarity surrounding the coronavirus, people in the future will now be able to see history of the case without restriction or censorship. “Longterm, people will look back at the coronavirus and see it with 2020 vision,” Williams said of Arweave’s future permanent impression. “People can see what is happening today with the same clarity and data to support it, 20, 30, 50 years into the future.” Rather than having a problem of lack of information, such as the few fragments known looking back at the 1918 Spanish flu at a time when it was harder to get clear picture of how people felt as it was unfolding, blockchain is able to absolve this problem. Only time will tell, literally, if this information whether it was once censored or not, will forever live on the permaweb for future Internet users to see.“With timestamping the information space, people can understand the world today,” Williams expressed on the importance of time in its network. Arweave is determined to impact the way information can be recorded permanently making it impossible to alter or lose any data or information in a day in age where uncertainty lingers. “Future historians will look back at the information of today to make deductions and learn, so that in the future we can all make decisions better.” "

[+] via Getty Images)","Dutch bank ING has made an undisclosed investment into HQLAx, a Blockchain-based securities lending platform that helps improve collateral fluidity by creating a new, efficient, transparent, and more cost-effective marketplace for liquidity transfers.This is not the first dealings that ING and HQLAx have had with one another as, in early 2018, the bank, along with Credit Suisse, executed their first live transaction using HQLAx securities lending app on R3's Corda blockchain platform.In December 2019, the securities lending platform went commercially live with help from the ING blockchain team and has also already seen action by executing its first commercial live transaction with Commerzbank, Credit Suisse and UBS.The initial live securities trade on a blockchain platform saw an exchange of €25 million of high-quality liquid assets with Credit Suisse using the collateral lending application of HQLAx. This demonstrated a more powerful transaction as in a traditional settlement of a securities lending transaction, individual underlying securities are transferred between accounts. However, the intent of the operating model for the HQLAx collateral lending application was to achieve a legal title transfer of baskets of securities through the transfer of ownership of the unique DCR-linked accounts themselves. The investment in HQLAx from ING is not one that is without consideration as the ING team has been very much a part of growing the securities lending platform. This investment is an investment in an ING product as much as in HQLAx.“The successful commercial launch of HQLAx is a big milestone for the implementation of blockchain in the securities lending market and proof that blockchain can bring tangible benefits to the industry,” said Mariana Gomez de la Villa, head of ING’s blockchain team. “It’s rewarding to see that a project we’ve been working on for years, is now live.”The importance of implementing blockchain technology for this aspect of banking is one intended to tackle concerns over liquidity. Banks need high-quality liquid assets to meet tougher liquidity requirements under Basel III. These are assets that can easily and immediately be converted into cash without losing their value. However, holding too many lowers their return. Efficient trading allows banks to optimise their balance sheets.“HQLAx enables market participants to redistribute their collateral by exchanging the ownership of tokenized securities on Corda’s blockchain platform, which no longer requires the underlying securities to move across users. This removes settlement barriers and improves collateral fluidity, which in turn allows users to manage their liquidities easier, faster and more efficiently,” added Gomez de la Villa.When the first live securities lending transaction was settled using R3's Corda blockchain platform via the HQLAx platform, the potential for its application was quickly unlocked and apparent. Romain Dumas, Head of Rates Repo and Collateral Optimization at Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited, explained at the time of this initial transaction: ""The success of this first live transaction speaks to the potential for blockchain technology to help improve collateral fluidity by creating a more efficient, transparent, and cost-effective marketplace for liquidity transfers.""Paolo Muzzarelli, Head of Transaction Banking Products within Financial Institutions at Credit Suisse (Switzerland) Ltd., also said: ""As a provider of Transaction Banking services, it is of paramount importance to engage in technological change to understand and anticipate the future needs of our sophisticated client base."""

CTO of Swan Bitcoin. “As we transition to remote work, we'll learn to ...","Editors' Pick|Mar 22, 2020,08:00am EDT",Business leader looking out window.,"On good days, a leader’s job is simple: Keep the company running, employees productive, and customers happy.What distinguishes a great leader is how she responds in times of crisis. Does she panic, seeing uncertainty ahead? Or does she see the bigger picture — the fact that more than money is at stake; that people must put themselves and their loved ones ahead of business needs?Lives are on the line, and business leaders have a responsibility to be there for their communities, whether they can be there in person or not.Your employees and customers know that. What they are looking for is whether you’re up to snuff as a leader. Here’s how they decide:1. Concern for employeesGreat leaders care about their employees as people first and workers second. That distinction may not be noticed during a typical workday, but it becomes critical during a crisis. During the outbreak, leaders can show they care for employees by sharing the “why” behind business decisions. Consulting firm Credera’s CEO Justin Bell and Managing Partner Andrew Warden make it a point to overcommunicate and be transparent when sharing information with employees about their thought processes.Bell and Warden’s advice? Take a page from Ben Horowitz’s book, “The Hard Thing About Hard Things”: “Take care of the people, the products, and the profits — in that order.”2. Community engagementEvery company is part of a larger community. Employees use roads to get to work. Their children go to public schools. If they get sick, they go to a hospital for care. Companies in discretionary industries are an important part of their communities. They have the most to lose during a pandemic, but they also have the most to prove.Curtis Christopherson, president of Innovative Fitness and a friend of mine, knows people don’t have money to spend on high-end health services. Because he also knows people will struggle to stay fit at home, he’s unveiled a “Beat the Bug” fitness challenge. “We knew we had to do our part to flatten the curve,” Christopherson says. “The more seriously we take social distancing, the sooner we’ll all be back to normal.”Look for ways to give back from afar. Can you create an educational video on the dangers of hoarding food? What about a guide to proper hand-washing?3. A focus on the greater goalNobody starts — or works for — a company because they like to watch sales tick up. People are attracted to business because they want to build a better life for themselves and their families.Someone who recently reminded me of that is Yan Pritzker, co-founder and CTO of Swan Bitcoin. “As we transition to remote work, we’ll learn to be more productive in less time, get sick less often, travel more, and spend more time with our families,” Pritzker points out. “It’s important not to lose sight of why we work.”I admit, I’ve struggled with this. I’m in the midst of building Calendar, a productivity platform I co-founded. My goal is to help people spend more time with the people they care about — but I have to remind myself, it’s not signups or upsells that matter. What’s important is the opportunities I can create for personal connection.4. EmpathyIn a crisis, bad things happen to good people. Some people who do everything medical experts recommend to fight the virus — wash their hands, keep their hands away from their face, avoid unnecessary contact with others — will still get sick.Great leaders have empathy. They realize that going through hard times makes people stronger, and they encourage those people to push on. “What’s happening to these people during these moments?” asks Harvard Business School professor Nancy Koehn. “They are investing in themselves. They’re learning a great deal about their thinking and possible contribution to the great events of the day.”Investing in employees during tough times is the right thing to do. And once things return to normal, those workers’ experiences will only make them more valuable to the team. 5. A sense of opportunityThe Chinese symbol for “crisis” has two parts: one means “danger,” but the other means “opportunity.” The lesson is this: Leaders should respect the risk of the virus to their business (and health), but they shouldn’t forget that also it’s a chance to grow. Someone who reminded me of the good that can come from crises is professional dancer Ashleigh Dilello. At 13, Dillello was diagnosed with a life-threatening disease that caused her chronic pain and rapid weight gain. Although Dilello could have let it get her down, she used her diagnosis to step up. “Our brain’s primary purpose is to keep us safe, and one way it does so is by feeding our fear of failure,” she told me. “If I hadn’t repeatedly challenged my own brain’s limiting beliefs, I never would have survived my health crisis.”Just as Dilello’s illness helped her see her own strength, the virus will shake things up in ways we can’t yet see. Everyday people will do extraordinary things. Small businesses will make big impacts in their communities. It’s all about seeing those silver linings.Crises bring out the good in people as well as the bad. Companies must remember their role: It’s not to turn a profit; it’s to get the whole community rowing in the right direction. Great leaders know what an enormous responsibility that is."

So why can’t your computers do the same? ,"Imagine you’re CTO of a firm with lots of business relationships - any firm, in other words. How many times have you ruminated on the problem of staying in sync with all those other parties?You have an amazing way of communicating and sharing information with individuals in all the firms you work with; it’s called email. Everybody has it, everybody uses it; it just works. We take email for granted - and sometimes resent it. But the problem isn't too much of it... it's ... [+] too LITTLE! We lack a pervasive way for computers to email each other on our behalfBut when you try to communicate and share information with systems in the firms with which you work, it’s a nightmare! If you’re lucky, there’s a domain-specific network you can use, usually controlled by a monopolist who you have to watch like a hawk. Maybe, if you are really lucky, some of your customers or suppliers provide API endpoints you can call. But more often than not, you’re reliant on file passing and massively unsatisfactory ad-hoc methods.Sometimes it would be quicker to use a carrier pigeon to send data between firms than to use the ... [+] systems we sometimes rely onNow there is, of course, one obvious solution. Why not just set up a centralised database that you all work from? It could work in principle. But who would run it? Imagine what power a company would have if they ran the database that controlled an entire market!Sure.. a centralised database *could* make your market run more efficiently. But better pray it's a ... [+] good guy who runs that database...So that’s a non-starter. We simply can’t solve market-level problems with a centralised database. Instead, we have to figure out how to connect our existing systems, not introduce some all-seeing panopticon. We somehow need to link these existing systems, which are deployed in a decentralised fashion amongst all the firms in the industry, in much the same way that the people in these firms are linked by email.Now there are several historical, social and commercial reasons why this is hard and why previous attempts have usually failed. But in this post, I want to look forward. In particular, we can study a small number of motivating examples to show there is a real problem to be solved and then think through how we might, finally, allow machines to ‘email’ each other, just as easily as humans can:Sometimes the trick to solving a specialised problem in one industry is to use a common, generic technology that can be used by all industries.How would *you* solve the problem of getting computers in different companies to talk to each other ... [+] properly?Imagine you were tasked with designing a protocol that enabled computers in different companies to communicate with each other, loosely analogous to how email lets humans do it. What characteristics or capabilities would it need? What problems would it need to solve?I think the key things are: identity, location, reliable secure messaging, shared business logic and workflow and integration.Let’s take them in turn:IdentityYou don’t know anything about your counterparts’ IT systems but you at least want to know you’re actually talking to the right firm. So, there needs to be some way to address your messages to real-world identities rather than random strings.Maybe we can build on the existing email naming scheme for this or maybe we need something different, but the solution needs to take into account the fact that computers are unbelievably stupid.We get away with taking a lot of risks around identity in the regular email space because there are humans at each end of the connection who can be trained to figure out when they’re not talking to whom they should be or to detect when something isn’t quite right. For example, even if you know that Bill Gates’s email address at Microsoft was billg@microsoft.com, most people would be rightly suspicious if they ever received an email from that address. But when you take humans out of the loop, what are you supposed to do? How is one of your computers supposed to know that? Even with emails we see a huge amount of fraud and error.A stronger identity scheme is probably required. It’s tempting to say the public key infrastructure that protects the Web could help here but given the value that could be transacted over such a global network we should probably be pretty picky about which Certificate Authorities we trust and in which contexts. And it goes without saying that there should be no commercial entity with the power to deny access to such a network; allocation of names should work akin to something like how ICANN manages the DNS system.LocationWe also need the ability to locate services operated by our peers. Given that nobody knows better than your peer what services they offer, what protocols they support and how to find them, the solution should probably support some sort of “Peer Information” – or ‘PeerInfo’ – object concept: some authenticated way for a participant on the network to ‘assert’ things about themselves - “here’s what I offer; here’s how to find me” - and the authentication of that data structure should be strongly tied to the identity layer above.Asynchronous Secure MessagingNow it gets interesting. One of the amazing things about email is its asynchronous nature. I can send an email to you without needing you to be online – or even needing your company’s email server to be operating 24/7. It will eventually be delivered.We need the same thing for machines, and we also need to make sure it is secure. If one of my machines is sending a message to one of yours, it needs to be encrypted under a key that only your organisation has access to. So, we need something like the old MQ systems of the 2000s, that linked together machines inside companies, but toughened up and secured so they can be deployed across the howling prairie of the internet.Shared Business Logic and WorkflowImagine we’ve achieved all of the above. What should happen when a machine in somebody else’s firm receives a message from mine? With email, it’s easy. Some human reads it and figures out what to do.That’s fine for email. But humans are clever, and machines are stupid. For ‘email for machines’, we’re going to need to tell the computers what to do. And, if this is going to work without adult human supervision, we probably need a way to write business logic that encodes some sort of business process, for example, the process for agreeing an invoice or updating details on an insurance policy. This code will look a bit like an application and also a bit like a workflow… multiple firms would need to deploy code that can work with other firms’ computers running similar code but for any given interaction each firm’s role would probably be slightly different.So, we need some sort of application that can be distributed between participants in a business process, that is easy to write and which both captures business logic but also process and workflow logic.IntegrationFinally, we need a way to connect these ‘email for machine’ systems back to the existing systems inside each firm. We need to be able to automatically integrate with these existing systems.Good news… Email for machines exists today!This combination of institutional-grade identity management; self-sovereign service advertisement; secure asynchronous messaging; shared business and flow logic; and integration capabilities is the essence of what you need to link applications in different firms together.And the interesting thing is: it already exists. You might know it by its more common name: Enterprise Blockchain. Those of us working on blockchains in business contexts don’t always talk about it this way: but this is what’s going on at the heart of many of the projects we’re working on. If I look at a lot of the places where enterprise blockchains being deployed, a key part of the value being added depends on their ability to provide a neutral, shared, non-exclusionary, reliable substrate for ‘email’ between machines.After all, if you couldn’t ensure the right firms received the right information at the right time and that they were going to process it in the way you expected, none of the transformational benefits I so often write about could possibly be achieved.Some platforms take this further than others, of course. The platform I helped design, Corda, has a particular focus on fusing identity, routing, asynchronous secure messaging and common business logic between firms, but we’re not alone. These things may not sound earth-shattering but maybe that’s the point: none of us claim to be magicians; all of us in this space are just trying to do old fashioned engineering, focused on solving market-level problems. Do all enterprise blockchains work the same way?In time, I suspect they will. Indeed, there are efforts in the Ethereum community, for example, to add support for some of these concepts to the enterprise variants of the platform over time. Baseline is one example - it’s pretty early days but there are lots of very similar concepts there to those I outlined above.But that triggers an interesting question. Imagine we ended up with feature parity between Corda, Ethereum, Fabric and all the others. What would happen then?I suspect we’d then see the ages-old “consensus conundrum” rear its ugly head again! The “consensus conundrum” is that you need to think about how transactions are processed and confirmed on the networks to which you deploy your applications because “finality” is a slipperier topic than any of us would like.For example, imagine you’d deployed an “email for machines” solution that utilised a permissionless underlying blockchain for its transaction processing, and you’d been using it during the recent convolutions in the market owing to the current health crisis. Would a multi-hour backlog have been acceptable?We wouldn’t accept multi-hour delays for emails between people, and nobody is going to accept it with email for machines.So, as ever, focus on your requirements, and match the technology to the problem to be solved."

Do you wait for the ...","Mar 21, 2020,10:10am EDT",Getty,"To be sure, no one expected stocks to notch big double-digit losses in just two weeks, and while I don’t know when a rebound will happen (anyone who claims they do is lying), the economic numbers do carry a ray of light.So let’s dive into them, and talk a little bit about the 18 funds in our CEF Insider portfolio, too.Of Lizards and DividendsFirst, there’s one thing we must not do at a time like this: follow our “lizard brain”: the primeval part of our thought process that tells us to flee when danger rears up, to keep our precious capital safe.The problem, of course, is knowing when to get back in after you sell. Do you wait for the number of new coronavirus cases to peak? So is everyone else. By then, most of the rebound will be behind us.This conundrum, in one form or another, has plagued investors in meltdown after meltdown. Study after study shows that this is where most bears lose the script: they sell at the worst time, then wait too long to get back in, leaving the biggest gains (and highest dividend yields) for us savvy second-level investors to grab.You can see this fatal flaw in a study by Dalbar Inc.: according to the market-research firm, the S&P 500 posted an average annualized return of 9.85% a year in the 20 years ending December 31, 2015. But the average investor got only a little over half that, 5.19%, mainly because their lizard brain got the best of them when trouble hit.You likely know someone who did this during the 2008/2009 financial crisis. Odds are, they still haven’t made up those losses, despite the fact that the S&P 500 has returned more than 300% since it bottomed in March 2009.We’re not going to make that mistake, especially when there are so many cheap high-dividend options available in our CEF Insider portfolio, which yields upwards of 10% as I write this. These dividends are safe, so you can enjoy them while we wait for the inevitable rebound to come.Meantime, you can rest assured that I’m keeping the portfolio under constant surveillance, and will let you know the moment we need to make any changes.In Good News: A Recession Is Already Priced InIt’s no surprise, after the wave of shutdowns we’ve seen across the economy, that many economists are now predicting a recession. I, too, can see GDP growth going negative for a couple of quarters in the US.But that, again, does not mean it’s time to sell stocks. Let’s dive into the history—and the current economic numbers—so I can show you why I feel that way.The most important thing to keep in mind is that this recession will be nothing like 2007-09. That collapse caused consumer spending to freeze up and asset prices to crash because of fundamental flaws in the financial system—flaws that have since been mostly addressed.This current crisis is an unexpected shock to the market that came from the outside. That’s structurally different from the shock of 2007-09, which was more like a house of cards suddenly falling apart.That’s why I expect the 2020 recession to be more like the 1990 recession. If you are too young to remember, that recession was an eight-month slowdown resulting from oil doubling in price as a result of Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait. This was another unexpected shock from an external source, and it caused US stocks to fall 19.9% during the period. But by the time the economic slowdown had ended, stocks had fully recovered.Fast-forward to today: if a recession does come, markets won’t be shocked. This means there is upside to buying stocks—or better yet, closed-end funds (CEFs) that invest in stocks—now, especially on the possibility that this recession doesn’t actually happen, or is mild and short-lived.Here’s something else to consider: as more countries boost their ability to test for COVID-19, the virus’s current death rate will likely come down as more mild or asymptomatic cases are uncovered. That could go a long way toward easing people’s fear, meaning consumer activity could start to resume sooner rather than later, softening or pre-empting the recession everyone expects.The Oil Crash: America Will BenefitNow let’s talk about the other side of the meltdown story: oil, which has tumbled since the Saudi Arabia-Russia price war broke out.The price war terrified markets, arguably more than the coronavirus did. But is there reason to sell US stocks because of oil’s crash?Obviously, energy stocks should fall due to this trend, and dividend traps like master limited partnerships (MLPs) remain an unsafe place to keep your cash. But should other US stocks fall because one of their biggest costs—energy—has suddenly gotten cheaper?Energy Deserves Its Selloff—the Others Don’tEnergy as a portion of the S&P 500 has been falling for years, and is now just 9% of the index. But market panic caused the other 91% to sell off in sympathy, even though what’s bad for energy is great for sectors like utilities (which buy energy) and consumer-discretionary firms (which stand to book extra sales as cheaper gas leaves more money in consumers’ pockets).That makes the Utilities Select Sector (XLU) and Consumer Discretionary Select Sector (XLY) ETFs decent buys, but it’s even better to lock in a higher dividend to keep us flush in income through these turbulent times, and we can do that through high-yielding CEFs in those sectors. A good example is the Cohen & Steers Infrastructure Fund (UTF), which yields 11.2% as I write this and trades at a 9.6% discount to net asset value (NAV).We’ve seen this before.Oil Crashes, Stocks Hesitate—Then RiseWhen oil crashed in 2014, stocks immediately fell as the market panicked, and then everyone remembered that cheap oil is actually great for the economy. Stocks are up 37.8% since that happened, even after the recent crash.Quantitative EasingI’ve saved the best for last: the Federal Reserve has swung into action.Following the recent bear market, the Fed announced it will buy $1.5 trillion worth of Treasuries, effective immediately. This is very fast action; in the Great Recession, the Fed waited months before it began its quantitative easing (QE) programs, which is why the bear market then lasted for months. But we’ve learned that fast QE saves economies, so there’s no political opposition, and the Fed can act fast.If you doubt QE is good for stocks, just turn to 2013. Back then, the Fed spent less than $1 trillion on bonds, and stocks soared!While we can’t expect 2020 to be a year where stocks go up 30%, it is very possible that stocks could go up 30% from their bottom in much less time than most people think. Which means investors we now have a great buying opportunity, but the window is closing fast.Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

[+] more control over what you share.","Public data breaches are everywhere, and despite growing awareness of the need for better data security, they don’t seem to be slowing down. Take the recent hack of Clearview AI: hackers exposed the firm’s customer list, including many law enforcement agencies and details relating to the searches they conducted using Clearview’s data. In this climate, the idea of managing your personal data out there on a blockchain might seem crazy. But in fact, blockchain does provide a secure method of managing access to data, and using blockchain could put people back in the driver’s seat when it comes to controlling what data they share.I’ve already explored some of the unintended consequences of the gig economy, and data ownership is a central factor. Looking more closely at the rideshare ecosystem, one concern is that drivers don’t own their reputation. Reputational data including star rating, number of completed rides and distance driven belong to the ride-share platform. This is a significant worry. If these reputation metrics were recorded on a blockchain, drivers would be able to keep tabs on their standing, benchmark their performance against industry trends, and most importantly, carry their profile over to other platforms to optimize their business as “independent contractors”. This would let them maximize their opportunities to earn income without being reliant on a single app or platform.Blockchain isn’t just applicable to accessing personal data in the gig economy. Until the Equifax data breach hit the news in September 2017, most of us would have had no idea that credit score companies were systematically collecting, aggregating and selling our personal information, without our knowledge or consent. After all, it’s our sensitive personal financial data. It’s reasonable to assume that when we entrust that information to a third party, particularly one in the financial services business, that they would regard its security as highly as we do! But if we managed that information on the blockchain, we would know that it was secure, and we would have control over who had access to it. In broad terms, blockchain gives individuals a flexible way to control their data and content. The ability to link to a verified online identity ensures that personal information is both securely stored, and readily available to be shared under the right permissions. Further, smart contracts can be used to control access based on user-defined agreements. The privacy and encryption capabilities of blockchain are improving constantly, with several organizations including The Open Application Network working to develop better privacy protocols for blockchain.  Modern digital platforms pose risks for anyone reliant on those platforms for income; what happens to drivers if their ride-hailing platform is shut down or legislated out of their city? Blockchain eliminates these worries. It offers a flexible way for independent contractors to curate their reputation across a broad marketplace rather than on a singular platform. It doesn’t matter whether you’re an Uber driver or someone whose data has been stolen, we’re all getting tired of the rent-seeking behavior from giant platforms. In a world where efforts to monetize our actions for the benefit of mega platforms have become the norm, what’s the solution? We can put individuals back in control of their data, with blockchain’s decentralized ownership model. That would be a good first step."

little in common with testing Bitcoin- or Hyperledger-based solutions.","Mar 12, 2020,08:40am EDT",Photo:,"Blockchain technology has been explored for healthcare, financial services (paywall), intellectual property protection and even photojournalism usage. Gartner predicts that by 2023, blockchains will support the movement and tracking of $2 trillion worth of goods and services per year. In my company, we also use blockchains as an additional layer of security in our products. However, this architectural decision affects the way you should test your software.Software testing helps ensure strong data security, smooth application performance and an enjoyable user experience. The testing basics are pretty standard for all kinds of software. But it turns out there are some peculiarities to building a testing strategy for blockchain-based solutions.Planning is always the first step.When we first started adding blockchain features to our products, it became obvious that simply running tests as you go is not the best scenario. There are just too many things that can negatively affect test outcomes.For example, some of the important development aspects include the way you handle source code and branches and what environments you use in the project matter. And when these aspects are ignored, it can be difficult or even impossible to introduce improvements later in the product development life cycle. So it’s crucial to start planning a testing strategy long before the actual development begins. This way, you can ensure the quality of the final product and spend less time on tests.A testing strategy should specify in detail what you'll test, how and when (for every stage of the project). It should also note what tools and approaches you can use to do this. In my company, testing strategies also help us structure and organize specific, complex testing processes and thus improve our overall teamwork.During our first blockchain-related projects, we followed industry-recognized standards, such as IEEE 829-2008, to bring order to our test documentation and get the most out of it. But as the number of such projects grows, you may want to create your own methodology for testing blockchain-based products based on industry standards and your own experience.It's important to understand your product.Successful testing begins with a deep understanding of your project’s characteristics. For instance, testing applications built on Ethereum will probably have little in common with testing Bitcoin- or Hyperledger-based solutions. That’s why your software testing team should master the basics of blockchain technology and the peculiarities of the particular platform before running any tests.At the same time, blockchains are often used as part of a more complex solution. Therefore, to plan testing activities for such a product, you'll also need extensive knowledge of tools and technologies from outside the blockchain domain.For example, many of today’s blockchain-based applications use application programming interface (API) protocols, so knowing the basics of API testing will surely be a plus. Knowledge of the following will also be useful:• Continuous integration/continuous delivery tools and processes.• Standard monitoring systems and tools.• Blockchain-specific tools and frameworks.Planning your tests in detail can also help you eliminate hidden and unobvious obstacles. For example, in one of our recent projects, we needed to build and test several product components in parallel. When we were planning our tests, we had to analyze and take into account all interconnections and dependencies between these components. Otherwise, we risked significantly overspending on our testing resources and slowing down the overall development process.Also, I advise you to share a draft of your testing strategy with all project stakeholders before releasing the final version. That’s what we often do at my company to get valuable insights and advice on how to improve the document.The complexity of the blockchain can significantly expand the scope of necessary tests. This is why preparing a testing strategy is an important phase of building applications with blockchain features. The more well-thought-through your strategy is, the greater your chance will be of creating a quality product that performs at its best."

with ...","Editors' Pick|Mar 9, 2020,03:00am EDT","Market circuit breakers are intended to manage liquidity gaps, but are seldom used. (Photo by David ... [+] Dee Delgado/Getty Images)","With the recent market volatility, a reminder on how circuit breakers work may be timely. Essentially circuit breakers temporarily pause trading once certain decline thresholds are met and can ultimately close the market early should the decline be sufficiently large.For the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) circuit breakers have three tiers. These circuit breakers react to the price change in the S&P 500. The first tier is a 7% decline in the S&P 500. Should that occur, trading will pause for 15 minutes. The next level is a 13% decline, that causes another 15 minute pause if it happens on or before 3.25pm. Finally should the markets fall 20% the markets will close for the day. All these price changes are relative to the previous trading day’s close.At the time of writing, these circuit-breakers have not been triggered in their current form. However, the events of 2020 could perhaps change that because volatility is approaching the elevated levels not seen since 2008-9 and daily price swings have been very large. However, even then usage of the first tier of the circuit breaker is by far the most likely. 7% one-day declines do happen, though they are rare. The only historical event for the S&P 500 that would have theoretically breached the other circuit breakers is Black Monday of October 1987.The circuit-breakers seem most useful in liquidity events. If there are issues with order flow, then circuit-breakers can enable market makers to regroup over a 15 minute interval and perhaps bring the markets closer to balance. This may have been the issue on Black Monday when programmatic selling due to portfolio insurance, may have overwhelmed the market causing a massive price decline. However, if a circuit breaker is triggered not by liquidity issues, but by newsflow then the value is less clear. For example, if the combination of the coronavirus and the oil price cause the markets to materially and rapidly reevaluate prospects for global economic growth, then a 15 minute pause in trading may be less useful. That is to say a 15 minute pause may not change anything if a view is fundamentally held. Of course, should a decline be due to one-off technical factors, the a pause may be extremely valuable.Furthermore, there are some implications from overlapping global markets. If one market such as the NYSE triggers a circuit breaker, but other markets remain open, then it is highly likely that investors will still find a route to obtain their desired exposure in a different market not subject to a circuit breaker at the time. Again, this gets to the point that circuit breakers help manage times of issues with liquidity, if there truly is an event that radically changes perceptions of valuation or growth, then circuit breakers are likely less valuable. Nonetheless, based on market history it appears usage of circuit breakers will be rate."

(AP ... [+] Photo/Matt Rourke),"Everything about coronavirus life feels unprecedented. And that’s the adjective United States Attorney Scott Brady used when talking to Forbes about the level of COVID-19 scams he and his law enforcement colleagues are expecting. “The closest analogy is the kind of fraud that we saw relating to Hurricane Katrina,” he says. “I think we are really going to see an unprecedented wave of cyber attacks and cyber fraud. And that's what we're trying to prepare our partners and the public for.”He’s been one of the more active prosecutors preparing for the deluge of cases related to coronavirus-capitalizing crooks. On Tuesday, after attorney general William Barr called on U.S. attorneys to double down on efforts to counter such criminality, he announced America’s first COVID-19 fraud coordinator. He gave the job to assistant attorney Shaun Sweeney, who will oversee the prosecution of fraud resulting from coronavirus scammers. On the homepage of the Western District of Pennsylvania’s DOJ office website, there’s also a handy button that takes the user through to a page where scam victims can find out how best to report crimes and how to avoid them in the first place.Brady is also following Dave DeVillers, attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, in announcing that the threshold for initiating fraud cases is being ignored for coronavirus-related scams. For any other fraud, DeVillers told Forbes on Monday, there’s a minimum fraud cost required before any investigation is launched, which is usually in the tens of thousands.Despite the changes in how the DOJ and investigating agencies like the FBI are having to operate because of orders to distance themselves from one another, Brady thinks it won’t make much of an impact on their work. “We all have telecommuting capabilities, and can coordinate and investigate remotely,” he adds, saying that where they get subpoenas or search warrants, they’re executing them with all “the same precautions of self-distancing that the public should be taking.”Coronavirus scams a big threat to the elderlyBrady says that his team’s efforts are there to make it as simple as possible for the public to report scams. “The most vulnerable population to COVID-19 scams are people who are maybe 60 and older,” Brady says. “So we want to make sure that they have information on what we're seeing, the types of fraud and scams to be aware of, and then most importantly, just having a contact for our office for the FBI for some of our other federal partners so that we can you know, they can contact us and we can start investigations and stop that kind of problem.”Brady’s office has only received a couple of calls since launching the COVID-19 fraud page on Tuesday. But he’s keen to hear from the public about the kinds of illicit activity they’re seeing. “We want to know all the types of scams that are out there, because the reality is any one individual victim might only be victimised for, you know, some of the ransomware schemes that might be $100 of Bitcoin. But undoubtedly, that is not the only victim,” he adds. “Most of these frauds are going to be broader and have a more significant financial harm.”Onslaught of COVID-19 fraudCoronavirus-themed frauds have been varied and pervasive. On Wednesday, a new strain of Android malware was seen mimicking a coronavirus map, whilst having the power to spy on victims through their smartphone camera or microphone. Phishing emails claiming to come from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health organizations, promising information on coronavirus treatments and information, have also been spreading fast. And one group of researchers said on Tuesday they saw more than 2,500 successful attacks on Windows PCs using coronavirus information as a lure in less than 24 hours.Brady’s team will also be dealing with attacks by nation state-sponsored hacking crews and hits on healthcare bodies. Earlier this week, the Health and Human Services (HHS) department said it had fought off an attempted attack on its systems. “We have not seen anything like that yet in Western Pennsylvania, but we're prepared for that,” adds Brady.Forbes has been maintaining a list of coronavirus-themed online attacks out there, which you can find here.Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus"

Bottom Line For Binance Charity Is 'Bottom Billion', Fights COVID-19 ...","Mar 16, 2020,01:08pm EDT","Provenance data, powered by blockchain and IoT technologies, is adding a new, digital dimension to the procurement and re-use of raw materials. How will these value chains benefit all stakeholders?","Small-scale producers in Tanzania benefit from blockchain solutionsThe celebrated French playwright Jean Racine once wrote: “There are no secrets that time does not reveal.” His words may have rung true in 17th century Paris, but within global supply chains, the facts can be harder to find. As goods and services are traded, the background information is often locked away or lost in translation. For centuries, the reliable passage of commodities and materials has mattered more than the accurate flow of data.Of course, an interesting piece of provenance will raise the value of an item, especially in the hands of a skilled marketer. However, brands can show signs of ‘selective memory’ when it comes to sharing provenance with customers. At worst, this cherry-picked provenance can be used as a smoke screen for what’s really going on. Audiences are often happy to accept the back story on trust, because they want to buy into the sense of quality or nostalgia.But what is provenance after all? In a global and complex marketplace, with often opaque supply chains, consumers are more and more interested to know exactly what is the source of the products they purchase. Are they sustainably sourced? How fair are their business practices towards local producers, and what is the impact on the environment of their supply chain? Who exactly has worked on my product throughout its life cycle, and where has it been? Where will it go after it leaves me? To address this lack of awareness, blockchain technology can be implemented in supply chains to increase awareness of an asset’s provenance. For too long, provenance has offered a garnish rather than the main meal. Well, no more. The world of business is changing – and provenance is beefing up. Three key drivers are pushing it up the agenda. The business imperative for provenance transparencyFirstly, we now care more, as a society, about where things come from. We have recognized the need to stamp out unethical practices and protect our planet. Provenance has grown a moral and environmental backbone.It’s not enough for corporations and governments to pay lip service to fair working conditions, climate change or plastic waste. Targets and commitments from the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals are just part of the equation. Customers and voters expect to see tangible progress or they will look for alternatives. Young people, in particular, won’t tolerate more of the same. This growing burden of evidence is fast becoming a business and political ultimatum: prove your credentials or step aside. The second game-changer is that technology is making provenance real. Welcome to e-provenance. It’s now possible to surface and converge information from across a supply chain in ways that are both accessible and unalterable. Blockchain, in tandem with other technologies such as artificial intelligence, Internet of Things and nanotechnology, can help to turn knowledge and data from the supply chain into a force for good. The final driver is that provenance adds a new stream of value. Companies like Everledger, for example, aim to help turn one-dimensional supply chains into vibrant value chains. What’s the difference? Traditional supply chains represent all the steps required to get the physical product to the customer. Modern value chains will grow the worth of raw materials by adding their digital twins and provenance data. Instead of a static linear diagram on a page, companies can present customers (and regulators) with a textured story full of human and physical detail. Technology allows us to trace a mineral or material from extraction, refinement, first use, re-use and decommission, as needed. We can show the who, where and how in high definition. By making the past come alive, provenance can play a dynamic role in the present and also reach into the future, as the world evolves towards the circular economy. From shareholders to stakeholdersE-provenance is not just the right thing to do – it’s good for business too. If, as many people predict, the global business model will shift from shareholder profits to stakeholder benefits, then the accepted notion of value will change too. Provenance will be bound into the bottom line. Government policy makers will incentivize corporations to act in a transparent way and collaborate openly with others, because that’s what their voters want to see happen. Those that resist this change risk finding themselves marginalized. Data will be the life force of this brave new world. Businesses that can monitor, evaluate and demonstrate their positive impact to each other, governments and their customers are set to win. They will monetize the competitive advantages of provenance and transparency. Technology such as blockchain can also help to build trusted communities where rivals and unlikely trade partners are able to share knowledge about their respective value chains. As traceability technologies help value chains to overlap and feed off each other, they will open new streams of innovation and unlock corners of the economy that haven’t yet been imagined. Just as access trumps ownership in the gig economy, sparking a $1 trillion industry, so value chains can trump supply chains, as more and more industries speak to the truths of their supply and activities.The power of small-scale producersGlobally there are many known barriers to success for emerging economies and small-scale producers alike: lack of access to finance, lack of access to raw materials, lack of business knowledge and skills training, sourcing bottlenecks, prohibitive shipping costs, lack of access to local and global markets, and life/work imbalance, to name just a few. It is generally agreed that we must work to move the continuum of small-scale producers, such as artisanal miners, from subsistence labor force, up the value chain to makers and co-creators in the greater context of the creative economy. Given all of the challenges, the key question is how do we drive change for small-scale producers? What type of focus is needed? How do we begin to understand the complexities of artisan value chains so that we may design innovations appropriate for small-scale stakeholders that ultimately bring greater opportunity, improve livelihoods, and increase the economic prosperity of local communities?For years, corporations have built systems and trade mechanisms for the buying and selling of goods and services. But there was never a platform to enable, demonstrate and mobilize provenance. That needs to change. In fact, it’s already happening, with the help of blockchain technology. And the change is visible, for big corporations and for small-scale producers alike. It creates value and, most importantly, it changes lives for the better.Jean Racine will be proved right, after all."

Now, new data analyzed by Atlas VPN is shedding more light on the scope of this cybercrime.According to the report, in Jan., Google registered 149k active phishing websites. In February, that number nearly doubled to 293k. In March, though, that number had increased to 522k—a 350% increase since January.The daily increases during the month of March also offer insight into fraud. Data from a RiskIQ scan of websites with suspicious coronavirus-related keywords indicates that 317k new websites were created during the two-week period between Mar. 9-23.Mar. 11 and Mar. 21 saw the steepest day-over-day increases, at 278% and 312%, respectively. Mar. 11 was the day the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Mar. 20 was the day when New York, Illinois, and Connecticut joined California and Pennsylvania in ordering some form of shutdown—offering insight into the surge on Mar. 21, which also saw the single greatest daily leap, with 67k new suspicious websites created. While RiskIQ’s scan is only based on keyword search, ZDNet has been checking these sites at random, finding that roughly nine out of ten were in fact malicious or attempting to generate sales of fake supplements. “I believe that hackers identified coronavirus as something users are desperate to find information on,” Atlas VPN COO Rachel Welch said in a statement. “Panic leads to irrational thinking and people forget the basics of cybersecurity. Users then download malicious files or try to purchase in-demand items from unsafe websites, in result becoming victims of scams.”"

Semiannual and annual levels remain on the charts. Each uses the last nine closes in these time horizons.Second quarter 2020 and monthly levels for April will be established based upon the March 31 closes. New weekly levels are calculated after the end of each week. New quarterly levels occur at the end of each quarter. Semiannual levels are updated at mid-year. Annual levels are in play all year long.My theory is that nine years of volatility between closes are enough to assume that all possible bullish or bearish events for the stock are factored in. To capture share price volatility investors should buy on weakness to a value level and reduce holdings on strength to a risky level. A pivot is a value level or risky level that was violated within its time horizon. Pivots act as magnets that have a high probability of being tested again before its time horizon expires.How to use 12x3x3 Weekly Slow Stochastic Readings:My choice of using 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic readings was based upon back-testing many methods of reading share-price momentum with the objective of finding the combination that resulted in the fewest false signals. I did this following the stock market crash of 1987, so I have been happy with the results for more than 30 years. The stochastic reading covers the last 12 weeks of highs, lows and closes for the stock. There is a raw calculation of the differences between the highest high and lowest low versus the closes. These levels are modified to a fast reading and a slow reading and I found that the slow reading worked the best. The stochastic reading scales between 00.00 and 100.00 with readings above 80.00 considered overbought and readings below 20.00 considered oversold. A reading above 90.00 is considered an “inflating parabolic bubble” formation that is typically followed by a decline of 10% to 20% over the next three to five months. A reading below 10.00 is considered as being “too cheap to ignore” which typically is followed by gains of 10% to 20% over the next three to five months. —-Want to learn how to integrate trading levels into your everyday trading strategy? Check out my new publication, 2-Second Trader."

","The coronavirus is already causing a sharp drop in the number of hours people are working in places like Washington, D.C., and New York State. New data from Earnin, a personal finance app with millions of users that helps people access their already-earned wages immediately after they leave work each day, gives an early indication into the economic impact of the pandemic. In New York and Rhode Island, people worked 27% fewer hours on Monday, March 16 than they did on Monday, March 9. (On March 15, New York City ordered all non-essential businesses like restaurants to be closed, limiting them to take-out and delivery orders. New York State and Rhode Island followed the next day.) In Washington, D.C., people worked 40% fewer hours on March 16 compared with a week prior. In Massachusetts, they logged 24% fewer hours. This data comes from tens of thousands of Earnin’s users, 70% of which are hourly wage earners. Many of them work in industries like retail, healthcare, hospitality and government or at restaurants and call centers. Earnin is an eight-year-old company based in Silicon Valley, and it uses cell phone data like users’ GPS location to understand how many hours they’ve worked each day. Earnin’s data highlights an unfortunate truth: The people living paycheck-to-paycheck, or about three in every four American adults, will be the hardest hit by the current recession. “When no one can eat at the restaurant you work at, there are no tips ... Almost no one is traveling. Hotels don't need housekeeping. Casinos in Vegas are closed,” Earnin CEO Ram Palaniappan tweeted on Wednesday. “The financial crisis will show up before the health crisis is done. It could lead to more unrest and divisiveness OR it could be the moment we all pull together and help each other.”On Thursday, the Department of Labor said unemployment claims had risen to 281,000 for the week ending March 14—an increase of 70,000 from the week prior—reaching their highest level since September 2017. With Earnin’s unique early-indicator data, Palaniappan wants to help policymakers who are trying to make quick decisions on how to aid struggling Americans. Recently, New York State suspended mortgage payments for borrowers in hardship, and the federal government passed a law giving paid leave to people affected by the coronavirus. Palaniappan says the government could theoretically use Earnin’s payment rails to send money to Americans more quickly.

Nike, for example, recently pulled its products from Amazon in part to try to mitigate the damaging effects that counterfeit goods were having on its brand. While this will certainly help and is a step in the right direction, it barely scratches the surface of a long-term solution.The Threatening Power Of Counterfeit Goods What is the real threat of counterfeit goods?First and foremost, it’s the fact that a counterfeit product equals a low-quality product. While this might not seem like a serious threat (and for those who knowingly buy knock-offs for superficial reasons, it’s not), the truth is that poor quality items can have real, dire consequences. Consider knock-off makeup and skincare products. The package and product might look identical to the authentic brand, but when applied, they can cause skin infections and rashes.Another alarming example of these consequences is in the electronics industry. Counterfeit automotive parts, smartphone/tablets and even vapes can cause serious personal injury and even death.Inevitably, these consequences have a severe negative impact on a brand’s reputation and, in turn, consumer trust. Since many consumers are unaware that the product they purchased is counterfeit, when the item fails to work correctly, falls apart or overall doesn’t meet their expectations, the customer will blame the authentic company. This results in the customer losing trust in the brand and also likely means that they won’t purchase from the retailer in the future.There is also a business threat of counterfeit products, as it results in a loss of revenue for the brand that is being copied. Simply put, when counterfeiters sell a product that looks the same as the original but at a lower price, the authentic brand will lose sales. Not so long ago, consumers were able to identify fakes fairly easily. Now, with the explosion of e-commerce and social media, the lines between real and fake are much more blurred.Unfortunately, many online retailers don’t have the knowledge or tools to filter counterfeit products. Even so, it’s more important than ever for businesses to protect themselves (and their customers) to ensure the perception of their brand is not undermined by counterfeit goods.How Retailers Can Gain Their Control Back Retailers must invest in stopping the problem before it happens or, worse, becomes rampant and more difficult to regulate.Here are a couple of important ways that retailers can claim back control in the fight against counterfeits:Coming Together To Curb Counterfeiting: A Key Priority In 2020 The risks of counterfeiting are real. Brands in all sectors -- from fashion to health/beauty and electronics -- are grappling with how to ensure their brand reputation is not diminished through scammers selling fake versions of their products.There is some good news: Retailers and governments are recognizing the danger of counterfeiting and are pledging action to combat it. In October 2019, Amazon said they were prepared to invest billions of dollars into keeping customers from selling fake or dangerous products on its platform. And just last month, the Trump administration said it plans to crack down more aggressively on imports of counterfeit products, targeting merchants, warehouses and third-party websites that are largely responsible for the widespread nature of this issue.The overwhelming popularity and increased dominance of e-commerce isn’t going away anytime soon. It will be the combined effort of forward-looking brands, retailers and governments that will stop counterfeiting in its tracks in 2020."

[+] United States.","Yes, the coronavirus pandemic is unprecedented in modern times in terms of danger and the speed of its impact on the economy.However, we can learn from one past U.S. President how resilient and agile the U.S. economy can be, especially when everyone works together toward a single goal.The man in question is President Harry Truman, who in 1946 had the unenviable task of switching the U.S. economy from the sole goal of winning WWII, and back to normality. Politically, he had to win the peace. Among other things Kenneth Weisbrode writes about that process of transforming the economy in his book: The Year of Indecision, 1946: A Tour Through the Crucible of Harry Truman's America.What he tells us about Truman’s struggle is instructive in the current crisis because while the two events are different there are parallels.In 1946, with Germany, Italy and Japan all defeated, and the fighting over, the constant production of tanks, warplanes, warships and everything else would need to slow to a trickle from its previous torrent.But at the same time, hundreds of thousands of war veterans were returning home in search of jobs, and homes. Many wanted to start families. Companies that had made tanks and other military equipment would need to retool to make cars and passenger aircraft.In short, Truman would need to stop the war economy and start the peace economy. Politically this had to be done with as much speed and as little disruption as possible.The fact that so few people even know about this forgotten event tells us how well Truman did in achieving it. And yes there was some disruption with mass layoffs, falling wages and rising price levels. But when the switch was done, the U.S. entered one of its golden ages; the couple of post-war decades of what now look like economic bliss with low unemployment and low inflation.Right now the U.S., and many other countries, face a similar need to switch the economy. For the time being, gone will be the consumer economy, in its place will be the pandemic-fighting economy. Government instructions to stay home are a key part of that.We need mass production of ventilators and other medical equipment to treat the sick. Already companies are doing their bit.Vaccines need to be developed as fast and safely as possible. Research has been happening these past few weeks. Hundreds of millions of testing kits need to get mass produced. Medical staff need to come out of retirement. Employees, where they are able, need to work from home. Companies need to adapt.These things are in the works already. Then, when the battle against the pandemic is over we need to switch back to normality. The coffee shops need to reopen along with the parks and the restaurants.With business and government working diligently this can happen and at speed. With luck we get through the mess quickly. Hopefully, the fatalities and human suffering can be kept to a minimum.Truman didn’t face a viral enemy so the parallels to the current crisis aren’t perfect. But he did need to change what the U.S. was doing, and he succeeded. He did that with just a fraction of the resources now available to the U.S. and the European Union.What Truman did often gets called American “can-do.” Other countries now have that attitude as well including the U.K. and other European countries.

The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So when stocks turn up that see insider buying, and are also top ranked, investors are wise to take notice. One such company is Principal Financial Group , which saw buying by Director Daniel Gelatt."," The Top DividendRank'ed Stocks With Insider Buying »Back on March 10, Gelatt invested $999,823.01 into 28,148 shares of PFG, for a cost per share of $35.52. In trading on Tuesday, bargain hunters could buy shares of Principal Financial Group and achieve a cost basis 27.3% cheaper than Gelatt, with shares changing hands as low as $25.84 per share.

The DividendRank report noted that among the coverage universe, PFG shares displayed both attractive valuation metrics and strong profitability metrics. For example, the recent PFG share price of $24.16 represents a price-to-book ratio of 0.5 and an annual dividend yield of 9.27% — by comparison, the average company in Dividend Channel's coverage universe yields 7.4% and trades at a price-to-book ratio of 1.2. The report also cited the strong quarterly dividend history at Principal Financial Group Inc, and favorable long-term multi-year growth rates in key fundamental data points.The report stated, ''Dividend investors approaching investing from a value standpoint are generally most interested in researching the strongest most profitable companies, that also happen to be trading at an attractive valuation.

[+] portfolio diversification.,"The past few weeks have witnessed levels of investment market volatility unlike anything many people have ever seen before. In the midst of this market turbulence, the stock market’s 11-year bull run officially came to an end in early March when major indices fell 20% from their recent peaks. Daily swings of 1,000 points or more in the Dow Jones Industrial Average have become almost commonplace, setting many investors’ nerves on edge. The big question on many people’s minds right now is: What are the best investment strategies for times of extreme volatility like this?Combatting Volatility with Alternative InvestmentsHighly volatile markets serve as a good reminder of the importance of proper asset allocation and portfolio diversification. A growing number of retirement investors today are achieving this by investing in alternative assets through a self-directed IRA. These include assets such as real estate, private equity, hedge funds, gold and precious metals, crowdfunding, private placements, and private corporate debt instruments.In a recent survey conducted by Natixis Investment Managers, approximately 60% of investors said that recent market volatility has prompted them to consider diversifying their retirement portfolio beyond traditional investments like stocks and bonds. About the same percentage (65%) said that they want to incorporate investment strategies that are less tied to the broad market.Which types of alternative assets are the most popular among self-directed IRA investors? According to the survey, more than half of the account owners said they plan to boost their real estate holdings while 30% said they will pursue private equity opportunities. Note that several categories of alternative investments cannot be held in self-directed IRAs. These mainly include collectibles such as antiques, artwork, stamps, coins and rugs. Investment transactions that involve self-dealing or certain family members, often referred to as “prohibited transactions,” must also be avoided with alternative assets held in self-directed IRAs.Benefits of Self-Directed IRAs and Alternative AssetsThere are many potential benefits to using a self-directed IRA to invest in alternative assets. Perhaps the biggest is the ability to diversify a portfolio by adding investments with low correlation to stocks and bonds. This can help retirement investors control volatility and limit downside risk in their portfolios.Investing in alternative assets using a self-directed IRA can also give investors more flexibility with their retirement portfolio by opening up a much wider universe of investment opportunities. Unlike mutual funds and ETFs that only provide indirect exposure to alternative assets, this strategy allows for direct ownership of assets, which gives investors greater control.Holding alternative assets in a self-directed IRA also offers tax advantages when compared to owning them in a taxable account. Assets held in a self-directed traditional IRA grow on a tax-deferred basis while assets held in a self-directed Roth IRA can be withdrawn tax-free in retirement.It’s important to note that there are unique risks involved in holding alternative assets in a self-directed IRA. One of the biggest risks is the lack of liquidity that’s inherent in some types of alternative investments that have long hold periods. While this might not be a big issue for investors who are still decades away from retirement, it could limit the ability to move out of underperforming assets in the short term.Is Volatility the New Normal?With so much uncertainty still in the air, there’s a good chance that market volatility could continue for months to come, if not longer. This could make now a good time to consider diversifying with alternative assets through a self-directed IRA.Please contact us at Service@StrataTrust.com if you have more questions about using self-directed IRAs to invest in alternative assets."

It’s a tool that stands to revolutionize playtesting—the process of playing a game to test it for bugs and flaws before it launches—for studios, with implications that extend far beyond the world of entertainment.In essence, Game Simulation equips game developers with the ability to create simulations with bots that playtest games on their behalf. Bots have been playing games effectively for decades, but Game Simulation harnesses them at a scale that is many orders of magnitude beyond what has been possible before.The result is that instead of having anywhere from a handful to a few thousand pre-launch playtesters, developers can now simulate millions of game playthroughs in a fraction of the time. It’s not meant to replace human involvement in playtesting, but rather shift the mechanical tasks that don’t require human touch to machines, freeing up time and budget.Understanding this interplay—what tasks are best-served by humans and by machines, and how those can work in concert—is at the foundation of Unity Game Simulation.“When we talk about machine learning and AI, we often expect those systems to help us in our lives,” Unity VP of AI and Machine Learning Danny Lange said in an interview with the author. “When it comes to game development, there’s some very obvious areas like making NPCs smarter or getting better graphics by using these new techniques. What I like to do is look beyond the most obvious and say, ‘Can I do things with AI and ML that people basically skipped because they never really thought it was possible or never even thought of the idea?’ One of these examples is: ‘Can I launch the perfect game?’”Many aspects of “perfection” ultimately fall to human hands—things like character development, narrative, and design. But simulation at the massive scale possible on the cloud allows creators to locate bugs in games that smaller-scale, human-only playtesting might not. Further, the large-scale simulation aggregates large quantities of data that offer deeper understandings of the game experience.“If we use AI bots to learn to play your game, and you can have a lot of them—and they can play your games millions and millions of times—don’t you think that would give you some insights into your game?” Lange said. “Things like game balance, game economy, and the mechanics of where bots spend time in your game.”Furyion and iLLOGIKA were two studios to test out Game Simulation in its early stages. Furyion used it on its forthcoming multiplayer shooter Death Carnival to deduce the combination of weapons, ammo, and power-ups that would produce ideal level-completion time and difficulty. By configuring parameters in multi-stage simulations, Furyion condensed the equivalent of 165 million playthroughs into 10 simulations—all of which took a little over 3 days, allowing Furyion to rapidly implement changes.“Because of [Unity Game Simulation’s] seamless integration with the Unity Editor, we were able to run simulations, then quickly make gameplay tweaks within moments,” said Furyion Founder and Director Herbert Yung in a statement. “Not only was this process hundreds of times faster than with playtesters, but we were able to design our simulation to provide high-quality results. This really changed my perspective on the best, most efficient way to game balance.”The studio estimates a savings of $80,000 and 600 hours of time that would have been spent managing playtesters, measuring weapon performance, and compiling builds.'Death Carnival' in the Unity Editor. Furyion Games was able to rapidly implement edits based on ... [+] insights from Unity Game Simulation.Meanwhile, iLLOGIKA used Game Simulation with a more macro-view goal: to optimize its game to give players the right interplay of challenges and advantages. Game Simulation was able to address this using large-scale simulation—25,000 simulations totaling more than 1,125 playthrough hours. The total runtime? 4 hours. Bots, Lange explains, aren’t hampered by human capability.“What we actually do here is run these simulations at superhuman speed—we don’t have to run them at 30 frames per second,” Lange said. “We can run these at 200, 300, 1,000fps, depending on [the game’s] complexity.”Having access to the resulting insights on Google Cloud decreases the time and money spent in playtesting, and allows game developers to ship more polished products at launch, increasing its likelihood of success. But it also frees up both human playtesters and game developers to focus on uniquely human factors like aesthetics, game feel, and fun.Sample screen of Unity Game Simulation on Google Cloud.“The magic here is actually in the effectiveness of very large numbers of data; we’re talking 10,000, 100,000, a million playthroughs, where you get statistical information about your game,” Lange said. “Doing this with real people is actually happening but it happens post-launch, and games get fine-tuned over time. What we’re really opening up for here is to do some of that work up-front before it ever gets in the hands of human players.”In early testing, one thing these bots have quickly demonstrated is a propensity to find loopholes.“One of the learnings was that these bots are very, very efficient at finding loopholes and cheats in games,” Lange said. “So we did some internal game environments that we tested out and basically said, ‘You play this a million times and you’ll notice that these bots will be very quick in finding obscure situations where they can basically utilize a loophole in the game.’” In one of these internal game environments, a bot made an especially convenient discovery.“At one point in a multistory tower, a dev forgot to make the ceiling solid, and one of these bots found out that they could just jump through the ceiling to the next level and just skip that way,” Lange said. “Statistically, most of the bots behaved nicely, but then other bots would progress instantly on a level—in these cases, you can look at these outliers to ask, ‘How can that happen?’”While Game Simulation is a tool foremost for game studios and developers, Lange takes a broader view of how the power of simulation could impact our lives.“This is dedicated for game simulation, but when you start thinking about it, what if your game represents something else?” Lange said. “What if it represents, say a small development of houses? You can model sunlight, wind, road noise, how people commute in and out. You can figure out optimal placement for houses on that piece of land. Is that a video game? It’s almost like SimCity—it starts blending with reality.”For Lange, Unity Game Simulation holds deep implications not just for the future of gaming, but broadly for the future of AI. The game engine is a safe, fertile environment for training everything from drones to autonomous vacuum cleaners. “One of the primary reasons I joined Unity three years ago was that I saw the limitations of AI developed in the real world,” Lange said. “Training self-driving cars on real streets with real people around them is not really a great idea. What I realized was that to really advance AI, the game engine is the perfect place. It’s the AI biodome. You can create an environment, you have 3 dimensions, you have time, you have physics—time, inertia, all those things. I just see this having utility far beyond video games itself, and this goes along with my observation that video games have been leading tech in the graphics space and AI space for many years. By moving from physical world to the virtual world, you can in a sense bypass nature in the fast lane.”Unity Game Simulation is now available in open beta."

Circling The Drain. Sell Now. Light: So if you invest often enough, you ...","Editors' Pick|Mar 12, 2020,09:50am EDT","Volatility in the stock market has been quiet until the recent virus-sparked sell-offs. How should investors cope with that? For some advice, we turn to Andrew Sivertsen, senior financial planner in the Quad Cities office of The Planning Center. ","Larry Light: Stocks have jumped around a lot lately, entering bear territory and unnerving a lot of people. How should investors think about this phenomenon?Andrew Sivertsen: There are several key principles to having a sound investment philosophy, and one of the most important is being able to deal with volatility risk.Volatility risk is accepting that your investment portfolio can undergo large and unexpected swings both up and down. I think of volatility like flying in an airplane. If you fly long enough and often enough, you accept the reality that at some point you will experience turbulence. Most of my flights are calm and I barely remember them. Light: And then there are the more memorable ones.Sivertsen: Yes, I remember one flight to Atlanta where, out of nowhere, the biggest bump I’ve ever felt in my life jolted my seatmate’s in-flight beverage to the ceiling of the plane. Our eyes locked with the same fear and question: Are we going down? The next 10 to 15 minutes were some of the scariest moments I’ve ever experienced, but eventually the plane reached an altitude where things settled down, and my heart rate was able to return to normal.I also vividly recall another turbulent flight to Anchorage, though it was not nearly as scary. Traveling from Chicago, the entire 8-plus hour flight was a constant, steady stream of turbulence. I consider myself to have a strong stomach, but even I felt like reaching for the complementary airsickness bag and wishing I had taken a Dramamine.Light: So if you invest often enough, you will encounter the occasional rocky ride. And some are a lot worse than others.Sivertsen:  Investing in the stock market is much like flights. Much of the time, it’s a steady, calm experience and most passengers pay little attention. Other times, like on my flight to Atlanta, a big shock can come out of nowhere to quickly terrify us—before recovering just as quickly. Or, as happened on my flight to Anchorage, the volatility can go on and on leaving us sick wondering if it will ever end. Fortunately, there are systems that we can use to help deal with volatility risk.Light: You can adopt permanent mechanisms to be ready for trouble, right? Sivertsen: One of the most efficient ways to travel from point A to point B is flying, though obviously every flight risks unexpected turbulence. The same is true of your long-term financial goals. Investing can and should be a part of a prudent strategy. The key to managing long-term volatility is to make sure that you’re not investing too aggressively or too conservatively for your personal situation. This is done in two ways. The first is understanding your risk tolerance, because every investor has their own financial DNA that dictates how they will react to various financial scenarios. The second is understanding your risk capacity, which is driven by your age and goals. This means that most investors will have a higher percentage of their funds in the stock markets in their twenties and thirties. But then lower that percentage as they get closer to retirement. Your advisor at can help you assess and understand your risk tolerance and risk capacity to help you make more informed choices around how much volatility risk to take on in your portfolio.Light: And you still have to deal with short-term volatility along the way.Sivertsen: During my flight to Atlanta, the pilot was able to climb out of the irregular air currents, which helped address the unexpected turbulence. My partners and I utilize what is called volatility-based rebalancing to help prepare for short-term volatility. For example, your investment portfolio contains several different funds. Each fund represents a different type of investment that is important to own for diversification purposes, and each fund is a different percentage of the portfolio depending on its function. As time goes on, each of these funds moves at its own pace, with some growing much faster while others rise and fall in price. Rebalancing simply means that from time to time we need to look at the portfolio and sell what has gone up and buy into what has gone down. Since the goal of investing is to buy low and sell high, rebalancing over time helps us accomplish this goal.Every week the algorithms on our trading software are looking for opportunities to do just that by setting a volatility band on each fund, allowing it float up or down until it crosses the threshold triggering either a buy or a sell. This doesn’t happen every week, but usually these triggers occur several times throughout the year.For example, looking back at the last year and a half, as stock markets hit all-time highs in August 2018. In most cases, this would trigger selling stock funds in the portfolio and buying into the safer bond funds. Then, the following four months contained a sharp correction in the stock market, which bottomed out on Christmas Eve. This most likely triggered selling some bonds and moving them back into the stock funds.The markets then recovered quickly in the first couple months of 2019 resuming all-time highs and thus more stock sales. Then came the recent downturn. Rebalancing helps keep a portfolio from drifting too aggressively as the stock market is going up. This, in turn, reduces downside risk for the next market fall, and, conversely, enables us to invest more client funds back into the market and generate more upside potential for when stocks eventually go back up.Light: Then there’s the Anchorage flight scenario. Somewhere in between the sudden jolt en route to Atlanta and broad changes over a long time. Sivertsen:  Like my flight to Anchorage, there are broad market swings that last much longer. The tech boom of the late 1990s ended in 2000 with the tech crash, followed by 9/11, which lasted through 2002. Then the housing boom propelled markets until 2007, which fizzled and eventually crashed when Lehman Brothers went under in October 2008. Markets have been expanding since March 2009 except for several corrections including the one we are currently experiencing.There is a quote by famous investor Warren Buffett: “Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.” Our human emotions lead us to get caught up in the euphoria and excitement around abnormally large financial gains like the tech and housing booms. Light: How do you measure these market gains, or losses?Sivertsen: By using certain ratios­—a measure of a stock’s valuation that helps determine its performance and risk as an investment—that we can look at that show when investors are paying much more for a stock than they should when compared to its book value. Book value is the total value of a company’s assets minus its liabilities, which is how an accountant would value the company.When the market pricing is high, we typically begin reducing the amount of stock exposure in a portfolio. Likewise, when fear drives prices down, the ratios indicate when it could be time to start increasing exposure back into the stock market. The ratios are not a predictor of short-term market performance, but do give us insight into the longer-term return expectations.Currently ratios have been particularly high in the US, indicating for a while that it would be wise to be more defensive. For example, someone with a long-term portfolio of 60% stocks and 40% bonds would consider temporarily investing at a 50/50 split instead. Then that investor would have been better prepared for the market drop. If it continues to fall the ratios, would begin to normalize and the investor may want to consider moving the portfolio back to the original 60/40 split while stocks are down.Most importantly is to keep flying. Despite the inevitability of some turbulence, clear skies are ahead."

Users simply pull up the palette, choose their color and point at objects to begin bringing their own styles and unique color combinations to scenes.While the timing might be serendipitous for those needing to drop stress levels now, Sarno explained the project has been in development for more than two years.“It began as an idea to use VR to help medical patients if they're in pain or distress,” Sarno said in an interview with the author. “A lot of adult patients use coloring books to pass time and distract themselves, so we thought, ‘What would that look like in VR?’”As Lighthaus began discussing the project with potential users, the response led them to discover it might have broader appeal than just within the bounds of healthcare.“We worked with a Bay Area hospital and discussed how we'd offer it to patients in chemotherapy to distract from pain and make the time pass more quickly,” Sarno said. “But we got such great responses from patients—and everyone we showed it to—that we realized that it could appeal to everyone.”A completed scene in 'Color Space'One feature of coloring books that Sarno and the team wanted to bring to Color Space was simplicity; accessibility was foregrounded as a design principle. This positions it as an experience able to help new Oculus Quest users with immersive environments, as well as a way for longtime VR users to relax—particularly in light of social distancing and shelter-in-place measures.“You can master Color Space right away without any complex controls, but still have a really compelling and satisfying creative experience,” Sarno said. “So it's great for all the folks who are getting Quests and trying VR for the first time, but also good for longtime VR users because it's a great way to relax, chill out, and have fun—especially in these stressful times where a lot of us are cooped up and want a way to escape.”Translating a 2D format into VR naturally presents challenges; what is the best way to capture the essence of a legacy form while ensuring it works to the unique strengths of immersion?“Our goal was not just to do a coloring book in VR, but to imagine what the VR version of a coloring book could be,” Sarno said. “It has to let the user enter the scenes—we say that instead of coloring in a scene, you're coloring in a scene. You get transported into the middle of these lush three-dimensional scenes, and as you color them, they start to come alive. So it's really bringing you into the coloring book and letting you bring it to life with your color.”The color palette in 'Color Space'In order to reimagine the coloring book in this way, Sarno tapped Bittman, himself an artist who works in 2D and VR formats. Just as importantly: he has established workflows across many different VR creative solutions. This meant that not only did he bring an intuitive understanding to the creative needs of this translation, but he also knew how to jump across different toolsets to realize that vision. From there, Krasner engineered the experience for optimal tone and interaction.“[Danny] really kind of invented a whole new VR art creation process; Danny created Color Space's art completely inside VR—it's made in VR, with VR art creation tools like Tilt Brush, Gravity Sketch and AnimVR,” Sarno said. “Then we imported the scenes and animation into Unity and our awesome engineer, Anna Krasner, made Danny's art and music come to life and allowed users to color it in.”In an interview with the author, Bittman went behind the scenes of his creative process, explaining how he used different platforms to achieve his goals with Color Space—as well as some of the unique hiccups they encountered in the process of exclusively using 3D tools.“We landed on a great workflow where we’d loosely design the shapes of our scene in Tilt Brush to figure out how to break our objects up into fills you could individually color,” Bittman said. “We then remodeled our objects in Gravity Sketch and just extruded out their edges to create our outlines. That part was easy, along the way however, we ran into some issues that were only present since we were working in 3D space. For instance, we wanted all of our outlines to be relatively the same thickness, and yet the further away we placed an object in the scene, the thicker we would have to make the outline so it’d still be visible. So from the home position it all looks even, but in reality some outlines are only one centimeter thick, and others are meters thick.”The creative process involved in taking the Gas Station scene from beginning prototype to final ... [+] output. Pictured top-left: the original mock-up in Tilt Brush; bottom-left: the remodeled Gas Station with outlines in Gravity Sketch; right: final product post-texturing in 'Color Space.'This elaborate process, including the obstacles, led Bittman to some new insights around how to simultaneously think cinematically and immersively; each scene needed to be rewarding as a VR world and from single fixed positions.“We also had to play a lot with object size, and how to break up our fills, because it’d be impossible to fill in each petal of a flower that’s 50 feet away—but if that flower is right at your feet, you’d expect to be able to completely customize every aspect of it,” Bittman said. “Then on top of all of that, every object needed to be fillable from the home position; we didn’t want to make the painters have to walk a few feet just to see a bush behind a tree, but they should still be able to walk around if they wanted to without it breaking the composition. Overall, that was coolest challenge for me, because while we were working on a 3D scene, the composition of the scene basically needed to look like a still from a movie, with each object perfectly framing and pointing to other objects. I think it’s that unity that creates an overall relaxing feeling. Everything is where it should be.”For more information about Lighthaus, visit the official website.

Interactive Livestreaming Campaign",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessedamiani/2020/03/13/meet-hovercast-the-company-behind-bernie-sanderss-groundbreaking-interactive-livestreaming-campaign/,"He owns Bitcoin, Ether, and other altcoins. Read Less. © 2020 Forbes Media

AdChoices · Privacy Statement · Terms ...","Mar 13, 2020,01:12pm EDT",A still from a recent Bernie Sanders campaign event livestream,"Coronavirus fears mean digital engagement has never been more important in politics. From The Strokes to Public Enemy, Hovercast’s interactive functionality for the Sanders campaign reveals the next wave.Barack Obama was the first American President to embrace social media as a communication tool—so much so that he’s been called the “first social-media president.” The 2016 election saw the Donald Trump campaign embrace targeting, including its now infamous alignment with Cambridge Analytica.In light of the recent Coronavirus pandemic, it’s clear that human and natural disasters can completely disrupt in-person events, casting digital engagement as more than just secondary strategy.These signals indicate that digital positioning is going to increasingly define the future of politics. Among the 2020 Democratic hopefuls, the Bernie Sanders campaign has most fully embraced this reality, using platforms including Twitch, YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook to activate and communicate with Sanders’s base.In the course of using these platforms, the Bernie Sanders campaign has specifically embraced a new wave of digital engagement: the interactive livestream. To do so, it tapped Hovercast, a platform that allows clients to create bespoke interactive livestreams—using its toolset to “gamify” political donations in conjunction with ActBlue, a grassroots nonprofit technology organization for Democrats, non-profits, and progressive groups to raise funds.The Hovercast-Sanders partnership commenced with the campaign’s rally in New Hampshire, which featured appearances from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Dr. Cornel West, and ended with a concert from The Strokes.Through its live donation integration, the event’s broadcast raised $85,000 for the campaign, breaking seven consecutive donation goals, which were displayed as meters in live graphics. Each time the goal meter “filled,” a celebratory Bernie GIF appeared on screen. Simple as it may sound, this type of integration establishes a realtime relationship between streamer and audience—a potential that has gone untapped in politics until now—and speaks to the larger role that interactive livestreaming will play in the future of political campaigns.“With interactive livestreaming, we now have the ability to connect with the audience from any platform and bring their engagement to life in the show,” Hovercast CEO Eli Stonberg said in an interview with the author. “By giving the campaign simple tools to curate chats, display donor names, and set donation goal meters, we’re helping reward audience members for their participation in the movement and making donations feel fun.”The Sanders campaign has since used similar gamification techniques for all of their livestreams, including Sanders’ victory speech in Nevada and the Los Angeles Rally with Public Enemy Radio.“Campaigns and organizations energize their supporters with Hovercast because building a movement is more fun and effective when you can see that you’re doing it with others, together, live,” Hovercast CTO Jeff Greco said in an interview with the author. “We’re offering appreciation via personal recognition by the campaign and the ability to participate with the community.”By allowing Bernie Sanders to explicitly express “appreciation” to grassroots donors, Hovercast’s toolset empowers the campaign to drive deeper engagement, building community and inspiring digital audiences to feel deeply involved in the campaign’s goals.This aligns with livestreaming trends from the game industry, with some predicting growth of 38 percent in the sector by 2021. “Modern politicians can learn from what video game designers have spent decades proving out,” Stonberg said. “Games can be playful, rewarding, motivational, they can make you feel good and less lonely. Shouldn’t those qualities also be some of the sensations that you feel while participating in a campaign?”The migration of these trends into the political sphere has broad implications for how candidates engage existing and new bases, raise money, and ultimately get elected.“The gamification of political fundraising has massive potential,” Stonberg said. “Interactive live streaming can give people a shared sense of meaning, an outlet for creative expression, recognition for their input, and the satisfaction of communal achievement.”The official Bernie Sanders live stream can be found here."

[+] Hong Kong, Hong Kong, on July 30, 2018. (Photo by S3studio/Getty Images)","Asian equity markets were largely lower. While Japan managed a small gain, large losses in Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia and Singapore overshadowed the few positives. Investors appear to be de-risking their portfolios by selling indiscriminately. One broker noted a global unwind of leveraged trades across asset classes including currencies and equities. Investors will borrow cash in low yielding currencies and execute carry trades by buying high yielding currencies. Other managers will put on paired trades of a long versus a short position. There are also risk parity trades of long bonds and leveraged stocks occurring. These trades are being unwound in a dramatic fashion, which may lead to strong selling at a time when no one is buying. This explains an element of the dollar’s strong rise as this money comes back to the US.Overnight, the renminbi fell versus the dollar despite China having significantly higher interest rates than the US. A fixed income trader friend noted that the US bond market is now in “no bid” territory i.e. there are no buyers. You may have noticed this if you’ve tried to refinance your mortgage. US interest rates are at zero so isn’t it a great time to do so? Wrong. There are simply no buyers of mortgage bonds. Paradoxically, US mortgage rates have increased. We need liquidity in financial markets, especially in fixed income just as we saw in 2009 during the GFC. Remember the PBOC hasn’t cut interest rates in China though they have pumped liquidity into the financial system. Hopefully the Fed will do the same here in the US. Maybe mortgage rates’ rise is a sign of the equity bottom? Only time will tell!Hong Kong and Mainland China were not immune to the selling. However, they did not fall to the extent of the rest of Asia. Yes, China has beaten the coronavirus. Even Hubei province is now reporting no new cases. However, more important to the market’s resilience are expectations for the PBOC to cut the loan prime rate (LPR) tomorrow. We also saw a policy statement on supporting the “new consumption model” i.e. internet and e-commerce companies. Alibaba’s Hong Kong listing and Tencent were up overnight despite Hong Kong’s sell off. The Hang Seng is now back to the level it was at when I joined KraneShares in 2013! Hong Kong is clearly oversold and overdue for a bounce back. However, I suspect these New China economic sectors and the underlying stocks will lead the way higher. This could happen in the US and Europe as asset-light companies are likely to weather the storm better than old economic sectors.This morning I received a news alert that India would suspend inbound commercial flights. Thus far, India has had relatively few COVID-19 cases. The first cases in the country were from foreign tourists. Limiting air travel is such an obvious way to curtail the spread, but the extent to which passenger air traffic is curtailed varies by country. The WSJ noted in separate articles both the Mexican government’s indifference to the coronavirus and the UK’s decision to allow rock concerts to take place as planned this past weekend. Conversely, Chile and Peru have taken drastic measures. It is easy to Monday morning quarterback this. Despite our study of China, I completely missed the extent to which coronavirus was spreading despite noting more than a month ago that global air travel was still taking place. I am paying for it financially and will do my best efforts to prevent such an error in the future.

Demand 
for its filters for pulmonary ventilators is up 50% from the same ...","Coronavirus|Mar 16, 2020,06:00am EDT","Massimo Scagliarini, CEO of GVS.","As Italy’s unprecedented national lockdown enters its second week, infections from the novel coronavirus pandemic are growing by the thousands every day. Hospitals in the hard-hit north of the country are buckling under the pressure, running low on supplies of much-needed masks and pulmonary ventilators. Italy’s benchmark stock index, the FTSE MIB, plunged by 17% on Thursday, the worst one-day drop in its history, recouping some of that loss with a 7% rebound on Friday. Amid the chaos and disruption, a family-owned company is seizing the moment to supply doctors and nurses on the front lines — and when the storm has finally passed, to list on the Milan stock exchange.GVS Group, a maker of medical filters and biohazard masks, is perhaps one of the few Italian companies that have geared up activity amid the country's near total shutdown. Founded in 1979 by Grazia Valentini Scagliarini — the company’s name comes from her initials — GVS started out making filters for medical devices, later branching out into masks and more specialized filters for the auto industry. GVS has been planning an IPO since September 2019, closing the year with $257 million in revenues (230.6 million euros), a 9% increase from 2018, and net profits that rose 43% to $36.9 million (33.1 million euros). More than 90% of revenue comes from outside of Italy, with more than 2,700 employees in eleven countries.Now led by one of Scagliarini’s children, CEO Massimo Scagliarini, GVS is positioning itself to meet the needs of the growing crisis and emerge stronger than it was before. To meet soaring demand from hospitals, GVS is hiring 120 new workers and opening four new production lines for its masks in Italy, including one for special biohazard masks it tests with a live virus. Demand for its filters for pulmonary ventilators is up 50% from the same period last year, with the life-saving devices in increasingly short supply. “Our plant manager in China is asking me to double production lines because they can’t keep up with the demand,” Scagliarini told Forbes in a phone interview on Friday. “I spoke with a nearby company that produces pulmonary ventilators, and we’re trying to see how to work with them because they’re supplying the Italian civil protection agency. They were delivering ventilators to hospitals without any filters because they had run out.”Production line for GVS masks in Italy.GVS was born in 1979 in the small town of Zola Predosa on the industrial outskirts of Bologna, from an idea passed down by founder Grazia’s father, an engineer at the auto parts manufacturer Magneti Marelli. Convinced there was an untapped market for industrial filters, he encouraged each of his three daughters to start a company making filters for different industries. In an area dense with healthcare companies, Grazia focused on the market for medical blood filters and established GVS.Throughout the 1980s and 90s, GVS expanded by building two new plants in Italy plus subsidiaries in Serbia, Argentina and Brazil. The company received its first outside financing in 2001, when it sold a 20% stake to B Group, an Italian private equity firm. “Like all family companies in Italy, we made decisions around the kitchen table,” said Scagliarini. “We wanted to grow and become more professional.”Founder Grazia Valentini passed day-to-day control of the company to her sons, Massimo and Marco, in 2002. GVS then went on to expand into six more countries — including Japan, China and the U.S. — culminating in the 2011 sale of an 18% stake to Luxembourg-based private equity fund Mandarin Capital Partners for $30.2 million, according to Pitchbook. “We were profitable, and we wanted to find a partner who could teach us the skills and secrets of mergers and acquisitions,” said Scagliarini.That strategy paid off, and GVS went on to complete a string of acquisitions of smaller filter and biohazard equipment manufacturers in six countries, including three in the United States. The Scagliarini family regained full ownership when they bought out Mandarin Capital’s stake (for an undisclosed sum) in 2015.Now, more than half of the company’s revenues come from its healthcare and life sciences division, which includes filters for pulmonary ventilators, but Scagliarini is also looking to expand the company’s health and safety division to capitalize on the demand for biohazard masks.GVS masks.GVS has been involved in the fight against COVID-19 since it emerged, before it began its deadly march across Europe and the rest of the world. In the early days of the pandemic, when the coronavirus was still largely limited to China, GVS donated filters and supplies from its factory in the eastern Chinese city of Suzhou to meet demand in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. The factory reopened on February 11 with only a quarter of its workforce, gradually bringing employees back to work to meet stringent health requirements, and is now producing filters for export to Italy. Last Wednesday, GVS converted two production lines in the United States to make more masks, expecting an increase in demand as the virus continues its spread.“We learned a lot from China. Fortunately, our containment strategy worked and we didn’t have any cases [among our employees].” said Scagliarini. “Starting last month, we applied the same security procedures in Italy. As incredible as it may seem, we ended February with practically the same revenues as in 2019.”With customers ranging from Coca-Cola to Heathrow Airport — GVS makes the filters that verify water quality in Coke bottles, as well as the air filters at gates in the busy London hub — Scagliarini is confident the company will continue to grow once the virus has been defeated. New distribution centers are planned in Southeast Asia and South America, with an eye towards entering markets in Africa. The firm is also betting on both sides in the hydrogen vs. electric car debate, producing membrane filters that are used in both hydrogen fuel cells and lithium ion batteries.The IPO is still planned for the spring, although market volatility means it’s too early to set a date. “There’s a storm going on, but the situation is fluid,” said Scagliarini. “We have something that no one else can offer. Even at a time of crisis, we are stable.”Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus"

Headlines. Now That's Better! Granted, this investor is still facing ...","Mar 10, 2020,09:50am EDT",Getty,"When the market is selling off, it’s easy to panic as big losses rack up in your account.Here’s the thing, though: going to cash, and fully exposing yourself to inflation, is a guaranteed way to lose. It’s doubly sad to see first-level investors doing this when there’s a time-tested way to survive meltdowns, keep your income stream intact and cut your portfolio’s volatility.It doesn’t involve panic selling. Instead, it revolves around three simple rules: diversify, be patient and keep a big income stream. Let’s walk through each of these.1) DiversifyThe first key to surviving a meltdown is to be in several markets at once. That way, if one crashes, you’ve still got the others to balance things out.This is the most simple and powerful trick in finance, yet it’s commonly overlooked. Take the last week of February. If you were 100% invested in the S&P 500 through an index fund like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) or Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VOO), you’d be facing an 11% loss in just a week.To be sure, a loss like that, taken when you’re close to retirement, could be a threat to your golden years.This is where diversification comes in: someone who also bought municipal bonds—issued by state and local governments to fund infrastructure projects—through the iShares National Muni Bond ETF (MUB) or the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) had a far better week.Now That’s Better!Granted, this investor is still facing losses, but an equally allocated portfolio of these three ETFs results in a loss of 2%, a far cry from 11%.So if diversifying into a variety of funds in different asset classes works, why are personal-finance gurus touting low-cost index funds as the secret to wealth? Because they’re riding a 10-year bull market, that’s why. But the prudent investor knows that all good things come to an end, even decade-long stock run-ups.2) Be PatientOne of the worst things about bear markets is they happen so fast. But that’s also one of the best things about them. Remember the end of 2018? Fears around trade, the Federal Reserve and global growth hit stocks all at once—and this happened.Late 2018 saw a technical bear market take hold by the end of the year, with the S&P 500 falling about 20% in three months. And it took about three months for stocks to recover.The best thing about bear markets is that they don’t last forever, and if you’re patient, your portfolio will recover. The best thing you can do when stocks fall 11% in a week? Don’t sell and lock in that loss. Just wait—stocks will bounce back.3) Keep a Big Income StreamWhat if you can’t wait? Some people hold stocks not because they’re waiting for their nest egg to grow, but because they need an income stream now.This is where yield comes in.Investors who hold an index fund like VOO and need cash now are being forced to sell shares at a discount to what they could’ve sold for a couple weeks ago. This is the case for many VOO shareholders, because that fund yields just over 2%. With such a low income stream, you need to sell shares periodically to maintain a 5% withdrawal rate, let alone a higher one.High-yield equity funds, like many closed-end funds (CEFs), are an alternative. For instance, the Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (ASG) holds mid-cap and large-cap stocks and pays a huge 8.4% dividend, so the odds are lower that you’d have to sell a single share during a crash.ASG has been crushing the index for years, even after the recent bloodbath.ASG isn’t the only option. There are CEFs in many sectors—municipal bonds, corporate bonds, utilities—that get you diversification and high income. And since the average CEF’s discount is now 4.3%, with over 150 offering discounts of 10% or more, now is your chance to buy at fire-sale prices.Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.
