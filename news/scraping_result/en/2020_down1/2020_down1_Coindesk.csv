minutes (known as block rewards) will drop by half, to 6.25 from 12.5 ...","Mar 24, 2020 at 17:05 UTC","The Bitcoin halving will take place sometime in May 2020. What is the halving, how will it affect the price, and what does it mean for miners and the cryptocurrency's long-term prospects? Here's everything you need to know. ","“The halvening” sounds like a horror movie about an ax murderer. But it’s actually the nickname for one of the most hotly anticipated events in Bitcoin’s history.Sometime in May, the number of bitcoins (BTC) entering circulation every 10 minutes (known as block rewards) will drop by half, to 6.25 from 12.5. It’s a milestone that’s easy to see coming because it happens every four years and has happened twice before. The allure of possible riches is what’s drawing so much attention to the upcoming event, which is more commonly referred to as the halving (some wags like to add the “en” to make it sound ominous). The amount of supply entering the system will suddenly shrink, but the demand will, in theory, stay the same, possibly driving up the cryptocurrency’s price. As such, the event has inspired passionate debate about bitcoin price predictions and how the market will respond. “The theory is that there will be less bitcoin available to buy if miners have less to sell,” said Michael Dubrovsky, co-founder of mining R&D nonprofit PoWx.But the periodic decline in Bitcoin’s minting rate could have a deeper significance than any near-term price movements for the functioning of the currency. The block reward is an important component of Bitcoin, one that ensures the security of this leaderless system. As the rewards dwindle to zero in the decades ahead, it could potentially destabilize the economic incentives underlying bitcoin’s security.For those trying to make sense of this complex topic, CoinDesk offers the following explainer of Bitcoin’s third halving.New bitcoins enter circulation as block rewards, produced by “miners” who use expensive electronic equipment to earn or “mine” them.Every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years, the total number of bitcoin that miners can potentially win is halved. In 2009, the system started at 50 coins mined every 10 minutes. Two halvings later, 12.5 bitcoins are currently being dispensed every 10 minutes. This process will end with a total of 21 million coins, probably in the year 2140. Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, who may have been an individual or a team, disappeared roughly a year after releasing the software into the world. So, he or she or they (we’ll just go with “they” from now on) are no longer around to explain why they chose this specific formula for adding new bitcoin into circulation. But early emails written by Nakamoto shed some light on the mysterious figure’s thinking.Shortly after releasing the Bitcoin white paper, Nakamoto summarized the various ways their chosen monetary policy (the schedule by which miners receive block rewards) could play out, pondering the circumstances under which it could lead to deflation (when a currency’s purchasing power increases) or inflation (when the prices of goods and services purchasable with a currency increase). At the time, Nakamoto couldn’t have known how many people would use the new online money (if anyone).They elaborated very little on why they chose the particular formula they did: “Coins have to get initially distributed somehow, and a constant rate seems like the best formula.”In most state-issued currencies a central bank, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, has tools at its disposal that enable it to add or remove dollars from circulation. If the economy is floundering, for instance, the Fed can increase circulation and encourage lending by purchasing securities from banks. Alternately, if the Fed wants to remove dollars from the economy, it can sell securities from its account. At the time, Nakamoto couldn’t have known how many people would use the new online money (if anyone).For better or worse, bitcoin is a bit different. For one, the supply schedule is all but set in stone.Unlike the monetary policy of state-issued currencies, which unfold through political processes and human institutions, Bitcoin’s monetary policy is written into code shared across the network. Changing it would require an immense output of coordination and agreement across the community of Bitcoin users.“Unlike most national currencies we’re familiar with like dollars or euros, bitcoin was designed with a fixed supply and predictable inflation schedule. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. This predetermined number makes them scarce, and it’s this scarcity alongside their utility that largely influences their market value,” crypto wallet company Blockchain.com wrote in a blog post ahead of the 2016 halving.Another unique aspect of Bitcoin is Nakamoto programmed the block reward to decrease over time. This is another way in which it differs from the norm for modern financial systems, where central banks control the money supply. In stark contrast to Bitcoin's halving block reward, the supply of the dollar has roughly tripled since 2000.Nakamoto left clues that they created Bitcoin for political reasons. The first Bitcoin block features the headline of a newspaper article: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”Many have come to interpret it as a sign of Nakamoto’s political beliefs and goals. If widely adopted, Bitcoin could potentially reduce the power banks and governments have over monetary policy, including bailouts of struggling institutions. As shown with the block reward, no central entity can create bitcoin outside of the strict schedule.The halving is grabbing so much attention mostly because many believe it will lead to a price increase. The truth is, no one knows what's going to happen.Bitcoin has seen two halvings so far, which we can look to as precedent.The 2012 halving provided the first demonstration of how markets would respond to Nakamoto’s unorthodox supply schedule. Until then, the Bitcoin community didn't know how a sudden decline in rewards would affect the network. As it turned out, the price began to rise shortly after the halving.The second halving in 2016 was highly anticipated, as is the one now approaching, with CoinDesk running a live blog of the event and Blockchain.com putting out a “countdown.” Each halving has encouraged vigorous speculation about how the event would affect bitcoin's price. On July 16, 2016, the day of the second halving, the price dropped by 10 percent to $610, but then shot back up to where it was before. There was little evidence the sudden reduction in bitcoin’s minting rate had a long-term impact on the price. At the time, CoinDesk's Jacob Donnelly went so far as to call the event a “boring vindication.”Read More: Why Bitcoin’s Next ‘Halving’ May Not Pump the Price Like Last TimeWhile the immediate impact on the price of bitcoin was small, the market did tally a gradual increase over the year following the second halving. Some argue this increase was a delayed result of the halving. The theory is that when the supply of bitcoin declines, the demand for bitcoin will stay the same, pushing the price up. If that theory is correct, then we could observe similar price increases after future halvings, including the one scheduled for this year. Others argue that given the predictability of bitcoin’s halving schedule, this change in the minting rate is unlikely to shift the price. Traders have long known the bitcoin block reward will decrease, giving them ample time to prepare.It’s possible that if enough people know about the halving in advance, they will buy bitcoin in anticipation, pushing the price up before the halving instead of after. This is what people mean when they argue the halving is “priced in.”Explore these other stories on Bitcoin Halving 2020:Bitcoin wouldn’t work at all without these block rewards.As pseudonymous independent researcher Hasu put it, there are two parts to making Bitcoin work. “Bitcoin’s ledger state should answer the question of ‘who owns what, when?’” Hasu told CoinDesk.The first part, “who owns what?” is solved by cryptography. Only the owner of a private key (which is like a secret access code) can spend the bitcoin. The game theory that secures Bitcoin requires that a) miners have an incentive to mine honest blocks [and] b) miners have a cost ... to attempting dishonesty.“The second half (‘when?’) is the big challenge and was unsolved before Bitcoin,” Hasu explained. Otherwise, it’s easy for people to “double-spend” their coins, effectively creating money from thin air. Without the block rewards, the network would be in chaos. Hasu explains that if they have enough computing power, miners can attack the network in two ways: By double-spending coins or by stopping transactions from going through. But they are strongly incentivized not to try either, because then they would risk losing their block rewards.“The game theory that secures Bitcoin requires that a) miners have an incentive to mine honest blocks [and] b) miners have a cost ... to attempting dishonesty,” Dubrovsky said.In other words, miners will lose money if they don’t follow the rules. Read More: Bitcoin 101: How Bitcoin Mining WorksThe more computing power miners direct towards Bitcoin, the harder it is to attack because an attacker would need to have a significant portion of this processing power, known as the hashrate, to execute such an attack.The more money they can earn by way of block rewards, the more mining power goes to Bitcoin, and thus the more protected the network is.That is why the periodic decrease in rewards might eventually become an issue.Miners need an incentive to do what they do. They need to get paid. They’re not running these expensive, electricity-guzzling computers for their health after all. But the consequence of this dropping block reward is that eventually, it will dwindle to nothing. Transaction fees, which users pay each time they send a transaction, are the other way miners earn money. (Theoretically, these fees are optional, although as a practical matter a transaction without one might have to wait a long time to be processed if the network is congested; the size of the fee is set by the user or their wallet software.) The fees are expected to become a more important source of remuneration for miners as the block reward falls.“In a few decades when the reward gets too small, the transaction fee will become the main compensation for nodes. I’m sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume,” Nakamoto wrote.But for a long time, Bitcoin researchers have been considering the possibility transaction fees won’t suffice. For one thing, it means transactions might need to grow more expensive over time to keep the network as secure. It’s impossible to predict what will happen, but if we want a system that could last 100 years, we should be ready for the worst case.“This cannot really work without very expensive transaction costs because Bitcoin cannot process huge quantities of transactions on-chain,” Dubrovsky said.And, as discussed above, it is mining rewards that draw more computing power to Bitcoin, hardening it against attacks that try to circumvent the network’s rules. It’s unclear whether a future attenuated block reward will have the same allure for miners, even when supplemented with fees.“I don’t think this halving will make Bitcoin significantly less secure, but in eight to 12 years we could find ourselves in hot water,” Hasu said.Part of the problem is that more than a decade after Bitcoin’s birth the market is still figuring out the true cost of protecting the network from attackers.“Nobody knows the correct level of security needed to keep Bitcoin safe. Currently, Bitcoin pays out something like $5 billion per year and there are no successful attacks; however, there has been no price discovery. Bitcoin may be overpaying. To really find out the minimum level of security needed to avoid attacks, the mining rewards would need to be dropped to the point where attacks start happening and then increased until the attacks stop,” Dubrovsky argued. “Of course, this would be catastrophic for Bitcoin as it’s designed now, but it could really come to some kind of scenario like this if rewards dwindle and the Bitcoin community doesn’t do anything about it,” he added.Hasu said he “hopes” transaction fees will be enough to incentivize the security of Bitcoin in the end, but he thinks it's worth anticipating the “worst case.”“It should be clear that the incentive to attack Bitcoin today is larger than it was five years ago. We now have [U.S. President Donald] Trump, [China President Xi Jinping] and other world leaders talking critically about it. The more Bitcoin grows, the more they might see it as a threat and might eventually feel forced to react. That would be the worst case, anyway,” Hasu said.This question is an interesting one to ponder when thinking about Bitcoin’s future prospects, though it might sound like a far-off matter in 2020.“It’s impossible to predict what will happen, but if we want a system that could last 100 years, we should be ready for the worst case,” Hasu said. “The worst case is demand for blockspace does not increase in the dramatic fashion that would be needed. As a result, block rewards would eventually trend toward zero.”Bitcoin Halving Research ReportThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

be trading near a major bottom. Short-term technical charts ...","Mar 17, 2020 at 11:45 UTC","A key metric suggests bitcoin (BTC) is now trading at a relatively discounted price, having dropped by 60 percent in the last three weeks.","Bitcoin’s market value to realized value (MVRV) Z-score fell below zero on Friday and stood at -0.18 as of Monday,  according to crypto analytics firm Glassnode. The metric is used to to identify periods where the cryptocurrency is under- or overvalued The Z-score has turned negative for the first time in 12 months, suggesting the cryptocurrency is now undervalued. Bitcoin topped out at $10,500 in mid-February and fell to a 12-month low of $3,867 on March 13, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. The cryptocurrency suffered a staggering 39 percent drop Thursday as the coronavirus-led sell-off in the global stock markets triggered margin calls and forced investors to liquidate their positions in bitcoin and other markets including gold and U.S. Treasurys. Bitcoin’s market value refers to the total dollar value of the supply in circulation, as calculated by the daily average price across major exchanges. Meanwhile, the realized value approximates the value paid for all coins in existence by adding the market value of coins at the time they last moved on the blockchain. The latter is closer to fair value as it adjusts for lost coins and those being held for the long term (so-called HODLing). As such, the MVRV Z-score essentially represents the distance or deviation from the realized value.Historically, a below-zero MVRV Z-score (green area) has marked market bottoms, while a reading above 7 has marked tops.For example, bitcoin fell below $6,000 on Nov. 14, signaling an extension of the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached in December 2017. It had dropped to $3,400 by Nov. 25. The Z-score also turned negative in the second half of November and declined to -0.51 by mid-December. The sell-off ran out of steam near $3,100 in December and, after some consolidation, broke into a bull market in April. Essentially, the ebbing of downside momentum was reflected in the Z-score’s negative turn. Going back further, the 2014 bear market, which began at highs above $1,000 at the end of 2013, ran out of steam near $150 in January 2015 with the Z-score falling to -0.50. Again, after consolidating for some months, the cryptocurrency broke into a bull market in November 2015. So if history is a guide, the current MVRV Z-score of -0.18 suggests the cryptocurrency could be trading near a bottom. At press time, bitcoin is trading in the green near $5,335, representing a near 18 percent gain over 24 hours.The recovery may be associated with the positive action in the U.S. stock futures and the Asian and European equity markets. Notably, futures on the S&P 500, Wall Street’s equity index and the benchmark for global equities, rose nearly 5 percent early Tuesday, triggering a “limit up”.Bitcoin has recently been tracking action in the equity markets and could continue to do so in the short term. From a technical perspective, though, there is scope for an extension of the ongoing recovery rally.Bitcoin created a hammer candle on Monday, validating oversold conditions suggested by the 14-day relative strength index. A hammer comprises a long lower wick with a small body, and occurs when the sellers fail to keep prices at the lowest point of the day. Essentially, it represents seller exhaustion. As a result, a move to the $5,900–$6,000 range may be seen in the next 24 hours or so. That range has recently capped upside in the cryptocurrency. Buyers need to prevent a break below the ascending trendline support, currently at $4,672, which would negate a bullish higher low at $4,435 that formed Monday.A violation there would shift risk in favor of a drop to $4,000. The chart shows the area above $5,900 has proved a tough nut to crack for the bulls over the last four days. As a result, a sustained move above that level is needed to invite stronger buying pressure.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.

That was the lowest level since March 25, 2019, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. Equity markets are also flashing green alongside the slight recovery for bitcoin. S&P 500 futures are currently reporting more than 3 percent gains, while the Euro Stoxx 50 index – the eurozone’s benchmark index – has added more than 2 percent to its value. Asian markets had gapped lower at the open, tracking the overnight losses on Wall Street, but recovered a major portion of the losses before the closing bell.While bitcoin’s recovery looks impressive, the cryptocurrency is still down by more than $2,000 from levels near $8,000 seen early on Thursday. Bitcoin is now reporting a 27 percent loss on a year-to-date basis after showing gains of 46 percent just a month ago when the cryptocurrency was trading near $10,500.Back then, bitcoin was outshining gold by a notable margin, as the yellow metal was flashing a 6 percent gain for 2020. However, as of March 13, gold is back on top with a 7.5 percent year-to-date gain. The yearly gains were shed as the cryptocurrency plummeted by nearly 39 percent on Thursday during the relentless coronavirus-led sell-off in risk assets. The resulting liquidity crisis was accentuated by a massive long squeeze (forced liquidations) on prominent crypto derivatives exchanges such as BitMEX. Bitcoin’s sudden crash to $3,867 from $8,000 looked overstretched as per technical studies. “The latest bitcoin correction has pushed BTC to oversold levels last seen in September 2019 and November 2019,” co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital Jason A. Williams tweeted today. Indeed, the widely tracked relative strength index (RSI), which oscillates between zero to 100, had dropped to 15 – the lowest since November 2018. A below-30 reading indicates the cryptocurrency is oversold. As a result, the rise seen over the last few hours could be an “oversold bounce,"" which occurs when investors view a preceding sell-off as too severe and ease selling pressure by squaring off short positions. “Bitcoin will regain poise with risk assets, which will start seeing a sustainable recovery once there is stabilization in the coronavirus infection curve,” Mike Alfred, co-founder, and CEO of Digital Assets Data told CoinDesk. As per the latest reports, coronavirus continues to spread in Europe and the U.S. Therefore, the current uptick in the equity markets could be a chart-driven bounce or investors may have taken heart from the Federal Reserve’s decision to inject $1.4 trillion worth of liquidity into the financial system. If the recovery gathers momentum during the U.S. trading hours, bitcoin could very well find acceptance above $6,000 once more.However, as long as the virus outbreak shows no signs of slowing down, the risk of further downside moves in equities and bitcoin would remain high. Still, dips below $5,000 would be transient, according to Alfred, as there is too much fundamental demand from long-term holders – investors who bought bitcoins before the massive rally from $6,000 to $20,000 seen in the fourth quarter of 2017 and during the last five weeks of 2018. Currently, there are 12.19 million addresses that acquired coins below $5,700, according to blockchain intelligence firm IntoTheBlock.These players could increase their exposure on price drops below $5,000, especially with the miners' reward halving (a bitcoin supply cut) due in two months. Alfred said the price range of $2,500 to $5,000 offers incredible value for investors.  The bear market, which began at the end of 2013, ran out of steam at the 200-week average in 2015. Back then, the average was placed near $220. The sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached in December 2017 also ended at the 200-week MA in December 2018. The long lower wick attached to the current weekly candle suggests seller exhaustion below the 200-week average. If history is a guide, bitcoin looks to have found a bottom below $4,000.That does not necessarily imply a v-shaped recovery to $10,000. If the equities resume their sell-off, prices might revisit sub-$5,000 levels. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.

3,www.coindesk.com,1 month ago,Bitcoin's Sharp Price Drop May Have Been Prompted by $120M Scam Sell-off,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-sharp-price-drop-may-have-been-prompted-by-100m-scam-selloff,"People in control of the PlusToken wallets have been liquidating their 
stolen bitcoins since August and likely played a big role in pushing 
bitcoin ...","Mar 9, 2020 at 11:55 UTC","Bitcoin has plunged to two-month lows since Sunday, possibly due to an over-$100 million liquidation by PlusToken scammers, analysts say. ","The top cryptocurrency fell by nearly 10 percent from $8,900 to $8,000 on Sunday to register its single-biggest daily decline since September 2019, according to Bitstamp data. Then on Monday, bitcoin (BTC) slipped further to two-month lows below $7,700 during the Asian trading hours.At press time, the cryptocurrency’s global average price, as calculated by CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, has recovered somewhat to $7,925.While the sudden price drop has taken place alongside a bloody day in the traditional markets, there may be another factor driving down bitcoin's value so severely.“The sudden drop in prices seems to arise out of the selling of BTC by PlusToken,” Ashish Singhal, CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange CoinSwitch.co told CoinDesk. On Saturday, scammers in control of the remaining wallets of the China-based Ponzi scheme moved 13,000 BTC (worth around $101 million currently, but close to $120 million at the time) to so-called “mixers” and may have offloaded their holdings, causing prices to fall sharply, according to Singhal. Mixers are used to obfuscate the source of a crypto transaction by outputting batches with different coins than are sent in.PlusToken had posed as a cryptocurrency wallet and swindled investors out of possibly as much as $2 billion in cryptocurrency by promising rewards. While six of its masterminds were arrested in June 2019, the authorities could not seize 180,000 BTC, 6,400,000 ether (ETH) and 111,000 tether (USDT), which were sent from scam victims to PlusToken wallets, according to Chainalysis. Trader Kevin Svenson has also associated the latest price drop with PlusToken holdings being dumped into the market. People in control of the PlusToken wallets have been liquidating their stolen bitcoins since August and likely played a big role in pushing bitcoin down from $12,000 to $6,500 in the four months to November. as noted by Ergo Research at the time. Back in December, the scammers still controlled 20,000 bitcoins, of which, 13,000 look to have been moved for liquidation over the weekend.The onchain activity on Saturday was again noted by Ergo Research:Some, of course, may argue that moving coins to mixers does not necessarily result in liquidation and the sell-off seen from Sunday was caused by the coronavirus-led crash in the global financial markets. Indeed, negative global macro factors – such as the equity market sell-off and record low in the U.S. government bond yield – may have also played a role in pushing bitcoin lower, as noted by popular analyst Jacob Canfield. Still, a major PlusToken liquidation could well have weighed heavy over bitcoin’s price if it did occur. The cryptocurrency was trading steadily above $9,000 on Saturday as the scammed coins were being moved to mixers and fell sharply the following day. Further, traditional markets were closed over the weekend.Canfield too listed a PlusToken dump as one of the factors possibly responsible for bitcoin’s price drop. So how did bitcoin's price drop look from a technical perspective?“Bitcoin needed higher prices on the 4-hour chart to get itself into a neutral stance between $9,200-$9,600,” popular Twitter analyst Mr. Anderson told CoinDesk. “Once that battle was lost it left the 12-hour chart in an ugly position as well and things snowballed quickly,” Anderson said. In the aftermath, the head-and-shoulders breakdown, a bearish reversal pattern, seen on the daily chart suggests the rally from December lows near $6,400 has ended and the bears have regained control. The bias will remain bearish as long as prices are holding below the former support-turned-resistance of the neckline, currently placed at $8,450. A bullish reversal now requires a convincing UTC close above the March 7 high of $9,213. That would invalidate the lower-highs setup.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.

Markets spiking up, markets spiking down, longs taking drawdowns, shorts getting stopped out on intraday bounces. While investor sentiment across markets was negative, there was also a sense of confusion as “there was nowhere to hide” in terms of assets. Interestingly, I’ve yet to speak with anyone who made a “real killing” in that week’s trading. The ones who fared best are the ones who moved out of assets and into USD/hard currency and now have many options as to where to vest that capital.On March 12, bitcoin (BTC), having already traced down from $9,200 to $7,700 and then to $7,200 in the prior few days, plunged from $7,200 to $3,800 before spiking up and settling in the $4,800 to $5,200. The move tested the resolve of bitcoin bulls who had expected the upcoming halving to continue to drive the price higher. Similarly, sentiment towards the crypto king and leading decentralized currency plunged, with many pointing to bitcoin’s failure to be a hedge in troubled times - something that was long assumed to be a given due to the “digital gold” nature of bitcoin. I, however, believe these investors are mistaken in their analysis and the safe-haven nature of bitcoin is continuing.See also: Noelle Acheson:  Why Bitcoin’s Safe-Haven Narrative Has Flown Out the WindowEarlier that week, I wrote a short post on my thoughts around the BTC drawdown from $9,200 to $7,700. In it, I pointed out that gold prices were also taking a drawdown along with stocks and rates. My suspicion was there was some sort of liquidity crunch happening causing a cascading fire sale of assets. This more or less played out exactly as one would expect, with all markets tanking later in the week and the Federal Reserve stepping in with a liquidity injection for short-term markets. This liquidity injection included an expansion of the definition of collateral.Having worked in both rates and equities, I’ve noticed equities traders tend to ignore moves in rates and it’s, unfortunately, a waste of a very powerful signal. Specifically, “significant” or “odd” moves in short-term markets signal shifts in the underlying liquidity needs for market participants. While repo markets have many intricacies and dynamics, here is a general outline of what they do and how one might use them.For context, a repo (repurchase agreement) is a short-term loan – generally overnight – where one party sells securities to another and agrees to repurchase those securities at a date in the near future for a higher price. The securities serve as collateral, and the price difference between the initial sale and repurchase is the repo rate – i.e. the interest paid on the loan. A reverse repo is the opposite of this – i.e. one party buys securities and agrees to sell them back later.Repo markets serve two important functions for the broader market. The first is that financial institutions such as hedge funds and broker-dealers, who often own lots of securities and little cash, can borrow from money market funds or mutual funds that often have lots of cash. This liquidity crunch and ensuing government intervention is laying the foundation for bitcoin’s adoption as a safe haven asset.The hedge funds can use this cash to finance day-to-day operations and trades, and money market funds can earn interest on their cash with little risk. Mostly, the securities used as collateral are U.S. Treasurys. The second function for repo markets is the Fed has a lever to conduct monetary policy. By buying or selling securities in the repo market, it is able to inject or withdraw money from the financial system. Since the global financial crisis, repo markets have become an even more important tool for the Fed. Sure enough, the 2008 crash was preceded by odd movements in repo markets, showing what a good indicator of the future repo can be.With equities selling off in larger and larger moves and the markets becoming more volatile, the Fed injected liquidity into the short-term markets. While some headlines claim the Fed spent $1.5 trillion in a recent move to calm equities markets, those headlines are a bit sensationalist and are trying to equate last week’s actions to TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program, which allowed the Fed to purchase toxic debt from bank balance sheets along with said banks’ stocks). And I say this as someone with very little trust in the Fed. This wasn’t a bailout but was a move to calm funding markets and the money is now part of the repo markets making it a short-term debt. See also: Despite Bitcoin Price Dips, Crypto Is a Safe Haven in the Middle EastLet’s take a step back and think about what that means – short-term markets where parties exchange very liquid collateral had a funding crisis, implying that market participants on aggregate didn’t have cash or didn’t want collateral in return for cash, and needed the intervention of the Fed to continue functioning. There is no way to cut this as a positive. This would go a long way in explaining the wild movements and unprecedented yields hit across the entire yield curve. To make matters worse, this is not a new phenomenon. There was a funding crisis in September 2019 as well. It is clear that the repo markets are struggling without the Fed’s intervention.Given the fire sale we saw recently, and the whipsaw in the Treasurys markets, I suspect some funds were caught off guard, especially by the move in oil futures, and were unable to get funding. This then led to a sale of assets to generate cash and then a cascade of sales across markets.To clarify, I keep putting “and gold” in parentheses because the commentary applies to both markets given the nature of their fixed supply. I consider BTC to be a better version of gold as it is provably scarce, among other benefits. However, gold has enamored mankind since…well, the dawn of mankind. So while I think BTC is the better option, gold has a place in portfolios not quite ready for digital currencies.Bitcoin had a bad week, retracing much of 2019’s gains but remaining positive on a Y/Y basis (though it’s up again more recently). Here are the positives: Bitcoin and traditional safe-haven assets all sold off, bitcoin is now trading very cheaply on a USD basis, and the fundamental analysis and value proposition remains unchanged. Because of bitcoin’s newer, more volatile nature, the moves in this market will naturally be more extreme.People think bitcoin lost its safe-asset use case but this liquidity crunch and ensuing government intervention is laying the foundation for bitcoin’s adoption as a safe-haven asset.It’s easy to talk about long-term theses and other “hopeium” in the face of this nascent market’s most extreme recent drawdown and ignore the fact that a ton of people lost a ton of money. So let’s consider the short-term thesis:A “first-level” analysis would conclude BTC went down while stocks went down, and so there is no “store of value,” nor does it function as a “safe haven.” I cannot stress how useless this commentary is, and masquerading it as “analysis” is somewhat insulting. Anybody with mediocre programming skills can plot two lines and point to a correlation – what value has this analysis added? None. That aside, consider gold in 2008. Gold prices fell sharply at the beginning of the financial crisis, only to rally after TALF (Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facilities), which was a program to increase credit availability and support economic activity by facilitating renewed issuance of consumer and small business asset-backed securities. Unlike TARP, TALF money came from the Fed and not the U.S. Treasury and so the program did not require congressional approval but an act of Congress forced the Fed to reveal how funds were lent. Other relief measures were implemented and then further bolstered by quantitative easing (QE), where central banks purchase a predetermined number of government bonds to increase the money supply and inject money directly into the economy. In the U.S. QE started in November 2008 and ended about six years and $4.5 trillion later. This serves to illustrate that safe-haven assets may sell off during a liquidity crunch but afterwards investors begin to see the need for assets with sound money properties that offer protection from currency devaluation.See also: Cash Is the New Safe Haven as Crypto, Gold Continue to TankFor cryptocurrency markets, the signs of a pullback were building. I personally watch Bitmex leveraged positions to get an indication of where the market is. Whenever leveraged positions build up to an extreme, the market tends to (possibly is forced to) move in the opposite direction and clear out the leveraged positions. There were over $1 billion in leveraged longs on Bitmex and from what I last read, roughly $700 million of those were wiped out during the week of the sell-off. It is a painful but necessary cleansing.Because bitcoin is a mined coin with model-able production costs, it is important for fundamental investors to follow miner behavior closely. Leading up to the crash, miner inventory had built up. Miners either sell coins to market or build up reserves to sell when prices are more favorable. This is called the MRI (miner rolling inventory). Chainalysis put out this fascinating chart that shows miners generated inventory vs. inventory sent to exchanges. One could assume miner hoarding is a sign that there is an expectation of a price increase, but a liquidity crunch throws all that out the window, AND historical data suggests that returns are better when miners are not hoarding.Losing money sucks, but when you invest or trade it’s something you should get used to. If you’re a stellar investor, you’re probably still losing money 40 percent of the time. So, the short term shows a buying opportunity as we saw a large capitulation last week. Alternative.me's BTC Fear and Greed Index implies a startling change from last month flipping from a score of 59 (Greed) to 8 (Fear) showing that fear is currently the driving market force, and it’s almost always better to buy when others are fearful. But I would urge caution. Until we see BTC, gold and Treasurys dislocate from the S&P 500 i.e. break their recent correlation, I am cautiously deploying capital.On a long horizon, things are going according to plan. The halving is still some blocks and months away. Miners who are already feeling the pain of this price reduction will continue to struggle to be profitable as block rewards are halved. On Sunday, March 15 the Fed slashed baseline interest rates to 0 percent and announced the purchase of $700 billion in bonds and securities to calm financial markets and create an economic stimulus. After the recent pullback in stocks, many of us had assumed the Fed would engage in a new form of QE. If history serves us correctly, this is likely the first of many asset purchase programs.The money printer is coming, and when that starts, fixed supply assets such as BTC and gold will do well. The stock market has spoken, it is demanding an economic stimulus and has shown over the past year that, without government liquidity injections, it cannot sustain its current growth.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

by market capitalization into a historically attractive zone, according ...","Mar 20, 2020 at 16:17 UTC","Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent sell-off has pushed prices on the top cryptocurrency by market capitalization into a historically attractive zone, according to one indicator. ","Prices fell from $10,200 in mid-February to 12-month lows below $4,000 last week, dashing many hopes for a strong rally ahead of the May 2020 mining reward halving. However, with the price slide, a key indicator called the “Puell Multiple” has declined to levels suggesting the value of newly issued bitcoins on a daily basis is quite low compared to historical standards. Put simply, this signals appears to show the cryptocurrency is now undervalued. The Puell Multiple is calculated by dividing the daily issuance value of bitcoins in U.S. dollar terms by the 365-day moving average of the daily issuance value. Daily issuance refers to new coins added to the ecosystem by miners, who receive coins as rewards for validating blocks on the blockchain. Miners usually cover mining costs by selling coins into the market.The Puell Multiple slipped to 0.41 on March 16, the lowest level since Jan. 17, 2019 and was last seen at 0.47, according to data provided by the blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode.The metric is now hovering in the green zone or the range of 0.3 to 0.5, which has marked bear market bottoms in the past. Historical data also shows the indicator enters the green zone in the last leg of the bear market following which the bearish momentum weakens. Bitcoin’s bear market from the record high of $20,000 reached in December 2017 ended at lows near $3,200 in mid-December 2018, with the Puell Multiple hitting a low of 0.30.The indicator entered the green zone during the last leg of the bear market, which began on Nov. 14, 2018, when prices fell below the long-held support of $6,000 and slipped to $4,000 by Nov. 20. On that day, the Puell Multiple fell below 0.5, signaling undervaluation. The selling pressure ebbed in the following days, allowing a recovery from $3,400 to $4,400 in the last week of November. While the bounce was short-lived, the sellers could not do much damage, as evidenced by prices bottoming out just $200 below November's low of $3,400 on Dec. 15. That’s when the Puell Multiple was hovering near 0.30. Going back more than half a decade, bitcoin’s downward move from the November 2013 high of $1,100 came to an end near $150 in January 2015. The Puell Multiple also bottomed out near 0.30 in mid-January. Similarly, the preceding bear market had ended in November 2011 with the indicator’s drop to 0.30.The latest under-0.50 reading on the indicator suggests the worst is behind us. Other metrics like the market value to realized value (MVRV) Z-score are also indicating undervaluation. However, the cryptocurrency might not be out of the woods yet, as the Puell Multiple hasn’t dropped to 0.30 – the level which has marked bear market lows in the past. If history is a guide, we may see one more bout of selling, which could likely push prices back to the $5,000-$4,000 range and the Puell Multiple down to 0.30. ""We can certainly retest recent lows once or twice,"" Mike Alfred, CEO of Digital Assets Data, told CoinDesk, while adding that dips below $5,000 will be short-lived, courtesy of strong demand from long-term holders – investors who bought bitcoins before the massive rally from $6,000 to $20,000 seen in the fourth quarter of 2017 and during the last five weeks of 2018. Bitcoin is currently trading near $6,550, representing a 69 percent from recent lows under $4,000.

Among other closures and down-scalings, its mining business is being shuttered. “Digital Farms' cryptocurrency mining operations have been suspended indefinitely, primarily due to the sharp decline in the market price for bitcoin,” the company wrote.Last May, DPW announced Digital Farms, formerly Super Crypto Mining, had obtained a 617,000 square foot facility in the U.S. to set up operations with “immediate access to 28 megawatts of power and an infrastructure to support up to 300 megawatts.”Super Crypto Mining was acquired by DPW in January 2018 and later re-branded as Digital Farms. According to DWP's annual report filed with the SEC in April 2019, the mining operation had started off by borrowing $5 million from two institutional investors and buying a thousand of Bitmain's Antminer S9 mining machines. Mining of bitcoin, litecoin (LTC) and ether (ETH) under the new owner kicked off in February 2018.See also: Miners Are Selling More Bitcoin Than They Are MiningThe company’s first yearly revenue from crypto mining was $1.67 million, a small portion of DPW's total $27 million revenue, according to the 2019 report. The company had been planning to mine the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and also offer cloud mining services. Discussing its scenario under the coronavirus pandemic, DWP said in the latest filing: ""Due to the unprecedented market conditions domestically and internationally, and the effect COVID-19 has had and will continue to have on the Company’s operations and financial performance, the extent of which is not currently known, the Company is temporarily suspending guidance for 2020.""Bitcoin's price has been dropping since February from levels above $10,000, making it hard for the mining industry to return a profit.

long-term investors popularly known as “HODLers” don't seem to be deterred.","Mar 17, 2020 at 17:05 UTC",Bitcoin’s (BTC) price volatility has surged to record highs but the long-term investors popularly known as “HODLers” don't seem to be deterred. ,"The cryptocurrency’s three-month implied volatility rose to a lifetime high of 6.8 percent on a daily basis (equal to 130 percent annualized) on March 13, according to crypto derivatives research firm Skew. The implied daily volatility stood at 3.5 percent (66.9 percent annualized) a week ago. Going further back, the gauge had dropped to a 12-month low of 3.2 percent (61.2 percent annualized) on Feb. 23, when bitcoin was trading near $10,000. Bitcoin’s ATM volatility on one-month options, which measures the calculated or implied mid-rate volatility for an at-the-money (ATM) option, also hit a record high of 184 percent on an annualized basis on Monday. See also:  Retail Investors Are Buying, the Bitcoin Institutions Are Selling, Traders SayThe unprecedented implied volatility – the option market's opinion of bitcoin’s potential moves – could be associated with the recent sell-off. Bitcoin topped out at $10,500 in mid-February and fell to 12-month lows below $4,000 last week. That's a solid 63 percent drop in just four weeks. The cryptocurrency shed nearly 39 percent of its value in just a single day on March 12. Many observers say extreme bouts of price volatility will hinder bitcoin’s global mass adoption. Even so, the long-term investors appear to be unperturbed. While bitcoin’s price is down 40 percent on a month-to-date basis, the number of HODLers, or addresses holding coins for over a year, remains near the record high of 18.68 million reached in February. As of March 16, there were 18.21 million addresses holding bitcoins for more than 12 months, according to data provided by the blockchain intelligence firm IntoTheBlock. The data indicate bitcoin’s investor community may believe bitcoin could become an integral part of the financial system in the future. “They see any drop in price as a mere speed bump on the road leading to where BTC’s value both in utility and price is substantially larger than what has been seen to date,” Justin Gillespie, CEO of Titus Investment Advisors and a bitcoin trader, told CoinDesk.George McDonaugh, managing director and co-founder of London-based digital asset investment company KR1 plc, says long-term holders are believers in the technology and are immune to price volatility.  He added that they could continue to pick up cheap bitcoins in the interim because the cryptocurrency is still viewed among many as a hedge against the current global macro environment. The coronavirus outbreak has forced the U.S., Italy and a few other nations to put entire cities into lockdown. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has responded by cutting the benchmark fed funds rates to near 0.0 percent and launching a quantitative easing program worth $700 billion per month. Other major central banks have also delivered rate cuts over the past week or so. See also: Bitcoin Is Now Undervalued, Suggests This Price Metric“When banks are shut, bitcoin is open; when ATMs are closed, bitcoin is cash; when governments print unfathomable sums of cash, bitcoin cannot be debased,” McDonaugh told CoinDesk. Mike Alfred, CEO of Digital Assets Data, echoed similar sentiments while stressing the HOLDers are, for the most part, not macro traders but are ordinary retail investors with a very long-term perspective.“The macro backdrop has never been more bullish for bitcoin with a magical combination of synchronized global liquidity and declining trust in central banks and centralized authority,” Alfred told CoinDesk. So far, however, bitcoin has not worked as a haven asset during the recent market turmoil and instead has moved in tandem with the equity markets. The cryptocurrency’s 40 percent drop in value has coincided with a 17 percent fall in the  S&P 500 index since the start of the month. Bitcoin is set to undergo mining reward halving sometime in May 2020. As the name suggests, the rewards per block mined will be halved from current 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC. The process is repeated every four years and is aimed at curbing inflation in the cryptocurrency.Many long-time market participants say bitcoin will pick up a strong bid after halving. “While the cryptocurrency may not have found a floor yet, the supply reduction due to the halving event will eventually drive the price up,” Olga Kochmar, CEO of mining farm operator Zionodes told CoinDesk. The bullish narrative related to halving could also be the reason behind investors holding onto their coins despite the recent price crash. Record number of addresses holding bitcoin for more than a year does not imply actual demand for adoption, as a single person can hold multiple addresses. “Bitcoin addresses are pseudonymous, which allows a single user or wallet to create a near-infinite amount of addresses that all belong to the same user. As a simplistic comparison, think of Bitcoin addresses as cash. A person can have multiple $20 bills in their wallet, but they all belong to the same wallet and user,” said Wayne Chen, CEO of Interlapse Technologies and founder of Coincurve.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own.,"The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a weekly newsletter focused on institutional investment in crypto assets. Sign up for free here.Listen. That whooshing sound you hear is not just the bitcoin (BTC) price. It’s also the sound of the safe-haven narrative flying out the window, probably for ever.March 12 was not bitcoin’s worst 24-hour price crash ever. That honor belongs to April 11, 2013, when bitcoin fell by almost 50 percent. Comparing the two
crashes helps to understand what happened this week. It also helps to form a picture
of what this sector could look like going forward.For context, in April 2013 Ethereum had not yet launched, Mt. Gox was the largest bitcoin exchange and the Harlem Shake meme dominated the internet. The previous month, the price ranged between $34 and $94, and the average transaction (according to Coin Metrics) was under $800. Chinese demand powered the retail-driven market. Professional custody services were just warming up (BitGo, one of the first, was formed in 2013). Coinbase was less than a year old. BitMEX had not yet created the perpetual swap. Heck, CoinDesk didn’t even exist then (we started publishing the following month).In 2013, bitcoin was the “asset of the future,” a decentralized representation of value, a protest against powerlessness and a way for savers to reduce their vulnerability to central bank action. Market participants believed in the story. By some accounts, the price started to rise along with international attention on the Cyprus banking crisis, in which a haircut was applied to all deposits over €100,000 at the two largest banks.If you were a 2013 bitcoin investor and you time-travelled to now, you would not recognize the scene. Chinese demand has dissipated. Mt. Gox is a bitter memory. A lively derivatives market drives volume. Big, incumbent financial institutions have set up digital asset desks. Really, you’d pinch yourself.You might also be a bit alarmed. You’d love the legitimacy and the platform sophistication, and you’d get genuinely excited about all the smart people who have left their finance jobs to work in crypto. You’d almost certainly be stunned the sector has evolved so quickly. And you’d be thrilled the institutions have taken an interest. Finally, professional traders have grasped the possibilities.But you’d also wonder where
the ideology went, where was the focus on empowerment rather than profits. Crypto markets went and grew up. They substituted their hoodie for a button-down and put on some big-boy shoes. They made new friends, became more responsible and entered a new world of risk.To get a feel for how
that risk has changed the sector, let’s look at the market behavior of the two
crashes. Back then most market participants were long. The absence of a liquid derivatives market made shorting relatively cumbersome and expensive. Trading was dominated by those who had taken the time to understand bitcoin, and they acted according to whether they thought it was over- or under-valued. The April 11 crash was triggered by profit taking – the price had more than tripled in the previous two weeks. It was a narrative-driven slump.What’s more, it was
isolated. That same week, the S&P 500 was largely flat, as was gold. It was
entirely a bitcoin story. Today the market is dominated by professional trading desks. They know about markets. While many are probably attracted to the idea of a fiat alternative, their jobs are about playing numbers. For them, it’s not about bitcoin, it’s about volatility.  Last week’s crash was a liquidity event, triggered by margin calls in crypto and other assets, and by a massive investor panic. This crash was about raising cash and covering liquidity. It had nothing to do with bitcoin itself. Nor was it isolated – the S&P 500 suffered its worst 24-hour slump in history. Bitcoin’s story was not part of the activity this week. Bitcoin was just another financial asset getting trampled as investors headed for the exit.That is why its safe
haven narrative has died.And that’s a good
thing. Let’s look at why.First, bitcoin was never a safe haven. Even before this recent crash it was just too volatile, too young and too untested for that role. In spite of the lack of logic, the narrative endured because so many wanted it to be true.Now that we can put that legend to rest – an asset that can fall by over 40 percent intraday is unlikely to ever be taken seriously as a safe haven – more realistic expectations should emerge. This will support credibility amongst the investment community and perhaps give bitcoin a more justifiable role in portfolio management.Also, this week has revealed there is no such thing as a safe haven. Gold and T-bills, the assets the market traditionally turns to in times of turmoil, also fell, largely due to liquidity squeezes. Investors were scrambling to raise cash this week – but even that safe-haven asset could come under strain as the global economy tips into recession and geopolitics adds tensions to monetary policy as well as faith in sovereign credit. Yet, portfolios need diversification – market assumptions may have been turned upside down and trust in correlations may take some time to recover, but the underlying math hasn’t changed. Even with investment principles in turmoil, the demand for alternative assets will not go away, and professional investors are already taking stock, adjusting objectives and rebalancing.In a world worried
about income, assets like bitcoin and gold that don’t depend on cash flows for
their valuation are likely to occupy an increasingly important role in
investment allocations as “alternative assets.”The greater the range
of alternative assets, the better for investors, especially in troubling times
like these. Analysts and fund managers will be looking for opportunities to
offset the upcoming shift in market fundamentals – many are likely to take a
closer look at bitcoin, which does not depend on macroeconomic metrics. In a market where
relationships are broken and assumptions are smashed, an alternative asset –
vulnerable as it may be to money flows – does start to take on an appealing
narrative of its own, more innovative and more credible than that of the safe
haven.With this, the integration into traditional finance that we wanted for bitcoin can do so much more than make it vulnerable to the ravages of global sentiment. It can also finally bring it the opportunity it deserves.Watch: What Does The Fed's 0% Rate Cut Say About Bitcoin?The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Now crypto traders are wondering how long this new rally will last.  ","Bitcoin (BTC) is up 1 percent in the past 24 hours of trading, currently changing hands at $6,224 as of 19:00 UTC. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization may be trending below its 10-day moving average in price, but it’s still above its 50-day average, the signal of a continued upward trend. On Coinbase, prices were as high as $6,993 on the U.S. exchange over the past 24 hours. That’s an 80 percent appreciation from its lows of $3,845 on March 12, which was hit, in part, by  liquidations on BitMEX  coronavirus-related news. “We saw buying in large sizes from some larger players in the last couple of days from $5,000 and up,” said Darius Sit, managing partner of Singapore-based trading firm QCP Capital. Over the past 24 hours, Bitfinex traded on its spot markets more than $400 million worth of cryptocurrencies, according to the exchange. This coincided with a price spread developing and arbitrage opportunities forming on exchanges like Bitfinex and BitMEX. Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino told CoinDesk the action comes from ""a combination of multiple factors [including] halving, hedging against the traditional market and an important number of fiat inflows entering crypto markets to take advantage of the recent decline.”See also: The Puell Multiple Is Turning Bullish on BitcoinWith the potential of government stimulus plans boosting economic activity, bitcoin has been very bullish. So where is bitcoin's price going? Professional stakeholders, as usual, differ on opinions and strategies. “Conditions look set for a stellar rise with unprecedented monetary easing and fiscal stimulus along with the halving narrative.

We're seeing record interest from first-time bitcoin buyers.”River Financial is relatively small, with just under 10,000 active user accounts, but this volume surge appears to be rippling across markets. Gemini’s head of communications, Carolyn Vadino, confirmed the New York-based crypto exchange saw a surge in activity over the weekend.“During this time of market uncertainty, we continue to expect to see higher volumes than normal,” Vadino said.Likewise, one over-the-counter (OTC) trader in Latin America, who provides liquidity to several of the world’s leading crypto exchanges, said his desk has seen “two to three times” the normal buy orders since the price dropped dramatically on Thursday. “You still have a lot of people who are long that are trying to get out,” said the trader, who did not want to be named. “It’s more related to hedge funds liquidating than anything else. ... There’s a lot of bitcoin-collateralized dollar loans out there to miners or people who are long crypto.”See also: Bitcoin Is Now Undervalued, Suggests This Price MetricAnother U.S.-based OTC trader confirmed that companies with heavily leveraged loans played into the wave of institutional investors selling off. Yet, retail traders are buying up bitcoin so aggressively that it’s throwing the whole market off, according to the anonymous trader in Latin America.“I hope this doesn’t stay so long because it could be damaging. We all need some type of volume to survive,” he said. In short, if more people are buying than selling, trading or leveraging it will be tricky for liquidity providers like himself to profit from arbitrage. This would pressure exchanges to find new market makers, or force market makers themselves to try different strategies. No one quite knows how that would play out if it happens over several months. “It’s basically half the volume that was trading [when bitcoin was priced] at $9,000, even if it’s the same amount of bitcoin changing hands,” he said.Exchanges like BitMex were briefly overloaded during a period of dramatic volatility last week, experiencing an hour-long outage. According to the analytics firm Skew, BitMex and OKEx alone facilitated nearly $10 billion in bitcoin futures trades on Thursday, March 12.However, OKEx Financial Markets Director Lennix Lai said it doesn’t make sense for any significant exchange to implement a “circuit breaker,” which automatically halts trading on their platform if rapidly falling prices cripple the system.“If one major exchange has a circuit breaker while the others keep on trading, the sell-off pressure would simply transfer to another exchange,” Lai said. See also:  Governments Face Trade-Offs on Privacy in Fight Against CoronavirusAs such, smaller brokerages like Leishman’s are focused on preparing their back-end selling mechanisms for unprecedented traffic.“You can’t choose when volatility hits and the orders start coming in,” Leishman said. “Almost all of our orders have been buy orders. ... We need to make sure the prices we are promising users don't lose us money but are fair.”On the other hand, at least traders at OTC desk Cumberland don’t appear to be concerned about long-term instability.“In our role as a liquidity provider, we continue to see both buying and selling from our counterparties,” a Cumberland spokesperson said. “Including those who have been sitting on the sidelines for a while using this as an opportunity to re-engage in the market.""

Prices were better bid 24 hours ago when global equities were flashing green. Sentiment, however, soured during Wednesday's Asian trading hours and futures tied to the S&P 500 fell by 5 percent, triggering a ""limit down"" – the maximum percentage decline possible in one trading day. Asian equities also put in a weak performance, providing negative cues to the major European equity indices, which are currently down at least 3 percent. “Global equities markets continue to reject stimulus efforts put forward by the U.S., with the S&P 500 recording its largest one day drop on Monday since 1987,"" said Matthew Dibb, co-founder and COO of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds.See also: Why Bitcoin Is the Only Truly Free Market, Feat. Dan TapieroThe U.S. Federal Reserve delivered an emergency rate cut of 100 basis points early Monday and announced new quantitative easing in the form of at least $700 billion in asset purchases. Further, the Trump administration said Tuesday it's planning to send checks directly to U.S. citizens as part of a $1 trillion stimulus program. Even so, the stock markets are flashing red, which likely indicates investors are worried that monetary easing will not spur economic activity. After all, the threat to global supply and demand is not being caused by institutional systemic failures but by measures related to the growing coronavirus pandemic. As a result, a sustainable price recovery in both stocks and bitcoin may remain elusive until there is a stabilization in the coronavirus infection curve.""However, if the impact of the coronavirus outbreak intensifies beyond the global lockdown we are already experiencing, it could spark a further run for cash,"" Simon Peters, analyst and crypto-asset expert at multiasset investment platform eToro, told CoinDesk. Should that happen, investors may again look to bitcoin as a source of liquidity, leading to another wave of selling. Bitcoin is currently consolidating, showing indecision in the marketplace, said Peters. That seems to be the case as the cryptocurrency is stuck in a triangle pattern on an intraday chart. Bitcoin has carved out an ascending triangle that comprises two trendlines – a horizontal line connecting price resistance and a rising trendline joining higher lows. A four-hour close above the upper edge of the triangle, currently at $5,945, would open confirm an ascending breakout and open the doors for $6,425 (December low).However,
if the lower end of the triangle at $4,865 is breached, more sellers may join
the market, yielding a re-test of recent lows under $4,000.The 14-day relative strength index is signaling oversold conditions with a below-30 reading, while the MACD histogram is producing higher lows below the zero line, a sign of weakening bearish momentum. A triangle breakout on the 4-hour chart, if confirmed, could be followed by a quick rally to $6,000.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.

An example of this was the latest letter from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink promising a fundamental reshaping of finance.Bitcoin, although it’s also about fundamentally reshaping finance, has earned a bad reputation when it comes to energy use, thanks to the vast number of specially-designed computers needed to carry out its mining process.Read more: Hyperledger Conference Shows Where Blockchain Can Fight Global WarmingHow you choose to interpret bitcoin’s energy consumption depends on your perspective. Bitcoin supporters might point out that PlayStation, for instance, uses up about as much power as the Bitcoin network, according to research by Bitwise Asset Management. The reinvention of money, they’ll add, is a much loftier goal than playing FIFA 20.On the other hand, the Greta Thunberg generation may question what appears to be just another financial trading instrument – but one that consumes as much electricity as Chile, a country with 18 million people. The recent meltdown in markets caused by coronavirus raises other questions about bitcoin’s place in the world. Bitcoin, sometimes described as “digital gold,” was always seen as a safe haven for investors, un-correlated as it was with the rest of the financial system. But the coronavirus shock saw bitcoin fall even more precipitously than the stock market. Its recent ebbs and flows have mirrored that of the S&P 500.As economist and author Frances Coppola puts it: “If bitcoin can no longer be used as digital gold, what can it be used for?”Some would argue the gradual encroachment of institutional money into bitcoin as a high-yielding alternative asset class comes with its own cost: a newfound correlation with the rest of the financial system.Indeed, there has been an assumption from some quarters of the crypto world that it’s only a matter of time until swathes of institutional investment will flow into bitcoin. This will follow as the network becomes more regulated, they say, and things like dedicated exchange-traded funds (ETFs) emerge.But with a firm focus on ESG among institutional investors of any real size, that may not happen after all, at least not at anything like the scale once predicted.“I think bitcoiners are very much hoping in the future that institutional investors will put their money in bitcoin,” said Alex de Vries, blockchain specialist at PwC. “But it's very unlikely that shareholders of those institutions will allow companies to invest in high-carbon assets.”It’s not easy to take the temperature of large-scale buyside when it comes to crypto. When CoinDesk asked some of the largest investment firms if ESG concerns might be a factor regarding bitcoin as a hedge, most of them declined to comment.It was sort of this niche hippie topic for bleeding-heart liberals and there were certain connotations with ESG that it was largely bullshit.However, one of the largest retirement funds in the U.S., which asked not to be named, said simply: “Things like bitcoin don’t fit into our portfolio.”Within the confines of crypto, the question of ESG in relation to bitcoin does occasionally come up but it's relatively rare, said Matt Hougan, global head of research at Bitwise Asset Management.“I would say it comes up in one out of every 20 serious conversations,” he said.However, Hougan conceded ESG is certainly the topic du jour, and he expects to hear it mentioned more often.“I fully agree that ESG has entered a sort of new era in 2020. It's the combination of Larry Fink's letter, of the Australia wildfires, the California wildfires, Greta's popularity. I do think it’s top of mind. I've overheard ESG investing conversations in coffee shops here in the U.S., which I've never done in the past,” Hougan said.That said, it’s probably fair to say the bitcoin community, for the most part, is not too concerned about environmental issues. For example, Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer of crypto-focused investment firm CoinShares, pointed out that ESG and environmental sustainability tends to come in cycles; it was a big topic 10 years ago, then it died down and now it's big again, she said. “Historically, ESG had sort of been a backwater of investing, where you got sent if you weren't fit for front office,” said Demirors. “It was sort of this niche hippie topic for bleeding-heart liberals and there were certain connotations with ESG that it was largely bullshit.” ESG warriors perhaps share some similarities with the crypto community: Both are growing and passionate movements, and both could be viewed as extremists by the mainstream financial services sector.And though some ESG fans see the value in blockchain for being able to track global supply chains, the goodwill does not extend to bitcoin itself.Lauren Compere, director of shareowner engagement at Boston Common Management, a majority-employee-owned and woman-led investment firm with over $20 billion in assets under management, said millennials and post-millennials want to track how a particular T-shirt is made, for example, or check its provenance using a slavery app.Read more: Everledger Looks Beyond Blood Diamonds With ESG Supply Chain Collaboration“I think from an ESG perspective, they are also looking at, ‘How does something like bitcoin fit into the ecosystem?’” said Compere. “What kind of impact does it have on things like climate? Is it a contributor? Is it an enabler?”Brett Wayman, VP of impact investing at Envestnet, a provider of software to financial advisors, said it’s a question of deciding if the benefit of cryptocurrency as a separate asset class outweighs the negatives of the environmental impacts of Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanisms.I think the climate problem will force bitcoin to self-regulate or reconfigure itself.“Right now I think the environmental impact is pretty extensive. I do think that bitcoin is an interesting investment. But from an energy usage standpoint, my understanding is that it will only become more and more energy-intensive to mine some of these currencies,” said Wayman.(That likely doesn’t hold for cryptocurrencies based on the less-mining-intensive Proof-of-Stake (PoS), which includes the forthcoming overhaul of Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market cap.)Martin Vezer, manager of thematic research at Sustainalytics, which is 40 percent owned by Morningstar, said there are clear environmental concerns when a coin relies on mining, which can be quite energy- and carbon-intensive depending on where the electricity is coming from.“A fundamental question for investors to consider is whether a cryptocurrency is a commodity that actually adds value. In the early trends that we see, a lot of people appear to be buying and selling cryptocurrency as a short-term bet rather than a long-term investment. Sure, this gamble has paid off for some, but others have lost money,” said Vezer.Responsible investors typically look for long-term opportunities with a clear value proposition rather than a short-term betting opportunity, Vezer added. “They weigh the environmental and social risks associated with an asset before adding it to their portfolio,” he said.While much of the data is based on estimates, it’s thought that close to 75 percent of bitcoin mining is fuelled by renewable energy. Bitcoin miners are nomadic and will migrate to the cheapest sources of energy. Over half of all bitcoin mining takes place in China’s Sichuan province, which has excessive hydropower capacity.The portability of bitcoin mining rigs allow for interesting innovations such as consuming wasted energy from oil wells. In such cases, trapped gas is vented into the atmosphere or burnt off by flare towers because it’s not deemed worthwhile to capture and transport.Steve Barbour, the founder of Upstream Data, which operates bitcoin mines on oil fields in Canada, has even described bitcoin mining as a “conservation machine.” The vented gas fuels a generator that the mining computers are plugged into. It’s a relatively low capital expenditure for an oil company, said Barbour, especially when presented with the prospect of future BTC returns.Read more: Yale Researchers Turn to Hyperledger to Track Carbon EmissionsUpstream Data is planning bitcoin mining trials with Canadian Natural Resources, a Toronto Stock Exchange-listed oil and gas producer that reported over $21 billion in revenue last year, Barbour told CoinDesk.“What we are doing with bitcoin mining reduces venting of methane into the atmosphere,” he said. “It’s an example of how an ESG narrative around bitcoin is at least incomplete.”However, Martin Wainstein of the Yale Open Climate project, an advocate of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology generally, said he remains skeptical of such “green” endeavors.“Even though they have gotten very creative to be energy efficient at sources where you have waste, bitcoin is out of control and doesn't work the way it was designed for,” said Wainstein. “I think the climate problem will force bitcoin to self-regulate or reconfigure itself.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

That’s a significant increase from September 2019, when he said he sold roughly 20 bitcoin a month to 50 customers.The appeal of holding value in bitcoin, he said, is that people can access “the money any time they need it.”This appears to be true across the region. One anonymous Syrian trader with family in Lebanon said small Lebanese business owners are struggling to pay their invoices abroad. So, among the few Lebanese with family abroad and the necessary computer skills, some now “buy [bitcoin] locally with cash and liquidate it abroad through friends and family to pay their invoices.”In fact, some Middle Eastern bitcoin traders reported relative newbies are learning quickly and looking to buy bitcoin this week, as global prices dip.Read more: Why Energy Experts Are Watching Crypto as Oil Wars EmergeMeanwhile, in Tehran, an anonymous Iranian bitcoiner said people now “tend to keep their assets in gold, dollars and housing, plus a little bitcoin.” Due to the coronavirus outbreak in Iran, the economic situation has gotten progressively worse. This means fewer public bitcoin meetups and quieter trades among a population with even less faith in national institutions. Small-scale bitcoin mining is now commonplace, locals say, despite the challenges faced by industrial operations.“Bitcoin is a revolutionary product but it needs a few more revolutions,” the Tehran-based bitcoiner said. “In the past, people thought bitcoin was a new type of scam. Now bitcoin is more trusted.”The analytics firm Gate Trade estimated there are now more than 30 Iranian companies using bitcoin, instead of fiat, for cross-border deals. But a Gate Trade spokesperson declined to specify which companies because the greatest barrier to bitcoin adoption in the Middle East appears to be international sanctions. That challenge isn’t limited to Iran.Read more: How Lebanon’s Economic Crisis Highlights Bitcoin’s LimitationsYemeni bitcoin trader Mohammed Alsobhi said roughly five civilians continue to buy a small amount of bitcoin each month. The bitcoin market in Yemen is much smaller and quieter than most in the region due to the widespread censorship of telecommunication networks. But there is interest among locals knowledgeable about computer science.""If I had the capabilities available in developed countries, I would have made great progress in this field,"" Alsobhi said of selling bitcoin in his war-torn nation. ""Most companies that deal globally … are excluding Yemen.""He said he hopes people in Yemen will gain access to crypto markets for trading opportunities. But, he added, war is the biggest barrier to bitcoin adoption in his country because of sanctions. For example, due to compliance concerns, he said people in Yemen cannot download wallets via Google Play. Crypto-curious civilians are barred from the system as the sanction’s collateral damage. Yemen offers a microcosm of the global challenges civilians face using decentralized monetary networks. Stepping back, a currency war emerged from Yemen’s civil war between Iran-backed Houthi rebels, which conquered the former capital city of Sana’a, and the Saudi-aligned Central Bank of Yemen, now in Aden. Yemenites don’t trust either side. Yemeni activist Tawakkol Karman recently accused President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi of being just another pawn under “the Saudi occupation.”As such, sanctions have ripple effects for civilians trapped between failing banks and warring parties. Yemen’s United Nations representative, Abdullah Al-Saadi, accused the Houthi militants of consorting with the ultimate target of U.S. sanctions, the armed forces of Iran.“The militias continue to welcome Iranian experts and receive military support and weapons from Iran,” Al-Saadi said in a U.N. Security Council meeting in February.With widespread reports of Houthi looting and the ongoing humanitarian crisis, the idea of digital cash appeals to some tech-savvy Yemenites in urban areas.“Most of the population of Yemen is in [Houthi]-controlled areas, and are engaged in the bulk of economic activity in the country,” said Hassan Al-Haifi, an ex-banker based in Sana’a. “Cryptocurrency or e-money could help Yemenites under a formidable siege and blockade. … Sana'a would be favorable to a more autonomous currency regime.”Read more: Notes From the WEF: Oil-Producing Nations Want Dollar Alternatives, Just Not BitcoinBen Freeman, a former Goldman Sachs oil trader and CEO of Creo Commodities, said cryptocurrency’s value in the region relies on being decentralized and censorship-resistant. He doesn’t believe bitcoin’s current volatility has any impact on that value proposition, especially in light of the risk Yemen’s civil war presents for Saudi Arabian oil production.“Extreme market sell-offs generally hit most asset classes as assets are sold to generate collateral for losing positions,” Freeman said. “If institutions break down, and bitcoin is independent to any institution or government oversight, then we’ll start to see more flight to bitcoin as an asset class.”The hurdles preventing local adoption in the Middle East aren’t the lack of opportunity or demand; they are primarily the byproduct of political conditions. In Yemen and Iran, bitcoiners may need to avoid both domestic and international compliance risks. Most fintech companies overlook Lebanon and the Palestinian territories, even without sanctions. As such, there are few comprehensive or clear datasets related to usage beyond global (and heavily regulated) crypto exchanges.This makes local markets hard to quantify. Still, it doesn’t appear that broader market dips reduced demand on the ground for over-the-counter (OTC) trades. Institutional players fleeing bitcoin have little impact on demand from grassroots Middle Eastern networks. To the contrary, lower prices present an opportunity for buyers in emerging markets. “Bitcoin transactions in Iran increased [in 2020], compared to previous years,” the Tehran-based bitcoiner said. “But the slope seems gentle.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Dumping by a Ponzi scheme played a mighty role in the selloff, market sources said. Read more here.","The price of bitcoin has fallen to a one-month low below $7,900, amid a wider sell-off in the global financial markets.As of writing, the price of the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is changing hands at $7,837, the lowest in the past 30 days and a 10 percent decline on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.The price decline comes as the global financial markets suffer a wider sell-off, with Brent crude oil dropping over 30 percent on Sunday, its biggest single-day decline since 1991. Underscoring the severity of the global flight from assets perceived as risky is the drop in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield below 0.5 percent for the first time ever, down over two percentage points from a year ago. Bitcoin's sudden price dip also comes as the network's computing power and mining difficulty (a measure of competition among miners) are both expected to reach a new high in just five hours. With more processing power chasing a less-valuable asset, mining farms that are using old mining equipment are in for an even tougher time.Data from the mining pool Poolin shows the most widely used mining computers such as the AntMiner S9 and Avalon 851 are all at a critical breakeven point, meaning they are not generating any daily profits at bitcoin's current price, amid all-time-high mining difficulty.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Oil prices are reporting a 7 percent gain and the U.S. 10-year note yield is trading at 0.70 percent, up nearly 35 basis points from Monday’s record low of 0.35 percent. Gold, however, is down nearly 1 percent at $1,665 per ounce. The recovery may be associated with hopes for fresh fiscal stimulus from U.S. authorities, as pointed out by popular analyst Holger Schaepitz. President Trump announced Monday that the White House and Congress will meet Tuesday to consider substantial economic relief measures, which may include a payroll tax cut.Bitcoin may extend today's gains if equities continue to regain poise. Moreover, with the reward halving (a 50 percent supply cut) due in May, the macro view from some crypto fund managers remains optimistic. ""I expect bitcoin and the broader crypto markets to rebound quickly against the broader equity markets on the back of continuing wider adoption and strong sentiment,"" Hong-Kong based investment fund Kenetic's co-founder and managing partner Jehan Chu told CoinDesk. ""I think short term this macro market shock will make it difficult for funds and startups to raise money, but mid to long term it absolutely strengthens the use case of blockchain technology and crypto,"" Chu added.The long-tail attached to Monday’s daily candle indicates bear fatigue. Further, the MACD histogram on the four-hour chart is printing higher lows below the zero line, a sign of weakening bearish momentum. So a stronger recovery to $8,200 (Monday's high) cannot be ruled out. That said, bitcoin will remain bearish as long as prices stay below the head-and-shoulders neckline resistance, currently at $8,480.On the downside, Monday's low of $7,625 is key support. If breached, that could cause more sellers to join the market and lead to a drop toward $7,000. Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.

The opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own.,"The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a weekly newsletter focused on institutional investment in crypto assets. Sign up for free here.After the market storms of the past couple of weeks, we could all use some (relatively) good news. And it’s this: Storms bring destruction but also clarity.As I write, bitcoin (BTC) is bouncing, but who knows what wild swings it will have gone through by the time this is published? So, bitcoin’s price is not where to look for clarity now. It’s more existential than that.Out of the chaos of the last couple of weeks, in which everything moved together, a clearer distinction has emerged between asset classes.  

Greater clarity itself may be good news, but what we’re seeing is not. Let’s walk through the new fundamentals.First, equities: Expected earnings are down across the board, possibly by a whopping amount. A couple of weeks ago, in the U.S. and Europe, business was humming along, albeit with trepidation. Now, bars and restaurants are closed in many population centers, events have been cancelled, shops are shut, planes are grounded…. The list of sectors impacted by the necessary virus precautions is long and alarming.Next, government bonds: If there’s one thing the bond market hates, it’s inflation. The unwinding of globalization as a result of constricting supply chains will push up manufacturing costs which will feed through to prices. Liberally sprinkle money around the system in the hopes of stimulating spending, in a supply crisis, and you add to the inflationary pressure. Nominal yields on public debt are at historically low levels; inflation will push even more real yields into negative territory.For those worried about inflation, bitcoin is even more resistant than gold. As for corporate bonds, the sharp drop in earnings coupled with increasing costs could trigger a wave of defaults.What about gold? The traditional safe haven will probably do well in the medium term as investors remember its anti-inflationary properties. Gold traditionally outperforms in low-rate environments – no shortage of those these days. Plus, its lack of income makes it less vulnerable to drops in economic activity. And then there’s bitcoin. Its high volatility makes it unsuitable for many investors. But those who think gold makes sense in this world gone mad are most likely going to take a closer look, especially after the perspective-changing storm we’ve just weathered (with probably more to come). Even those skeptical of gold’s place in a diversified portfolio are bound to be curious about a digital alternative that solves for some of the metal’s weak points while revealing relationships with the broader economy that no other asset has.Last week I wrote about how it’s not a safe haven. Here’s the thing: it doesn’t need to be.See also: As This Crisis Worsens, Bitcoin Will Become a Safe Haven AgainFor those worried about inflation, bitcoin is even more resistant than gold. Its hard cap and pre-programmed supply are immune to fluctuations in price. A sharp jump in the price of gold, however, is likely to bring more supply onto the market as production ramps up, and could even impact the estimated supply limit as alternative mining methods become profitable.For those worried about a sharp economic slump, bitcoin is practically the only asset not directly impacted by macroeconomics. There’s no income to cut and no supply chains to hinder access. External factors such as energy costs and supply chains can impact miner economics, but bitcoin itself adjusts for shifts in the maintenance of its network. When miners close down, bitcoin becomes cheaper to mine, which eventually makes the enterprise profitable again.What makes bitcoin even more of a unique asset class is it can be indirectly impacted by macroeconomics, in a big way. The impact will come from many vectors, but especially loose monetary policy, the currency markets, emerging economies and populist tendencies. 1) Loose monetary policy: With central banks around the world hitting the markets with whatever they can, money supply constraints have been thrown out the window. As this crisis unfolds, the amount of money that will enter the system to help out not only markets but also citizens and companies will dwarf what we saw in 2008. Back then, the markets were threatening to drive the economy into a wall, so reassuring them was paramount. Now the threat to the economy is driving markets into the wall. The usual tactics that assuage market panics aren’t going to stimulate demand that is reeling from mandated shutdowns, job losses and generalized fear. Printing money could perhaps help if it actually gets into the hands of the consumers, but that will create inflationary pressure in an economy with no tools left to fight it. The usual anti-inflation weapon is raising interest rates – but doing that in a heavily indebted environment could trigger waves of corporate and even sovereign defaults. Growing inflationary pressures and steady currency debasement will most likely increase interest in disinflationary assets such as bitcoin and gold that can also be used for payment in some circumstances.  2) Currency markets: Investors around the world are fleeing into dollars, pushing up its value relative to other currencies. This could help the U.S. consumer by making imports cheaper, if imports weren’t disrupted by supply chain constrictions. But with a stronger dollar, U.S. manufacturing will become uncompetitive, and foreign holders of dollar-denominated debt could get pushed into default. Other countries' import and debt service costs will skyrocket, weakening their currencies and pushing up the dollar even further. The ballooning demand for dollars could lead to a currency liquidity crunch – the swap lines extended to foreign central banks in last Sunday’s Fed intervention were expanded even further on Thursday, a worrying sign that the initial measure wasn’t enough to relieve the strain on the FX markets.See Also: Into the Unknown: No Limit on Fed Money InjectionsCalls are growing for concerted action similar to the 1985 Plaza Accord, but getting economic powers to follow the lead of an “America First” government whose leader based much of his campaign on promises of a wall is going to be a much harder challenge than in the post-stagflation desperation of the late 20th century. With fractures in the global currency order becoming increasingly apparent, economists and investors will be asking what the next monetary order will look like. Bitcoin may or may not be part of that solution but it is a new tool in the box.  3) Emerging economies: The sharp escalation of dollar-based prices, combined with a demand crunch, could push non-dollar economies into recession, which is likely to lead to social unrest. In some parts of the world, this could be met with swift retaliation or even regime change. The confiscatory bias of political parties navigating a power struggle could intensify interest in a liquid and semi-private store of value. 4) Populist tendencies: While more established democracies will deal with recessions and social unrest through negotiations and trade-offs, even they could veer towards populist tendencies. These will most likely take the form of additional support for overwrought health systems, as well as for citizens and companies hit hard by mandated shutdowns and resulting slump in demand.To keep up the pretence of balanced budgets, this support is likely to be paid for through fiscal policy, which means tax increases. While bitcoin should never be used to avoid taxes (never, ok?), investors in some jurisdictions may feel that the risk of stiff penalties when caught is worth it. But more importantly, fiscal measures are generally more lenient on capital gains than on high incomes, in the spirit of encouraging investment. This could push high-net-worth individuals towards assets with a high risk-return profile.In a market where everything goes up, the resulting dust can blur big-picture vision. After a drenching storm there is damage, but the dust is gone. Edges are sharper and colors are more vibrant. To stretch a metaphor even further, maybe the sun won’t be out for a while, but as we look anew at previously held assumptions, it is likely investors around the world will see in bitcoin attributes that until now have not been so important. This is not investment advice, obviously, and all investors work under different risk-return parameters. It is a reminder that we should all question assumptions, get informed, ask different questions and think things through. And now is a better time to do that than ever before.

18,www.coindesk.com,1 month ago,Price Drop Casts Pall Over Bitcoin Miners' Equipment Upgrades,https://www.coindesk.com/price-drop-casts-pall-over-bitcoin-miners-equipment-upgrades,"Large bitcoin (BTC) mining farm operators in three countries told CoinDesk 
they've been on a buying spree to upgrade or expand facilities since ...","Mar 16, 2020 at 05:00 UTC","Bitcoin’s price crash last week has cast a shadow over mining firms, which have spent over half a billion dollars overhauling equipment over the last six months in preparation for the network’s next so-called halving.","Large bitcoin (BTC) mining farm operators in three countries told CoinDesk they’ve been on a buying spree to upgrade or expand facilities since September, reflecting a shared commitment to staying in the mining game for the long haul. In May, the amount of freshly minted bitcoin awarded to a successful miner every 10 minutes or so will be programmatically split in half, hitting these firms’ top line. Since older equipment is becoming unprofitable even before the reward is cut, more than $500 million has been poured into the new, more efficient machines that can churn out more bitcoin, according to a CoinDesk estimate.But bitcoin price’s recent plunge – crashing to below $5,000 on Friday and recording a 50 percent drop since its high above $10,000 in late 2019 – is creating greater uncertainty about mining farms’ profitability.According to data from mining pool PoolIn, even the most efficient equipment on the market, such as MicroBT’s WhatsMiner M20S and Bitmain’s AntMiner S17 Pro, is generating daily profits at a gross margin below 50 percent. That estimate is based on bitcoin’s current price and mining difficulty (a measure of how competitive it is to mine bitcoin) with an average electricity cost of $0.05 per kilowatt hour (kWh). If bitcoin’s price does not bounce back to a higher point after the halving, which will essentially reduce mining revenue by half, mining farms would have to bear a longer payback period for their investment.“We have been just heads down and kept mining, and bought a bunch of new machines,” said Zheng Xun, CEO of Hashage, which operates several sites in China’s mining hub in Sichuan province. “We already have a large scale so probably won’t buy any more for the time being. We’re maintaining cash flow to see how the market plays out after halving.”That said, it remains to be seen how bitcoin’s overall computing power will react to bitcoin’s price drop in the coming weeks as older mining equipment is expected to shut down. If the computing power and the mining difficulty on bitcoin’s network decrease significantly, the incumbents will be able to mine more coins.But for now, the network’s seven-day rolling average hash rate has shown a downtrend since last week’s price crash, falling to 108 exhashes per second (EH/s) from 118 EH/s around March 9.Chris Zhu, co-founder of the mining pool PoolIn, said in an online panel via WeChat on Friday his expectation before the price crash was bitcoin’s hash rate would still rise slowly. Now he expects the computing power to go down by 20 to 30 percent in the coming months. Global mining farms’ spending glut is reflected in the significant growth of bitcoin’s total computing power in the past half-year.Since September 2019, the hashing power on the bitcoin network has increased by 30 percent, jumping from around 90 EH/s to most recently around 120 EH/s. Given that most of the new equipment has been priced between $20 to $30 per terahash per second (TH/s), mining farm operators may have spent more than $600 million in recent months to get ready for the coming halving event. (For context, 1 EH/s = 1 million TH/s.)Artem Eremin, product manager of 3logic, a reseller of bitcoin ASIC miners, said his clients in Russia and central Asia have started actively buying Bitmain’s AntMiner S17s since October, preparing to replace the old ones. (ASICs, or application-specific integrated circuits, are computer chips customized for heavy-duty activities like mining.)3logic now sells about 2,500 units of the newest equipment per month. It used to be around 5,000 units in October and November, Eremin said, although the buying momentum slowed in December. According to different estimates, a third to half of all mining computers in Russia might have been replaced with the new models by now.Igor Runets, CEO of Bitriver, a mining venue in Bratsk, Russia, said his clients had been buying new ASICs quite actively since last fall but slowed down their purchases in January. “There was the Chinese New Year, the coronavirus outbreak, and then the buying activity just didn’t fully recover after that,” he said.Similarly in China, larger mining farms have been revamping their facilities with top-of-the-line equipment in large quantities since the second half of 2019, when major manufacturers started to ship equipment in bulk.Zheng said his firm scaled up its facilities by 30 percent with the latest machines supplied by Bitmain and MicroBT since the end of the summer in China last year and the deployment was in place prior to the Chinese New Year.Some, like Gabriel Xia’s Spark Capital, a China-based fund, even started the replacement and upgrade work as early as summer 2019. “We sold all the old S9s in summer last year when its price at the second-hand market doubled and started buying new equipment,” he said.Behind this recent buying momentum is the tremendous amount of investment that has poured into the bitcoin mining space in 2019 alone.For perspective, bitcoin’s hashing power hit 1 EH/s for the first time around February 2016. It then took the network about 30 months to reach 50 EH/s in September 2018 – even after the 2017 bull run.But it only took the network 15 months to double that level and reach 100 EH/s in January 2020.This accelerated growth was made possible by major manufacturers such as Bitmain, MicroBT and Canaan, which have produced and shipped more powerful equipment using more advanced computing chips.But technological advancement also means new equipment has become much more expensive. With higher barriers to entry than in 2017, the space has been consolidating, squeezing out retail miners. In 2017, even on the back of bitcoin’s bull run, it might not be so common to hear one customer place a single purchase order worth over $15 million for mining equipment. But things changed in 2019.“With an order like 100 million yuan [$15 million] in 2017, you might be the biggest miner across the network,” said Xia, whose firm has been mining since 2016. By 2019, “$15 million would only make you just an ordinary big customer.”Traditionally, mining farms would sell fresh bitcoins to fund their operations. However, over the last couple of years, a new market for financial services emerged to help them get working capital even if they want to “hodl” (bitcoin slang for holding rather than selling). Xia said Spark Capital’s mined assets have been pledged as collateral for loans it took out to pay utility bills and expand operations. The firm is betting it will be able to sell the coins at a higher price later, and in the meantime it’s shortening the time it takes for the machines to pay for themselves. “We are looking at a longer term when we scale up,” he said. Echoing that strategy, Dmitry Ozersky, CEO of Eletro.Farm, a farm operator in Kazakhstan, said 90 percent of his clients don’t sell their mined coins regularly, instead waiting for big price surges. “Some sold at $12,000, but are now waiting for the price to get above $10,000 again,” he said.  Cynthia Wu, vice president and head of custody at Matrixport, Bitmain’s crypto financial services spinoff, said the startup now boasts up to 200 large farms as clients. And out of around $100 million in outstanding loans, the vast majority was borrowed by miners to pay for electricity bills and new construction, she said. But what goes side by side with that optionality is the risk of having their pledged collateral force-liquidated when bitcoin’s price tumbles more than 50 percent in two days. With major lenders enforcing an average 60 to 70 percent collateral rate, a borrower would face the imminent risk of their pledged bitcoin being force-liquidated unless they choose to pledge additional assets. That’s even assuming they borrowed when bitcoin’s price was at its recent high of $11,000.As to the liquidation strategy, Wu said it may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.“In the U.S., people would sell because this is how they manage their cash flow. But in China, miners are more long-term hodlers, they are more reluctant to sell. In China, it’s a very typical miner mentality: not spending much of what you mine,” she said. Sharif Allayarov, head of Matrixport’s business in Russia, says the industry’s old-timers, who've been out there since 2012 or so, are also usually hesitant to sell. “Newcomers are trying to jump into fiat as soon as they can, but as they stay in the business and see crypto grow, they are becoming less likely to liquidate fast,” Allayarov said. Ethan Vera, CFO and co-founder at mining pool Luxor Tech, said there are definitely miners interested in borrowing money to pay bills but “those are usually OGs in the space that are long-time miners and very bullish on it.”Newcomers want to find ways to limit their exposure to a price drop, he said.“In general a lot of professionals are entering the mining space in North America. They are from investment banking, corporate finance, oil and gas backgrounds. They historically use financial instruments as a way to hedge their business risk,” Vera said. ”My conversation with these large miners want to find ways to limit their exposure to the value of hashrate and the price of bitcoin.”Neither are they keen on trading derivatives – at least not in Russia, Runets and Ozersky said. The crypto futures and options market is not mature enough at the moment and miners got into this game to profit from the risk, not to spend money hedging against it, Ozersky said.However, Matrixport saw some interest for its option product, Wu said. Out of about 70,000 BTC worth of options traded at the platform since the product was launched in October, big miners accounted for around 70 percent. “They want to be more protected when the market moves,” Wu said. “Miners also want to speculate [on the price] to enhance their yield.” Meanwhile, the latest overhaul strategy among large mining farms also leads to a legacy issue: What do they do about older mining equipment like AntMiner S9s and equivalent models, which have dominated the mining market since 2017?With the bitcoin halving two months away, and bitcoin’s price down to the $5,000 range, way under the breakeven point for these older models around $8,000, will they all get shut down soon?“Everybody is trying to get rid of S9s,” said Eletro.Farm’s Ozersky. Yet, he believes S9s are far from done yet. The bottom line is, it all boils down to a miner’s strategy. At Bitriver, which is hosting 70 megawatts to power ASICs for his clients, only around 25 percent of the equipment are S9s, Runets said. “Those who wanted to sell them have already sold.”Spark Capital’s Xia, whose firm already sold all of its S9s, estimates that S9s are only contributing around 20 to 25 percent to bitcoin’s total network.“People have different strategies: some wanted to switch from old machines to the new ones, some opted to buy old ones cheap, hoping to pay them out quickly,” Runets said. Those who stick to S9s don’t want to pull the plug even if they are now working on the verge of breakeven, Runets said. “Nobody is switching off, and until the halving, people are going to squeeze everything they can from their old ASICs.”According to these mining farms, there’s an option to switch S9s to a lower energy consumption at 700 watts instead of 1,600 watts, churning out 9 TH/s instead of 13 TH/s.Similarly, some, like Electro.Farm and mining pool Poolin, are also offering clients the option to boost the productivity of S9 by pairing up two units into one. The idea for both options is to increase the overall gross margin so that S9s may just still bring a daily profit – however modest – at an average electricity cost up to 5 cents per kWh.Further, there are also individuals or smaller farms that are somehow capable of finding much cheaper electricity than larger farms. “If you can find an electricity cost of $0.02 per kWh, sure, you can still play with S9s,” said Hashage’s Zheng, referring to the imminent rainy summer season in China that comes after bitcoin’s halving schedule in May.Individuals in Siberia could even use an S7 with some profit until the end of February, Eremin said. Retail miners, although fewer and fewer, still can be found also in Kazakhstan and in the breakaway region of Abkhazia. “But here’s another thing: These old ASICs are occupying space and earning less money for the farms as they usually charge a fee off each kilowatt,” Eremin said. So big farms are incentivized to replace old ASICs with new ones.For now, Runets said he does not want to see parts of his farm go offline abruptly, so Bitriver is planning to offer temporary energy price discounts to keep its clients’ machines buzzing. But in the long term, Xia said, “the S17, S19 or MicroBT’s M20 and M30 will become the new S9 in the next cycle.”David Pan contributed reporting.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

the involvement of a central custodian, facilitated more batched ...","Mar 20, 2020 at 09:00 UTC","With the global economy reeling from the coronavirus crisis, bitcoiners are increasingly turning to crypto wallets with privacy features.  ","A masking feature called “coinjoin” batches transactions together so it’s harder to identify specific participants. Some refer to it as “mixing,” but others dislike that term for its associations with money laundering.The bitcoin-centric Samourai Wallet, a suite of apps that operates without the involvement of a central custodian, facilitated more batched transactions so far in March than any other month since the feature was first released on desktop last summer.According to bitcoin podcaster Matt Odell, the competing Wasabi Wallet is currently the most popular coinjoin option, with 3,769 downloads since March 3, followed by Samourai Wallet then JoinMarket. Odell said Samourai’s addition of Whirlpool mobile support in February 2020 was “a game-changer.”“Mobile support is a huge step forward in user experience,” Odell said. “All bitcoin users should be encouraged to use coinjoin otherwise they expose their transaction history to those they pay and those who pay them.”By his tally, the number of coinjoin cycles run through Whirlpool this month is 4,758, more than double the number in February. Samourai Wallet said in a statement that the term “collaborative transaction” is more accurate than the colloquial “mixing” because transactions happen directly between users.“This is a fundamentally different proposition than custodial tumblers or ‘mixers’ like Helix,” said Samourai Wallet, referring to the service that landed its creator in legal trouble with the U.S. Department of Justice last month.However, it’s tricky for new bitcoiners to use such privacy tech because many exchanges, like Coinbase, Binance or even smaller exchanges like Bits of Gold, flag mixing wallets as a sign of suspicious activity.Although Bits of Gold CEO Youval Rouach said his exchange saw hundreds of new users over the past two weeks, with new user signups up over 139 percent, they won’t be able to cash out to Samourai Wallet.“We see regulation not as a hurdle, but as a step forward toward mainstream adoption,” Rouach said, adding that regulators may consider mixer wallets a “red flag” and “brokers should report those transactions to the anti-money laundering authorities.”In the U.S., attorney Rafael Yakobi said such policies aren’t necessary because there are legitimate safety considerations for maintaining financial privacy. “Maintaining the privacy of your balances and ties to all past and future transactions, that’s not suspicious,” Yakobi said. “It’s just a normal thing that people should be doing.”Separately, he believes the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s (FinCEN) May 2019 guidance indicates non-custodial services are exempt from money transmitter requirements because they don’t “accept and transmit value on behalf of users.”Attorney Gabriel Shapiro is less certain about FinCEN’s approach to non-custodial wallets with group transactions. “Money transmitter laws are very broad and powerful,” Shapiro said. “I am not confident that the mere fact that Samourai does [group transactions] on a ‘non-custodial’ basis is sufficient to protect them from the ambit of financial regulations.” Regardless of legal ambiguity in some jurisdictions, privacy tools are essential to bitcoin’s value proposition.Bitcoin Core contributor James O’Beirne said the coronavirus crisis is inspiring some bitcoiners to question bitcoin’s core value proposition. ""The inflation hedge use case becomes less compelling if bitcoin's performance mirrors equities; everyday investors will just use what they're already familiar with, which is stocks,"" O’Beirne said. ""Bitcoin has been prone to the same liquidity-induced sell-offs that stocks have, it's been kind of sobering. ... I think that will continue as traditional markets continue to decline.""The price drop is especially relevant to businesses like miners and exchanges. If the bitcoin price drops low and stays there, it will be less profitable for miners to power the network.""Then all the commercial infrastructure of bitcoin is generally going to require longer block confirmation times,” O’Beirne said. “If the security gets low enough in bitcoin, doing the final settlement might start to take as long as it does in the traditional system. Then that big benefit of bitcoin gets impaired.”Bitcoin’s prospective usage as an investment hedge or faster payments network remains unclear. But the censorship resistance use case is still intact so far. According to a source with knowledge of the matter, there is a six-man effort to use cryptocurrency to buy supplies for a medical mask factory in Iran, a nation devastated by both economic sanctions and a coronavirus outbreak that claimed more than 1,284 Iranian lives so far. These rare cases, using cryptocurrency to buy medicine or supplies despite compliance challenges, do not appear to be a leading use case for the growing popularity of group transactions. When asked if they use such privacy tools, the Iranian factory source said he doesn’t know what a “mixer” is and they’ve used just $1,000 worth of cryptocurrency, both bitcoin and the stablecoin tether (USDT).As Yakobi pointed out, many bitcoiners around the world see batched transactions as a regular part of their privacy-tech setup. Batching bitcoin might be comparable to choosing not to write your name in ink on every dollar bill you accept or send.Since the Bitcoin blockchain is public, regular transactions state the user’s address in simple, clear letters. Not writing your name is a good way to not attract stalkers or thieves down the line. O’Beirne said bitcoin is still in its infancy, too immature as a technology to be useful for resisting law enforcement. Beyond fungibility, self-custody is still rare among bitcoin enthusiasts.“In reality, maybe 0.1 percent of anybody is going to do that [self-custody],” O’Beirne said. “But having this option is really important.”Along those lines, Tel Aviv Bitcoin Embassy volunteer Sarah Wiesner said batched transactions are becoming more important as governments like her own in Israel ramp up surveillance measures in the name of coronavirus containment. She sees learning about such privacy-focused wallets as a routine security step for the real circumstances she lives in.“A mixer is not enough, you also need to make your device somewhat safe from mass surveillance,” Wiesner said. “With cash being banned or discouraged [in Tel Aviv], using mixers will be much more important.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

21,www.coindesk.com,1 month ago,Bitcoin Is a Safe Haven for a Worse Storm Than This,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-is-a-safe-haven-for-a-worse-storm-than-this,"Bitcoin (BTC) was designed for many reasons, but one of the most important 
was to be a safe-haven asset during times of financial distress.","Mar 26, 2020 at 16:48 UTC","Byrne Hobart, a CoinDesk columnist, is an investor, consultant and writer in New York. His newsletter, The Diff (diff.substack.com) covers inflection points in finance and technology. ","Bitcoin (BTC) was designed for many reasons, but one of the most important was to be a safe-haven asset during times of financial distress. From the genesis block’s coinbase parameter (“The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”) to today, bitcoin’s fans have treated it as something worth owning when the market goes crazy.So it’s disappointing, to say the least, that after the fastest market rout in recent history, an asset built to be a safe haven … dropped 31 percent while the S&P dropped by a quarter. The daily correlation between the S&P and bitcoin went from slightly negative in February to 0.6 in March. Bitcoin barely responded to the Federal Reserve cutting rates to zero, and shrugged off other monetary interventions.See also: As This Crisis Worsens, Bitcoin Will Become a Safe Haven AgainThis is painful to anyone who owns bitcoin, especially to anyone who bought it as a hedge against exactly this kind of sell-off, and exactly this kind of central bank response. The money printer went brrr, and yet the store-of-value lost value.What’s going on?When we talk about safe-haven assets, we’re really talking about three different kinds of assets, for three kinds of scenarios:Safer versions of risky bets, of the sort you’d invest in to hedge against a mild recession. These might include less-levered companies in a given industry, high-margin companies, corporate bonds rather than equities or any investment in a consumer staples company. When the economy shrinks, it’s bad news for companies in the champagne and luxury hotel business, but doesn’t really dent sales of toothpaste and canned food.Assets people borrow during good times: Yen and U.S. Treasurys are classic safe assets, in part because investors borrow them to make other bets. If you buy a 10-year corporate bond, you’re making a bet on the creditworthiness of the company, and a bet on interest rates. Most of the people who are good at credit analysis are not experts in predicting the future course of monetary policy, so many of them buy the corporate bonds and bet against Treasurys of the same maturity to control their interest rate risk. It’s not the safe haven for this particular kind of crisis.The yen is a similar case: Since yen rates have been so low for so long, a classic forex trade is to borrow yen and invest in a currency with higher rates. In both cases, when the trade unwinds –when you sell your corporate bond or close out your bet on the Turkish lira or the South African rand, you end up buying the safe asset. Anything boring and borrowable goes up in price in response to bad news.Things you want to own if the world is about to end. The best way to illustrate this is with a story: The financier Felix Rohatyn grew up in France in the 1930s. When Germany invaded, his family fled — they had enough time to pack their bags, but they lost almost everything. He recalled his parents putting gold coins in tubes of toothpaste before leaving. Everything else they owned, they left behind. If you’re living through a moment that’s going to be in the history books, the only assets you can take with you are the ones in your head or the ones you can smuggle out. (A USB drive, conveniently, fits into a variety of toiletry containers.)One interpretation of bitcoin’s price performance during the COVID-19 crisis is that it wasn’t such a safe haven after all. But another is that it’s not the safe haven for this particular kind of crisis. The math of epidemics and immunity is such that, however bad they are, they eventually burn themselves out given a low mutation rate. Once the percentage of the population that has been infected is greater than 1 / R0, cases begin to fall even in the absence of countermeasures. With a case fatality rate of 2 percent, that’s an extraordinarily painful process to go through, and it ends up being a disaster for humanity on a historic scale.See also: Why Bitcoin’s Safe-Haven Narrative Has Flown Out the WindowAn intense disaster, but not one that lasts forever. The 1957-58 flu pandemic may have led to the sharpest postwar recession in U.S. history (at least as of Q4 2019), but the subsequent recovery was equally swift.Right now, that’s how most investors are thinking. Whether they think COVID-19 is overblown or underblown, they still think of it as a temporary problem from which we’ll recover in short order. In fact, the very bailouts that Satoshi referenced in the Genesis block point to an argument in favor of the recovery consensus. Conventional wisdom among investors and policymakers today is the government didn’t react fast enough in 2008 to forestall a deflationary spiral. This time around, central banks are moving fast to supply cheap capital to financial institutions. In that scenario, governments and economies don’t collapse, and nobody has to flee their home hours ahead of disaster.They do, however, need to scramble for dollars to service debts, so they’ll sell anything – stocks, bonds, real estate, crypto – and convert it into an asset they can use to pay the bills.Bitcoin’s drop doesn’t disprove the safe haven argument. It just shows us bitcoin is designed to be a safe haven from a worse storm.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

That represents a 25 percent drop on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. However, just as quickly, prices rebounded to over $6,550.Meanwhile, major European equity market indices like Germany’s DAX, France’s CAC and U.K.’s FTSE 100 are down at least 6 percent at press time. Meanwhile, futures on the S&P 500 are shedding over 4.5 percent. Asian equities also took a beating with Japan’s Nikkei index losing 4.5 percent. The risk aversion, which began two weeks ago, worsened during the Asian trading hours after President Donald Trump announced a 30-day ban on travel from most of Europe and failed to meet investor expectations for additional fiscal stimulus measures to counter the coronavirus epidemic. While stocks and bitcoin are down, gold, a classic haven asset, is struggling to eke out gains. The yellow metal is currently trading largely unchanged on the day at $1,642 per ounce, having printed a low of $1,630 earlier. U.S. Treasury bonds, also a safe haven under normal conditions, dropped on Wednesday, pushing yields higher despite the massive sell-off on Wall Street. The 10-year Treasury yield rose more than 10 basis points to 0.89 percent even though the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 5.9 percent.The traditional safe havens are struggling right now, possibly because the institutions are liquidating positions in these assets to fund margin calls in the equity markets. A margin call occurs when the value of the investor’s leverage account drops below the minimum margin requirement. The investor is then required to bring in additional capital or securities to build back the account up to the minimum margin requirement. ""We started seeing institutional liquidity issues today. For the first time since the beginning of the bear market neither U.S. Treasury bonds nor gold managed to hedge an S&P decline,"" angel investor and Messari's head of product Qiao Wang tweeted early Thursday. See also: Bitcoin’s Crash Triggers Over $700M in Liquidations on BitMEXMeanwhile, Bloomberg Markets' Jonathan Ferro referred to Wednesday as the worst day of the last few weeks, as stocks tanked while Treasury yields rose, highlighting liquidity stress in the market. In fact, the hunger for liquidity was so strong on Wednesday that a model portfolio of 50 percent treasuries and 50 percent stocks fell by the most on record, according to Bloomberg’s cross-asset reporter Luke Kawa.“People are raising cash to meet redemptions and margin calls. Market liquidity is freezing up, people are struggling to trade. The buy the dip mentality has totally flipped,” Ferro tweeted during Asian trading hours. Some investors think bitcoin is also being treated as a source of liquidity. “How did BTC go from being a hedge against bad stuff to getting washed out and trading like a risk asset? When things go from bad to very, very bad like they did last week, investors take leverage down as fast as they can. They book profits to make up for other losses,” billionaire investor and CEO of Galaxy Digital Michael Novogratz tweeted earlier this week as an explanation for bitcoin’s 13 percent slide in late February. The S&P 500 had suffered a double-digit drop during the same week. Bitcoin’s futures market data validates Novogratz’s claim to some extent. The global open interest or the total number of outstanding futures contracts have dropped sharply over the last few weeks, signaling a slowdown in institutional activity. Open interest topped out at highs above $5 billion on Feb. 14 and fell to nearly $3.8 billion to hit the lowest in nearly two months, according to Skew data. Meanwhile, both the open interest and trading volumes in futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the most liquid futures markets, have also dropped sharply over the last couple of weeks. Open interest fell to $171 million on Wednesday, the lowest level since Jan 6, having hit a high of $338 million on Feb. 14. Trading volume also hit a three-month low of $88 million on March 6, before witnessing a brief spike on March 9. “It looks like institutional investors are taking a break from bitcoin in this unstable period with growing fear related to the coronavirus,"" according to an Arcane Research tweet. With coronavirus showing no signs of a slowdown, stocks may continue to lose altitude, possibly keeping bitcoin under pressure. Rumors are doing the rounds that the U.S. Federal Reserve may deliver another emergency rate cut before the next week’s scheduled meeting to address the liquidity issue in the market. However, rate cuts may fail to yield a sustainable bounce, as there is general consensus in the market that additional easing would not catalyze economic activity. The threat to global supply and demand is not caused by institutional systemic failures, but rather a global health pandemic.Further reading: Ether Suffers Record-Setting 33% Drop Amid Global Market TurmoilThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

23,www.coindesk.com,1 month ago,Bitcoin's Plunge Was Foreshadowed by Miner Inventory Data,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-plunge-was-foreshadowed-by-miner-inventory-data,"As bitcoin prices see a sharp drop, some miners would consider turning to 
lending platforms to collateralize their bitcoins in exchange for cash.","Mar 9, 2020 at 18:12 UTC","Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent price drop has caught many investors off guard. However, a key metric showing worry among the network’s miners gave a warning several weeks ago. ","The miner’s rolling inventory (MRI) figure, created by crypto markets data company ByteTree to measure the changes in inventory levels held by these key market participants, remained below 100 percent in January, suggesting a lack of confidence in the 30 percent price rally that month. An MRI above 100 means miners are selling more than they mine and running down inventory, while a below-100 MRI indicates hoarding – miners selling less than they mine and amassing inventory.Conventional wisdom says that a seller always sells high. Thus, some investors may take a sub-100 MRI reading as a sign miners are anticipating a price rally and are therefore hoarding with an aim to liquidate at a high price at a later time.Miners, however, operate on cash, notes Atlantic House fund manager and ByteTree founder Charlie Morris, and are always sellers in the market liquidating rewards (bitcoins) received for mining blocks to cover their operational costs. A below-100 MRI level is not necessarily a price-bullish indicator, but represents fear among miners the market is too soft to sell into. On the other hand, an MRI above 100 reflects a strong market able to absorb miners’ selling pressure. January’s MRI of 79 percent, the weakest in over two years, was essentially a warning sign that a bull trap was in the works. Bitcoin topped out near $10,500 in mid-February and has been falling ever since. At press time, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading at two-month lows under $7,800 and is just $640 away from turning negative on a year-to-date basis. Miners generated 53,955 bitcoins and sent 42,451 bitcoins to exchanges in January, yielding an MRI of 79 percent, according to data from blockchain surveillance firm Chainalysis. Historically, returns are poor when miners sell less than they mine, while returns have been strong when miners have sold more than they mined, according to Morris. To put it another way, miners tend to build inventory during bear markets and run down inventory during bull markets. While it may seem counterintuitive to read hoarding as a bearish signal, an analogy from the traditional financial system is instructive.Central banks in countries running account deficits depend on hot money inflows to build foreign exchange (usually, U.S. dollar) reserves. For example, the Reserve Bank of India will buy dollars in the spot market when the Indian rupee is trending higher and is able to absorb the RBI’s bid for U.S. dollars. Buying dollars during a downtrend in the rupee would be risky since that would only add to bearish pressures around the local currency. Similarly, miners hoard or avoid selling when they feel the market lacks strength to absorb their offers. Selling into a weak market would lead to deeper price drop and, in turn, hurt profitability. More than any other constituency in the market, miners have the biggest influence on price. Mining pools account for the highest percentage of total bitcoin flowing into exchanges, for example. As of January, over a quarter of all BTC received by exchanges came from mining pools. Meanwhile, hosted wallets and merchant services – payment gateways or processors – accounted for just over 10 percent of the total BTC supply to exchanges. Miners therefore have to be extra careful while offloading their holdings as their actions can translate into a big sell-offs. Such was the case when weak miners, facing losses courtesy of bitcoin’s slide from $14,000 to $8,000 in the third quarter of 2019, began dumping their holdings in the fourth quarter, as noted by Adaptive Capital analyst Willy Woo. That precipitated a bigger drop to $6,500 by mid-December. As it stands, widely used mining computers such as the AntMiner S9 and Avalon 851 are already struggling to generate daily profits, according to data from the mining pool Poolin. If the price slide continues, the small and inefficient miners may shut down operations and sell their holdings to mitigate losses.However, some miners are still optimistic about future bitcoin prices and remain unfazed as they look to the anticipated halving event in May. “In the medium and long term, we have a very positive view on the price,” Xiao Yang, chief executive at Chinese crypto mining and miner firm PandaMiner said in an interview. “Despite short-term volatility, we expect to see market demand at a relatively high level while it is getting harder to mine bitcoins from the supply side.”  As bitcoin prices see a sharp drop, some miners would consider turning to lending platforms to collateralize their bitcoins in exchange for cash. That would help to sustain their cash flow, which has been strained by recent low market price, according to Yang. This move is meant to help miners not be forced to sell their bitcoins at a low price when running out of cash. Besides lower prices, the fast-growing hash rate has made it even harder for miners to hold their bitcoins; they need to borrow more from lending agencies, Yang added. According to btc.com, the bitcoin mining difficulty growth rate is now at 6.88 percent, up  from negative 0.38 percent on February 25. Yang said another phenomena showing the mining industry is generally confident about future bitcoin prices are the new mining computers marketed by the likes of Bitmain and Canaan Creative. Bitmain has unveiled its latest product, the S19, on March 10, while Whatsminer will launch its new product in April. Miners consider the drop in bitcoin prices, correlated to the U.S. stock market sell-off, as a temporary change in the market, according to Yang. “We are still focused on long-term price increase and not too concerned about short-term market moves,” Yang said.

Notable performers on CoinDesk’s big board include XRP (XRP), up 10 percent, Stellar (XLM) in the green 3 percent and dash, up 4 percent. All 24-hour price changes are from 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET) on March 27. Traditional markets, meanwhile, continued to reel from the record unemployment claims in the U.S., part of the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak, despite a $2 trillion stimulus package making its way to  President Donald Trump for his signature. U.S. stocks closed with the S&P 500 index down 3 percent. Earlier in the day, Japan’s Nikkei 255 closed its session up 3.8 percent. For Europe, the FTSE 100 Index closed in the red 3.3 percent. See also: How a Flurry of ‘Digital Dollar’ Proposals Made It to CongressFederal Reserve ""and fiscal policies have averted for now accelerated economic and financial de-leveraging. Unfortunately, they can't avoid a deep and sudden recession resulting in alarming unemployment and business closures,” Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, wrote in a tweet. On low volumes, bitcoin’s price changes have narrowed, staying in a $6,400-$6,900 per 1 BTC range since March 24. This has put the bellwether cryptocurrency’s 10-day and 50-day moving averages close to each other. “I think bitcoin just moved up from its $4,000-$5,000 crash range earlier than equities did. While equity markets have been rallying the last couple of sessions, other more safe haven-type markets like bonds and gold have been consolidating,” said Siddharth Jha, a former Wall Street analyst now focused on blockchain technology at startup Arbol. Indeed, gold has started to consolidate moving averages as of March 27. “Some people I respect say gold is a buy here,” said Rupert Douglas, head of business development for institutional sales at Koine, a digital asset manager. “Perhaps it is, perhaps silver is going to go rocketing higher, but if it doesn't and trades lower, does bitcoin follow?”The crash on March 12 is still fresh in the minds of crypto traders and fund managers, leaving some to think no trading decisions are the best decisions for the time being. “Markets need to be saturated for people to look for incremental yield. Plus, there’s a lot of wound licking, post-BitMEX debacle,” said Vishal Shah, founder of Alpha5, a new derivatives exchange backed by large crypto funds. See also: Strange Days: S&P 500 Is More Volatile Than Bitcoin This MonthShah was referring to the $700 million of liquidations on BitMEX on March 12. This caused problems for the Ethereum network-based DeFi ecosystem, which relies on ether’s price to ensure stability. Not surprisingly, ether has been consolidating, although there was a bit of volume early Friday. “After a major crash and rebound, markets often consolidate for some time to see which way the flows may develop,” Arbol’s Jha said.

One way to read this is as a possible co-ordinated action by whales to dump the cryptocurrency.Coins began flowing into exchanges at a faster rate starting from block number 620.8K, mined on March 8. Prior to that block, the average inflow per transaction was about 1,000 BTC. But after that, inflows ranged from 1.500 to 6,000 BTC in the run-up to Thursday’s price drop. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency’s slide began with a near 10 percent drop on March 8. In the following three days, BTC posted marginal losses – before plunging by a staggering 39 percent on ThursdayThe implication is that whales – individuals, or entities, that hold large amounts of digital currencies – started moving coins from wallets to exchanges at least four days in advance of the dump. A similar pattern can be seen at the world’s largest exchange, Binance. Prior to 620.817K, the average inflow per block was about 100 BTC. After that point in time, inflows ranged from 130 to 1,702 BTC in almost every block.Notably, that huge inflow of 1,702 BTC was observed in block number 620.965 when bitcoin’s price was trading near $8,000. Again, the data suggests big players had begun preparing for the massive liquidation since March 8.Similarly, inflows into BitMEX fluctuated between 97 and 1,994 BTC from block numbers 620.8K to 621.3K. One transaction, for 1,000 BTC, was recorded in block number 621,256 when bitcoin’s price was hovering around $7,900.It is doubtful anybody could have predicted the magnitude of the sell-off seen on Thursday. That said, the increased inflow of BTC into exchanges was a sign the big sellers were getting ready to offload their holdings, which usually translates into big price slide. The lesson: Keeping a close eye on inflows into exchanges can help leveraged traders avoid getting trapped on the wrong side of the market.

","For bitcoin (BTC), the pattern is arising as the 50-day moving average (MA) moves to cross below the 200-day MA, likely in the next day or two. If confirmed, it would be the first death cross since Oct. 26, 2019, according to Bitstamp data. Meanwhile, similar crosses are forming on Wall Street equity indices, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the S&P 500. The death cross is a long-term bear market signal, according to technical analysis theory. Despite the scary name, it's based on backward-looking moving average data and is the product of a recent notable price drop. For example, the impending bitcoin death cross is preceded by the decline from $10,500 to $4,000 in the four weeks to March 13. The massive sell-off has caused the 50-day average to turn lower and drop to the 200-day average.Similarly, the Dow has tanked by more than 35 percent over the last five weeks and is likely to witness its death cross on Monday. It should be noted that, as a lagging indicator, the death cross often traps sellers on the wrong side of the market, as seen on the historical bitcoin chart below. As the averages closed in on the death cross on Oct. 25, 2019, the cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid and rose from $6,500 to $10,350 in less than 48 hours. Another such cross, confirmed at the end of March 2018, was followed by a rise from $6,500 to $9,950. That said, with the global markets still in panic mode courtesy of the coronavirus outbreak, the latest death cross may not turn out to be a contrary indicator. Amid fears of a recession, investors are treating bitcoin as a source of liquidity rather than a safe haven, as had been anticipated by many. ""Another turbulent week can be expected for Asia markets as more countries lock down in the fight against COVID-19. The West is not looking too great either,"" Toby Wu, senior analyst at investment platform eToro, told CoinDesk. Futures on the S&P 500 fell by 5 percent early Monday, triggering a limit down, while stocks in Asia cratered after the U.S. Senate failed to advance its coronavirus rescue package, bolstering recession fears. At press time, S&P 500 futures are down 3 percent and major European indices are flashing red. As a result, bitcoin is likely to remain on the defensive. The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $5,840, representing a 6.57 percent drop on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. Bitcoin is trading within the range of the big doji candle created on March 20 for the fourth straight day, a sign of indecision in the market place. Acceptance under the candle low of $5,670 would imply an end to  the corrective bounce from recent lows under $4,000 and shift risk in favor of a drop to $5,000.That looks likely, as the 12-hour chart shows the cryptocurrency has dived out of an ascending channel. A move above $6,460 (March 21 high) is needed to alleviate the bearish pressures and open the doors to $7,000.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.

In fact, prices in the crypto market are seeing such a steep upward trend that arbitrage traders are able to trade between Bitfinex and other exchanges to easily capture profit. ","Bitcoin is up over 15 percent in the past 24 hours, changing hands at $6,206 as of 20:30 UTC (4:30 p.m. ET) Thursday, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. Meanwhile, the Nikkei 225 index closed its day at 05:00 UTC Thursday down 1 percent. That’s notable because recently crypto traders were looking at the Asian-based markets and indexes like the Nikkei for signals, which in the past week did create a brief correlation.“It was surprising to see bitcoin's correlation with a traditional index like the Nikkei 225 given bitcoin's similarity to traditional stores of value like precious metals,” said Marc Grens, co-founder and president at DigitalMint, a bitcoin point-of-sale provider. “That being said, since the creation of the Bitcoin protocol, this is the first time we’ve seen the behavior of bitcoin holders through a bear market.” Volumes at cryptocurrency exchanges have jumped, with Coinbase, Bitstamp and Bitfinex combined  seeing a 19 percent bump in 24-hour exchange volume, according to data aggregator CryptoCompare. So, what’s the reason for the jump? Higher crypto volatility means traders are seeing more opportunities to make money. “It appears that volatility play-related profit-taking and some degree of normalization of liquidity is behind the pick up in prices,” said Denis Vinokourov of Bequant, London-based London-based digital asset firm Bequant.Trading on Bitfinex began pricing bitcoin at a discount after 09:00 UTC, sometimes by as much as $20 lower when compared to exchanges such as Coinbase and Bitstamp. This allows for traders to buy bitcoin on the cheaper exchange (Bitfinex, for example) and simultaneously sell where prices are higher in an arbitrage, a near-riskless profit.  The discrepancy narrowed, then continued again after 17:00 UTC, with spreads hitting over $30 at times. It’s not just on Bitfinex where traders are finding opportunities. BitMEX’s perpetual contracts on bitcoin settle every eight hours and are currently paying those who buy them as much as 8 basis points (0.008 percent) of value. Traders can thus buy bitcoin perpetual futures on BitMEX and sell simultaneously in over-the-counter (OTC) markets, and collect the basis payments. BitMEX allows traders to leverage as much as 100 times over what they put up. “We are seeing most of our selling flow from basis trades, not liquidating trades,” said David Vizsolyi, Head of Trading at Chicago-based DV Chain. Ether (ETH) was briefly down compared to bitcoin, as the BTC/ETH pair on exchanges like Coinbase showed ether priced in bitcoin moving below its 10-day moving average at around 17:00 UTC. This signals that traders were also selling ether and buying bitcoin, even though the prices of both assets were going up. That move was short-lived. Within the same hour, the trend turned around, with ether later seeing stronger gains over bitcoin. At press time, ether is up 19 percent in 24 hours. Elsewhere, the foreign exchange markets have been in turmoil, causing the dollar to strengthen against other fiat currencies. The S&P 500 squeaked out a half-percent gain while gold was up just 0.2 percent as of Thursday 20:00 UTC. Other eye-popping crypto gainers on the day include bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin SV (BSV) both up 40 percent. Traders also noted dash (DASH) in the green, up 30 percent in 24 hour trading. “Dash and other coins are rallying big time. We are pretty bullish here on dips,” said Jack Tan of Tapie-based trading firm Kronos Research.

However, we can turn to a proxy for insight: gold.","Bitcoin’s (BTC) “digital gold” narrative has stuck well, namely because of the cryptocurrency’s low issuance supply schedule and a hard cap of 21 million bitcoins. In turn, theory on how a gold-based economy would react to an external shock such as the current global pandemic lends itself into a look at a future bitcoin economy.As CoinDesk reported Monday, both bitcoin and gold rose on news of the U.S. Federal Reserve extending an indeterminate amount of aid to the private market. From a supply perspective, both assets sit still while the Fed feverishly tries to outpace COVID-19. ""The Federal Reserve will continue to purchase Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions,"" the central bank said Monday.With such a policy’s incumbent inflation concerns – where infinite supply depresses the value of the U.S. dollar – what would an alternative world look like? What would the macroeconomic story be in a world where bitcoin or gold was dominant as a means of exchange?For one, the value of a gold-based money would not artificially inflate, Mark Thornton, Austrian economist at the Ludwig von Mises Institute, told CoinDesk. (However, mainstream economists hold concerns that central bankers would have far fewer levers to pull in times of financial collapse.)Like any market, gold’s value is determined jointly by supply and demand but has natural limits to the amount supplied in a given year. On average, the amount of gold mined per year hovers around 2 percent of gold’s total known supply.Indeed, the price of gold has gone up in recent years mostly because gold is priced in dollar terms, Thornton said. As the amount of dollars on the market increases, so does gold’s price.Additionally, gold – a safe-haven asset – acts as a hedge on inflation in financial crisis environments such as now. In the long run, bitcoin proponents such as Messari co-founder Dan McArdle believe BTC’s conservative features will bring it long-term value similar to that of gold. For Austrian economists like Thornton, gold’s value comes down to economic theory first posited in ""Principles of Economics"" (1871) by Austrian school founder Carl Menger. To briefly summarize, Menger said everyone determines value subjectively while a society creates a price one can buy or sell on the open market. Gold’s value is readily demonstrated by its continued use as a store of value, particularly during recessions or financial crises.“The supply schedule for gold is relatively stable. The quantity of gold supplied is a response to the demand for gold and its price,” Thornton said.But how would a gold-based economy differ from our current economy? A stable medium of exchange would force people to be more responsible with the money they have, Roy Sebag, co-founder of precious metal custodian Goldmoney, told CoinDesk in an email.This responsibility would lead to two outcomes: A stable money supply would make it difficult to stack up large corporate debts, limiting the dangers of a 2008-style financial crisis. But it would also help distribute wealth across the economy more efficiently than current systems do, Sebag said.First, Sebag said a fiat-based system that is known to inflate the currency to protect against business failings leads to companies taking out too much debt. (Think of commercial airlines buying back stock in heady times as opposed to investing in their services, what some might consider a moral hazard.) Sebag says his point can be readily seen on Capitol Hill today – where Congress is weighing a multitrillion-dollar stimulus package with protections for firms such as Boeing.“Under a gold monetary standard, leveraging a balance sheet in any circumstance is a risky proposition,” Sebag said.Instead, failures would be allowed to happen – but they would not become this colossal in the first place. “Failure happens often and resilience becomes the integral ingredient in defining prosperity,” Sebag said of what a gold-based system would look like.See also: Bitcoin, Gold Spike as Fed Unveils Unlimited Coronavirus Stimulus PackageSecond, if people were able to plan financially on long time horizons, then retirees would not be put in a precarious position every time the economy blows the top. Sebag goes as far as to claim the elderly would boost the economy during a recession as opposed to being crushed by it.Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost over 30 percent since its peak in February 2019. Many people’s retirement plans are underwater.A gold economy, Sebag said, would allow people to plan for the future with a key metric: the interest rate.Historically, Sebag said the natural interest rate – meaning the cost of future money when not set by a government – sat around 5 percent. Compare this to the rate-by-decree coming out of the Federal Reserve and periodic percentage drops: It’s hard to plan for the future when you don’t know what your assets will be worth in six months.A bitcoin economy is laughably far off from a mainstream perspective – even more so than a gold-based economy. Bitcoin’s market cap sits below $200 billion while the Dow hit as high as $8 trillion in December 2019. Gold’s current market cap is around $9 trillion.Yet, a savings-based money like gold or bitcoin becomes more attractive as the Fed and Washington lawmakers push toward fiscal extremes.“In a gold-based economy without interest rate manipulation, taxes and so forth, people would have much more savings and far less debt. But now, with the Fed and paper money inflation, we have very little savings and gargantuan debt,” Thornton said.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Combining on-the-ground recordings, interviews and thoughtful narration, she paints a picture of why things are how they are, as well as the state of human rights and free speech.""I wanted to see by myself if this is true and how far bitcoin is known and used there,"" said Anita Posch.Recorded February 2020 in the run-up to the growing quarantine movement and coronavirus travel restrictions, Anita traveled to Zimbabwe and Botswana to listen, learn and record about the usage of bitcoin in these countries. In the world of bitcoin, countries like Zimbabwe and Venezuela are frequently mentioned as places where the cryptocurrency could or perhaps should be making a difference and where they can really help the people's economic situations. Check out another of Anita's favorite episodes featuring Andreas M. Antonopoulos debunking arguments against bitcoin like high volatility, energy consumption, inequalities and the exaggerated risk of possible failure.TRANSCRIPT: “Bitcoin in Africa: The Ubuntu Way” - Part 1 - Zimbabwe: Ideal conditions for Bitcoin?ANITAHello friends, bitcoiners and pre-coiners alike! This is the first episode of a multipart series called “Bitcoin in Africa: The Ubuntu Way” In February 2020 I travelled to Zimbabwe and Botswana to find out, if and how bitcoin (BTC) is used there. I spent three weeks in Zimbabwe, two weeks of that time I was  in Harare the capital and I travelled for one week to Bulawayo and Victoria Falls. After that I spent some days in Gaborone, the capital of Botswana to meet and talk with the founder of the Satoshicentre, Alakanani Itireleng.ANITAThe instrument you heard is a mbira (pronounced m-BEER-ra , IPA (ə)mˈbɪəɾə) it is an African musical instrument, traditional to the Shona people of Zimbabwe.Why did I visit Zimbabwe?I wanted to see with my own eyes how the living situation is for people and, more importantly, to research the usage of bitcoin. Bitcoin is in my eyes first and foremost not a speculative, trading object, where everything is about price. For me it’s a tool of liberation that enables individuals and communities to free themselves of tight restrictions by authoritarian or totalitarian nation states that harm people's human rights. This has many faces. In the so-called western world, in countries with freedom of speech, safety and a high level of wealth, it is the possibility to free oneself from the banking system. The banking system has in the last 30 years in combination with national and global regulations evolved into a very strict system of surveillance and allowances. Where we - the majority people of integrity are being policed by the banks - because of fear of money laundering and terrorism finance done by the few. In conjunction with “surveillance capitalism” - a term coined by Shoshana Zuboff  in her book, well worth reading - surveillance capitalism - which is the permanent recording of all our digital traces on Facebook, Google and Co. - that are being used not only to comfort us with better search results and convenience, but also to manipulate our decisions and extort our data for money and higher profits. This has had disastrous consequences for democracy, freedom and our privacy. So in countries with high living standards, safety and a relatively good working banking system with a low inflation rate controlled by so called “independent” central banks, I would argue that governments try to regulate bitcoin in the face of “money laundering and financing terrorism” - while in countries like Zimbabwe bitcoin has to be tamed or controlled by the governing elite, because of the possibility for more “human rights and freedom” for its citizens and their loss of power.This podcast special and my trip to Africa would not have been possible without my sponsors and supporters. I want to thank my sponsors first: Thank you: Peter McCormack and the whatbitcoindid podcast, Coinfinity and the CardWallet, LocalBitcoins.com a person-to-person bitcoin trading site, SHIFT Cryptosecurity, manufacturer of the hardware wallet BitBox02, and many thanks to several unknown private donors who sent me Satoshis over the lightning network.This special is edited by CoinDesk’s Podcasts Editor Adam B. Levine and published first on the CoinDesk Podcast Network. Thank you very much for supporting the Bitcoin in Africa series with your work.Thanks goes also out to stakwork.com - stakwork is a great project that brings bitcoin into the world through earning. One can do microjobs on stakwork, earning Satoshis and cash them out without even having an understanding about the lightning network or bitcoin. I think we need more projects like that to spread the usage of bitcoin around the world. Thank you also to GoTenna, for donating several gotenna devices to set up a mesh network in Zimbabwe and to Team Satoshi, the decentralized sports team for supporting my work.This special is also brought to you by the Let's Talk Bitcoin Network.Voice of captain: Mascati…. Welcome on board... Make yourself comfortable….ANITA:I did talks about bitcoin in both countries and introduced around 100 people to the possibilities of using and earning bitcoin and showed them how it can improve their living situation in the short and long run. I met with many people from different backgrounds with a diverse set of goals and interests. I talked with them about their daily life, how the economic situation has changed in the last 20 to 40 years, about their hopes and fears for the future and, of course, about bitcoin and its chances and challenges in Africa. In 2014 Alakanani Itireleng a true Bitcoin OG founded the Satoshicentre in Gaborone to educate her fellow citizens about bitcoin: INTERVIEWEE: “I want to help people get into the Bitcoin ecosystem and set the ecosystem to make it like work for Africa, not only for Botswana to make it to work for for Africa, you know, we are the very people that need bitcoin. Yeah. We are the people. I think so too. Yeah, we are actually this is the place where it is needed the most. Like I was shocked when I was in the U.S. in Orange County [California]. I saw a drive-through bank. Yeah. I was like why do you guys have a drive through banks? You don't need bitcoin. So we need bitcoin.”ANITA February 2020: My trip to Zimbabwe starts. I arrive at Harare airport - before I am allowed to join the queue in front of the immigration desk my body temperature is measured - it is coronavirus season. All is good. They ask me where I come from: I say Austria. The answer is a question: Australia? I say no: Austria in Europe, next to Germany. Ah. Austria. Alright. I join the queue for the immigration procedure. I apply for a visa - and pay 30 U.S. dollar in cash. This, despite the fact, that in June 2019 the use of U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies was outlawed by the government.  So, if the government outlawed the use of foreign currencies, why did I just pay my visa fees with U.S. dollar cash? This is just one of many questions I ask myself during the three weeks of my stay in Zimbabwe.Next step, customs control: I am very nervous because my suitcase is packed with devices for bitcoin use. I am bringing donations from my sponsors, several Hardware wallets, the BitBox02 by SHIFT cryptosecurity, several Card Wallets, a RaspiBlitz, which is a Bitcoin and Lightning Fullnode and several GoTenna devices to set up a mesh network to communicate and even send bitcoin, while being off the grid. So coming from the immigration desk I try to stay behind a couple to sneak through and I am lucky, the custom officers are not interested in me or my suitcase. I feel a great relief. After arrival my friends immediately take me out to an event. They say, you have to see that. And they were right.It was the Austrian new year's concert in Harare. It felt a little weird. Being in a church, with an audience of 99 percent whites - so called “Murungus” in the local Shona language - attending. A group of elderly Rhodesians coming together to listen to a classical concert in the tradition of Vienna philharmonic orchestra. That's not quite what I expected to find. But this audience is also a part of the country’s history and current life. This shows that Zimbabwe is a land of many contrasts.In the three weeks of my stay, I showered exactly one time. Bah, you might think. No, I did wash myself, but only in a so-called shallow bath. You fill the bathtub just a little bit, like 2 cm high and then you wash yourself sitting and pouring the water over yourself with a jug. Why? Because of the water drought, there is no public water supply. So people try to save as much water as possible, you don’t even flush the toilet when you have been on the small side. You have to buy water privately that is delivered every two weeks with a truck. And if possible, you collect the rainwater. Even though there is no water supply the water company still sends bills and you have to pay them.Same with electricity: It depends in which area you live. If you are close to hospitals or to the areas where people from the government live, then your chances to have water and electricity all the time are high. If not, then you have to suffer from power outages. At the place where I was staying, the power went on around 11 p.m. and went off around 5 a.m. in the morning. That means that people - and there are a lot of them - who cannot afford to buy a solar panel and an inverter - have to work by night. If you cannot afford a gas stove, you have to cook by night. And still: the electricity provider ZESA sends you bills and you have to pay them.So I travelled the country and arranged a number of interviews. Three of my interview partners in Zimbabwe wanted to stay anonymous. One person is working for a human rights organization in Harare. Another one feared about his professional career and the third one is a teacher in a public school who is also afraid of possible threats. The other two I was talking with would have been ok with their names in the public, but I decided to leave their names out, too. Why? Because people are scared. As my interview partner who is working for a human rights organization puts it:HUMAN RIGHTS SPEAKER“The human rights situation here right now is really poor. I don't, I haven't I haven't been this pessimistic about it in 10 to 15 years. It's really is ... it's as repressive as it has been with like, an added layer of like a sinister, vindictive.And I think that there's a small number of activists or organizations trying to do something. And in some ways, because there's so few of them, it's really easy to just sit really hard. So if you are one of those handful of people you can get kidnapped, raped, beaten up and stuff. You know, you fight [for your] life, you know, every day. And like, how long does the energy last? So because some people, I mean, that's my observation on my feet, you know, just that you can do it for a certain period of time. And then you just, I don't know, it's almost like a, like a fading out, you know?”ANITASo one can say there's no free speech in this country? HR SPEAKERYeah. And adding up ... Especially what you receive from a kind of like whatever in form of like a global support network coverage of it's very poor, you know? I mean, you get a headline in the media and like this, and this happens, but actually, the peer support internationally, I also like find quite poor.ANITAOne of my interviews was taking place at a self-service restaurant in the middle of Harare. My guest and I started talking and I recorded with my audio recorder and two handheld microphones. After 20 minutes a woman from the restaurant approached us:UNKNOWN SPEAKER:….recording is not allowed….ANITAWe continued and finished our interview and left for another restaurant. But this was a disturbing experience. At least for me. I am used to being able to record my own conversations wherever I want. But people here are scared. And as I realized afterwards reports from foreigners about Zimbabwe require a permit. Also, you are not allowed to take pictures of government buildings.With all those complicated living conditions, what are the positives about living in Zimbabwe?HR SPEAKERThe people, the people, people it is and yeah, the climate. And the possibilities. You know, if you are an entrepreneurial person you are very free to start new things - there are not so many strict regulations for starting a business. In fact, you have to have this self-sovereign attitude otherwise you couldn’t survive here. Still, it is very different, if you have the possibility to leave the country or not.Because It's tough. I mean, I think that's a big part of why people leave, is the combination of kind of lack of civic freedom and lack of economic prospects. And it's a little bit like what we were just saying about the colleague who's gone to work in London, like you had an opportunity like that, you take it and if you mean, even if, even if the choice was like, be a tomato vendor here or work as a waiter in South Africa, I'll work as a waiter in South Africa or for any other foreign currency I can send it home. I can support my family.ANITA: There are 16 million people living in Zimbabwe and only about 800,000 of them have a formal employment. That are only 5 percent of the population, that means 95 percent are informally unemployed; they hustle, they live off nothing. Of the 5 percent with a formal employment, most of them work for the government, are civil servants or teachers in public schools. This is what the headmistress of a school told me:TEACHER:“And everybody else is just living [by] hustling. Yeah, we hustle. Oh, yeah, it's ... you have people who work but and who are self-employed. But very few people are, like, working ... for a proper institution, because even the institutions are in a difficult place because you'll have rentals, for example, charged in U.S. dollars, even though the government would say no, it's not allowed. Even if they rate it, it will be like astronomical prices. We, like, I don't even earn that much. So typical rental, for example, for a one-bedroom apartment, let's call it that, which is pretty standard, you're looking at about 250 to 350 U.S. dollars, the average person at most is maybe earning 2,500 Zim dollars, which is about 100 dollars. So how do you pay your rent?... [S]o now like it's become, employment has almost become like a jail, because it's, like, because now you don't have time, because they'll take all your time, you don't have time to find that additional $200 or $250 to pay your rent. But, really and truly, you need additional maybe $400 because you've got the other bills outside of rent. So it's almost like being employed, is almost a disadvantage ... in this country because you're locked down at that price and even if everything goes up, every month, your salary will remain the same. And a lot of companies struggle to put – what did they call it? Something allowance of, forgetting the term – an adjustment, as, yeah, it's called a salary adjustment to move with the market. It's never really completely what you actually need. They'll try maybe you get an extra 200 bond or an extra 500 bond. But it's difficult, you know, it's difficult to keep up with that corporate struggling as well. Very few corporates are able to pay people very well for it to make sense.”ANITAAs a teacher and headmistress. she can tell about the situation in schools:Wow, I mean, I work in education. I work in education, and I can tell you, it's difficult. It's difficult. Have a staff complement of 14 and they, my, you have to then obviously get money from school fees. So you have a lot of schools now. Trying to diversify. Because if you put all that pressure on the parents, then your parents can't afford to send their children to your school. So it's like, Okay, what do you do? We need to increase our fees because I need to be able to pay my teachers more. But if I throw that burden on the parents, I, as a parent know that I can't even afford that, you know, per term for every child, that I've got some parents of two, three, four children, and they need to bring [their] children, so what do you do? You end up subsidizing? That's when you have schools that have maybe a little Market Garden, you know, where you commercialize your kitchen and you start baking. You know, when you're not making lunch for the kids, you're selling food on the side so that you supplement your income. It is difficult and teachers have struggled the most, especially who work for state schools, public schools, they are in the worst possible position. Those who work in private schools are in a much better position because they can afford to charge more government schools can't charge what private schools are charging, because government schools supposed to the public schools supposed to be affordable for anyone to send their child to school, then they put in a difficult position where you're told you cannot not accept a child because they haven't paid fees. So you have to accept them. So you'll have, let's say, 50 children, and maybe only 15 of them have paid the school fees. But because as a government school, you're not allowed to send children home because they have a right to education. How do you take care of the other 35 ... and still take care of your teachers and it's, it's our country, is madness, you know. The more I talk about it, you know, it sounds terrible.ANITANot only that prices are rising daily, the whole society is crippled by corruption. Before 2017, when Robert Mugabe still was the country's leader, there were roadblocks by police everywhere. They would stop your car and say that you have done something wrong or mock you about small things they find in your car - ending with demanding money. Friends told me that they stopped driving through the city of Harare, because at one time they were stopped by five roadblocks inside the city and had to pay around 100 USD in fines only to get from one side of town to the other. With the new government, this has changed. No more roadblocks inside Harare. When I was there, it was almost spooky. Because I did not see any police. A friend said: If you need the police at your home, because something has happened, you cannot just call them and they’ll come, you have to go and fetch them. And still there are roadblocks. A thing that I have never encountered in my life before: when we were on our roadtrip to Victoria Falls, we were stopped by roadblocks at the borders of each city. Coming from Austria, I have never seen something like that before. And it feels creepy. It's like, every time I see police and I have to stop - or maybe they wave us through, you never know - it feels like you have done something wrong. Uncertainty, being at the mercy of their whims - that's not a good feeling. INTERVIEWEE 2:As any person I hate talking ill about my country, but it's the truth, sadly, sadly is the truth. We are struggling. We are struggling. We have doctors are not paid nearly what a doctor should be paid realistically. We don't have equipment. We don't have the right medication the cost of medication alone is unbelievable. You can't afford to get sick. We were in a fuel queue with car behind us was a doctor, a doctor was in there. And he eventually was he was actually a doctor on call. And he'd also been in this queue for like, two hours or so. And the guy was supposed to be on call and knowing already that [office] was so severely understaffed. A doctor who supposed to be attending to patients but is stuck in a fuel queue is a problem. So he went up to the front and he tried to get fuel, at least in a jerrycan, and he showed them his card and the fact that he was on coal and it was a huge fight. But I think in the end, he only got like 10 liters, which is enough just to get him to work and get back home at the end of it. And as we're trying to help him sort of fill up his car. He then says, As a doctor, I can safely say to you cannot afford to get sick. Please do not get sick in this country because it's one of two things: It's either you cannot afford it because they are hospitals that are beautifully equipped, fully staffed, all the medication, all these hospitals are here right now in this country, but you know you are paying a premium for it. Even our medical aides, not all of them are accepted at these hospitals. But then you have our government hospitals, which are not as well equipped. And if you don't have the kind of money that is required to get proper health care, your chances of not making it or you know, probably not getting the best health care you possibly could a very, very high, very high and if a doctor can say, don't get sick, what does that what does that tell you?ANITA: While traveling from Harare to Bulawayo I met a doctor who lived a big part of his life in Zimbabwe. I would say, he is in his early 70s and he fought in the Rhodesian Bush War, which was a guerilla war to fight for the independence of Zimbabwe in the 1970s. It ended with the declaration of independence of Zimbabwe in 1980 with a new leader called Robert Mugabe. This doctor lives in Europe now, but every year he returns to his old home country to stay for some weeks. He brought a suitcase full of medical supplies with him, to donate it to a hospital, because public hospitals are lacking everything. At the airport, custom officers opened his suitcase and demanded money for the supplies. ANITA:Corruption is everywhere. And it seems that there are different rules for different people. Yes, I think one can say that for every country, but the differences are so big here. If you have USD, if you are in a high position, if you are in the right network, you can have a great life in Zimbabwe. I have seen private houses with swimming pools blue as the sky, many shiny SUVs and most of the better off people employ gardeners, maids and other staff. When I was there a new rule by the government was published. The minimum wage for a gardener or worker is allowed to be as little as eight USD. Per month. And of course: this is not paid in USD, but in Zimbabwe dollar.For instance: The maid in a house - close to where I stayed - works seven days a week, from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m., doing housework, cooking, taking care of the kids. She is a so-called live-in maid. Due to the power cuts she has to iron by night. She also sleeps in the house of her employer. For this, she earns 10 USD per month. Most of the time the families of workers like her live in another part of town, where the rents are cheaper. So, because they cannot afford a car, if they want to go home, they have to take the bus which costs them around 1-2 USD. How should anyone be able to live from that?And now a short word from my sponsors:Not your keys, not your coins - be the holder of your keys for your bitcoin. For that: Use a well-built hardware wallet like the BitBox02 by SHIFT Cryptosecurity from Switzerland. With their upcoming app for Android you can connect the hardware wallet directly with your phone and send and receive bitcoin on the go. Check it out at shiftcrypto.ch - that’s shift c r y p t o.ch. You get free shipping with the code ""anita""I could go on with these examples of mismanagement and corruption. For instance: MealieMeal - which is like a cornmeal- it is the Zimbabweans staple diet… The thing people eat on a daily basis like rice in Asia, noodles in Italy or potatoes in Germany. It's part of their diet and normally relatively affordable. But it is not available at the moment. The producers of MealieMeal are being forced by the government to get paid in Zimbabwe dollars. So they decided, before they are paid in this bad money that loses its value daily, they rather store the MealieMeal in their warehouses and wait for better deals. This is something that hits people in towns worse, than those in the countryside. Because there either you have your own corn or the local chief settles a deal with the producers so that his people get MealieMeal.Basically much of the conversation is about where to get what, at which prices:STREET AUDIO: Do you know that they have chibage?Anita:And I did not even mention the fuel queues up until now. So petrol: The urban spaces in Harare, Bulawayo and other towns are not densely populated in general. That means, that distances are very great. And there is no public transport like we know it. Yes, there are a lot of mini buses and also bigger buses to travel over land. Someone like me would be completely lost because there are no timetables or stops with signs. And yeah, there are no road signs at all. Nowhere. So you really need to know your way or ask people. That means everything is depending on cars and buses. If you cannot afford that, you have to walk. And I saw a lot of people walking. Women, who were carrying heavy bags on their heads - yes like we see it on television - and men, who interestingly enough, carry much less than their accompanying women. And yes, I have asked. It is a very patriarchal society.Coming back to the petrol. There are severe petrol shortages. You never know when and where you can get petrol. I was told that most of the time, when fuel shortages occurred, the price was raised afterwards. In the weeks I was in the country, I saw many, many people queueing for petrol. Long lines of cars are parked at the side of the streets waiting for the petrol station to open. People spend nights and days queueing, never knowing for how long the petrol will last. One of my interview partners excused himself for not calling me at the time we agreed upon because he was in the petrol queue for such a long time that he did not have power anymore in his cell phone.Before we dive deeper into the current situation in the following episodes, let's take a look back and take a look into the history of this beautiful land Zimbabwe and its people.The Encyclopædia Britannica begins its history of Zimbabwe with ""The Stone Age"" The first Bantu people are thought to have reached Zimbabwe between the 5th and 10th centuries CE. Zimbabwe is home to many stone ruins, including those known as Great Zimbabwe, which has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1986.Overview of Great Zimbabwe. The large walled construction is the Great Enclosure. Some remains of the valley complex can be seen in front of it.The Portuguese, who arrived on the east coast of Africa at the end of the 15th century, dreamed of opening up the interior and establishing a route to connect their eastern settlements with Angola in the west. The first European to enter Zimbabwe was probably Antonio Fernandes, who tried to cross the continent and reached the neighborhood of Que Que (now Kwekwe).A second great movement of the Bantu peoples began in 1830, this time from the south. The Ndebele, carved out a kingdom. The Ndebele were warriors and pastoralists, in the Zulu tradition, and they mastered and dispossessed the weaker tribes, known collectively as Shona (Mashona), who were sedentary, peaceful tillers of the land. For more than half a century, until the coming of European rule, the Ndebele continued to enslave and plunder the Shona. This is an important fact for the later development. During this period, however, British and Afrikaner hunters, traders, and prospectors had begun to move up from the south, and with them came the missionaries.In South Africa Cecil Rhodes formed the British South Africa Company, which received its charter in October 1889. Its objects were to extend the railway, to encourage immigration and colonization, to promote trade and commerce, and - of course - to secure all mineral rights, in return for guarantees of protection and security of rights to the tribal chiefs.The Ndebele resented this European invasion and in 1893 they took up arms, being defeated only after months of strenuous fighting. The Shona had at first accepted the Europeans, but they too became rebellious, and the whole country was not pacified until 1897.""The Rhodes Colossus"" by Edward Linley Sambourne, published in Punch after Rhodes announced plans for a telegraph line from Cape Town to Cairo in 1892.By 1892 about 1,500 settlers from the south had arrived in Rhodesia. The railway reached Bulawayo in 1896 and Victoria Falls in 1904. After Cecil Rhodes's death in 1902 he was buried in the Matopos Hills and they built him a monument that stands on top of these hills destroying the beauty of the land.And now a short word from my sponsors:The Card Wallet is the ideal solution to store your bitcoin keys in the medium and long run.

Between 1930-1960s - Black opposition to colonial rule was growing. 1965 - Prime minister Ian Smith unilaterally declared independence from the United Kingdom under white minority rule, sparking international outrage and economic sanctions.The Rhodesian Bush War lasted from 1972 to 1979 it was a Guerrilla war against white rule.According to Rhodesian government statistics, more than 20,000 people were killed during the war. Rhodesian security forces, guerrillas and around 8.000 black civilians, and 500 white civilians were killed. In 1980 - Zanu leader Robert Mugabe won independence elections. He became the first prime minister as Zimbabwe achieved an internationally recognized independence on April 18, 1980.He stayed president of Zimbabwe until 2017.Mugabe was born to a poor Shona family - hence remember how the Ndebele enslaved and plundered the Shona, before the European rule. Because between 1982 and 1985, Mugabe sent the military and the so called 5th brigade - trained by North Korean - to crush  armed resistance against him from Ndebele groups - in a military crackdown known as Gukurahundi, a Shona term which translates roughly to mean ""the early rain which washes away the chaff before the spring rains"". The Gukurahundi campaigns were also known as the Matabeleland Massacres. Approximately 20,000 Matabele were murdered in these first years after the war; most of those killed were victims of public executions. Margaret Thatcher's U.K. government was aware of the killings but remained silent on the matter, cautious not to anger Mugabe and threaten the safety of white Zimbabweans. The United States also did not raise strong objections, with President Ronald Reagan welcoming Mugabe to the White House in September 1983. In October 1983, Mugabe attended the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in New Delhi, where no participating states mentioned the Gukurahundi. Economically, Southern Rhodesia developed an economy that was narrowly based on production of a few primary products, notably, chrome and tobacco. It was therefore vulnerable to the economic cycle. The deep recession of the 1930s gave way to a post-war boom. This boom prompted the immigration of about 200,000 whites between 1945 and 1970, taking the white population up to 307,000. They established a relatively balanced economy, transforming what was once a primary producer dependent on backwoods farming into an industrial giant which spawned a strong manufacturing sector, iron and steel industries, and modern mining ventures. These economic successes owed little to foreign aid.In the 1990s hundreds of thousands of acres of largely white-owned land were expropriated. In April 1994, a newspaper investigation found that not all of this was redistributed to landless blacks; much of the expropriated land was being leased to ministers and senior officials. Responding to this scandal, in 1994 the U.K. government - which had supplied £44 million for land redistribution - halted its payments. Over the course of the 1990s, Zimbabwe's economy steadily deteriorated. By 2000, living standards had declined from 1980; life expectancy was reduced, average wages were lower, and unemployment had trebled. By 1998, unemployment was almost at 50 percent. As of 2009, three to four million Zimbabweans - the greater part of the nation's skilled workforce - had left the country. Mugabe increasingly blamed the country's economic problems on Western nations and the white Zimbabwean minority, who still controlled most of its commercial agriculture, mines, and manufacturing industry. From a human rights perspective I also want to talk about Mugabe's growing preoccupation with homosexuality, lambasting it as an ""un-African"" import from Europe. He described gay people as being ""guilty of sub-human behavior"", and of being ""worse than dogs and pigs"". This attitude may have stemmed in part from his strong conservative values, but it was strengthened by the fact that several ministers in the British government were gay. Mugabe began to believe that there was a ""gay mafia"" and that all of his critics were homosexuals. Critics also accused Mugabe of using homophobia to distract attention from the country's problems.   In February 2000, land invasions began as armed gangs attacked and occupied white-owned farms. The farm seizures were often violent; by 2006 a reported sixty white farmers had been killed, with many of their employees experiencing intimidation and torture. A large number of the seized farms remained empty, while many of those redistributed to black peasant-farmers were unable to engage in production for the market because of their lack of access to fertilizer.The farm invasions severely impacted agricultural development. Zimbabwe had produced over two million tons of maize in 2000; by 2008 this had declined to approximately 450,000. By 2009, 75 percent of Zimbabwe's population were relying on food aid, the highest proportion of any country at that time. Zimbabwe faced continuing economic decline. Hyperinflation resulted in economic crisis. By 2007, Zimbabwe had the highest inflation rate in the world, at 7600 percent. By 2008, inflation exceeded 100,000 percent and a loaf of bread cost a third of the average daily wage. Increasing numbers of Zimbabweans relied on remittances from relatives abroad.The country's lucrative tourist industry was decimated, and there was a rise in poaching, including of endangered species. Mugabe directly exacerbated this problem when he ordered the killing of 100 elephants to provide meat for an April 2007 feast.In 2008, the parliamentary and presidential elections were held. After the election, Mugabe's government deployed its 'war veterans' in a violent campaign against his opponent Tsvangirai supporters. Between March and June 2008, at least 153 MDC supporters were killed. There were reports of women affiliated with the MDC being subjected to gang rape by Mugabe supporters. Tens of thousands of Zimbabweans were internally displaced by the violence. These actions brought international condemnation of Mugabe's government.This is only 12 years ago. No wonder that people are scared. In 2009, Mugabe's government declared that - to combat rampant inflation - it would recognize U.S. dollars as legal tender and would pay government employees in this currency. This helped to stabilize prices. But then in November 2016 a new national currency called bond notes was introduced amid public resistance.In 2017 Mr. Mugabe resigns after the military takes control. Former Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa becomes president. People have hope that from now on Zimbabwe might become a better place. But as it seems, nothing really has changed. In January 2019, protests break out in major cities after the government more than doubles fuel prices in an attempt to tackle shortages and the black market.In June 2019, Zimbabwe outlaws the use of any other foreign currency. Only Zimbabwean dollars are allowed as legal tender.That meant that All USD one had held on a bank account in the country were changed into Zimbabwe dollar at the exchange rate of 1:1. This did not last long. Today - 9 months afterwards - the exchange rate on the streets is 1:43. So now 43 Zim Dollar are equivalent to 1 US Dollar.INTERVIEW:When I came here two and a half weeks ago, I think the official exchange rate was one to 17. And in the shops, we had one to 20 or 25. Today, we got one to 30 in a shop. While so in, yeah, in two and a half weeks, the rtgs or the bond, Zimbabwe bond lost a lot. I don't know how many percent that exactly now, but actually a lot of, yes, value. Yeah. So what do you see? Or what do you think is coming next? I mean, do you think you're going into hyperinflation again?Speaker 2  We are in hyperinflation.Anita Posch    You are still in again? Yes.Speaker 2   Yeah. I think we are. It's just that it's not. It's not on the scale where last time we just like I feel like it just ran out of people's hands, like when we will became trillionaires. And quadrillion is like ... [it's] just there was no control left, like no one's coming and no one knew how to deal with it. We've been there before. So now it's like okay, let's try and control it. But ... we are currently in hyperinflation, I believe, so maybe an economist will tell me I'm wrong. Anita:In the three weeks of my stay the exchange rate on the street went from 1:20 to 1:30. This is a huge change. This is a sad situation because for the people living is getting difficult again.And by the way: The Reserve bank of Zimbabwe maintains a Twitter account, where you can find tweets that paint a picture about what is happening in the country.For instance, one tweet is threatening people with disciplinary measures for posting pictures of new banknotes on social media!In the next episode you will hear more about the banking situation and how people here are used to living in a multicurrency system, which theoretically is a perfect starting point for people to adopt bitcoin.If you like my show, please subscribe to it in your podcast player and share the episode on social media.

economies are fast approaching, bitcoin settlements may appear less ...","Mar 26, 2020 at 20:48 UTC",Demand for gold is skyrocketing and the clamor for scarce assets in a remote-first world was precisely where bitcoin was supposed to shine. ,"However, rather than creating a perfect scenario for the supranational money, the coronavirus crisis could instead entrench reliance on traditional institutions. In a world where central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) from major economies are fast approaching, bitcoin settlements may appear less attractive to compliance-focused financial entities.As for short-term market signals, it’s more common for big traders to turn to oil or gold these days, according to eToro CEO Yoni Assia.“The Saudi-Russia-U.S. competition on lowering the price of oil has added a lot of fire … some days [oil] is now the most traded asset on eToro,” Assia said. “There’s been a significant squeeze on the ability to purchase dollars. … There are liquidity issues but we’re still not at the point of 2008.”Assia said overall activity on eToro is up in March, including cryptocurrency trades, with gold purchases in particular at an “all-time high.” These traders bought $7.4 billion worth of gold in the first week of March alone, he said. While retail investors have increasingly turned to bitcoin, the volume they’re moving during the downturn is nothing compared to activity associated with other hard assets.Read more: Retail Investors Are Buying the Bitcoin Institutions Are Selling, Traders Say“Gold price and flow is determined by the real rate of interest,” Roy Sebag, founder of precious metals custody firm Goldmoney, said, adding that Russian gold markets are impacted differently because they don’t rely on dollars. “The [U.S.] Federal Reserve completely changed the rules – the real rate of interest [including inflation] swung even more into the negative and so we are seeing all that savings flow into gold immediately.” Rumors abound that institutions are short on physical assets like gold. Sebag said the coronavirus crisis has shut down precious-metal mints, refineries and mines, leading to high premiums on small units.""Traders are looking for small denominations of gold, which are becoming more and more difficult to find,” Sebag said. Issuers of gold-backed stablecoins, like Paxos, are also seeing increased demand.Even with bitcoin trading up among retail investors, it hasn’t translated to stronger bitcoin use among retailers. According to BlueWallet co-founder Nuno Coelho, Lightning Network payments have been steadily decreasing over the past year. Channel capacity peaked in May 2019.This may leave bitcoin languishing, stuck between niche commercial rails and a lack of large-scale users.“The hype about Lightning is gone,” Coelho said. “It’s time to focus on building the protocol and prove that Lightning can be a payments layer on top of Bitcoin. At the moment that is not clear yet.”Some critics are questioning whether the grandfather cryptocurrency will eventually be the settlement layer some institutions hoped for – especially if CBDCs gain a foothold.The U.S. Congress is already in talks about issuing a “Digital Dollar,” which might in some ways be comparable to China’s CBDC plans.That’s why Michael Sung, a professor at Shanghai's Fudan University, said he expects the coronavirus crisis to “accelerate” Chinese CBDC initiatives.Read more: US Senate Floats ‘Digital Dollar’ Bill After House Scrubs Term From Coronavirus Relief Plan“This would be the proper way to deploy the CBDC in China, it would be a stimulus,” Sung said. “The [Chinese] government has already indicated digital currency is not meant to do large settlements.”The Chinese government’s approach to digital settlements is especially relevant considering it is home to the majority of bitcoin mining farms and manufacturers. Russia comes in at a distant second, a nation that has also taken a favorable approach toward CBDCs and a restrictive one toward bitcoin.Governments could issue digital assets without the restraints of physical shipments or reserves, which both Eastern superpowers are also shoring up. China is, after all, both the world’s top gold producer and consumer. Some analysts believe the adjustable CBDC would offer a complementary catalyst to tangible reserves.“There’s a massive shift to fintech,” Sung said. “This will lead to a mass digitization.”On Tuesday, Chinese news outlet Global Times reported the People's Bank of China (PBoC) is now drafting laws to pave the way for CBDC circulation. Tony Tong, co-chairman of the Hong Kong Blockchain Association, agreed the current crisis may hasten such efforts and reduce the government’s reliance on physical cash. Fudan University’s Sung said he expects to see such developments before 2021.“Bitcoin was supposed to be the digital gold,” Sung said. “But there are all sorts of weird dynamics where it’s now unclear if bitcoin has that privileged status as a flight to safety.”Will Foxley contributed reporting.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

as investors scrambled to hedge their positions amid the sell-off.","Mar 10, 2020 at 15:00 UTC",Trading volume records in bitcoin’s options market were smashed on Monday as investors scrambled to hedge their positions amid the sell-off.,"Major exchanges – Deribit, LedgerX, Bakkt, OKEx, CME – registered total trading volume of $198 million, surpassing the previous record high of $171.3 million reached on Feb. 11, according to crypto derivatives research firm Skew Markets. Deribit, the world’s biggest crypto options exchange by volume, contributed nearly 86 percent, or $170 million, of the total trading volume on Monday. Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) traded $2.1 million, while Intercontinental Exchange’s (ICE’s) Bakkt did not trade any contracts. Bakkt last registered activity on Feb. 27 and prior to that on Feb. 12.An option contract is a derivative based on the value of an underlying instrument that gives the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the specified amount of an underlying asset on or before the expiration date. A call option gives the holder a right to buy, while the put option gives the holder the right to sell.“Derivatives trading activity tends to increase when a large spot move occurs, which was triggered yesterday by an extraordinary sell-off in risk assets globally,” Skew CEO and co-founder Emmanuel Goh told CoinDesk. Bitcoin (BTC) was trading above $9,000 on Friday and looked set for stronger gains over the weekend. However, the cryptocurrency fell sharply from $9,900 to $9,000 on Sunday, possibly due to liquidations by alleged PlusToken scammers and declined further to a two-month low of $7,640 on Monday. The rapid price drop was accompanied by a sell-off in the traditional markets and likely fueled demand for options. “The sell-off has provided an ample amount of opportunities for both shorter-term traders and longer-term investors alike to acquire bitcoin and other assets at a significant discount to where prices stood just two weeks ago. Options are one effective way of taking advantage of these opportunities."" Justin Gillespie, CEO of Titus Investment Advisors and bitcoin trader told CoinDesk. Volumes have been rising right from the start of the year. For example, Deribit has witnessed an average daily volume of nearly $100 million over the past four weeks compared to $50 million in the period from December through January. ""There's been an explosion of interest from investors, intraday traders, and miners in BTC options on Deribit the past few months,"" Su Zhu, CEO of Three Arrows Capital, told CoinDesk. Zhu added the recent record volume reflects the growing importance of options flow on Deribit in bitcoin price setting. Back in mid-January, Zhu tweeted predicting a surge in options trading volume. As bitcoin’s price dropped, the global open interest – the sum of all options contracts that have not expired, been exercised or physically delivered – rose to $841 million on Monday from Sunday’s $798 million, according to Skew Markets. The open positions surged from $250 million to $950 million in the first six weeks of the year and has remained elevated ever since, a sign of increased institutional participation in the bitcoin market. Looking ahead, bitcoin’s option market could continue to register strong volumes because of uncertainty is likely to stay high ahead of the May 2020 reward halving, the coronavirus pandemic and the prospects of an all-out oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The move will further reduce transaction fees for customers, according to the post.""We anticipate that this will reduce our load on the Bitcoin network by more than 50 percent, and the network fees our customers pay will automatically be reduced by an equivalent amount when sending,"" wrote Eli Haims, Coinbase product manager.Batching is already live, with the firm warning that it will add a ""small delay"" in sends being broadcast to the network, but will not impact the time it takes for users' transactions to be confirmed.The change will have its effect by reducing the number of transaction that need to be processed by the many, but still limited, number of computers supporting the network. In times of high use, bitcoin can become congested, with users needing to pay higher fees in order to get their transactions verified.Historically, when bitcoin's price is peaking, the market becomes more busy and fees often rise in conjunction. Fees have been stable and relatively low since last year, but peaked to record levels as bitcoin rose to an all-time high in late 2017. Notably, the recent turmoil in the markets prompted by the coronavirus' potential hit on the global economy has seen a sharp rise in fees, apparently as investors and traders moved in large numbers to liquidate their holdings.According to data from Byte Tree shared in a tweet, transaction fees on average over the last five weeks were around 74 U.S. cents, but an hourly average sometime Thursday saw that climb to almost $2 on average.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In addition to the coronavirus pandemic weighing on all markets, the ruble has also taken a hit from the price war started by Saudi Arabia, which slashed the price of oil, Russia’s main import, to its lowest level in three years.With the ruble plunging, the average price in Russia for electricity, one of the biggest costs for miners, also dropped. In Siberia, Russia’s main region for mining, the average price for power available to local mining farms fell from 5 cents per megawatt per hour to 4. At the same time, the price of bitcoin (BTC), while plunging itself, still is calculated in U.S. dollars, which makes the bear market a bit less painful for mining farms in Russia, several such outfits told CoinDesk. In other words, with bitcoin trading around $6,200 Monday, if you sold bitcoin for rubles the price would be $6,200 times 80 rubles, not 60 rubles as it would have been two weeks ago. Thus, the hit to revenue is mitigated for miners that run their specialized computers from these farms.“As the cryptocurrency price is bound to the U.S. dollar, the ruble’s fall is beneficial"" for miners, said Alexander Shashkov, the founder of Intelion Mining.Igor Runets, CEO of the Bitriver mining facility in Bratsk, Russia, said he signed two new contracts with miners last week for a total of 24 megawatts per hour of electricity.All expenses at the farm are in rubles, Runets says, so “with the ruble falling down, Russia is strengthening its position on the [mining] market."" He’s also planning to leverage forward spread contracts for buying dollars at an agreed price in future, to hedge against the ruble possibly going up later. Bitriver is now in talks with one of the Russian banks about buying such contracts, Runets said.“Dollar exchange rate does not affect the price of electricity. Salaries and other costs don’t rise that fast either,” said Zakhar Fedorov, the business development manager at Cryptoreactor, another mining farm in Bratsk. However, his farm hasn’t seen an inflow of new clients from abroad yet.“We do have requests from the foreign miners, but no more than usual. Due to the bitcoin price crash and the hysteria around coronavirus, in such a situation many prefer to sit on cash,” Fedorov added.Mining in Russia is mostly concentrated in Siberia, where low temperatures most of the year provide natural cooling and the electricity is cheaper than in other parts of the country due to the abundance of hydropower plants. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It has risen, but not above 80 percent.","In a role reversal befitting these topsy-turvy times, Wall Street has recently seen more turbulence than the average for the top cryptocurrency.The S&P 500’s 30-day volatility of daily returns, or historical volatility, jumped to nearly 80 percent Wednesday, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.Meanwhile, bitcoin’s (BTC) volatility gauge stood at 138 percent on Wednesday compared to the average volatility of 65 percent seen in the March 2019-February 2019 period, as per CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. The 30-day volatility of daily returns calculates the standard deviation of the daily gain or loss from each of the past 30 trading days and is usually expressed in annual terms irrespective of the time period. See also: Miners Are Selling More Bitcoin Than They Are MiningPut simply, it gauges fluctuations from the mean but does not measure the direction. So, when we say that the S&P 500’s volatility reading has surpassed bitcoin's average, it means the cryptocurrency on average witnesses smaller deviations from the mean compared to what the equity index has seen over the last 30 days.The S&P 500’s volatility began rising in the first week of March as the coronavirus outbreak outside China gathered pace, stoking fears of a global recession. The situation worsened in the second and third week, as the persistent sell-off in stocks triggered margin calls, forcing investors to treat traditional safe-haven assets like gold and U.S. Treasurys as sources of liquidity. That further boosted uncertainty and added to the price volatility – so much so that 4 to 5 percent daily moves have become a new normal. In fact, the volatility in the equity market recently rose above the lifetime average of bitcoin’s 30-day volatility, as pointed out by ARK Investment Management’s crypto-asset analyst Yassine Elmandjra. So by this one measure the benchmark equity index has become a relatively risky asset. Of course, bitcoin, too, has witnessed its fair share of price volatility with institutions exiting the market amid a global dash for cash and price drops getting exaggerated due to forced long liquidations on derivative exchange BitMEX. The situation, however, has been somewhat better lately compared to Wall Street in terms of volatility.  See also: Bitcoin Halving 2020, ExplainedThe cryptocurrency’s 30-day volatility hovered below its 12-month average of 65 percent in the first 11 days of the month. However, on March 12, prices fell by a staggering 39 percent from $7,950 to $4,777 and printed lows under $4,000 on the following day. With the sudden price crash, the 30-day volatility jumped to 106 percent on Mach 12 and has remained elevated ever since, despite the price recovery and relative stability in the $6,500 to $7,000 range observed this week. Looking forward, the volatility in stock markets may subside, as the central banks and governments across the world have launched monetary and fiscal lifelines to contain the economic fallout from the virus outbreak. The Federal Reserve has cut rates to zero and announced an open-ended asset purchase program. Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate approved a $2 trillion fiscal stimulus plan this week. A potential decline in the stock market volatility could conceivably also tame volatility in the bitcoin market. That said, the next halving of miners’ rewards is due in May. As a result, bitcoin could again return to its traditional status as a more risky asset than stocks. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

That's been true the past few weeks as well.”  Bitcoin’s (BTC) seizure-resistant technology makes it impossible to transfer without the consent of someone holding a private key. If bitcoin is to be money, it needs infrastructure to handle assets when life’s prevailing circumstances alter one’s plans, such as a medical accident or death. Read more: How to Protect Bitcoin for Your Heirs With the Push of a ‘Dead Man’s Button’Casa CEO Nick Neuman said half of recent inbound sales prospects have specifically asked about the firm’s inheritance service, Casa Covenant.The firm – which focuses on user-friendly private key storage solutions – has had three times the number of clients in the first three weeks of March than January and February combined for its Diamond class product, which includes the inheritance wallet service, Neuman said. Casa is looking to add the feature to its first- and second-tier services, Gold and Platinum, soon, he added.“We allow clients to hold their own private keys and securely pass their bitcoin on to their heirs in the case that doing so is necessary so that clients don't ever have to relinquish control of their bitcoin to a third party,” Neuman said.Meanwhile, the outbreak has strengthened Ethereum developers’ motivation to create similar infrastructure for Bitcoin’s top competitor.Even before coronavirus became a household name, the Alfred project at Denver’s Ethereum hackathon was building a suite of tools for transferring tokens under the ERC-20 and ERC-721 non-fungible token (NFT) standards. Project member Seth Goldfarb said the team chose the name Alfred to put a kind face on an uncomfortable topic.Read more: Casa Is Helping Bitcoin Investors Pass on Their Holdings When They DieFrom a technical perspective, the system would have two parts: an oracle service regularly scanning public sources for death announcements, and an escrow service, Goldfarb said.When the oracle detects a subscriber’s death, the escrow system would begin a countdown to sending the user’s digital assets to a chosen third party such as a family member. A “life alert” button could stop the escrow service from going through if needed, Goldfarb said. For now, the project remains in the development stage, however.While an unsavory topic, inheritance protocols are a necessary part of the tech stack if digital assets are to endure, particularly if they rise in value.“It’s not nice to think about, but it may [be] prudent to have a detailed plan for what will happen to your Bitcoin when you die,” Lightning Labs engineer Alex Bosworth said on Twitter.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Most crypto prices have been in the green over the past 24 hours. ,"Bitcoin (BTC) is hovering in the $5,000-$5,500 area as of 19:00 UTC (3 p.m. ET) on March 17. It’s the same area where the cryptocurrency spent the weekend trading before the Federal Reserve’s surprise rate cut announcement on Sunday, March 15. As of 18:00 UTC, bitcoin was changing hands at $5,371, up 7 percent over the past 24 hours. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index eked out a slight gain, up 0.06 percent as of session close on March 17 at 5:00 UTC.Lately, trading in Japanese markets seems to be one indicator of how bitcoin will perform in the following hours. Despite an obvious downward slump overall for Japan’s key equity index when the Nikkei traded in a tight range of limited up or down swings, so did bitcoin.It’s clear many markets are performing similarly - at least for the time being. “This is not the first time that bitcoin traded in tandem with other assets,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research for London-based digital asset firm Bequant. “Other examples include the China trade war and geographic tensions in Iran, but every time the correlation was promptly unwound.” One metric used to evaluate cryptocurrency, bitcoin’s market value to realized value (MVRV) Z-score fell below zero on Friday, suggesting BTC is undervalued. Some traders see recent price swings as natural capitulation from some market participants, with determination to buy from others.“The weak hands are leaving and the firm believers are buying,” said Sweden-based over-the-counter crypto trader Henrik Kugelburg.Indeed, other traders have the view that institutions are selling while retail types are scooping up bitcoin at what they see as discount pricing. The S&P 500 is up 4 percent in trading as of 18:00 UTC after the Trump administration announced measures to stave off an economic downfall because of the coronavirus pandemic after the Federal Reserve's interest rate bazooka did not have the desired immediate effect on the stock market.Gold is up by less than a percentage point on the day, and the yellow metal is another indicator of how the markets feel about rate cuts and other measures world governments are taking to deal with the coronavirus crisis.“It's very scary when the Fed cuts rates to zero over the weekend and you see the reaction that the market has had,” said Rupert Douglas, Head of Institutional Sales for digital asset manager Koine.“Normally, gold would be screaming higher.” Despite the fears, traders will need to keep focusing on what they do best - remaining calm and using the tools at their disposal to deal with price swings. “You can go long with very limited risk and a large reward if you trade with tight stops,” added Douglas. Outside of bitcoin, cryptocurrency prices making notable moves today include Lisk (LSK) up 11 percent, IOTA (IOTA) up 6 percent and bitcoin SV (BSV) in the green 6 percent. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

UTC (12:48 p.m. Eastern Time) Monday. That decline was less than half ...","Mar 9, 2020 at 21:56 UTC","It was just another Monday in the notoriously volatile cryptocurrency markets, which stay open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. ","Traders in the 11-year-old digital-asset industry described few changes in business activity or sentiment as coronavirus-related fears gripped Wall Street and sent stock markets reeling. “We're not the ones uncomfortable with the volatility today,” said Ricky Li, co-founder and head of Americas at Altonomy, a cryptocurrency-focused proprietary trading firm. Prices for bitcoin (BTC) slid by 2.9 percent to about $7,800 as of 16:48 UTC (12:48 p.m. Eastern Time) Monday. That decline was less than half the 7 percent plunge in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks, a drop so fierce it tripped market “circuit breakers,” temporarily halting trading under exchange rules designed to help limit investor losses.The latest sell-off in stocks left the S&P 500 down about 18 percent since its record high on Feb. 19. Since then, bitcoin has fallen by about the same percentage. Yet, on a year-to-date basis, bitcoin is still up about 8.6 percent, in contrast with a 7.7 percent loss so far in 2020 for the S&P 500.Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index (the ""VIX""), a measure of implied volatility on the S&P 500, is trading at its highest levels since the financial crisis. Sometimes called the ""Fear Index"" by traders, the VIX measures the S&P index's expected volatility in the coming weeks and usually rises when the market expects stocks to fall. ""Few assets are safe when a 'black swan' event such as the coronavirus takes hold of the markets on a global scale,"" Connor Abendschein, a research analyst for Digital Assets Data, said in an e-mail. ""Bitcoin may find its footing and shine further down the road during this financial crisis."" One clear takeaway Monday was that as traditional markets undergo a level of anxiety not seen since the 2008 recession, the cryptocurrency industry showed few existential signs of distress.In fact, bitcoin’s “hash rate” — a gauge of the amount of computing power working to confirm data blocks on the underlying blockchain network — was holding steady at around 122 exhashes, or quintillion hashes, per second, according to Blockchain.com. That’s roughly double where it stood in mid-2019. Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based digital-asset firm Bequant, said he was seeing interest in new loans from borrowers who have become more bullish on bitcoin following the recent price drop.He spent a good portion of Sunday morning trading WhatsApp messages with one client who wanted a loan denominated in stablecoins, digital tokens whose value is linked to a government-issued currency like the U.S. dollar. The borrower wanted to use the loan to buy new computers for data processing on the network, known as bitcoin mining because the rewards are paid out in units of the cryptocurrency.     “We're not seeing any change in sentiment,” Vinokourov said.  “There's no mining capitulation.” TradeBlock, a digital-asset analysis firm based in New York, wrote Monday in a blog post that the average daily price swings in the S&P 500 recently surpassed those for bitcoin. According to the firm, that hasn’t happened since October 2018. Steep gains and losses are nothing new to cryptocurrency traders; indeed, bitcoin naysayers from traditional finance have consistently mocked the notion that bitcoin could ever serve as a “safe haven,"" or reliable store of value similar to gold or U.S. Treasury bonds. Bitcoin’s price jumped 13-fold over the course of 2017, only to tumble by 73 percent in 2018. Last year, it rose 94 percent, roughly triple the gains charted by the S&P 500.   Vladimir Cohen, an over-the-counter broker, said he knew of clients who had taken advantage of a price rally in bitcoin earlier this year “to get rid of such a volatile and unpredictable asset.” Konstantin Plavnik, chief operating officer of the Moscow-based crypto derivatives exchange Xena, said bitcoin’s recent sell-off in synch with stocks might be a bullish sign — bitcoin is “becoming a more effective, full-fledged part of the global financial markets.”“Bitcoin is a speculative asset, and during the crisis, investors switch to cash,"" Plavnik said.Prices for gold, seen by many big investors as a traditional store of value in times of economic and market distress, are up about 10 percent this year — roughly on par with bitcoin’s 2020 gains. U.S. government bonds, another asset category long considered a reliable safe haven, have also rallied, with yields on the 10-year note declining by 0.2 percentage point to a record low of 0.51 percent. Bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices.      Yin Shao, co-founder of the trading firm Reciprocity in New York, said he didn’t see anything too notable in bitcoin’s price movement Monday — or any unusual business activity.“The folks that we generally trade with are not terribly connected to or in tune with what's going on in traditional markets,” Shao said. U.S. stocks tumbled even amid signs government authorities are moving quickly to provide economic support and fresh liquidity injections for ailing markets.   The U.S. central bank’s New York branch on Monday offered to pump more cash into distressed markets, increasing one overnight lending program for Wall Street dealers by 50 percent to $150 billion. Futures traders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange have upped bets the Federal Reserve will soon make a steep cut in interest rates for the second time this month to support the economy. Bloomberg News reported that Trump administration officials are drafting measures to blunt the economic impact, beyond the $7.8 billion emergency spending bill passed last week.  Bitcoin, launched in the wake of the 2008 crisis by coders as a new type of money theoretically free from government control, has no such safety net, which serves as a dampener on market volatility.Zac Prince, CEO of BlockFi, a cryptocurrency lender and vendor, said it’s typical for big crypto traders to borrow more bitcoin during times of heightened volatility — to place transactions designed to capture profits from price dislocations.“When things move, there's more stuff for them to do,” Prince said. “I wouldn't say we're seeing anything particularly different from the way things usually work.” Anna Baydakova contributed reporting for this article.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

bitcoin, both in terms of its reputation as a hedge against centralized ...","Mar 17, 2020 at 18:30 UTC","Another enormous program of quantitative easing (QE) ought to benefit bitcoin, both in terms of its reputation as a hedge against centralized changes to the financial system, but also directly, as asset prices gradually rise across the board.","While QE may be anathema to crypto hardliners, some experts agree the net effect on prices is positive, one way or another.QE has helped drive up the price of bitcoin (BTC) over the past decade, according to economist and author Frances Coppola. “What QE does is raise asset prices across the board and that would include new alternative assets like bitcoin,” she said.The idea bitcoin is somehow uncorrelated with the financial mainstream is now being convincingly laid to rest, Coppola added (last week’s coronavirus shock saw bitcoin shedding close to 50 percent of its value).Central banks conducted three rounds of QE between 2009 and 2015, during which time the S&P 500 rallied by more than 200 percent. Gold, a classic safe-haven asset, rose from $800 to $1,921 in the three years leading up to 2011 only to fall back to $1,050 by December 2015. Since the last financial crash in 2008, QE helped global private wealth grow by two-thirds to $166 trillion, according to the Boston Consulting Group.However, the notion that expending the quantity of money in developed economies leads to hyperinflation – a popular idea among some bitcoin advocates – is false, Coppola said.“There is absolutely no evidence that QE causes hyperinflation. The way QE works is to push investors into higher-yielding assets – and bitcoin, while being unbelievably volatile, is higher yielding. So what you actually get are asset bubbles, including bitcoin,” she said.In the current state of crisis, the bazooka of measures by the Federal Reserve failed to stabilize markets caught in a desperate flight towards cash. To counteract the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the Federal Reserve announced a $700 billion bond buying program and that it would be cutting the interest depository institutions charge one another overnight for reserves to between 0.0 and 0.25 percent.Simon Peters, a market analyst at eToro, agreed that once the rise in COVID-19 cases outside China tails off, investors will be looking toward assets like bitcoin.“Investor sentiment could shift to, ‘Now I have all of this cash and with the increase in monetary supply, what do I do and where do I put it?’” said Peters, adding:“Holding cash is not beneficial in these circumstances because the currency has been devalued and you are losing purchasing power so where do you put it? That is potentially where the likes of bitcoin and other crypto-assets may see the benefit.”A so-called Cantillon Effect refers to the change in relative prices resulting from a shift in the money supply. Assets like stocks and real estate become overpriced, meaning assets like bitcoin become more attractive over time, as noted by analyst Pierre Rochard and VanEck director Gabor Gurbacs.Based on what’s happening in the mainstream financial system, bitcoin still counts as “Doomsday insurance,” according to Alex Mashinsky, CEO of crypto lending platform Celsius Network. “They are printing money that did not exist yesterday and they are giving it to everybody,” Mashinsky said of central banks. “But you can’t say, ‘We have this disease so we are going to print another 5 million bitcoin,’ or, ‘We want to be re-elected so we are going to print another 10 million bitcoin,’” he said.For some time now, Caitlin Long, the force behind Wyoming’s blockchain legislation and now CEO of Avanti Financial Group, has been critical of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Long called for increased capital requirements on banks to deleverage the situation, back when there were rumblings in the repo market that liquidity was starting to become scarce. “History is not going to support the decision of the FOMC to ease the banks' capital requirements,” she said.Central banks are running the same playbook as always and it's not working, Long said, adding: “The quantity of stimulus that they are throwing at this is staggering in size if you compare it to the size of QE1, QE2 – they are now doing QE1s in a single day, when QE1 was done over a span of months.”The QE1 program lasted from December 2008 until March 2010 and saw the Fed buying $600 billion in mortgage-backed securities and $100 billion in other debt.For the first time in several years, Long said she went out and bought some bitcoin right after markets crashed last week (she cautioned this is not to be read as financial advice).“All I know is bitcoin is an asset that is no one's IOU. I would prefer to diversify my wealth away from assets that are someone's IOU, when I don't know if that someone is solvent,” Long said.As traditional finance zigs down the QE route, bitcoin is zagging in the opposite direction.In two months, the supply of new bitcoin will be reduced by 50 percent – an occurrence scheduled for roughly every four years known as the “halving.” “As the U.S. government prints another trillion-plus dollars, this will have long-term ramifications on inflation and dilution of money. On the other hand, we will still have 21 million [bitcoins] available, ever,” said Alex Blum, COO of Hong Kong-based fintech firm Two Prime. “The halvening will happen when it’s set to happen.”Bitcoin’s scarcity to value argument involves “an ideological statement of faith,” in Coppola’s opinion. “There will always be people who believe that scarcity alone is sufficient to make something valuable. In actual fact, something that is so scarce that nobody wants to buy it isn't valuable at all. Things need to have liquidity,” she said.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The value was reinvested into XTZ tokens and into other asset classes. Per the report, the Tezos Foundation, which is based in Switzerland, held approximately $397.7 million worth of bitcoin on July 31, 2019. As bitcoin traded at the $10,000 mark, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, the foundation held roughly 39,700 bitcoins. As of Jan. 31, the foundation held 31,800 bitcoin, worth roughly $298.5 million based on a spot price of $9,400.

0.5-1 bitcoins (~$500 at 2016 bitcoin prices), the size of a typical ...","Mar 16, 2020 at 12:34 UTC","J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.","Bitcoin-based ransomware attacks are an interesting phenomenon. But who cares? They’re tiny. That was pretty much my opinion about ransomware until a few months ago. I formed it after reading a paper in early 2018 that used blockchain analysis to measure the ransomware market. The authors concluded just $13 million in bitcoin (BTC) had been paid out in ransom from 2013 to 2017, a ""relatively low” amount compared to the “hype surrounding the issue.”But headlines throughout 2018 and 2019 indicate this benign view may no longer be valid. Whereas early ransomware strains such as Locky asked for ransoms of just 0.5-1 bitcoins (~$500 at 2016 bitcoin prices), the size of a typical ransom demand has exploded. In May 2019, the cities of Riviera Beach and Lake City, both in Florida, paid $600,000 and $500,000 in ransom, respectively, to regain access to computer systems infected by ransomware newcomer Ryuk. Crippled by Doppolemayer in late 2019, a Canadian insurer paid $905,000 in ransom, much of which eventually made its way to Bitfinex.See also: J.P. Koning – Lightning Solves Bitcoin’s Speed Problem, but Watch Out for FraudstersThe range of institutions being hit has been expanding as well. Whereas the first wave of attacks was mainly focused on the consumer market, the new wave has targeted institutions corporations and governments. According to Armor, a security company, 72 U.S. school boards were hit by ransomware in 2019, or around 1,039 schools.What is ransomware? It is malicious software that takes control of a computer, say by encrypting files or threatening to publicly expose data. It only releases that control after receiving a ransom payment.Ransomware predates bitcoin. Ransom-A, a 2006 strain of ransomware, froze victims' computers and would only release them when $10.99 had been transferred by Western Union. Cryzip required $300 in ransom to be paid via e-gold, an early digital gold payment system. Another ransomware outbreak in 2011 impersonated law enforcement agencies such as the London Metropolitan Police or the Federal Bureau of Investigation and required payment via e-money or prepaid cards like MoneyPak, Ukash or PaySafeCard.All of these payment routes are relatively difficult to trace, which is why they were popular with extortionists. But they had weaknesses, too. Western Union requires at least some identification. Prepaid options like MoneyPak have dollar caps, which limits their ability to facilitate large ransom payments.Any payments network is subject to a calculus of legitimacy. Once the percentage of illicit transactions reaches a certain percentage, the system becomes stigmatized.Bitcoin has all sorts of advantages. Ransom payments can be any size, payments can never be frozen, and the network is global. And so ever since the 2013 appearance of Cryptolocker, the first strain of bitcoin ransomware, bitcoin has become the preferred payment method for ransomware operators.If the bitcoin ransom market was initially quite small until 2017, how much bigger has it become? In a recent RSA security conference, FBI agent Joel DeCapua suggested that between October 2013 and autumn of 2019, $144 million in bitcoin ransom payments had been paid.To arrive at this number, DeCapua recreated methods used in an earlier 2018 study by a team that included Google and Princeton researchers. This team traced a total of $16 million in bitcoin ransom payments between 2013 until August 2017. Their method relies on finding seed bitcoin addresses – addresses from which a ransom had been paid – and techniques like clustering to back out the total amount of ransom associated with each ransomware family.Assuming continuity between the earlier Google/Princeton study and the FBI's newer effort, around $128 million in bitcoin has been paid as ransom between August 2017 and the end of 2019. That's a big pick-up in ransom volume! DeCapua's presentation reveals that between February 2018 and October 2019 Ryuk alone accounted for $61 million in ransom.Ransomware has become more sophisticated. Whereas early strains like Cryptolocker and Locky indiscriminately targeted computers for small amounts, Ryuk operators carefully select a specific target, usually large organizations like a city government or corporation. Once inside the victim's network, the hackers move laterally through the system to compromise as much data as possible. This allows them to extract massive ransom payments. According to Coveware, in the fourth quarter of 2019 the average ransom payment doubled to $84,116, up from $41,198 in the previous quarter.Ransomware could have big effects on the bitcoin ecosystem.I'd suggest that any payments network is subject to a calculus of legitimacy. Once the percentage of illicit transactions reaches a certain percentage of total transactions, the system becomes stigmatized. A chill sets in. The public, politicians, law enforcement, and regulators begin to protest, and the system is either retired or its operators are forced to reform it.E-gold encountered this tipping point in 2007. The e-gold network had become a popular venue for selling compromised credit card numbers, and the FBI shut it down. Or take Western Union, which had become a popular way to run scams like law enforcement fraud or “wire money to get me out of jail” scams. Not only did Western Union have to implement new anti-fraud measures, but it had to pay a half billion dollar fine to the FTC. MoneyPak, owned by Green Dot Bank, has also brushed up against the legitimacy point. Due to the growing popularity of MoneyPak in telephone confidence scams, Green Dot's founder Steve Streit was called in front of the Senate's Committee on Aging in late-2014. Streit maintained that only $30 million out of $20 billion in value loaded in 2013 (just 0.25 percent) could be attributed to fraud. Nevertheless, Streit would choose to deactivate MoneyPak in 2015. When it was brought back online a year later, the system had been reformed. A new customer information process ensured that only KYC'ed users could receive MoneyPak funds.See also: Cash Is the New Safe Haven as Crypto, Gold Continue to TankGift cards have also been hitting up against the legitimacy point. Gift card scams caught the attention of attorney generals in Pennsylvania and New York. In 2018 they pressured Walmart, Best Buy, and Target into announcing measures to cut down on gift card scams including limiting card face values to $500.I have no idea if bitcoin is close to reaching a critical level in the calculus of legitimacy. But the usage of bitcoin by crooks who cripple schools and health care providers makes for terrible optics. If enough voters have been hurt by these attacks, that serves as fertile breeding ground for political and regulatory pushback.The recently proposed Crypto-Currency Act of 2020, for instance, calls for ""the tracing of transactions"" to be built into each cryptocurrency. In theory, tracing would help cut down on ransom attacks. But such a measure seems unlikely it could be implemented. Green Dot and Western Union are centralized and can be easily modified, but bitcoin is anarchic, which means that there is no easy way to force this sort of change.If ransomware has forced bitcoin over the legitimacy line, the pushback is likely to be felt at the infrastructure surrounding bitcoin, such as exchanges. Perhaps exchanges would be confined to sending or receiving funds from/to identified addresses. Or they may be prevented from receiving bitcoins from services that mix coins to obfuscate their transactional historiesThe other possibility is that as a shiny newcomer, bitcoin is exempt. When the topic of ransomware came up at the 2019 U.S. Conference of Mayors, 225 mayors resolved to avoid paying ransoms. Their anger was primarily directed at the hackers, not the payment mechanism. The same calculus that applies to other payments systems doesn’t seem to apply to bitcoin – for now at least.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Compared to the publicly tradable A-shares, B-shares are only available to CME members and offer special voting-rights to elect six people to the board of directors, the position Federighi seeks. See also: CME Bitcoin Futures Daily Trading Volume Hits 2020 Low – That’s a Bullish SignFederighi, a CME member since 1997, argued the exchange would need to create as many as 9,600 CME tokens, each representing hundredths of a B-share. The blockchain could replace complicated legacy structures, with tokens redistributed to existing B-share holders, he said. ""Digitize and fractionalize B-shares into hundredths of a membership. Let them trade freely on a blockchain where all transactions and ownership are recorded,"" Federighi said in his proposal. Tokens would ""enable future owners to gradually buy into a membership over time.""Federighi also proposed that CME should build its own renewable energy plants to power operations and ""divert the excess energy to mine Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,"" which could be ""immediately converted"" into fiat. Not only would that create a new environmentally friendly revenue stream, but it would also help familiarize the exchange with a new technology and asset-class, he argued. ""While this seems outside of our core competencies, I’d argue this is our business: we, like the miners, match and clear trades,"" he said.See also: CME Takes Its Bitcoin Options Live, Competing With ICE’s BakktA footnote says the proposals were not checked by CME management and ""some may not be feasible."" Asked if he considered his measures radical, Federighi told CoinDesk he stands by all of his proposals. He declined to comment further, citing the rules of the election process.

right ...","Mar 9, 2020 at 21:53 UTC","Monday’s historic financial tumult reached beyond stocks, sinking commodities and even bitcoin markets.","“I don’t think any asset is safe right now – except cash, U.S. dollars,” said Ali Khedery, formerly Exxon’s senior Middle East adviser and now CEO of U.S.-based strategy firm Dragoman Ventures.While bitcoin (BTC) prices dropped nearly 10 percent over the weekend, Saudi Arabia slashed its export oil prices when Russia refused to support an Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) effort to reduce oil production. Coronavirus quarantines mean fewer cars on the road, economic slowdown and less demand for oil, experts warn.Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData, described the current state as an “oversupplied” oil market where Saudi Arabia made a drastic move, harming everyone’s bottom line, in an effort to “to get Russia back to the negotiating table.”Smith said it will be difficult for nations to reconfigure their supply chains to circumnavigate the oversaturated market. Although nations like Iran appear to be interested in using the bitcoin mining industry to turn cheap power into global assets, both Smith and Khedery agree there’s no serious interest in bitcoin as a market alternative any time soon.“In times of crisis, all markets correlate,” Smith said, arguing the dip contradicts bitcoin’s “safe haven” narrative.Plus, an anonymous bitcoin mining farm operator in Iran said many operations are stalled by regulatory setbacks such as penalty fees for subsidized electricity. Bitcoiners may be thrilled about the potential to turn surplus energy into bitcoin, but so far it doesn’t appear as though OPEC members are prioritizing mining infrastructure for that approach. The Iranian miner said the local industry doesn’t appear to have any connection to strategies for abating a broader market crisis, at least none civilians are aware of. Yet, if the oil market continues to plummet, Khedery said, “It may cause Iran, Iraq and Venezuela to collapse.”“Iran is in deep trouble,” Khedery added, speaking of the oil-exporting nation hampered by both sanctions and a coronavirus outbreak.Regardless, bitcoin bulls remain unfazed. Electric Capital co-founder Avichal Garg tweeted bitcoin may become a safe haven asset in the future. Bitcoin-focused investor Tuur Demeester said he expects the broader market chaos to increase bitcoin’s dominance on exchanges.“What you want in a period of crisis is options,” Demeester said. “You’ll be attracted to an asset that’s liquid. … There are some people who are being forced to sell [bitcoin]. But, overall we’re in a very healthy [bitcoin] market.”Likewise, Gabor Gurbacs, director of digital asset strategies at VanEck/MVIS, said adopting a bitcoin strategy is in the best interest of any country heavily involved in energy markets.“While for now the petrodollar system remains dominant and the U.S. dollar outperforms other currencies, sovereign nations are increasingly searching for alternatives,” Gurbacs said, adding the safe haven narrative hasn’t been disproven because “bitcoin is a relatively young asset and it’s not a full-fledged store of value yet.”There were, indeed, rumors at the World Economic Forum in January that some nations are actively looking for alternative currencies to settle energy market trades. But such forum participants generally dismissed bitcoin as too nascent, and alternative fiat systems as a poor substitute for the dollar, at least so far. “The Russians and Chinese have been trying for years. And failing, it seems,” Khedery said.Regarding the proverbial petrodollar, he added nations “can’t displace [USD] until there is a viable alternative.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Quedex volumes surged past a record $5 million on Saturday, beating the previous all-time high of $2 million reached in February, according to the exchange.""The new December 2021 products account for about 5 to 15 percent of total volume on the exchange ... we see it as relatively high and promising for a product which [has been] live for less than a week,"" Gromniak said. ""What's interesting is that the new December 2021 expiry options are the most popular among options products.""Quedex's total volumes peaked at over $16 million between March 6 and March 13, more than the exchange's $9.8 million weekly average. Over the same timeframe, volumes for the December 2021 contracts came in at $1.2 million with most activity taking place on Thursday, where volumes peaked at nearly $900,000, according to Gromniak. Operating since 2016, Quedex is regulated by the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission and offers various bitcoin-denominated products. As well as the two-year product, the exchange also offers contracts with expiries ranging from a week, to a month, to a quarter. Clients can also use a margin trading facility that comes with up to 10 times leverage.The new contract's launch came before the coronavirus pandemic triggered mass sell-offs across both traditional and crypto markets. Contrary to the widely held safe-haven narrative, bitcoin's (BTC) price dropped to a 10-month low on Thursday, taking many traders completely unawares. Forced liquidations of long positions on derivatives exchange BitMEX have soared past $700 million, adding further downward pressure to the spot price.While volatility is likely to continue for contracts with short term expiries, Gromniak attributes surging interest in his longer-dated products to investors trying to hedge their long-term exposure. Contracts with longer expiry dates, such as in two years' time, are not influenced by market downtrends such as the one sparked by the coronavirus, he said. Previously, exchanges OKEx and FTX had the longest-reaching contracts that expired in December 2020. The longest contracts available on Deribit lists expire in September. Gromniak said Quedex would consider adding contracts with even longer expiration dates, but added the company would wait to see first if there was sufficient demand from the market.

In this episode you will get to know the multicurrency world, the different forms and usages of money as well as the price fluctuations that Zimbabweans are dealing with day by day. We also take a look at the current regulations of cryptocurrencies and the usage of mobile payments and internet connections.To understand the Zimbabwean currency changes, reforms and the resulting crisis, we need to go back to 1980, the year of the independence of Zimbabwe. Back then the Zimbabwean dollar was legal tender for the first time. It was introduced to directly replace the Rhodesian dollar at par (1:1), at a similar value to the U.S. dollar. Over time, hyperinflation in Zimbabwe reduced the Zimbabwe dollar to one of the lowest valued currency units in the world. It was redenominated three times (in 2006, 2008 and 2009), with denominations up to a $100 trillion banknote issued. The final redenomination produced the so-called ""fourth dollar"" (ZWL), which was worth 10 to the power of 25 (1025 ) “first dollars.”You needed weird amounts of notes to buy stuff. I was told there was a joke at that time: Someone wanted to pay for something and came with a wheelbarrow full of bank notes to the seller. The seller threw the notes out of the wheelbarrow and went off with the wheelbarrow, because it was worth more than the big pile of banknotes.You can buy those paper notes as collectors items now. I found 10 million dollar notes at a souvenir shop in Victoria Falls. One of these paper notes costs 5 USD. I guess that is a higher value than they had in 2008.In 2009 the country – ravaged by the hyper-inflation – abandoned the Zimbabwe dollar and adopted multiple currencies including the U.S. dollar. In 2014 there were eight legal currencies - U.S. dollar, South African rand, Botswana pula, British pound sterling, Australian dollar, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee and Japanese yen.The dollarization reversed inflation, permitting the banking system to stabilize and the economy to resume slow growth after 2009. But then in 2015, the foreign currency notes dried up at the banks, leading to cash shortages in the economy. In 2016, Zimbabwe introduced Bond notes as a surrogate currency, which initially had equal value to the U.S. dollar but today it trades at 1:43 with the greenback.In June 2019, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe abolished the multiple currency system, outlawed the use of U.S. dollar and replaced it with a new “Zimdollar” based on the RTGS dollar. The new legal tender. Anita Posch  What are the forms of money that people use here in Zimbabwe?Online Entrepreneur  Okay, so in Zimbabwe there is what is known as Bond, which is the cash, the hard cash that you actually hold, paper money that you hold in your hand. And there is what is known as RTGS, which is the electronic money if I can, if I can call it that way, that’s another form of payment that people use, and also people use U.S. dollars and some other currencies like South African rand, but the most popular one is U.S. dollars in terms of currency that is not from Zimbabwe. But mostly people use electronic money which is called RTGS the bond money and U.S. dollars and South African rands as well.Anita Posch  And I always see these signs with EcoCash numbers on it. So is EcoCash very often, broadly used as a form of payment?Online Entrepreneur  Yes. EcoCash is broadly used. It is a form of payment in Zimbabwe. I would say, EcoCash is just a vehicle of where money passes through. Okay? So it just connects your RTGS balance to the customer. We just use it to make payments like walking into a shop, you buy bread, you can actually use it to buy anything that you want, pay school fees, pay anything that you want. Yeah. But it's not classified as a currency. Yeah, but it holds our currency.The official currency of Zimbabwe is the RTGS dollar or Zim dollar. As you have just heard it is called RTGS, if it is the money on your bank account - RTGS is short for real time gross settlement. So it is called what it is, electronic money - an entry in a database. If it is in the form of cash, it is called Bond notes or Bond coins. These are the Zimbabwean dollar paper notes. Cash. In paper form it is called Bond note as mint Bond coin. But the Bond notes are rare. This is the reason why there are queues at the banks when wages are paid out. People are waiting hours for cash. Why? Because public transport with buses or in many cases the school fees have to be paid in Bond notes. You can find pictures of Bond notes and coins as well as a queue in front of a bank, that we were passing by, on the episode page at https://bitcoinundco.com/en/africa2 .There are a lot of ATMs, but they are empty. They have been used up until 2015; now you can get your bank statement, but no Bond notes. So if you can get hold of Bond notes you immediately take the chance to get them. For instance - I was standing next to my friend at the counter in the supermarket. Ahead of her there was a guy who had a bundle of Bond notes in his hands. She saw that and before he could pay his groceries my friend asked him if he would give her the Bond notes, if she would pay for his groceries per swipe. And so it happened. His bill was settled and she got hold of Bonds.Credit cards: Credit cards have been used some years ago and you can book flights or use them for online shopping, but since they are all in foreign currencies it's complicated to get the money out of the bank. So if you're a merchant, it's theoretically easy to collect money with credit cards, but very expensive and difficult to redeem it. That's why almost nobody uses credit cards. So how do people pay their shopping and their bills? In the supermarket you can pay with Bonds or you swipe. Swipe means you pay with your banking card using RTGS  - you know, the electronically stored money in the bank - or you pay with EcoCash, which is mobile money. People are forced into using EcoCash because Bond notes are rare. Most of the people do not have access to U.S. dollars and even if you had U.S. dollars, the use of it was outlawed.And exchanging money is very costly and cumbersome in general. That’s the reason why you get 20 to 30 percent off the price of goods in most cases if you pay cash. On the other hand, if you use EcoCash prices are 20 to 30 percent higher because of the conversion costs. And additionally there is a 2 percent transaction fee that the government imposes on every digital transaction. This is basically a tax on every purchase, no matter how rich or poor you are.While driving back to Harare from our weekend trip, we stopped at one of the many corn stands next to the street. Men are roasting corn cobs on self-made stone grills - it’s their daily business. You can see one of the guys called Advance and his grill on the episode page at https://bitcoinundco.com/en/africa2 . We stopped the car, bought two corn cobs and my friend paid with EcoCash.One cob costs 8 Zim dollar in Bond; if you pay with EcoCash, 10.At the end of the sound you can hear Advances phone ringing. That's the EcoCash confirmation. “Looks like I have to do it again EcoCash is...then he says the telephone number and his name “Advance” and then you can hear his phone ringing - STOPM-Pesa (M for mobile, pesa is Swahili for money) is a mobile phone-based money transfer, financing and microfinancing service, launched in 2007 by Vodafone in Kenya and Tanzania. M-Pesa allows users to deposit, withdraw, transfer money and pay for goods and services easily with a mobile device.EcoCash, was launched in 2011 by Econet Wireless, a telephony company, for its customers in Zimbabwe - it is similarily to M-Pesa a mobile phone-based money transfer, financing and microfinancing service.Econet allows users to deposit, withdraw, transfer money and pay for goods and services, including utility bills, from a mobile handset. Users can also buy pre-paid airtime or data bundles for themselves or others. Users can also redeem stored mobile money for cash. A fee for each service is deducted directly from the account stored on the mobile phone.On the episode page at bitcoinundco.com/en/africa2 you will find a picture of an EcoCash sign, where you see the telephone number, name and the codes you have to dial to send the right amount of mobile money to the seller.

In 2009 the unity government under a new constitution ended the phase of the Zimbabwe dollar being the official currency and introduced a multicurrency basket. In 2015 basically everything was paid in USD. Zimbabwe had a USD economy, but ran out of cash. The ATMs were working, but there was no money anymore inside of them. Almost everybody was unbanked. At some ATMs you could get South African rand. And in 2016 the bottom fell out on the cash supply. Why did the U.S. dollar cash supply run out in 2016? HUMAN RIGHTS SPEAKER One reason is that Zimbabwe is much more of an import economy than it is an export economy. So before, like when we used to have a strong agricultural base and a strong manufacturing base, we were exporting things. We had a functioning economy. In the intervening 20 years, agriculture really declined, manufacturing really declined, we began to be a country that imported a lot more than it exported, or that we even produced ourselves. So when you go to the supermarket you will see that everything is South African, we're not producing locally, but we're buying. Then think about fuel, think about electricity. There's a huge economy that's purchasing things from outside and not much that's selling outside. So all the U.S. dollars that were circulating in the economy at some point they had to have been from outside the country.So, over time, you have what's called a nostro account, which is basically the international system of  - once my money goes out of U.S. dollars cash and into the bank, it's technically still U.S. dollars, but it kind of exists in an electronic trust format. So I'm a bank here and I have U.S. dollars, your bank in the States that has U.S. dollars, we know that we have U.S. dollars collectively, but I'm never going to physically give you $100 because you're the bank in the States, right? It only exists electronically. Which - as long as we all trust each other is great, but it means, that the Zimbabwe bank is meant to put my U.S. balance into this nostro space internationally, because that's actually where it's existing and holding its value. But the banks didn't do that. So, over time, slowly, slowly the U.S. balance that I thought I had in my account, which was my 100 U.S. dollars that I put into the bank - the bank didn't hold it in the safe space, they lent it to the government, they borrowed it, they exchanged it. So the U.S. balances that banks held got eroded. And now, when I need the U.S. dollars to go outside the country to buy things I need actual nostros, but if I'm inside my own internal economy, I have a U.S. dollar, in inverted commas, and I give it to you and it's all buying stuff. Yeah, so we did never check one another like, do you still hold actual dollars? Here are mine. So that were years of doing that, and eventually just kind of all caught up with us. And it was like, millions, hundreds of millions of actual U.S. dollars. The banks have just been busy borrowing, lending Treasury bills and spending. And it was just a number in a database. So the physical, hard currency that should have been backing that up, it was nowhere to be found.In 2016, they introduced the Bond notes, which was kind of like, Oh, look, there's no more cash in the system. We're going to introduce Bond notes to make these things easier. It's exchange rate is one to one so one Bond note is one U.S. dollar. Don't worry, you're going to be fine. And we're like - well, we're not particularly stupid.  - But you also can't really do much about this. That's the thing. ANITAAnd then what happened next? Because I heard from people who had like U.S. dollars in the bank, and the government forcibly changed it to Zimbabwean dollar. Do you have any cases or can you say something about that?HUMAN RIGHTS SPEAKER I mean, that's exactly what they did. It happened in a couple of phases. Since 2009 we have been using this multi-currency basket. So my bank account that I had with Standard Chartered, it was an U.S. dollar account. And in October 2018 you woke up one day and they were like, okay, guys: listen, you have a U.S. dollar account, but actually, that's now a RTGS account  - a real-time gross settlement account.Yeah. So literally like even as an organization, it was the same. They converted your U.S. dollar bank account with all you owned into RTGS dollars and told you, if you want, you could open an U.S. dollar account. But you have to put new money inside this account, because the other one is now RTGS dollar - the exchange rate is one to one - but you can’t have that money.To give you an example of how broken the banking system is: At the time, we as an organization, we were banking with CABS - don't bank with CABS. CABS is a bank, Central African Building Society. We had all of our money inside of the bank and remember, you can't get cash. So let’s say we owe an Austrian company that is working for us here in Zimbabwe 1,000 USD. We can't get money out of the bank, so we have to somehow transfer it digitally to the company in Austria. The company in Austria has maybe an U.S. nostro FCA account here in Zimbabwe, but with a different bank - not with CABS - so there's no nostro to nostro relationship. HUMAN RIGHTS SPEAKERBut the Austrian company’s bank maybe has a corresponding bank in New York. But CABS doesn't have an U.S. dollar corresponding bank. So CABS has to find the euros to convert our money to send it to Austria - to move it to New York, so that they can go back to South Africa, so that it can get converted to U.S. dollars. So that the Austrian company's bank account here can get it. It was mad. It was like literally  - like we paid one bill that - I think the bill was $73 and the bank charges were $45  - it was just insane. That went on for a year or so.But then in February 2019, you woke up again. And they're like, okay, okay, no, no. You're right. The exchange rate is not one to one. Actually, it has taken us a while, we were a little bit slow. But don't worry, it's now one to 2.5. We're going to have an interbank exchange rate. So now, you could move your U.S. dollars into RTGS at the bank rate, but when you would actually go to the bank, they would just look at you like, that's so silly - you can't actually do that. Like we don't have money. So you couldn't actually do it, but they acted like you could. That was a long time. And then they introduced the statutory instrument in June that said: No more U.S. dollars. You are only allowed to use Zimbabwe dollar only. Only ever, ever. But then you go to a government office and you have to settle a bill and you want to use your local swipe card - and the government office tells you no sorry, we are only taking U.S. dollars or an international credit card. So it was completely absurd, you know?Anita Posch Yeah. And you also have different rates, like in the bank, you have one to 17 or something. And on the street, one to 25. So you get more RTGS on the streets. HUMAN RIGHTS SPEAKERYeah. Because the U.S. dollar is highly valued. Especially with a lot of people or businesses, you know, who need parts or supplies, they can't be imported or paid in RTGS. They need the U.S. dollar. And also, there's a lot of exchange control regulation on the U.S. dollars. So if I'm an NGO, I am legally allowed to trade in U.S. dollars. So we can pay a bill to a local supplier in U.S. dollars. HUMAN RIGHTS SPEAKERThat supplier has to liquidate those U.S. dollars within 30 days, or they get converted into their RTGS account at the bank rate. So and if I'm the local company, and I want to use those U.S. dollars to buy something, I have to prove it - I have to give my invoices - I have to give my justification - I have to ask for permission. And the Reserve Bank may or may not allow me to move those U.S. dollars out of the country. So suppose I'm in solar power and I want to buy 20 panels so that I can sell them. I only have 30 days to spend down on the money that I already had. And the Reserve Bank can take as long as it wants to give me permission to even go and resupply. So, like that's another reason why the U.S. actual physical dollars, the physical cash, has so much more value. So don't, don't put $100 into my bank account for God's sake! Just give me the cash, because the cash I can keep and I can use it whenever I want it compared to the one in my bank account.Anita Posch   Yeah, so that's the main advantage with U.S. dollar cash.HUMAN RIGHTS SPEAKER  Yeah, it's a huge advantage and that's why the premium exists.And now a short word from my sponsors:The Card Wallet is the ideal solution to store your bitcoin keys in the medium and long run. No Software updates needed, it's 100 percent offline, it leaves no traces on the blockchain if you give it away as a gift or inheritance. With the card wallet you'll get one bitcoin address, you can send bitcoin to it, whenever you wish and all you have to do is, to store it in a safe place. That's it. The manufacturers are the Austrian state printinghouse, which is also the producer of Austria's passports and Coinfinity, Austria's first bitcoin broker. Order your card wallet at cardwallet.com/anita and Get 20 percent off.HUMAN RIGHTS SPEAKERSo to answer your question of what percentage of Zimbabwe is banked? Basically almost everybody has to be banked in one or the other way. People have to use EcoCash, because there is no cash on the streets - there is no other way to get or use money. Every small shop on the streets, every vegetable seller uses EcoCash. There was a case. Middle of 2019. Government basically said EcoCash, listen, no more cash out. You can no longer take your EcoCash money and change it for U.S. dollars - we’re done. And EcoCash was like haha, no, sorry. Actually, they filed legal papers to object to that. And in the course of those legal papers you got a sense of like, wow, okay, so this percentage of Zimbabwe's transactions are electronic, so it's huge - like 85 plus percent of Zimbabwe's transactions are electronic, which basically means - that percentage of the economy is somehow banked or has EcoCash. Meaning 85 percent of all transactions are electronically and mobile money is a huge part of that. 99.8 percent of the mobile money is EcoCash. I mean, it's huge.Anita Posch Are there other providers who also have something like EcoCash?HUMAN RIGHTS SPEAKERYes, it is like a mobile wallet. There are two other mobile phone operators. But they are tiny. So again, like when you say like what percent of the economy is banked? It's actually huge because of this pressure. In 2015, maybe it would have been probably less than half. But because suddenly now you have an economy in which there is no cash, the only way I can pay for things is EcoCash or swipe. So even things like Steward bank, which is also Econet, which has really popped up in the last few years, like the queues outside of Steward bank are massive, because they don't have any barrier. Like, I have to walk up with my ID and I can open a bank account. And if I want to exist in this economy, I have to have a bank account. And with EcoCash you don't even have to buy airtime, you do not need a mobile phone package. EcoCash works on your phone frictionless, you only need an ID to register and this even does not have to be your own. From that moment on you can accept payments. Anita Posch And is EcoCash a privately held company? HUMAN RIGHTS SPEAKERYes, it's private. Anita Posch But it's huge, isn't it? It's comparable to M-Pesa? HUMAN RIGHTS SPEAKERYeah, yeah, exactly. Is it basically the same. I mean, you can get money in - from the Diaspora into your EcoCash FCA Foreign Currency Account wallets. So then I can show my relatives on the Diaspora how to put 50 U.S. dollars into my EcoCash FCA wallet. I could then use EcoCash's Bureau de Change to change that money. At the bank rate,Anita Posch Which is not so good. HUMAN RIGHTS SPEAKERNo. Or I could have my relatives send to me over MoneyGram, which I could exchange to cash. Anita Posch    But how much do they take?HUMAN RIGHTS SPEAKERIt depends on how much you're like how much you're changing. Yeah, like I think it's a percentage of, I mean, I'm not saying it's free or cheap but if I don't have anything, it's the possibility. Anita PoschSo, and what happened then in 2016, you get Bond notes, one to one to U.S. dollars.HUMAN RIGHTS SPEAKERYeah. So they kind of floated around for a couple years. But it didn't change. It didn't really change the cash situation at all. Like it didn't suddenly get better. I mean, they literally had like, $2 notes and $5 notes and some coins. Lots of coins, and you still had to go to the bank with cash withdrawal limits. And maybe there wouldn't be any cash that day. And I think it was something like $50 a day and $300 a week. I mean, and they would give it to you in coins, like, oh, here I have $50 in coins. It didn't actually improve the cash situation.Anita Posch So just getting back to EcoCash. I mean, how do people feel about having to use this because actually, it's you have to, you're forced to use it.HUMAN RIGHTS SPEAKER  Yeah, I can't remember maybe last year there was something like, “Oh, this is so great. You know, Zimbabwe is leading the Electronic Frontier like Zimbabwe is revolutionized. We don't even need cash, we are a plastic money society and we are the future!” Yeah, like - we are not stupid.We are more like, this isn't a good thing. This isn't some choice that we've all decided like, Oh, it's so convenient money. Yeah. So what am I gonna do? I'm gonna swipe.Anita Posch  I mean, there's one thing you did here, you really leapfrogged the technology. Because I have seen many, many people with smartphones. I was surprised, actually, that so many people have smartphones. As of November 2017, EcoCash was reported to have 6.7 million registered users, compared with two million conventional bank account holders in the country. It controlled 99.8 percent of the mobile money market in Zimbabwe at the time. During the first six years of existence, the service processed over $23 billion. In 2017, Zimbabwe's Gross Domestic Product was valued at US$7.5 billion. Prices are constantly changing. That is why the menus in restaurants are without prices. Or as you can see on one of my pictures on the episode page, prices are being crossed out and re-written for instance on a packet of potato chips.By the time I record this episode - middle of March 2020 - the street rate is 1:43, while the official rate is still 1:17. This is reflected also in this tweet where someone is writing: “Nobody sane will exchange to the official bank rate, when you get much more Zimdollars on the street. Common sense should tell the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe to float the rate or dollarize. But they won’t do that, because it will stop political elites from LOOTING!”At the same time prices for and at public infrastructures are raised. For instance, the Bulawayo municipal pool. People who know me better know that wherever I spend some time, I am looking for a pool for a swim. So we headed for the public pool. When we got there a bunch of kids stood in front of the ticket office and we thought that there might be a swimming competition. But we were wrong. The reason for them to stay outside was a price rise from 8 to 25 Zimdollar in one day. The children simply couldn't afford that.The rampant inflation makes life for people who own and earn in U.S. dollars easier. Everything gets cheaper - on the backs of people who don’t have access to USD.If something cost 100 Zimbabwe dollars at the beginning of February, it was 4.2 USD; 2.5 weeks later it was 3.3 USD. So - the thing is again, if you are better off and own USD things are getting more affordable - you are better off again. But if you own Zimbabwe dollar only, prices are rising while your wage is in most cases not rising. Anita Posch  From my perspective seeing the living conditions of people, the economic situation, the banking problems, the difficulties to get Bond notes, the hyper-inflation and the currency controls, I would say this is the perfect setting for the use of bitcoin to support the flow of money inside and out of the country as well as to support the community and its people. You are a human rights activist and you know about the properties of bitcoin - being permissionless, transparent, open, non-inflatable, neutral and how it could support sending money in and out of the country circumventing currency controls. How do you estimate the chances for bitcoin adoption in Zimbabwe? HUMAN RIGHTS SpeakerThe main problem for us is exchanging money. It is very difficult and costly. Even converting EcoCash to USD is dodgy. We all know someone who knows someone, who can convert money from one currency or form to another. But we do not use the banks. I assume the problem with bitcoin at the moment is exchanging it to U.S. dollar or the other way round. Because you can not pay your rent or food with bitcoin. So in general - it would be great, but at the moment I do not know how this can work.Anita PoschYes, I interviewed a bitcoin trader here in Zimbabwe, who said that if you own bitcoin you basically own U.S. dollars. Because you will definitely find a person who exchanges it for you. Since cryptocurrency exchanges are outlawed people exchange peer-to-peer in specific WhatsApp or Facebook groups. So if you take on the effort to find those groups, then you can easily exchange bitcoin to USD. HUMAN RIGHTS SPEAKEROh really, that is great. I think it needs a combination of education, reassurance and convenience. As I said, the most important part at the moment would be the exchange possibilities of bitcoin to cash or USD. As long as that's easy, I think the potential and the prospects for bitcoin adoption are pretty high. Anita PoschDo you see other obstacles?HUMAN RIGHTS SPEAKERI guess liquidity and regulation. Because I do not know what the government is doing here aside from obviously blocking Golix, the only bitcoin exchange we had in Zimbabwe.Anita PoschA research paper that I found online - called “The Impact of Cryptocurrencies in Zimbabwe. An Analysis of Bitcoins” written by Anthony Tapiwa Mazikana - says that in 2017 the central bank categorically stated that cryptocurrencies are not welcome in Zimbabwe. The Reserve Bank made it clear that cryptos were endangering the public. In 2018 the RBZ noted that it will be illegal to accept cryptos as collateral, opening accounts of exchanges, dealing with them and transfer or receipt of money in relating to purchase or sale of virtual currencies.Further on the research paper says:The RBZ believed they were “protecting the public” when they banned cryptocurrencies. Around 2018 many people were scammed by a ponzi scheme called MMM. A lot of the guiders made a fair bit of money, with many of them converting their “mavros” - the MMM digital currency - into Bitcoin. With those bitcoin they bought cars from Japan and continued to enjoy their money safely stored in Bitcoin wallets. So - I assume that those people bought the Japanese cars on a website called “beforward,” it is still possible to buy cars with bitcoin there. Because the online entrepreneur I talked with, he said to me that many people exchanged their money into bitcoin over Golix  - to buy cars. I conclude that in the 2017 bitcoin boom many people in Zimbabwe were scammed by MMM or OneCoin and they reported that to the RBZ. And the RBZ used this as a reason to shut down the crypto exchange Golix and to forbid the handling of virtual currencies.Yes, scams are a big problem especially in countries where people are poor, in desperate need of money and have a lack of education because of the circumstances. That is why education to see the differences between bitcoin and scams is so important. Banning cryptocurrencies cannot be the answer. Firstly, because the technology in itself is not scamming or fraudulent, it’s people who use it with intent to defraud others; and secondly, bitcoin cannot be banned because it works permissionless and is decentralized. If you ban it in one country, other countries will not. So globally you will always be able to use it - maybe under the radar.As there are no exchanges in Zimbabwe, people establish groups of trust on social media and exchange peer-to-peer. I believe Satoshi Nakamoto built bitcoin exactly for that purpose. In one of the following episodes I speak with a teacher who is also a digital entrepreneur. She told me about the African philosophy of “Ubuntu” and how the narrative of bitcoin in southern Africa should be shifted from the western narrative of bitcoin as a self-sovereign freedom money to “bitcoin is community money.” In my view, these peer-to-peer groups on social media are exactly an expression of this community support. TEACHERUbuntu basically stands for, I am because you are the health of your community, the health of the people around you will determine your own personal well being. So I'll give you an example of how we greet each other. So when we say good morning, it's typically “Mamukase,” which is just asking, how did you wake up? The response to that is “Tamuka Mamumokau,” which means, we woke up well only if you woke up well. So it's ingrained in our very language. It's, it's basically putting an emphasis on those around you in order to improve your own social standing, your own, your own well being as a person. So I feel like if we shift cryptocurrency for what it stands for aside, there's a one sideways, yeah it's against the system. It's like this activist, it's almost taken on the shade of activism. But if you look at it, then the benefit that I can if I use if I have bitcoin is just choose bitcoin, right? I can send money to my relatives who are in Malawi or in Namibia or in Ghana. Currently I can't with our own currency, I can't send money out freely and quickly. It's usually a bit of a process and you have to get all sorts of approvals. But if cryptocurrency, if bitcoin allows me to quickly take care of the people around me, if we can sit down as a community and say, okay, we need to buy a new borehole for our community because we don't have water, we haven't had water for years and we need a communal borehole; if bitcoin allows us to buy and ship that borehole was they want the equipment or they want to bring it in from America or China or Europe, and we can do that without just by using our phones and not having to go through like, that's an amazing thing. You know, if we look at it from a place of development, if we look at it from a place of helping the community and taking care of each other, [that] allows us to take care of each other without having to create so many barriers and so much red tape to get stuff done with money. I feel like when you change that narrative, you speak to something very deep within an African.”So now we are coming to the end of this episode: All the people I talked with immediately understood the use case of bitcoin in Zimbabwe. But there is another obstacle. Internet use is expensive AND slow. Most of the people in Zimbabwe can not afford to pay for an internet connection. This is one of the reasons why EcoCash is so successful. One does not need to pay for the use upfront and one does not need an internet package to use the mobile money. It is also common to buy a “WhatsApp bundle” or a “Social Media bundle,” which are more affordable than open internet access, which is what you need to install a bitcoin wallet on your phone. Therefore, I suggest solutions, where bitcoin can be used inside those channels. The most used channels are WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram. Twitter and Telegram are available, too, but not used widely. Telegram saw an influx of users while the internet shut down in Zimbabwe at the beginning of 2019, when people realized that they cannot use WhatsApp or facebook anymore but telegram was still working.In the next episode you will hear from two bitcoin and cryptocurrency users in Zimbabwe. They are early adopters who use bitcoin as rails to get paid for freelance work from foreign companies and are also bitcoin traders.If you like my show please subscribe to it in your podcast player and share the episode on social media.

One victim reported losing over £15,000 when they purchased face masks in bulk that were never delivered, echoing behavior in the U.S. from fake merchants.Action Fraud has also received multiple reports about COVID-19 related phishing emails attempting to fool people into opening malicious attachments or revealing sensitive financial information.Elsewhere, a number of government bodies have also issued coronavirus warnings, including the U.S. states of Georgia, Nebraska, Utah and Oregon, plus the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Malta.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Earlier this week, major outlets like Walmart and Amazon said they were struggling to keep up with demand from “panic buyers,” reported CNBC.This increase in preparedness buying is spreading to the crypto sector as well, leading to unprecedented growth for a number of crypto payment processors.  Lolli, a bitcoin rewards application, reports a doubling in sales “from retailers supplying food and essentials such as Safeway and Vitacost,” Aubrey Strobel, the company’s head of communications, said in a direct message.See also: JP Koning – Lightning Solves Bitcoin’s Speed Problem, but Watch Out for Fraudsters“The majority of Lolli's merchants are online. As a result, our sales have dramatically increased over the last couple of weeks as a reaction to the pandemic,” she said. “We expect to see this continue over the next several weeks as people transition to a remote work schedule and prepare for COVID-19.”Safeway, one of Lolli’s partners, operates 894 locations across 17 states including California and Washington, which are developing epicenters for the virus. Lolli, which rewards online customers in satoshis, also has arrangements with restaurant delivery applications Postmates and Caviar, as well as PetSmart, which offers a pet food delivery service. Strike by Zap, a lightning implementation currently running in beta, nearly shut down after its payments increased beyond expectation. Jack Mallers, Zap CEO, said the wallet “crushed its all-time-highs last week,” after processing over a bitcoin’s worth of transactions.It’s a rally all over, from Latin America to South Korea.Mallers said the startup, which launched in late-January, expected to settle about a bitcoin worth of transactions per month. “We were not prepared to do this much volume. I had to make emergency phone calls to our trading counterparties to make sure the app wouldn’t crash,” Mallers said.Strike works by converting and settling bitcoin payments on behalf of merchants, so retail outlets never have to “touch” the asset. This means Strike is “inherently short bitcoin” for every payment made through the app. Using live trading algorithms to keep its exposure flat, Mallers set automatic borrowing limits with its OTC desks to cover these short positions, which when exceeded would block users from completing their transactions. “These are people stocking up, buying gift cards to Walmart and CVS,” Mallers said. He added that the uptick is “contextually related to Coronavirus beyond [market] volatility.” “When bitcoin volatility is to the upside, maybe people increase their spending – people generating wealth have a tendency to spend it –  but the reverse is usually not the case,” he said. Fold, another crypto payments startup with lightning integrations, has experienced inventory issues since February, Will Reeves, Fold CEO, said. “Most of the activity has been focused on prepping,” he said, with many users stocking up on first aid and other supplies on sites like Amazon, Lowes, and Cabela's. He added, “some users have mentioned that the contactless nature of Fold payments versus contaminated physical cash and credit cards has made them feel safer for the first time.”ZenGo, a Tel Aviv-based wallet startup with customers in 70 countries, has also seen record volumes of people buying crypto and using it for remittance, according to chief executive Oriel Ohayon. The increase in users “started early this week,” he said. However, Ohayon isn’t positive this is caused by the coronavirus or is part of a growth trend that began in January. See also: Mass Surveillance Threatens Personal Privacy Amid CoronavirusStill, transactions using the non-custodial wallet surged 300 percent week-over-week, Ohayon said. “We do not know where and how funds are sent, but we have a sense via support [tickets] and others that people use it to store bitcoin and send remittances.” “It’s a rally all over, from South Latin America to South Korea,” Ohayon said. “I think there is a global pattern here.”Sergej Kotliar, CEO of Bitrefill, another popular non-custodial payments channel, said, “it's very hard for us to notice a trend [in panic buying,] especially with any scientific level of evidence.” Other crypto payment rails may also be seeing a boost, though their privacy protecting and distributed attributes make it impossible to determine. Such as Mallers’s other lightning implementation, Zap, which is unable to track transactions.  “A bigger impact to us than people sitting home is the volatility in the bitcoin price,” Kotiar said. A drop in bitcoin price historically leads to a temporary increase in transactions. Though, Kotiar said, if prices remain depressed – after that initial surge in transactions – use of the app will level off.  See also: Makeup Mogul Michelle Phan’s Coronavirus Strategy Is Educate and HODL Bitcoin“People spend significantly less on purchases when bitcoin is low,” he said.  Likewise, BTCPay, a payments processor touted for its secure, private, and censorship-resistant features has likely seen a burst of user activity, but its founders are unable to confirm. “BTCPay is self-hosted software and we don't collect data on users or their transactions,” Pavlenex, a pseudonymous BTCPay contributor, said. While a boon to her startup, Lolli communications director Strobel reminds users, “no one knows how long this pandemic will last and what the micro and macro effects will be.” But “the principles of bitcoin still remain true,” she said. “Nothing about bitcoin has changed.”Note: this story has been updated with additional comment from Will Reeves at Fold.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The cypherpunk movement has expanded far beyond the 2,000 people who subscribed to mailing lists in the 1990s. In 2018, Entrepreneur reported there are more than 8,000 posts on Bitcointalk every day, while Coinbase garnered millions of user accounts. Such experimental technology is no longer the realm of just a few thousand geeks.However, across the board, even in 2020 cypherpunk projects rarely exceed a few dozen regular contributors. For example, Exiledsurfer, an event organizer and hacker space co-founder from the Parallele Polis collective, said his space in Vienna was inspired by a collective in Prague that collects roughly $5,000 a month in cryptocurrency from members to share a venue. Likewise, the Vienna chapter accepts dues in DAI, monero and bitcoin, just to name a few. “We’re a crypto pure organization,” Exiledsurfer said. “This will be an alternative asset class or, in a hundred years, there will by three guys in a garage in Topeka, Kansas, tweaking on a 2020 computer to keep the chain alive, just like people tweak on old cars.”The cypherpunk movement appears to be growing, albeit slowly. “I still get people every week, young people and programmers who say they want to give their lives to this thing,” cypherpunk icon Amir Taaki said, underscoring why he believes the movement will only succeed through groups with “structured” training methods. “There’s a yearning need for this...we can build our own financial networks outside of the control of the state,” Taaki said of the academy he plans to launch in Barcelona. “How do all of these pieces that we’re working on fit together to serve a higher goal? What’s our narrative?” Taaki said. Yet, even as a cypherpunk technology aficionado, Wertheimer disagrees with such collectivist views of “our” narrative or “pure” projects. “I don’t think we need bitcoin evangelists,” Wertheimer said. We’ll talk about why he views the ideological movement as divorced from user groups that may now utilize cypherpunk technology. Want more?

","The Missoula County Board of Commissioners voted unanimously Thursday to extend a measure to reduce the environmental effects of high-energy-consumption mining operations by another year, until April 3, 2021. That followed a consultation period in which 47 members of the public commented in support of the motion, according to a report by the Missoulian Friday. Under its zoning regulations, Missoula County requires all mining operations – drawn to the area because of its cheap electricity – to either purchase or build renewable sources of energy that completely offset the electricity they consume. The measure also restricts mining operations to designated industrial districts. The yearlong extension will provide officials with time to consider making the measure permanent. ""We are continuing to investigate this issue and this zoning and may ultimately propose it as permanent zoning,"" said Jennie Dixon of Missoula's community and planning services.See also: A New York Power Plant Is Mining $50K Worth of Bitcoin a DayThe original measure came after local residents voiced concerns about the power spikes caused by newly arrived mining farms, and was passed as part of a resolution last April that committed the county to operate completely on clean renewable energy by 2030. The requirements don't apply to miners operating before the resolution was passed, so long as they don't then scale up their operations. At the time, one official complained about the ""grotesque amount of energy"" consumed by HyperBlock, a bitcoin mining company that reportedly used as much electricity as a third of all homes in the county. The company complained the measures were aimed at them and risked driving them out of business. Officials denied the measures were intended to target any one business in particular. During a public hearing Thursday, supporters of the measure said crypto mining placed greater demands on the energy grid, making the county dependent on fossil fuels and accelerating climate change. The attorney representing HyperBlock denied the company was ""in any way contributing to climate change in our jurisdiction.""See also: Miners Are Selling More Bitcoin Than They Are MiningCommissioner Dave Strohmaier said the decision on whether to make the motion permanent or not will depend on whether energy demand in 2020 can be met by renewables. It is likely to become permanent if the county has to increase its reliance on fossil fuels, he said.

Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.). It is thought to have little chance of passage at present but, according to lawyers and backers in the industry, it does provide insight into what a top-to-bottom new law governing crypto could look like one day.","Marshall Hayner of Metal Pay and Erik Finman, who became a millionaire from bitcoin (BTC) before the age of 18 and now runs an investment fund, contributed to the discussion draft.Presented on March 9, the “Crypto-currency Act of 2020” sets out to define categories of digital assets and clarify which federal agency will oversee each tranche. “The bill looks to provide not only clarity but legitimacy to crypto assets in the United States,” said Will Stechschulte, Gosar’s legislative assistant, in a press phone call. See also: ‘Youngest Bitcoin Millionaire’ Willing to Stake it All on Metal PayRegulatory uncertainty hangs like a cloud over the industry as it aims to attract conventional investors. Fully 56 percent of financial advisers cite “regulatory concerns” as reason not to invest in the nascent industry, a recent Bitwise survey found.“Regulatory uncertainty has certainly been a shackle around the ankle of U.S. investors,” Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics and a former eToro analyst, said. “Many projects are simply choosing to move elsewhere.” While there are existing proposals aimed at providing clear guidance – such as the Token Taxonomy Act and  Securities and Exchange Commission member Hester Peirce’s “Safe Harbor” proposal – Gosar’s bill is the latest to take a holistic approach to crypto regulation.  ‘It’s difficult for a member to move a bill in a committee of which he’s not a member, doubly so if he’s in the minority,’ Brito wrote in a blog post.The bill divides digital assets into three categories: crypto-commodity, crypto-currency and crypto-security with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Secretary of the Treasury via the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) overseeing each, respectively. “While the bill makes sense on the surface,” a deeper look reveals that its neat categorizations are potentially fatal flaws, said Lawson Baker, head of operations and general counsel at TokenSoft. A Bloomberg legal analyst said much the same, claiming an early draft of the bill “displays a lack of basic understanding of the relevant federal laws and regulatory agencies.”Debate over the bill’s efficacy and overreach started in mid-December, when a draft version leaked. Jerry Brito, executive director of Coin Center, directed criticism at the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Gosar, who does not sit on the committees that might discuss his bill. “It’s difficult for a member to move a bill in a committee of which he’s not a member, doubly so if he’s in the minority,” Brito wrote in a blog post. He now says the bill should be opposed on principle, if it shows any signs of life.“It’s dead on arrival,” Kristin Smith of the Blockchain Association, said after reviewing the latest version. Following its introduction on the floor late Monday afternoon, Ben Goldey, Gosar’s representative, said the bill will now pass to a committee for review. “Usually within the first week it will get assigned, but I suspect Financial Services [Committee,]” will take it up, Goldey said. Finman suggested it may be reviewed first by the House Committee on Agriculture.It’s dead on arrival.Whether the bill passes or not, its sweeping ambition is already redefining the scope of crypto regulation. Attempting to simplify the issues around cryptocurrency and its relationship to the larger economy, the bill is an example of why it’s so hard to define what crypto is and how it should be treated. CoinDesk spoke with lawyers, investors and the bill’s writers about how the bill takes on crypto’s big regulatory issues and likely goes too far.Gosar’s bill defines crypto-commodities as an “economic good or service, including derivatives that have full or substantial fungibility; the markets treat with no regard as to who produced [them;] and rest on a blockchain or decentralized cryptographical ledger.” This broadly defined concept would include bitcoin, ethereum, and any digital asset with free-floating valuations. The bill would also place these commodities under the purview of the CFTC. However, as Robert Kim, a Bloomberg legal analyst noted: the CFTC does not regulate commodities themselves, but derivatives traded off them. “The CFTC indicated early on that virtual currencies, such as bitcoin are commodities under the Commodity Exchange Act. However, that does not mean they regulate the day-to-day activity of spot exchanges,” said Donna Redel, board member of New York Angels and a professor at Fordham Law and Fordham Gabelli School, said. “Do they have the capacity to review that? The regulators themselves would have to see what’s feasible here.”See also: Lawmakers Reintroduce Bill to Exempt Crypto Tokens From US Securities LawsSimilarly, FinCEN was selected to oversee “crypto-currencies,” despite not actually regulating currency. Marshall Hayner of Metal Pay thinks that’s a pedantic statement. “When you launch a crypto product and deal with stablecoins, you're dealing with FinCEN,” he said in a phone call. “Anti-money laundering requirements are top of mind for any firm that wants to remain compliant.” Lawson Baker, head of operations and general counsel at TokenSoft, a technology company automating finance by porting financial assets onto blockchains, noted that the definition given to “crypto-securities” by the bill does not capture real-world use cases of blockchain technology. The proposed definition: ""all debt and equity that rest on a blockchain or decentralized cryptographic ledger,” makes sense in some contexts, Baker said, but in reference to traditional assets misses the mark. For example, there's mortgage debt that could be issued on a blockchain. “Under [the bill’s] rules, a tokenized mortgage would be a ‘crypto-security’ requiring registration with the SEC absent an offering exemption,” Baker said. “As we all know, mortgages are already regulated by state and federal banking laws and not the SEC.” My gut says we should stay nimble right now and define later. Read: push regulators to provide rule updates or additional guidance.Likewise, Redel pointed out that even broad definitions may not allow projects room to breathe. She pointed instead to Hester Peirce’s proposal for a safe harbor for token projects, which grants three years exemption for projects to decentralize. “The digital asset industry is constantly evolving,” Redel said. “Any effort of legislation has to take into account future innovation in the space and what else happens in the coming years. It’s not good to bet on a horse race if you don't know the players.”Under the Act, a ""decentralized cryptographic ledger"" refers to a ""ledger that (A) runs as a stand-alone blockchain that is secured through a minting mechanism."" As Baker notes, “This definition presumes all cryptocurrencies will operate on blockchains and public ledgers, completely ignoring how privacy coins like Zcash will operate in the future.” Mati Greenspan takes a realistic view. While clearer frameworks may bring in entrepreneurs, investors and traditional financiers standing on the sideline of crypto, decisions to invest are also impacted by the larger mechanizations of the economy. “Sentiment is way down due to the effects of the [Corona] virus and most people aren't exactly in an investing mood lately,” Greenspan said. Likewise, Nic Carter, a venture capitalist with Castle Island Ventures, said crypto is “an asset class that’s really just an outlet for gambling.” Adding, these “excesses of crypto [are] definitely a function of our stage in the economic cycle.” Carter adds that clear guidance for tax liabilities are also necessary, which the bill fails to address.What good is an omnibus bill if it cannot pass? What about more focused approaches for that matter?The Token Taxonomy Act was successfully introduced, but was ultimately stalled during the review period. While Erik Finman is confident that his bill will pass, “I’m not even considering failure as an option,” he said, a similar situation is likely to transpire here. “The optimum way to regulate the industry would be for the agencies to come up with a robust set of rules,” Donna Redel said. “This is preferable than the slower process of adjudicating and then waiting for the agencies to catch up. But the courts will, hopefully, always be there to provide guidance.”While this process is slow, and companies may lose time and competition, Redel is skeptical that any prescriptive law could cover all the facets of the industry. Josh Lawler, a partner at Zuber Lawler, agreed. “Looking at various statutory schemes, most don't work. The Swiss system doesn't work, really. Some are better than others, but it's not that easy to get a comprehensive plan.”“My gut says we should stay nimble right now and define later. Read: push regulators to provide rule updates or additional guidance under current definitions rather than unintentionally redefine the scope of an agency's regulatory jurisdiction,” Lawson Baker said.

interest rates for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) deposits on April 1, ...","Mar 17, 2020 at 18:48 UTC","An increase in borrower demand is driving crypto lender BlockFi to raise interest rates for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) deposits on April 1, said CEO Zac Prince.","The second-largest price drop in bitcoin’s history last Thursday created a gulf between prices on the bitcoin futures and spot markets. In the following days, BlockFi saw a 10x increase on the trading side of the house, and a surge in loan demand from its two largest client pools: market makers and proprietary trading firms.Institutional borrowing across all assets made up for a decrease in retail U.S. dollar borrowing, and BlockFi saw a record number of transactions as traders took advantage of arbitrage opportunities. In the past, the crypto lender has had to cut rates because borrower supply had not met depositor demand. Since Thursday, BlockFi has seen a slowdown in net deposit growth to roughly 0 percent but not an outright decrease.Next month, Tier 1 BTC holders (those who keep up to five BTC on BlockFi) will earn 6 percent annual percentage yield (APY) and Tier 1 ETH holders (up to 500 ETH) will earn 4.5 percent APY. Currently, Tier 1 BTC holders and Tier 1 ETH holders earn 4.9 percent and 3.6 percent APY, respectively.Rates for the GUSD and USDC stablecoins will stay the same at 8.6 percent APY. The higher rates on deposits stem from the firm’s ability to increase interest rates on crypto lending, Prince said. A week ago, BlockFi had interest rates on loans in the mid-single digits. The firm is now charging rates in the ballpark of 10 percent, Prince added. By contrast, crypto lender Celsius has raised interest rates on ETH loans to an astounding 260 percent from the 15 to 20 percent under normal circumstances. While not revealing the number or volume of margin calls BlockFi made during the crash, Prince said that the firm had to request less additional collateral than rival firms Genesis and Celsius. Last Friday, CoinDesk reported Genesis alone had called in $100 million in additional crypto from about 40 clients.Read more: $100M+ in Margin Calls: Crypto Lenders Demand Collateral as Market Buckles“It could be due to the construction of the [loan] book,” Prince said. “For example, we have no loans with bitcoin miners at BlockFi. … Hut 8 was a public mining operation company that was talking about their margin call with Genesis.”Prince also said no changes would be made to BlockFi’s underwriting standards.BlockFi did see less than 10 percent of liquidations in its dollar-denominated loan book. These liquidations happened prior to bitcoin’s dip below $4,500, Prince said, and were a result of the firm’s risk management system which manages margin calls, liquidations and monitoring of liquidity on the market. The BlockFi team, which is currently working remotely, monitors and controls the system on a day-to-day basis. “It is a tough time from the sentiment perspective,” Prince said. “Take crypto out of the picture, the fear level and things people are going to go through over the next few days, weeks and months is very challenging.” The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Instead of jaunting up to ...","Mar 9, 2020 at 21:23 UTC",Human frailty knows no bounds – even the virtual ones.,"I attended a virtual reality meetup hosted by bitcoin advocate Udi Wertheimer on Sunday for the MIT Bitcoin Expo. Instead of jaunting up to Cambridge, Mass., for the afternoon, I donned virtual goggles in Southern California to enter the world of “non-deterministic bitcoin scripts” and other cypherpunk conversations.And despite all the coronavirus-fueled excitement around virtual gatherings being a viable alternative to germ-swapping IRL events, I still got sick. Still, my foe was much more mundane: motion sickness.“Kudos to all you brave souls who are still here in meatspace,” said Casa Chief Technology Officer Jameson Lopp as he opened his talk, addressing the sparse physical crowd at MIT. Truthfully, it's pretty cool that you can roam a tech conference from the comfort (and safety) of your own home. To date, some 45 tech-related conferences have been canceled, postponed or moved to online platforms. That’s a lot for a distributed industry that has long relied on hackathons and meetups for forward progress.Wertheimer’s VR experience ran on Mozilla Hubs. A fairly buggy platform compared to others such as VRChat – which hosted a four-hour VR “afterparty” for the MIT Expo. My experience was, I’d say, closer to Harry Potter’s Azkaban prison than San Francisco’s (now-postponed) Bitcoin 2020.Mozilla Hubs can run on two platforms: desktop or VR goggles. At first, I logged on to the desktop version I had become familiar with in the week prior for fun. Here’s a picture of me as a donut at the Parthenon:It’s important to note Hubs’ current status as more of a proof-of-concept than full VR simulation, especially on desktop alone.You can move about, talk to attendees and even teleport, but it still lags severely and crashes after about two-dozen people join the virtual room. The VR group I joined does not plan on using the platform again (although Mozilla is marketing the product to event organizers like SXSW).“When Jameson joined we had some severe audio problems, he could hear only some of the people so it was a bit of a mess. Still lots of fun though,” Wertheimer told CoinDesk.After lobbying my editor, I purchased an Oculus Go for the event, the cheapest headset you can get on Amazon. (At about $150 on Amazon Prime, it has never been cheaper to distance yourself from reality.)Linking my Oculus with Hubs, I re-entered into the MIT Expo hall. Or rather, under it by about 60 feet:No, being virtually buried alive is not quite as suffocating as dwelling in the dirt, but it wasn’t enjoyable either.I felt quite trapped beneath the virtual tent and its 30-some avatar guests. More still, I was incapable of moving. My controller worked whenever I exited the Expo to pick a new avatar character, but was worthless inside the event itself. I was left spinning around my apartment looking for some virtual buttons to click. This, in turn, was greeted by lagging images of a mountain backdrop and distant echoes of a conversation about bitcoin scripting language.Health experts caution that COVID-19 is asymptomatic until an acute turning point, wherein hospitalization is generally required. My experience with VR bears similar warning. Unexpectedly, nausea set in some 30 minutes into the Expo. Nonetheless, I was determined to carry on. My resolve did not last.Perhaps the digital world is more weighty than the physical. I abandoned the VR world for the comforts of meatspace after multiple (failed) attempts at moving toward the tent entrance.Like bitcoin, VR isn’t ready for the big stage quite yet. It may never be.The limitations of VR are still quite tangible. Clunky and expensive hardware is met with underdeveloped software infamous for making users disoriented and seasick. For one, I’m glad vomit doesn’t transfer to the digital realm.Most VR applications such as VRChat cannot handle more than a few hundred attendees without crashing. Mozilla Hubs can only run about 30 people before sending applicants into the digital abyss. There’s also that little voice in the back of your head wondering if what you are doing is entirely normal.“Not all VR experiences are equal. In particular, the platform we used on Sunday appeared to have performance issues once we maxed out the number of people who were allowed to join the virtual space,” Lopp told CoinDesk via email. “In general, though, some platforms enable interesting functions that you wouldn't be able to do in real life.”Silver linings certainly exist in the VR clouds. Wertheimer said participants felt more comfortable addressing conference speakers in one-on-one conversation. Privacy-minded attendees, who often do not attend real conferences, happily showed up under pseudonyms.“Having the person next to you nodding, explaining things with their hands, looking at what you’re describing. It sounds simple but it makes the interaction feel a lot more ‘human’ than most online interactions,” Wertheimer told CoinDesk.Like bitcoin, expect VR innovations to grow in stature as the list of nixed conferences continues to lengthen. Regardless of its defects, VR remains an attractive way to make the tent bigger for crypto. Clearly, nausea beats the flu any day of the week.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

","Markets in the U.S. are beginning to show signs of life thanks to the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing plus the recently enacted $2 trillion U.S. stimulus package. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 23 percent and the S&P 500 index has gained around 20 percent from their respective March 23 bottoms. Yet, a conclusion to the wide-reaching COVID-19 pandemic is far from over.Australia's equity benchmark ASX 200 index is off by 31 percent and Japan's Nikkei 225  has lost 21 percent  from their February highs as the COVID-19 outbreak went from bad to worse over a month ago.Government measures in Australia got a whole lot more stringent overnight. The country's prime minister announced gatherings were to be restricted even further to a maximum of two people in order to slow the spread of COVID-19 from within its borders. The unprecedented measure were agreed to by the newly created ""national cabinet,"" comprised of the premiers of all the states and territories plus the prime minister and convened to coordinate a battle plan against the virus. So far, the ASX has been slow to react. The index is up by about 2.3 percent on the day. However, pressure toward the downside is apparent. Gains may require significant positive day-on-day returns over the course of this week if they are to signal confidence in the country's latest measures.Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Hong Kong-based blockchain investment and trading firm Kenetic, said that despite the turmoil the ""corona moment"" would be the moment we learned to be truly digital.""While all market signs point to a long and lean winter, the silver lining is that remote working and especially socializing is clearly the catalyst to mainstream the digital experience,"" Chu said.""From church services to dance parties, group meditation to infant play groups, the digital experience is normalizing for all sectors of society. This experimental phase, driven by a survival instinct, is fundamentally ushering the masses to the ""digital-first"" future,"" Chu added.In commodities, oil is trading at lows not seen since February 2002. Gold is down half a percent from March 27's close and is showing signs of extreme volatility amid the uncertainty, currently changing hands for around $1,616 per troy ounce.Bitcoin prices' resistance near $6,900 is presenting a significant hurdle for the world's bellwether cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency suffered continual losses last week, with prices down $1,000 from that local peak. Bitcoin is currently changing hands for around $5,900.Further, two long-term moving averages (MAs), the 200-day and 100-day, are beginning to converge once more. That indicates the potential for a deeper drawdown from Feb. 13's high of around $10,500, reflecting sentiment on current global market conditions.The last time these two MAs crossed was back in November 2019, when prices fell nearly a quarter to a local bottom of around $6,425 from $8,500.Elsewhere in crypto, XRP is down 3.6 percent over the weekend. Ether (ETH) is currently trading 4.1 percent lower than March 27's close of around $131. Global financial sentiment will need to continue to improve significantly in the coming week if there is any real chance of staving off a deeper recession. In the past week, almost all markets have suffered daily lower highs, taken by technical traders to be a negative signal.With coronavirus-related updates changing daily at a rapid pace, a conclusion to the uncertainty and fear in markets may be far from over.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

56,www.coindesk.com,1 month ago,Crypto Prepped Before Coronavirus Went Global,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-prepped-before-coronavirus-went-global,"“Bitcoiners don't seem fazed much,” said Christian Langalis, who works for 
Urbit but gained prominence as Bitcoin Sign Guy.","Mar 13, 2020 at 19:18 UTC","Market meltdowns, a failure of leadership at both the state and corporate level and a disruption to human civility are all built into the crypto mindset following the recession of 2007-2008. It explains why the relatively small enclave of Crypto Twitter was weeks ahead of the global pandemic, with crypto’s thought leaders urging people to prepare for the worst. ","Now that the worst is here, these harbingers of doom feel vindicated. “The word you're looking for to describe those tech Twitter personalities who you spent the last month mocking and who have been proven right on CV-19 is ‘Cassandra,’” Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures and lover of the classics, tweeted yesterday. Once-trusted sources of information, from media to presidents and prime ministers as well as international health organizations, have all failed in preparing the world for Coronavirus. And now, the call to “decentralize or die” has never taken on a more literal meaning. “Most companies in the [crypto] space have become relatively quicker to react and prepare for the virus than some other industries,” said Anil Lulla, a founder of Delphi Digital, said in a direct message. Twitter, crypto’s public square, has helped reinforce the need for decisive action ahead of the pandemic, with prominent voices like Ryan Selkis of Messari sounding the alarm early and often. Selkis wrote on Feb 8 about why the virus could be a big deal, and set company work from home policies March 3, well before most businesses, crypto or otherwise, had taken that step. To some extent, this skepticism of centralized systems has better prepared crypto firms and proponents for what lies ahead. Despite the anxiety rampant on social media, when queried individuals in the crypto sphere are treating the coronavirus pandemic as a “Life Changes! Be Ready” event. See also: How to Survive the Coronavirus and Keep Your Startup Alive“Bitcoiners don’t seem fazed much,” said Christian Langalis, who works for Urbit but gained prominence as Bitcoin Sign Guy. The preparedness mindset and crypto have long had close ideological associations, said John Ramey, former Innovation Adviser to the Obama White House and founder of The Prepared, a site with a full-on guide to getting ready for the worst. The Prepared is a likely onramp for people looking for information on how to wait-out a crisis. “People drawn to crypto don’t believe in central government fiat currencies, and recognize the risks in our institutions and systems,” he said. “That spirit is alive in the preparedness community. It’s two sides of the same coin.”Ramey has a three-point set of guidelines to prepare for any contingency. First, and most important, is for people to get their personal finances in order. Stocking up on food and essential goods and learning how to medicate yourself are secondary and tertiary (though still essential) concerns. That spirit is alive in the preparedness community. It’s two sides of the same coin.“Even if you have to move quickly in an acute event, there is value in keeping cash aside if you have a choice to do so,” Ramey said. “You have to be ready for the cascading economic effects.” Personal finance is a key concern for coiners; in fact, it’s the bedrock of the industry. “What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party,” Satoshi, bitcoin’s unknown creator, said when introducing the idea of the first trustless digital currency. Norwegian bitcoiner Hodlonaut said, “I have done very little really [to prepare for the coronavirus.] Norwegian society is pretty robust, it’s hard to see that food supply will become an issue and we have very high quality tap water in unlimited supply.”See also: Bitcoiners Are Biohacking a DIY Coronavirus Vaccine“I just hodl my bitcoin (BTC) like always,” he added.Likewise, Ramey said that people rushing out to buy toilet paper and hand sanitizers “aren’t preparing, they’re reacting.”“People can come into preparedness from different angles, but it all boils down to understanding the world is fragile and the responsibility is on you,” Ramey said. Hector Rosekrans, client advisor for bitcoin software firm Casa, is building systems that allow people to maintain control over their money in times of financial crisis. “While COVID-19 can impact operations at centralized custodians, self custody is not impacted,” he said. “With certain multisig setups you can safely keep a key at home, without risk losing funds in a physical attack.”Concentration risk is something Anil Lulla is facing head on, as he lives with two of his Delphi Digital business partners. “Our apartment has severe concentration risk as far as our business goes,” he said. “We're all trying to social distance from other people to the best of our abilities and have stocked up on a month of food supplies as well as medicine.” He also said they’re taking measures to self-medicate in the event one of them gets sick, to not take up hospital space or medical attention that could better serve someone else.Likewise, Amber Baldet, CEO of Clovyr, said she’s taking precautions to limit the spread of the coronavirus in her Brooklyn, NY community. “I work with financial risk, and my family works with technical risk. We’re generally risk-averse people,” she said. As a young and healthy adult she said she will likely be spared the worst of the coronavirus’ effects, though she’s staying home and cancelling a trip to New York in order to mitigate the spread of the virus. See also: Bitcoiners in Europe Reflect on Economic Shocks as Coronavirus SpreadsMany, like Jake Chervinsky, counsel for decentralized finance startup Compound, have seen little disruption to their daily habits – except more frequent handwashing.“Luckily, I often work from home since our office is in [San Francisco] and I'm based in [Washington] D.C.,” Chervinksy said. “I wouldn't say I'm exactly self-quarantining at this point, but I'm prepared to do so if necessary.”Compound instituted a ""remote-encouraged"" policy and has begun cancelling non-essential in-person meetings this week, he said.The phrase “flattening the curve” has also had viral spread. The idea is to slow transmission rates through quarantining and social distancing, Ramey said, thereby limiting the chance the healthcare system gets overloaded. “I’ve been self-quarantined for basically a week [and] told everyone I knew to stock up over a month ago,” Nic Carter said over Telegram. “The U.S. is on a trajectory to become Lombardy/Wuhan within a couple weeks so it’ll happen regardless.”Still, Carter questions the assumption that the economy’s health should come before public health, as some in traditional finance have been arguing. “The economy is downstream from the virus, which could kill millions – a down economy probably wouldn’t.” Carter thinks the virus is a ""black swan"" event that was due to disrupt debt-bloated markets, probably for the better. It’s what attracted him to the currency in the first place. “Bitcoin’s primary critique is against phony markets,” Christian Langalis said. “That it was a virus which served as the pin seems fitting given our highly internationalized economy.”“When one blows up spectacularly, it really just confirms the thesis,” he said. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Bitcoin (BTC) is down 21 percent and ether (ETH) is down 27 percent over the past 24 hours. That's more than the traditional markets, with the Standard & Poor's 500 down nearly 8 percent at 2:45 p.m. ET (1845 UTC).“It's apocalyptic out there. Traditional safe havens like gold are down,” said Rupert Douglas, head of Business Development, Institutional Sales at Koine. Traders liquidating holdings on crypto’s bellwether derivatives exchange, BitMEX, fueled some of these moves. Gold also got hit as traders sold the yellow metal for the safety of much-needed cash as losses mounted in equities. “This downward pressure caused crypto markets to suffer a liquidity crunch as the cost of capital spiked up across trading venues,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Bequant, a London-based digital asset firm. “This tightening was exacerbated by the fact that the market is highly dominated by sell-side liquidity providers/market-making firms, with only a limited buy-side demand,” he added.Over $700 million of XBTUSD liquidations have occurred on BitMEX during the past 24 hours, the second-highest daily total in a year. “Liquidations to satisfy margin calls. This is the worst-case scenario,” said Jason Lu, a cryptocurrency over-the-counter trader based in Asia. For a brief time, Lu noted, BitMEX’s perpetual contract XBTUSD traded at a discount to bitcoin prices on spot exchanges like Coinbase. For an increasing number of investors, the haven in crisis times seems to be cash, not cryptocurrency or gold. A recent survey conducted by iTrustCapital, a firm that offers cryptocurrency investments in retirement accounts, highlights how safe-haven tendencies have changed since the end of last month.Those answering “cash in a mattress” as a safe haven jumped from 18 percent of respondents in February to almost 27 percent by March 11. “Gold” as an answer fell from 37 percent to 33 percent during that same period. The survey was conducted before gold’s 3 percent drop on Thursday.While many cryptocurrency advocates have long likened bitcoin to gold as the ultimate financial haven (“digital gold” is an oft-used phrase), in these times the markets are saying otherwise.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

But we haven’t seen that in this crisis because of the coronavirus,” said Fadi Aboualfa, managing director of the MEES energy newsletter.There are rumors of Iranian efforts to use cryptocurrency to circumnavigate sanctions, potentially with deals related to commodities or oil markets. So far, Russia, China and Iran have been among the most proactive nations exploring the cryptocurrency space. Even as a top oil-producing country, Russia has historically been the odd man out of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), dominated by Saudi Arabia.These days, among cryptocurrency fans in both Russia and China, the current sentiment is outright defiance.“Big crypto mining pools are rejecting Iranian miners because of sanctions,” said Mikhael Jerlis, CEO of the Russian EMCD.IO mining pool. “We don't give a damn about sanctions. If we get sanctioned we’d just shut down the company and open a new one.”Over the past three years, Saudi Arabia’s oil supply routes have increasingly come under fire. The kingdom’s hold on the shipping routes around Yemen started slipping, thanks to Iran-backed Houthi rebels conquering the most strategic parts of Yemen. It’s no wonder why, as oil markets fluctuate, the crypto-savvy alliance of China, Russia and Iran is growing impatient with U.S. sanctions and petro-dollar allies like Saudi Arabia.“The dollar has weakened, mostly because China has been selling dollars quite liberally … in order to keep its own currency more or less stable,” said economist Daniel Lacalle. “I think there’s a part of it, in the energy markets, that is related to the tensions between Saudi Arabia and Russia.”When it comes to the prospect of using bitcoin (BTC) instead of U.S. dollars in energy markets, there are many factors beyond banking sanctions.Compared to energy markets, bitcoin is perhaps the least correlated asset on the global economic chessboard. Bitcoin’s current price of roughly $7,900 is almost double the price at this time last year, despite market slumps sparked by the coronavirus epidemic.On the other hand, market conditions may complicate the compliance risks associated with bitcoin. “You could argue they [gold and the dollar] are inversely correlated,” Aboualfa said. “That could be an indication of how bitcoin will be impacted if it’s deemed to be a store-of-value asset class.”However, he added, most OPEC players view bitcoin as a “sanctions play,” not a store of value.It’s unclear what role cryptocurrency will play in future markets, as both the least-correlated asset class and a political pawn in the sanctions rivalry. It might raise questions related to compliance on the tangible end of any significant trade, rather than the payment rails themselves.Meanwhile, from the perspective of an anonymous bitcoin trader in Saudi Arabia, the U.S.-Saudi bloc of this conflict appears to be ignoring cryptocurrency as a tool for global trades.“Barely anyone is talking about it,” he said of the kingdom these days.With regards to the oil market rivalry, he added: “Everyone’s on standby to see the impact … it’s about who can hold their breath the longest.”Meanwhile, energy experts say incumbents are complacent about the dominance of the U.S. dollar in oil markets while others may try to force change.“China and Russia are already trying to move away from the petro-dollar contracts,” Aboualfa said. “But the U.S. [Navy] could just stop any ship that tries to import Iranian crude. It’s not really a monetary thing.”Anna Baydakova contributed reporting.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In February of last year the company infamously filed the first proposal for an ETF made up of a mix of currencies including bitcoin, only to pull the fund at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s request the next day. Currently, the company only offers bitcoin-related funds to accredited investors.Low volatility is the San Diego-based asset manager’s target for its multi-strategy fund, which hit its one-year anniversary this month. With volatility of 24.5 percent compared to bitcoin’s 74 percent, Blockforce claims its fund has a third of the volatility of the cryptocurrency, capturing 86 percent of the upside of bitcoin and 12.5 percent of the downside. The fund’s goal is to capture more than 80 percent of bitcoin’s returns with about 40 percent of bitcoin’s losses. It’s supposed to “give people something they can invest in without all the stomach acid of a direct cryptocurrency investment,” Blockforce CEO Eric Ervin said.Forty percent of the fund is based on systematic strategies based on long-term and short-term trends in a mix of large-cap cryptocurrencies: bitcoin, bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC), ether (ETH), XRP and Binance coin (BNB). (This 40 percent is heavily weighted toward bitcoin, Ervin said.) Twenty percent of the fund is based on a mix of these large-cap crypto assets in general, and the rest is based on stablecoin lending. The upside performance of the fund has improved significantly since last year, the company noted. In the first four months of the fund’s operations in 2019, the fund only increased by 32 percent while bitcoin rose more than 180 percent. From July to December, the fund only dropped 16 percent while bitcoin fell by 33 percent.“One thing to keep in mind when evaluating performance throughout 2019 was the erratic nature of returns,” Ervin said in the note, adding:“In November, after a portfolio management team change, we significantly reduced the complexity of the models, we slowed down some of the signals and focused our research efforts on optimizing for trade frictions as well as identifying high-probability trends to confirm either up, down or sideways markets. These model updates went live in December and we have been very pleased with the results since that time.”The company will continue to add updates to its “research in pain pattern recognition, predictive signals for correlation breakdowns and some other areas.”Blockforce’s thesis, Ervin wrote, is the firm “will generate the bulk of [its] alpha through downside risk mitigation, portfolio overweights and underweights and the tactical use of digital asset lending in the portfolio.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

That’s the lowest figure in at least 18 months, which is when crypto derivatives research firm Skew began tracking BitMEX’s data. A perpetual contract resembles a futures contract as it offers high leverage and is a margin-based product. However, there is no expiry or settlement and thus it trades close to the underlying reference index price. The exchange uses the term ""open value"" for open interest in its perpetual contracts when measured in bitcoin terms.Open interest in XBT/USD on BitMEX has crashed by over 50 percent from 115,000 BTC to 55,000 BTC over the past 12 days. Activity has cooled significantly following bitcoin’s sudden drop from around $7,300 to $3,867 during a 16-hour period from 10: 00 UTC on March 12 to 02:00 UTC on March 13. “Markets in general – both traditional and cryptocurrency – have seen volumes hit as traders figure their way through the uncharted waters of recent weeks. Open interest on the BitMEX XBTUSD market, which remains the most liquid globally, has been impacted in line with what we have seen across the entire market,"" Greg Dwyer, head of business development at BitMEX told CoinDesk. “Open interest is falling because the market is full of uncertainty,” Ben Zhou, CEO of Bybit, told CoinDesk. “Traders in all fields, whether traditional or crypto, are simply unsure of where the market is going. Therefore they are being cautious and want to sit on the sideline to observe the market, until a clear entry signal appears."" See also: Bitcoin’s Approaching ‘Halving,’ ExplainedWhile the market sentiment was bearish to begin with, the downside move was exaggerated by forced liquidations of long positions on BitMEX. The “long squeeze” reportedly occurred between 02:16 and 02:40 UTC on March 13, when the exchange was down for maintenance. During that time, bitcoin’s price volatility spiked with prices dropping to $3,867 for just five minutes before quickly recovering above $4,000.Open interest is falling because the market is full of uncertainty.As a result, some in the crypto community suggested possible price manipulation on BitMEX. Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of Alameda Research and BitMEX’s rival exchange FTX, published multiple tweets, wondering out loud if there really were hardware issues, and saying the exchange’s unwillingness to address the market situation promoted the price slide. BitMEX dismissed Bankman-Fried’s argument as a conspiracy theory. However, the controversy seems to have led to a slowdown in the activity, as represented by the drop in open interest. While open interest has declined from $1.2 billion to $500 million on BitMEX since the big long squeeze, it has skyrocketed for their rivals. On FTX, open interest has increased from $68 million to $128 million in the past 12 days. Similarly, for Bybit it has risen from $35 million on March 14 to $100 million on March 22. Nonetheless, overall activity has slowed significantly across the globe over the past five weeks.  “Markets in general – both traditional and cryptocurrency – have seen volumes hit as traders figure their way through the uncharted waters of recent weeks. Open interest on the BitMEX XBTUSD market, which remains the most liquid globally, has been impacted in line with what we have seen across the entire market.,” Aggregate open interest has declined by 50 percent from highs witnessed in mid-February, Skew’s CEO Emmanuel Goh told CoinDesk. Global open interest had risen above $5 billion in mid-February when bitcoin’s price was trading near $10,500. At press time, total open positions were around $1.6 billion. Given the decline in the institutional activity, bitcoin's recent recovery rally looks to have been driven by the spot market, which is mainly dominated by long-term holders and retail traders. See also: Bitcoin and Gold: Evaluating Hard-Cap Currencies in Times of Financial CrisisInvestors accumulated coins below $5,000 earlier this month, according to an  indicator called “hodler net position change,” tracked by data firm Glassnode.The indicator stayed in the positive territory during the recent price slide, a sign net new positions were accumulated by investors (nicknamed “HODLers” by the crypto community). In the past, significant quantities were cashed out during bull markets of bitcoin, and net new positions were accumulated by HODLers in bear phases, according to Adamant Capital.

Prates is a lawyer at the Central Bank of Brazil and holds a doctorate from Duke University School of Law. The views expressed here are his own and do not reflect the position or policy of any of the institutions with which he is affiliated. ,"In times of crisis and radical uncertainty, the search for alternatives that can improve everyday life intensifies. The Bitcoin project was launched in October 2008, just six weeks after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and the financial crisis went from bad to dreadful. Since then, many other private cryptocurrencies have sprung up, and even central banks have began contemplating digital currencies of their own. None of these digital currencies became widely available or adopted, though.The coronavirus pandemic and its severe social, political and economic repercussions give digital currencies one more chance to shine. Unlike cash, digital currencies would not be a potential source of virus transmission or require persons to overlook social distancing when making payments. A central-bank digital currency (CBDC) available to the public could, moreover, allow the government to send money directly to the population as part of a stimulus plan without having to mail checks.But can digital currencies, private or public, finally deliver on their promises and change money for the better? It does not seem so.First, cryptocurrencies are an elitist type of money. Bitcoin (BTC), the reigning cryptocurrency until these days, may be attractive to the tech savvy and wealthy, but fails to meet the needs of people fighting for survival. As bitcoin enthusiast Peter McCormack reports from a recent visit to Venezuela, the persons who could benefit the most from bitcoin cannot use it. The poor and the less educated, who rely on cash and are the most affected by surging inflation, don’t have regular access to smartphones, connectivity or even electricity.See also: 4 Reasons Central Banks Should Launch Retail Digital CurrenciesHere lies a lesson for central banks. If they plan to issue a digital currency that can be used by banks and the public alike, they’ll need to adopt an all-or-nothing approach. Either everyone – no matter how poor, uneducated or old they may be – will have full access to the CBDC or it isn’t ready for launch.Instability is the second reason why cryptocurrencies still fall short of revolutionizing money. Even if people from a country facing monetary disarray could flight for bitcoin to seek protection against hyperinflation, they would continue to face price instability. During the coronavirus outbreaks, bitcoin lost half its value in dollars in a matter of weeks – not what is expected from “digital gold.” As usual, liquidity and safety were only found in U.S. bonds and dollars.So, the issuer or the people behind the currency still matter. Facing doomsday scenarios, both sophisticated investors in Tokyo and regular people in Harare trust the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve above all. Does that mean governments are more reliable than private money issuers? Not necessarily.Bank deposits are the closest we have to a digital sovereign currency – and they’re privately issued.As Argentinians and Brazilians can tell, some governments will not think twice before freezing bank accounts and limiting withdrawals during a crisis. Imagine what they could do with a CBDC! More than that, about nine in 10 dollars in circulation are already created by private parties: commercial banks. Bank deposits are the closest we have to a digital sovereign currency – and they’re privately issued.To be sure, as Cornell law professors Robert Hockett and Saule Omarova well underscore, the modern financial system is a public-private partnership, in which a sovereign government takes a privately issued liability (bank deposits) as a liability of its own (money). This franchise-like arrangement also means that, when things go wrong, the sovereign government has to provide support in the form of liquidity assistance and bailouts. After all, it’s “the sovereign’s full faith and credit” that are at stake.A privately issued digital currency could only present a credible alternative to this public-private model now in place if it could avoid bitcoin’s shortcomings. Global technology companies, like Google or Facebook, are the most favorably positioned to come up with an option in the short run. They can take advantage of their extensive user base and geographical dispersion to quickly provide the public with a digital currency that would facilitate not only local transactions but also cross-border payments.See also: The US Should Use Stablecoins for Emergency Coronavirus PaymentsFacebook’s libra was the initial step in this direction. However, as I argue in another post, libra looks more like a security than a currency and may well be a short-lived project because of its flawed design. To avoid this fate, the Libra Association should shy away from the stablecoin model, which requires the digital currency to be backed by a basket of sovereign currencies. This feature may be useful to help the digital currency keep its value stable. But it also turns the currency into a digital claim on a portfolio of assets, much like shares in a money-market fund.If the Libra Association wants to create a truly digital currency, it should move libra closer to the bitcoin model. Libra could still have an identified issuer, but it should also have its own unit of account and not rely on sovereign currencies to be created, transferred, or valued. In this case, libra could deliver the benefits of both the public and private monies without the hassles.Because of Facebook’s 2.4 billion user base, a revamped libra would be readily available to more than 1/3 of the world’s population. Rich or poor, old or young, educated or illiterate, if these users can already access Facebook, they could easily use libra, too. Also, with a known and reliable issuer behind it, libra could gain the public’s confidence – as long as the Libra Association can overcome Facebook’s complicated history with privacy protection. And the more trustworthy the issuer, the more stable and safe the currency.Against this backdrop, Facebook seems to be the only institution ready to launch an alternative currency in the digital format that could be widely available and potentially stable. In any case, finding the money of choice eventually comes down to answering one salient yet old question: Who do you trust the most (or the least) to take care of your money? Your government, bitcoin’s developers and miners or Facebook?For comments, please contact marcelo.prates@bcb.gov.brThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

With her 8.9 million YouTube subscribers and two million Instagram followers, Phan said she wants to use her platform to promote clear and helpful content about bitcoin.“Now my viewers are hungry for more than makeup and skincare. They want to know how to protect their purchasing power,” Phan told CoinDesk on Wednesday. “Today I made an Instagram post telling my followers to buy the [bitcoin] dip, and then hold.”Phan is looking to grow her empire, which started with an investment in the four-person music startup Thematic and the blockchain gaming startup Pocketful of Quarters, in addition to the 12-person direct-to-consumer brand Em Cosmetics, which she bought from L'Oreal in 2015. So far Em Cosmetics orders haven’t slowed down, she said, unlike brands that rely on retailers like Sephora to distribute products.“It’s benefited us, being direct-to-consumer, because that’s what we’re used to. Anyone in retail right now is suffering,” Phan said. “Even luxury brands are taking a huge hit. … So far we’ve been very lucky in having an immense amount of supplies before the virus.”Indeed, the New York Times reported the beauty industry is in for a rough season. However, Phan’s brand revolves around do-it-yourself tutorials and direct orders. Although she said some of her ingredients come from Italy, South Korea, Japan and to a lesser extent China, manufacturing is often done in the U.S. and she’s already selling out of some products.Phan hopes supply chains will normalize in a few weeks. If so, she’ll continue with plans to launch several products this year. In the meantime, she’ll diversify her content and focus on building brand awareness beyond makeup tutorials.“I want to use my platform to shine more light on bitcoin (BTC). There’s so much misinformation. I want to bring more clarity,” she said. “Situations like this are an opportunity for people to learn how to hodl.”She said many of her followers didn’t know they could buy a fraction of a bitcoin and store it themselves, off of an exchange.

The group claims it has a biologist on board with 10 years' experience building similar vaccines for the FDA. Prominent community members such as Blockstream co-founder Mark Friedenbach are vouching for the unknown team. (“It is not a scam,” he tweeted.)And it’s drawing on bitcoin’s decentralized ethos for inspiration.""Cryptocurrency is uniquely able to help with this problem because, like us, it's outside the traditional system. The original backers are bitcoiners, and we'd love to keep working with bitcoin and bitcoin developers on this problem. We need all the help we can get,"" a CoroHope spokesperson told CoinDesk by email.The group sees the FDA as a potential hindrance to finding a vaccine for the rapidly spreading coronavirus because the agency has a stringent approval process that, to the biohackers’ minds, doesn't necessarily benefit the public. See also: Chinese Crypto and Blockchain Firms Grapple With Coronavirus Outbreak""FDA-compliant manufacturing is absurdly overregulated: paperwork for the paperwork, quadruple-checking, endless committees … just the worst of bureaucracy. So we can be more nimble,"" the spokesperson said.They noted that it took the World Health Organization (WHO) until Wednesday to declare the coronavirus a pandemic, “which will end up having cost thousands of lives due to continued complacency around the world. Unfortunately, COVID-19 is a global pandemic and frankly we're not interested in waiting for regulations to try to do good work."" Like other bitcoin-adjacent endeavors (3D-printed guns, online black markets), this one is likely to be controversial.FDA-compliant manufacturing is absurdly overregulated … just the worst of bureaucracy. So we can be more nimble.""I have no concerns with someone trying to develop something in a novel way. Science is all about that,"" said Nancy E. Kass, a professor of bioethics and public health at John Hopkins University. ""But it would be harmful, problematic, confusing and misleading to start saying that they have an effective vaccine if that vaccine has not undergone proper safety testing and efficacy testing,"" she said, pointing to FDA rules as a guideline.The CoroHope spokesperson agreed with this sentiment. ""We are not some televangelist hawking colloidal silver as a cure-all,” they said. “Even if we have thousands of reports of safe administration of our vaccine ... and reports of vaccines tongue-kissing an infected person without incident, we will not declare it an effective vaccine. That is indeed the domain of the FDA, and we do not aim to undermine public trust in the FDA.""Reached for comment, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told CoinDesk to contact the National Institutes of Health, which said it had received too many requests to respond. The FDA did not answer a request for comment.Liability is the very reason its members have chosen to not reveal their identities, at least not yet.Since CoroHope is using new means to develop a vaccine, the team is taking a risk. Bryan Bishop, a contributor to Bitcoin Core (the most popular bitcoin full node software), joined the biohacking project “to organize development” – only to quit a couple days later.""There's just too much liability,"" he said, if the drug has adverse effects on patients who end up using it.  Bishop pointed to a recent New York Times op-ed spelling out some of the perceived issues with health care liability in this day and age, where neither the FDA nor pharmaceutical companies want to be on the hook for things going wrong.See also: New York Crypto Companies Move to 'Work From Home' in Face of Rising COVID-19 ThreatThe CoroHope spokesperson said liability is the very reason its members have chosen to not reveal their identities, at least not yet. ""Anonymity is preferable at this stage, as Bryan's concerns about liability are shared by the rest of the group,"" the spokesperson said.For the same reason, the team is hesitant to reveal some details of the project.""Whether we have medical personnel, we can not and must not say. We are actively inviting anyone with relevant expertise to join our project, and we encourage them to invest in privacy while doing so, to maximize everyone's safety working on this endeavor,"" the spokesperson added.See also: Ben Hunt on Markets and Narratives in the Age of CoronavirusCoroHope has received “only a small amount of bitcoin so far,” according to the spokesperson. It’s published an address that as of press time had seen no transactions. But the group is encouraging donors to get in touch directly to get an individual bitcoin address “because of the privacy-sensitive nature of this endeavor.” (Using fresh addresses for each transaction is considered a privacy best practice because it’s harder for busybodies to trace the flow of funds on the public blockchain.) While the coronavirus is spreading rapidly, it's unclear how long it will take for CoroHope to come up with a concoction – or if it will even work.""This is not a cure​,” CoroHope warns in a document explaining its plans. “Untested vaccines are probably ineffective and come with no guarantees. This is true whether they are developed by a government, a large corporation or a collective of biohackers, just like any other medication. Our highest priority is to ensure that any vaccine we develop is not harmful, and its potential effectiveness is secondary to its safety,"" That sobering disclaimer was added out of “an abundance of caution – underpromise and overdeliver,” said the CoroHope spokesperson. ""Any vaccine like this only has a small chance of working (perhaps 20 percent for [biotech company] Inovio's vaccine, and less for ours as we don't have millions of dollars for optimization),” the spokesperson went on. “When doing the cost-benefit analysis, though, even a tiny chance of it working will be worth the investment.”See also: How to Survive the Coronavirus and Keep Your Startup AliveOther biohackers share this desire to circumvent problems with traditional systems. For example, anarchist and transgender biohackers have been working to produce DIY estrogen and insulin, to avoid a medical system that is often unkind to them.But while biohacking is a growing movement, biohacking a vaccine is quite novel. ""To our knowledge, no one has yet biohacked a vaccine,"" the CoroHope spokesperson said.A pioneering approach might make more sense with such a uniquely deadly virus, the spokesperson argued. ""COVID-19 is the most dangerous virus since 1918 (though not surpassing that), and certainly since biohacking became a thing,” they said.CoroHope does, however, have a plan. Specifically, it is attempting to create a so-called plasmid vaccine, inspired by what Inovio Pharmaceuticals is working on. After successful trials, that publicly traded, Pennsylvania-based company said it will be ready for human trials in April.The small CoroHope team has one person in an experimental “wet” lab, with another ""standing by"" if it receives enough crowdsourced donations, as well as a few people on the ""non-biology side.""

They have also manufactured biomolecules for over a decade and the experience is all relevant. Any molecular biologist has made plasmids with a kit, but doing it at industrial scale does require specialized knowledge that we possess.”With initial funding, CoroHope’s first goal is to develop the plasmid DNA vaccine ""to design and synthesize the plasmid, perform preliminary testing and send it out to interested labs.""If the group receives more funding, ""we can begin its production, scale-up and distribution,"" according to the document. But there are limits to what the group thinks it'll be able to do.See also: Is Blockchain the Shot in the Arm Healthcare Needs?""While we will be performing quality control testing to ensure that the vaccine is safe, we will be unable to test it in a clinical trial or animal models, and would leave that part of the process to be hashed out by the community,” the document says.This could be useful since even if Inovio's or another vaccine is approved soon, manufacturing enough doses for everyone ""is going to take some time,"" the spokesperson said. ""If someone is at the bottom of the list, they have a right to take their well-being into their own hands.

RBA conducted the survey in October and November 2019.The low usage comes in spite of respondents’ overwhelming awareness that cryptocurrency can be used to pay for goods. Over 80 percent said they’d heard of crypto, making it the third-most recognized “alternative payment method” the bank surveyed for, behind only “buy now pay later” services and “tap and go” mobile payments.Crypto was by far the least-used alternative method, falling behind those as well as AliPay and WeChat Pay, bank-owned “PayID” and “Beem It” services, and in-app mobile payment options. Crypto had the worst usage-to-awareness ratio by far, the survey showed. “Although many respondents had heard of ‘cryptocurrencies’, very few had used a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin to actually make a consumer payment over the past year,” RBA said.The bank has previously cast doubt on crypto’s potential to overtake existing payment rails.This appears to be the first time that RBA’s CPS survey asked respondents about cryptocurrency. The survey had been conducted on five previous occasions.RBA found that cash use in Australia is down in 2019, especially among younger demographics such as those under 40, who paid by cash in just 15 percent of recorded transactions. Even older groups are moving away from cash, the survey found. But it remains the most popular payment method for those 65 and up. The survey also found that mobile payment methods are on the rise. That growth is being driven by younger demographics as well.  The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

SPDI banks regulated by the Wyoming Division of Banking can offer services for digital assets without the oversight of the risk adverse U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Bishop is coming on as the firm’s chief technology officer. In 2018, Bishop was a senior blockchain engineer and custody architect at LedgerX, the first Commodity Futures Trading Commission-regulated options exchange and clearinghouse for digital assets. He has also created Bitcoin Vaults, a pre-signed anti-theft recovery and drawback mechanism for bitcoin. “For everybody, crypto custody is a given core skills set,” Long said. “The fact that Bryan has already done this at LedgerX puts him in a small group of people who have built secure crypto custody platforms that are proven in the marketplace and have survived daily attacks from adversaries.”Community banking veteran Britney Reddy will become the bank’s chief of banking operations and chief financial officer. Reddy has held CEO, president, CTO, CCO and COO roles at multiple Wyoming banks.Shimko, who was a director at Figure, will become Avanti’s chief operating officer. Before Figure, Shimko was head of corporate development at SALT, a crypto-backed lender. Shimko began his career at Morgan Stanley in global capital markets.Former Blockchain Consulting CEO and LedgerX Chief Compliance Officer Chuck Thompson is joining the firm as chief legal officer. Prior to that, he was in-house counsel at multiple capital markets firms, including Morgan Stanley. In February, Avanti announced it was teaming up with blockchain technology startup Blockstream to provide payment, custody, securities and commodities activities for institutional customers using digital assets.

In an interview with the Russian news agency Interfax, however, its head of legal office Alexey Guznov said the institution did not believe cryptocurrency issuance and trading should be legal in the country. “We believe there are big risks of legalizing the operations with the cryptocurrencies, from the standpoint of financial stability, money laundering prevention and consumer protection,” Guznov said. The bank took an active part in discussing the digital asset legislation, which has been waiting to be heard in Russia’s parliament since last spring. So far, it describes the rules for issuing security tokens in Russia, without mentioning cryptocurrency at all. The central bank contributed to a second draft of the bill in the fall of 2019, clarifying the requirements for the issuers of such tokens, Guznov said. In particular, the issuer should report capital of no less than $660,000 (5 million Russian rubles) and be able to provide the access to the ledger to law enforcement if needed. However, BoR is still reluctant to let tokens that are not securities, like bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) , gain a legal standing in Russia. “Now we’ve approached consensus with other government bodies and market players that participate in the discussion. That consensus might be that nobody is going to ban owning cryptocurrencies,” Guznov said, adding that crypto “in the end, is not drugs or arms.”But “legalization of issuance and, which is even more important, circulation of cryptocurrencies pose an unjustified risk, which is why the [future] law prohibits issuing and organizing the market for cryptocurrencies, and also introduces the punishment for violating the ban,” according to Guznov.People will not be punished for owning crypto “if they made their deal in a jurisdiction that does not prohibit that,” he explained, but institutions that make crypto trading and usage possible would be outlawed under the bill. The bill might finally get passed during this spring session of the parliament, Guznov also indicated.  Bank of Russia's leadership has been consistently skeptical about cryptocurrencies for the past couple of years. In October 2017, the regulator's chairwoman, Elvira Nabiullina, said cryptocurrencies, just like private money, should not be legal in Russia. Last autimn, she also said Russia does not need its own national digital currency. Bank of Russia reported in December it was running the first pilot tokenization project by mining and smelting company Nornickel, which is planning to tokenize batches of palladium, cobalt and copper and sell metal-backed stablecoins. The company is now testing its marketplace for the tokens, registered in Switzerland. Stablecoins like these, Guznov said, are within the framework of the digital assets bill.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Implemented at stock exchanges after the “Black Monday” crash in 1987, circuit breakers are meant to essentially throw sand in the gears of a plummeting market.Cryptocurrency markets have no such guardrails, which helps explain why, in a matter of a dozen minutes Thursday, bitcoin (BTC) endured a 21 percent crash. For the day, it lost 31.5 percent of its value.By contrast, in the equity markets, stocks tumbled as well, but not nearly as much. When the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq opened Thursday morning, trading halted almost immediately. That’s because the S&P 500 index opened more than 7 percent down from the previous day, triggering a “Level 1” circuit breaker. This marked the second time in a week trading curbs were imposed on the big U.S. equity exchanges; Tuesday saw circuit breakers triggered as well (Circuit breakers were also set off on Sunday, when futures contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 5 percent after the Fed announced lower rates and $700 billion in bond purchases, and again on Monday.)  “Today's price moves in crypto are a strong argument for industry-wide circuit breakers,” tweeted Multicoin Capital’s managing partner Tushar Jain on Thursday. “The crypto markets structurally broke today & leading exchanges need to work together to prevent a repeat.”“The entire DeFi ecosystem almost died today. Several large market participants went bust,” he went on to tweet. “Many traders literally could not get money to the exchanges fast enough to trade due to blockchain congestion & the extreme volatility was then made worse.”Cryptocurrencies' long-term success depends on whether exchanges can chill volatility, according to Jain.“If we just all need to accept that crypto can drop by 60%+ in a day that *severely* limits the usefulness of this tech,” he subsequently tweeted. “Exchanges' incentives are aligned with market growth. If markets can drop 60%+ in a day, the addressable market for this tech is much smaller.”As it now stands in the U.S. stock markets, both Level 1 and Level 2 (at 13 percent down) curbs lead to a 15-minute halt in trading (provided they occur before 3:25 p.m.) on stock exchanges like the NYSE and Nasdaq. A Level 3 circuit breaker (20 percent decline) stops stocks from trading for the rest of the day.Commodity exchanges like the CME have slightly different levels and even have “limit up” circuit breakers that kick in when futures contracts on stock indices trade above 5 percent in pre-market or after-hours trading. The levels have gotten more stringent since the 2008 financial crisis, but the gist remains the same: Give traders – and automated systems – time to process the onslaught of orders and cool off before making things worse in a panic. There are even more intricate rules for individual stocks. And similar curbs are found on other exchanges all over the world.In lieu of such trading curbs, all the crypto markets have to serve as speed bumps are the exchanges’ occasional failures to process heavy volume.Several major exchanges — save Coinbase and Bitstamp, prominently — were plagued by outages of some kind Thursday. Most notably, BitMEX was offline “for maintenance” for a total of one hour with a couple of outages during a day that saw hundreds of millions of dollars in liquidations.Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of Alameda Research and cryptocurrency derivatives exchange FTX, questioned the timing of BitMEX going offline just as bitcoin was taking one of its worst plunges in its 11-year history.In a tweetstorm prefaced with “Insane theory of the day,” Bankman-Fried postulated that BitMEX purposely shut down briefly to stave off a complete collapse in bitcoin. Bitcoin “rallied without the gigantic sell wall of the BitMEX [liquidations],” he said.Not allowing all the liquidations to take place and then going offline as bitcoin’s price made its way toward $3,700 removed a tidal wave of bitcoin hitting the market. That allowed prices to quickly rebound above $5,000 thus making liquidations unnecessary.BitMEX denied that was its intention and fired back at Bankman-Fried.“’Insane’ is right. Sam, you know better than to deal in this type of conspiracy theory, especially since you operate a platform in the space,” the company’s official Twitter account said. “There is no conceivable reason why a platform like BitMEX - which has operated for over 5 years and counting - would lower itself to the degree you proposed to avoid a situation for which it is already prepared.”“Sorry for suggesting it!” Bankman-Fried apologized. “I think I'm a bit confused why you're interpreting it so negatively though–I didn't intend it that way at all.”Yet, whether or not such outages were intentional is beside the point, because they served as de facto circuit breakers, according to Jain. “It is clear that those exchanges going down helped prevent further market volatility and allowed the market to stabilize,” he told CoinDesk in an email.And it may be the only way circuit breakers could ever be implemented in cryptocurrency markets, noted Larry Tabb, founder and research chairman at TABB Group.On stock exchanges, the companies agree to list their shares on an exchange, which could then halt trading with the equivalent of a flick of the switch. Not so with unregulated cryptocurrency trading, where hundreds of exchanges can all trade a similar asset like bitcoin and it’s fairly easy for individuals to transfer that asset from one exchange to another.Putting in circuit breakers “would be hard given the heterogeneous nature of the crypto market,” Tabb said to CoinDesk in an email. “There isn’t one regulator (many aren’t regulated at all), there isn’t one protocol, nor one data consolidated data feed.”“So even if you wanted to implement one – how would you do it?” he went on to muse. “What if exchange X tripped a breaker, how would Exchange A know and why would they stop trading? In fact, if X were to shut down, it would be in A’s best interest to stay open as the trading from X may migrate to A.”(A few hours after emailing CoinDesk, TABB Group posted to its website that it was shutting down “effective immediately,” citing business challenges exacerbated by the coronavirus crisis.)For the time being, at least, circuit breakers may not be put in place as policy but the debate will likely rage on, even within exchanges themselves.“Circuit breakers can only be used on a fully monopolistic exchange,” tweeted Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, Binance’s CEO, in response to a Cointelegraph piece about circuit breakers. “Free market doesn’t work that way. #btc is traded on many exchanges.”The Cointelegraph article cited a piece in Forbes explaining circuit breakers in stocks, specifically because it was linked by Catherine Coley.“In crypto, the concept of circuit breakers is [mind-blowing],” she tweeted. “It's good to be aware of how other markets (S&P 500) handle volatility and liquidity concerns.”She closed her tweet with the hashtag “#EducateDontIntimidate”Coley is the CEO of Binance U.S., the American subsidiary of Binance. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Coupled with a massive sell-off  in the cryptocurrency markets, derivatives also contributed to recent declines in price.

Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, one of the most regulated and bank-friendly exchanges on earth, appeared to be taken aback at the way market dynamics within cryptocurrencies panned out. What Armstrong and other long-view cryptocurrency holders perhaps don’t realize is the impact derivatives trading has on “thin” or low-liquidity markets like cryptocurrencies. Selling pressure in cryptocurrencies can create a cascading effect that is hard to recover from. Traders on derivatives exchanges like BitMEX and Deribit must contend with auto-liquidation. Such a margin call-like event happens after there is intense spot market selling of cryptocurrencies for much-needed U.S. dollars on exchanges like Coinbase. “As people lose discretionary income and short-term liabilities get called in, all risky assets are correlated on the downswing for the short term and that includes both traditional markets as well as crypto,” said Kevin Zhou, CEO of algorithmic trading firm Galois Capital.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

BitMEX registered more than $700 million in just 15 minutes last Thursday as bitcoin (BTC) plummeted through its support levels.

Last Week’s Price Crash Ignites a DebateLiquidation risk mechanisms are commonplace in traditional markets where they are used to temporarily halt trading. Known as circuit breakers, they are activated to stop panic selling when markets come under sudden and extreme duress. The New York Stock Exchange, for example, has activated circuit breakers in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 and during the 2008 financial crisis. Stock exchanges all around the world, including NYSE, have recently been forced to trigger them again as the coronavirus pandemic sparked a global sell-off in equities. Huobi's mechanism doesn't halt trading as does a conventional circuit breaker; it only halts liquidations on leveraged positions. It can also gradually liquidate positions, rather than doing so in a single event. There are some other exchanges that use a similar sliding mechanism, such as rival crypto derivatives platforms, Bybit and FTX.See also: Bitcoin Sees 9% Gain as Turmoil Hits the Forex MarketsIn the past, crypto volatility levels have spiked following short or long squeezes – mass liquidations from unexpected changes in the underlying assets that exacerbate movements.

As such, CoreWeave has responded by doubling the power of the entire network with its GPUs, which are designed to handle repetitive calculations.See also: Bitcoiners Are Biohacking a DIY Coronavirus VaccineAccording to Venturo, those 6,000 GPUs made up about 0.2 percent of Ethereum's total hashrate, earning roughly 28 ETH per day, worth about $3,600 at press time. There is no cure for the coronavirus just yet (though various groups are working on vaccines and research to combat the disease, including IBM's supercomputer). Venturo noted that Folding@home has been used to contribute to breakthroughs in the creation of other important drugs. ""Their research had profound impacts on the development of front-line HIV defense drugs, and we are hoping our [computing power] will aid in the fight against coronavirus,"" Venturo said.The coronavirus is taking a toll across the world. Italy and Spain are on lockdown. Conferences, stores and restaurants are closing to stem the spread of the disease; by stoking fears, it's slamming the financial markets in the process. When the idea of using GPUs for coronavirus research was mentioned to CoreWeave, the team didn't think twice. They had a test system up and running ""within minutes,"" Venturo said. Since then, the project quickly snowballed. CoreWeave has been contributing over half of the overall computing power going into the coronavirus wing of Folding@home. ""The idea of 'should we do this?' was never really brought up, it kind of just happened. We were all enthusiastic that we might be able to help,"" Venturo added.Folding@home is a decentralized project in the same vein as Bitcoin. Instead of one research firm alone using a massive computer to do research, Folding@home uses the computing power of anyone who wants to participate from around the world – even if it's just a single laptop with a little unused computing power to spare.See also: Bitcoiners in Europe Reflect on Economic Shocks as Coronavirus SpreadsIn this case, the computing power is used to find helpful information relating to the coronavirus. Much like in bitcoin mining, one user might detect a ""solution"" to the problem at hand, distributing this information to the rest of the group.""Their protein simulations attempt to find potential 'pockets' where existing [U.S. federal agency Food and Drug Administration (FDA)] approved drugs or other known compounds could help inhibit or treat the virus,"" Venturo said.Viruses have proteins ""that they use to suppress our immune systems and reproduce themselves. To help tackle coronavirus, we want to understand how these viral proteins work and how we can design therapeutics to stop them,"" a Folding@home blog post explains.Simulating these proteins and then looking at them from different angles helps scientists to understand them better, with the potential of finding an antidote. Computers accelerate this process by shuffling through the variations very quickly.""Our specialty is in using computer simulations to understand proteins’ moving parts. Watching how the atoms in a protein move relative to one another is important because it captures valuable information that is inaccessible by any other means,"" the post reads.Folding@home could use even more power. Venturo urges other GPU miners to join the cause. Even without these calls for participation, though, miners of other cryptocurrencies are already independently taking action. Tulip.tools founder Johann Tanzer put out a call to action to Tezos bakers (that blockchain’s equivalent of miners) last week, promising to send the leading contributor to Folding@home a modest 15 XTZ, worth roughly $20 at press time. The initiative blew up, to Tanzer's surprise. Though they might not be contributing as much power as CoreWeave, 20 groups of Tezos miners are now contributing a slice of their hashing power to the cause. Tanzer's pot has swelled to roughly $600 as Tezos users caught wind of the effort and donated.But that's not to say all miners can participate. While GPUs are flexible, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), a type of chip designed specifically for mining, aren't, according to Venturo. Though ASICs are more powerful than GPUs, they're really only made for one thing: To mine cryptocurrency. This is one advantage Venturo thinks Ethereum has over Bitcoin, since GPU mining still works on the former, whereas the latter is now dominated by ASICs. See also: Israeli Bitcoiners See Surveillance as Unavoidable During Coronavirus Crisis""This is one of the great things about the Ethereum mining ecosystem, it's basically the largest GPU compute resource on the planet. We were able to redeploy our hardware to help fight a global pandemic in minutes,"" Venturo said. (However, it's worth noting that Ethereum has seen ASICs enter the fray. Not to mention, ether miners might soon go extinct when a pivotal upgrade makes its way into the network.)ASICs are useless for the Folding@Home effort, but if bitcoin miners have old GPUs lying around from the early days that they could contribute, too.Even if other miners join up, though, it's still a long shot that the effort will lead to a helpful drug.""After discussing with some industry experts [...] we believe the chance of success in utilizing the work done on Folding@Home to deliver a drug to market to be in the 2-5% range,"" Venturo said.

Gox intends to liquidate cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin and bitcoin cash, according to a draft rehabilitation plan.","The trustee, attorney Nobuaki Kobayashi, shared with creditors an outline of the draft rehabilitation plan on Tuesday ahead of a meeting Wednesday. The plan marks a significant step toward concluding a case that has kept creditors waiting since 2014, when Mt. Gox collapsed after a 850,000 bitcoin hack.An outline of the draft (see below), verified by CoinDesk, indicates that creditors who have filed claims for fiat currencies, bitcoin (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH) will receive these assets in their original form, either via bank transfers or BTC and BCH transactions to addresses at designated exchanges or custodians. Meanwhile, ""all other assets such as cryptocurrencies other than BTC and BCH will be liquidated into cash to the extent possible,"" the document reads.Crypto creditors won't be first in line, however, with the trustee saying: ""fiat currency claims allowed in the rehabilitation proceedings ... will be given priority in payment, to secure the interests of such fiat currency claims.""See also: Bitcoin Halving, ExplainedFurther, the draft rehabilitation plan, which is yet to be filed and approved in a court, added that the trustee also intends to allow BTC/BCH creditors to request payments in cash if desired.""Consequently, a sufficient amount of cash must be secured as the source for distribution for both fiat currency claims and BTC/BCH claims for which cash payment is requested. For reasons including this, the Trustee may, with the permission of the court, sell all or part of the BTC/BCH constituting the Debtor's assets,"" the plan says.Kobayashi said in the outline that the policy is ""not to purchase additional BTC/BCH."" Therefore, the existing BTC/BCH holdings may not be sufficient as a source for all claims in those assets.In October, the Tokyo District Court issued an order to extend the deadline for a rehabilitation plan to March 31, 2020.If approved, the plan could also resolve the legacy issue of how to deal with cryptocurrencies that have come into the trustee's possession as a result of hard forks of the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash networks. In such forks, after a new blockchain is split off from the original chain, all holder's digital assets are duplicated on the new network. It wasn't disclosed in the draft what quantity of crypto assets other than BTC and BCH the trustee is holding. Its balance sheet indicated it was holding about 141,686 BTC and 142,846 BCH, as of March 2019. At that time, Kobayashi had approved claims for 802,521 BTC, 792,296 BCH and $38,165,664 in cash, revealing a funding shortfall. The total amount of assets the trustee holds is also unclear at this stage. See also: Mt. Gox Files for Bankruptcy, Claims $63.6 Million DebtIn November 2018, a hard fork split the Bitcoin Cash network to create Bitcoin SV (BSV). The Mt. Gox holdings of 142,846 BCH would also have brought an equal amount of BSV in the trustee's possession – an amount currently worth about $24 million. A fork of bitcoin into bitcoin cash in 2017 also brought in around 200,000 BCH (now worth $45.6 million). During the first half of 2018, Kobayashi liquidated around 60,000 each of BTC and BCH following the crypto market bull run in 2017.Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in 2014 following an infamous hack in which it claimed to have lost 850,000 BTC at the time, although around 200,000 BTC were later found in an old wallet. In June 2018, the Tokyo District Court granted a petition to move the bankruptcy case to a civil rehabilitation process, allowing creditors to be repaid in their original crypto holdings rather than the fiat value at the time of the collapse.See outline of draft plan below:The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

James Cooper, a CoinDesk columnist, is a professor of law at California Western School of Law in San Diego.  ","With the impacts of COVID-19 still ravaging financial markets and trillions being deployed by governments and central banks to stem the economic carnage, one cannot help but wonder if this is cryptocurrency’s breakout moment. This unstable environment seems ripe for cryptocurrency to come out of the shadows and become a viable asset class and legitimate alternative to our fiat-based economies. With the proposals for a digital dollar, some legislators in the U.S. Congress seem to think so.Within a matter of weeks, we have gone from living our lives unencumbered from worry to being confined to our homes and practicing social distancing. With this backdrop, it is easy to believe anything is possible. But is the United States and the rest of the world ready to broadly accept and utilize digital currencies and related blockchain innovations?  See also: The Overton Window Opens for a Digital DollarTechnology is disruptive, given all the economic and political impacts that come with the adoption of innovations. It is no surprise that the legal structures to regulate the manner in which society utilizes new technologies always lag behind the technologies itself. The regulatory issues surrounding cryogenic freezing of embryos, the advent of online gambling, or the distribution of digitized music are good examples. Our Founding Fathers did not think about any of these when they set out to create the structures for the democratic governance of this country. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies are no different on the regulatory front. The agencies tasked with protecting consumers concerning securities, overseeing currency, and ensuring the fairness in commodities trading have been slow-footed to catch up to the workings of this complex technology. We need to clearly determine to what extent smart contracts can be enforced in a court of law.The dearth of core legal prescriptions is preventing massive adoption. Financial services, property titles, and tax accounting all require new regulations to accommodate the changing realities brought on by blockchain technologies. We need to clearly determine to what extent smart contracts can be enforced in a court of law. There is also a need to increase privacy protections before there is broad adoption of blockchain technologies. Without the fundamentals in place, it will be difficult to trust this new technology with our sacred social relations – identification, our money, our reputation and so forth. This will not be any easier given the immediate need to rebuild our financial systems but for many of us, our jobs themselves.  Beyond the legal challenges, there is the ever-present hurdle of user adoption which continues to prevent the wide scale acceptance of cryptocurrencies.  Despite all of the issues with fiat-centric currency, there is great comfort in the traditional security that our current financial services regime provides.  If a thief steals your credit card, your funds are replenished; if a bank goes bankrupt, up to $250,000 is covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; and if the bailouts and economic stimulus packages achieve their intended outcomes, then our loyalty to the current centralized banking system will only grow. See also: As This Crisis Worsens, Bitcoin Will Become a Safe Haven AgainFor the new world of cryptocurrencies to go mainstream, the average consumer must work through the complexity of current key management implementations.  In particular, if cryptocurrencies become a truly distributed asset class, consumers should also be ready to assume their own losses through theft or user error. To maintain legitimacy, we must build the capacity of individuals and businesses to navigate the thousands of incompatible coins and projects to determine what best services their needs.  There is a huge need for public education to this end.  Moreover, there are few decentralized applications that have sparked the public’s interest or demonstrate a true utility.  Even as Congress considers the use of a digital dollar in its varying versions of the newest stimulus package and the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank continues its study of a digital dollar’s role in the economy, technical and user adoption blockers will remain. There is no doubt a digital dollar can serve as a necessary transitional step, but it will be a new, unproven technology, with the highest of requirements to ensure the scalability, reliability, and ease of use. These problems reflect the legacy of trust that the U.S. (paper) dollar provides. It is likely that government-designed solutions will fail short of their intended mark when compared to proven open source deployed by an ecosystem of competing tech firms.The federal response to the economic chaos of COVID-19, with both Senate and House bills having considered the introduction of a digital dollar, may well expedite mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. While not known for their nimble innovation nor expedited implementation of laws, the actions this week by the federal authorities auger well for the future of cryptocurrencies.  They will not, however, result in a sea change in the world’s financial systems.

It’s a bright spot for adoption in an otherwise topsy-turvy time for bitcoin and cryptocurrency at large, which, like so much of the world, has been struggling to price in COVID-19. Not so for merchant crypto payments, though. Commerce product lead John Zettler told CoinDesk the team hasn’t seen any change in activity over March.  Money comes more often than not in bitcoin, Zettler said. He did not provide an exact crypto-by-crypto usage breakdown, but noted bitcoin is far and away customers’ method of choice.“Merchant customers often tell us it's the crypto they're most familiar with and the one they trust the most,” he said. Even so, Coinbase is seeing a surge in the use of stablecoins for payment, particularly its own dollar-pegged USD Coin (USDC). USDC leads the growth pack, Zettler said. He expected to see “material growth” in stablecoin use across Q2 and Q3.  See also: Geopolitical Crisis May Benefit Oil, Gold and CBDCs, Not BitcoinCommerce added support for USDC in May 2019. Coinbase plans to keep building out Commerce’s features in response to merchant demands, Zettler said.

However, digitizing the dollar in general is seen by many influential figures as a necessity for the U.S., with former Commodity Futures Trading Commission J. Christopher Giancarlo and economist Judy Shelton – who U.S. President Donald Trump has nominated to the Fed board – both claiming the nation may lose its financial hegemony if it fails to do so.Fed member banks can also maintain something called a “pass-through digital dollar wallet,” according to the draft bills, and recipients would receive “a pro rata share of a pooled reserve balance” held by the member. See also: The Overton Window Opens for a Digital DollarThe bill follows Representative Rashida Tlaib's (D-Mich.) unveiling of the “Automatic BOOST to Communities Act,” which would provide any individual in the nation a pre-loaded debit card. The card would initially hold $2,000 and be given an additional $1,000 until one year after the COVID-19 pandemic is contained. Under Tlaib’s bill, the U.S. Mint would issue two $1 trillion platinum coins, which the Fed would purchase using credit. “The Treasury Secretary would ‘sweep’ the newly created reserve funds from the Mint’s account to the regular Treasury General Account,” the bill reads. These funds would then be disbursed to U.S. residents through the program.“In the long term, the card infrastructure should be converted into a permanent, Treasury-administered digital public currency wallet system, to serve as a privacy-respecting ‘eCash’ complement to universal Fed Accounts and/or Postal Bank Accounts for All,” the bill reads. See also: US Senate Floats ‘Digital Dollar’ Bill After House Scrubs Term From Coronavirus Relief PlanThe Democratic bills come as the Republican-led Senate remains in limbo over its own bill to stimulate the economy.

The full percentage point cut was four times more than its usual move. ","The Fed's return to ZIRP — zero interest rate policy — was brought about by the threat coronavirus is placing on the U.S. and global economy. It was done at the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) meeting, which was urgently moved up to Sunday from a previously scheduled one on Tuesday.The last time rates were cut to this level was Dec. 2008, where it remained for seven years. It inched up as high as 2.5 percent by 2018, before the Fed began cutting. Just two weeks ago, it was brought down to 1.0 to 1.25 percent. “The coronavirus outbreak has harmed communities and disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States,” the FOMC said in its statement. ""Global financial conditions have also been significantly affected. Available economic data show that the U.S. economy came into this challenging period on a strong footing.”All but one member of the FOMC voted for the cut. The lone holdout,
Cleveland Fed President Loretta J. Mester, agreed with the idea of cutting
rates but wanted the range to be a little higher, between one-half and three-quarters
percent. Not only did the Fed cut rates, it also decided to start buying $500 billion in U.S. Treasury bonds and $200 billion mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Doing so has the effect of adding more dollars into the economy by taking the bonds off of banks’ balance sheets and putting loanable cash in their stead. It also lowers interest rates; bond yields fall as bond prices rise, which happens when massive buying like this occurs. Effectively, this is “QE4,” the fourth major round of quantitative easing by the American central bank since the global financial crisis a little more than a decade ago. This will bring total assets on the Federal Reserves balance
up to a record $5 trillion. Over the past week, the Fed also announced it was going to
do a total of $1.5 trillion in repurchase agreements (repos
and reverse repos) lasting up to three months to make short-term money available
to banks to meet reserve requirements and keep the fed funds rate on target. News of the FOMC’s action sent U.S. stocks into a tailspin, giving back a chunk the gains they eked out in the last trading hours on Friday.  Futures trading on the Dow Jones Industrial Average was halted Sunday evening when prices fell 5 percent, triggering market ""circuit breakers.""However, bitcoin prices were buoyed, albeit for a moment. The price of the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization soared 7.7 percent, from $5,182.70 to $5,582.62, in less than an hour after the Fed’s announcement.

Rhule was a seller on LocalBitcoins, a peer-to-peer trading platform used worldwide.Rhule is said to have closed eight deals with the undercover agents – often in Seattle-area Starbucks cafes – for a sum total of $140,000 cash, according to the unsealed complaint. He faces an additional charge of conspiracy to produce and distribute marijuana.The undercover agents also allegedly asked Rhule questions about monero (XMR), the privacy coin.“Rhule explained to UCA-1 that monero operated under the same concept as any cryptocurrency and was verifiable on the blockchain with one important caveat: wallet addresses could not be tracked,” the complaint said. The defendant allegedly offered to convert bitcoin to monero for the agents and provided tips on using Tor and TAILS to further preserve anonymity.Rhule appeared in Seattle before the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington on Tuesday, according to the Department of Justice Press release.According to the complaint, the undercover agents recorded Rhule during the undercover operations. Rhule allegedly never asked the agents the required “know your customer” questions that FinCEN-licensed money transmitters must ask clients, from which, of course, he had no licensing. He was also allegedly indifferent to the agents' stated use of the funds.“Rhule conducted these transactions even after the undercover agent explained that at least a portion of the cash involved represented proceeds of human trafficking,” the complaint said.The agents had found him through LocalBitcoins username after searching for in-person cash dealmakers. Rhule is the latest LocalBitcoins user to be prosecuted on charges of running an unlicensed money transmission business. LocalBitcoins no longer offers the cash for crypto trading option.HSI, a subset of the United State’s hulking Department of Homeland Security, has an interest in prosecuting unregistered money transmitters when it comes to crypto crime. The investigative unit’s National Bulk Cash Smuggling Center developed an intelligence program designed for sniffing out violators across internet forums and dark markets in the summer of 2018. Called the “Cryptocurrency Intelligence Program,” (CIP) it is now part of every HSI crypto investigation.But Rhule’s case slightly predates CIP’s debut. Agents first reached out to him in April 2018, according to the complaint.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It had never signed on a peer-to-peer client because these firms were seen as too risky to conduct business with, said John Dempsey, Chainalysis’ vice president of Product.“I think previously we categorically viewed P2P exchanges as a high-risk category,” he told CoinDesk.In a P2P model parties move cryptocurrency directly between their wallets with no financial institution processing the trade.

Some flout know-your-customer laws by allowing their users to work without an account, let alone identification required by law. That tainted the category’s reputation and made Chainalysis hesitant to partner with any P2P exchange. “This is a reputational risk for us,” said Dempsey, the Chainalysis exec.Dempsey said Paxful came to Chainalysis looking for investigative tools. The company agreed to a partnership after seeing Paxful had “transformed its business model to prioritize compliance,” according to Kennedy. Paxful Chief Compliance Officer Lana Schwartzman told CoinDesk the exchange began pivoting in “early 2019” after it realized its future depended on toeing the regulatory line.

The Algorand Foundation launched a health survey website to record public health trends during the novel coronavirus pandemic.The site allows infected people to record their experiences anonymously, and will use the Algorand blockchain to protect the data for posterity. Called the iReport-Covid app, the idea is to “get health data from more sources than just government authorities,” said Hugo Krawczyk, Algorand Foundation researcher. “We think blockchains are a good way of recording information and it’s accessible if you want to do statistics...if in 10 years you want to research the virus you will have this data available,” he said.An augmented reality gaming app, Triffic, is set to donate $10,000 to the World Health Organization (WHO).Usually, the app rewards players in GPS tokens, its native cryptocurrency, for moving about the world and collecting “beacons,” or virtual representations of real-world objects. Now that millions are under lockdown, the gameplay has been modified to spawn beacons – in the form of virtual toilet paper rolls, hand sanitizers, and face-masks – directly in player locations.For every item collected, Triffic will donate the token’s value to the WHO COVID-19 Response Fund. According to a blogspot, the apps creators have already sold 600,000 GPS for cash, to ensure donations retain a stable value.Fundraising will stop on either April 30, or when all tokens have been collected. Donations, which the app’s creators say will be verifiable, will be paid out in lump sum on May 1. Project N95 is a web-based clearinghouse for medical grade equipment. The platform serves as a medium to connect rapid response teams and hospitals with manufacturers of desperately-needed personal protective equipment (PPE). “We are working with governments to determine where demand is and where it is most urgent,” reads the Project N95 website. “This is a tool designed to gather data as efficiently as possible to assist in distribution efforts.”The platform takes in requests directly from hospitals and governments to help aggregate demand, as well as vets equipment manufacturers, to best execute distribution. They’re also looking for volunteers. Tor Bair’s Enigma, a data encryption firm, has developed a platform to facilitate privacy-preserving contact tracing for COVID-19. Called SafeTrace, the platform aims “to help protect public health while also protecting individual privacy,” Bair wrote in an email. As observed by some nations – like South Korea or Singapore – ability to “flatten the curve,” fighting a pandemic requires reams of data. This comes both from wide-spread testing, as well detailed maps of infected persons movements. “Some of the measures being used to combat COVID-19, specifically contact tracing, involve significant privacy compromises that pose risks even when participation is voluntary,” Bair said. SafeTrace counters this by providing a secure, open-source backend to upload and encrypt this sensitive personal information. The platform is loosely based on the existing Enigma protocol. Within a secure enclave, all the reports are collated and compared providing: 1. A “local view,” which is an individual report showing users where and when they’ve overlapped with individuals who have since tested positive2. A “global view” heat map that can help us better understand and curtail the spread of disease caused by COVID-19.Bair said they are looking for epidemiologists, health professionals, rust programmers, developers and engineers, and other volunteers to help out.

The companies must be going-concerns and have a monthly burn,” Neuner said.  ""Even if I'm theoretically ""at the epicenter,"" I don't know of anybody sick with the disease, in my extended social circles, and have not been affected from a health-related point of view personally. But I am heavily affected in day-to-day life. When this unprecedented and draconian Italian mass-home-detention started, I finally decided to get back and ""turn myself in,” in order to stay close to my parents and parents-in-law. Paradoxically, it’s been a happy month with my family. We’re spending a lot of time together with our 2 years old daughter, and there’s been a steep reduction in work-related stress. (More on that later.)Though a lot of friends and relatives – especially the self-employed ones, and the small entrepreneurs – are now unemployed and without any income. A lot of local enterprises are already financially crippled beyond repair. The psychological effects of imprisonment are starting to show: We have relatives and friends showing occasional breakdowns. My professional life has also been impacted negatively. I can't really monetize remote Bitcoin-related consultancies and workshops as I did with physical ones, and being in a reduced space with a small child I can only really enter remote sessions a few hours every night when there is silence.""CZ Changpeng Zhao’s “one tweet” could lead to $1 million in charitable donations. According to a public announcement, Binance Charity will match $1 donations to retweets of “this post” tagged with #CryptoAgainstCOVID.The charity will make an upfront donation of $1 million in BUSD, and set up a wallet for other to give. It’s unclear where the money will eventually go, though Binance intends to buy supplies directly and send them to “targeted hospitals in affected countries,” according to a blog post. “The most important element of human life is to show compassion and help others as we can, without the limitation or restriction of borders. Blockchain technology enables this in greater capacities than ever before and Binance Charity wishes to bring this to the masses,” said Helen Hai, Head of Binance Charity, said in a statement.Additionally, if there is 1 million retweets within 7 days (originally posted on March 25), the charitable wing of the world’s largest crypto exchange will redouble its donations. Binance started charitable giving early, having reportedly launched the “Binance for Wuhan” project in Dec. 2019. That effort committed to a donation of $10,000,000 RMB ($1.4 million) worth of supplies, shipped to over 300 hospitals and medical teams in various Chinese cities. In early February, Coinbase ordered more than 1,000 N95 masks for its employees, as one of the earliest companies to take a strong stance on the looming coronavirus threat. This mentality led the firm to close its offices in early March. “We never got to use [the N95 masks] because we started WFH two weeks ago,” Peter Jihoon Kim, a head of engineering at Coinbase, tweeted. But this wasn’t a tragic waste of personal protective equipment.Governments need accurate information related to how the virus has been transmitted interpersonally. Many, including China and Israel, have turned to using GPS data collected by their citizens’ mobile phones to identify people who have crossed paths with an infected individual.These “contact-tracing tools... can also be – and have been – used to expand mass surveillance, limit individual freedoms and expose the most private details about individuals,” write the team behind Private Kit, an open-source, “contact tracing” app. This team of epidemiologists, engineers, and data scientists – led by MIT Media Lab Professor Ramesh Raskar – built a free, privacy-protecting app that can be used to track the spread of COVID-19, using mobile phones.Users opt in to sharing their data with healthcare professionals (which also offers a “location trail” based on actual movements, rather than memory). These healthcare workers then redact all personal identifying information and added to a database. If a Private Kit user has crossed paths with an infected individual, the app will alert them.  The Giving Block crypto charity drive launched today. The #cryptoCOVID19 Alliance will give donations made in crypto to nonprofit partners includingSave the Children, No Kid Hungry, Us4Warriors, among others. “Today, donating cryptocurrency is not just a way to lower our taxes. It is our chance to protect the people we love, all while telling the new crypto story. To turn sideways glances into admiration. Today we write the first page of our story. Help us squash this bug,” Alex Wilson, The Giving Block CEO, writes in a statement. Gitcoin, part of ConsenSys, will match up to $110,000 in donations made in ether or DAI, though the charitable drive will also accept donations in bitcoin, litecoin, zcash and other cryptocurrencies. Gitcoin’s participation is part of its larger grant drive, where $250,000 will be gifted to projects growing the Ethereum community. This round, a special $100,000 is earmarked for crypto projects addressing public health, specifically, “all COVID-19 related projects focused on research, response, and recovery efforts within communities.”Pulled together by Scott Moore, technical growth lead at ConsenSys’s Gitcoin, the project is a twin to The Giving Block’s larger charity drive. “We’re hopeful that with this infrastructure, although it’s just the crypto community’s small contribution, we can help many of these public health projects get at least $10K [sic] to use immediately towards their efforts,” Vivek Singh, chief operating officer at Gitcoin, blogged. “If you don’t have the means to donate, we encourage you to share the hashtag #cryptocovid19 across your feeds!”Messari, a crypto data aggregator, added a new resource to keep track of coronavirus statistics. This curated feed, called COVID-19 Tracker, collects information related to the virus’s progression and regression in all 50 states, several territories, and the Grand Princess cruise ship. “I’ve been monitoring the coronavirus since Feb 1,” Messari founder Ryan Selkis wrote in a blog unveiling the data source. “I am not a doctor/expert, but have been ahead of many of them on this.”The webpage also provides curated links from news and government sites, as well as excerpts taken from Selkis’s daily newsletter, Unqualified Opinions. Earlier today, Selkis alerted the crypto community that he has been “shadow banned,” or temporarily restricted from Twitter. ”I believe it's from our COVID-19 coverage, and we're now being limited as if we'd been reporting on this like ZeroHedge,” Selkis said, referring to the newsource blocked from Twitter in February. JSTOR, the not-for-profit online hub for academic research, has made selections of its holdings public. Usually hidden by a severe paywall, the database has turned over 6,000 ebooks and over 150 journals for public use. In a statement on its website, JSTOR said the move is taken to assist “students have been displaced due to COVID-19.” The resources will remain available until the end of June, and may grow to include more than 20,000 books for institutions that do not participate in an existing book program. Prior to taking his own life, internet activist Aaron Swartz used JSTOR to download and republish 5 million academic journal articles through MIT's computer network. Swartz was later charged under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.“The world's entire scientific and cultural heritage, published over centuries in books and journals, is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of private corporations,” Swartz wrote in the 2008 Guerilla Open Access Manifesto. A couple living in upstate New York is contributing 300 face shields to the state’s coronavirus efforts. Isaac Budmen and Stephanie Keefe, owners and operators of 3D printing firm Budmen Industries, are able to produce these protective masks in mass quantities, all from their basement. According to local news site Syracuse.com, the couple designed the shields after learning the county would open a coronavirus testing site. With hundreds more shields on the way, Budmen said, “We’re really not looking to make money off the county in this crisis. We’re just sort of looking to get through it as fast as we can.”The art world has gone virtual. As the spread of the coronavirus forces museums to close indefinitely, a number have taken their galleries online.Art Basel, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Pace are among the many that now offer virtual viewing rooms, according to the New York Times. Art Basel alone has uploaded 2,000 masterpieces, worth some $270 million. Digital galleries “feel personal, they feel intimate,” Jeff Koons, pop artist, told the Times. “I love looking at images. I can be just as happy to look at an image of a Manet painting online. It’s really about the stimulation that a work has for you.”NanoHack is an open-source respirator that leverages distributed manufacturing and 3D printing to ease the demand shock in medical-grade face masks. The idea is to create a reusable, recyclable and form-fitting mask by mass printing components to be assembled at home. The company alleges the “copper nanocomposite” material is antimicrobial. It’s unclear if the masks are currently in production, or which decentralized distribution channels are in use. NanoHack did not respond to a request for comment by press time. Together, we have the power to use the latest technology in ways that make an immediate and lasting humanitarian impact in local communities and across the globe.IBM will expand its developer competition aiming to solve the world’s most pressing issues – from climate change to crisis communications – through code, to include COVID-19.The “Call for Code Global Challenge” offers winners $200,000 in cash, reports Venture Beat.“We are working with some of the world’s leading experts to define the most pressing needs and provide the most helpful resources,” IBM said in a statement. “Together, we have the power to use the latest technology in ways that make an immediate and lasting humanitarian impact in local communities and across the globe. Thank you for answering the call in this unprecedented time in our history.”Orchid, the decentralized VPN provider, is courting journalists as China and other countries use the coronavirus crisis to expel members of the press.“We are making Orchid available for free to all journalists in order to ensure they are able to access and transmit accurate information, no matter where in the world they are,” the company wrote in a Friday blog post shared with CoinDesk in advance. “If you are a journalist, email amanda@orchid.com with the name of your publication and proof of your status, to get set up and receive a personal onboarding.“The token-powered privacy project raised roughly $48 million from a slew of big-name backers including Andreessen Horowitz, Blockchain Capital, Polychain Capital and Sequoia. The network and its OXT token launched in December.Orchid sees the coronavirus-induced shift to remote work as an opportunity to attract new customers.“This is the first time many people around the world will be working remotely on a regular basis,” the company wrote. “We know that Internet privacy tools can be crucial for workers in sensitive industries and/or geographies, and we understand that the need to work remotely for an extended period is likely to cause significant disruption.”As such, the company says it will prioritize its desktop app in the months ahead as people log onto their laptops to work from home.Have you ever wondered how DAOs could be deployed to beat the pandemic? Well, Collab19 has your answer. “By creating a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) people from all over the world can come together to fight COV-19,” according to Collab19’s website, where philanthropic individuals are instructed to buy the DAO’s tokens “to help the DAO decide which charities to donate to!”Like other decentralized autonomous financial bodies, Collab19 is governed by token-economics. Of 1,400 C19 (the native token on the platform) tokens created, the DAO will keep half. The rest will be put on a Uniswap pool. On a weekly basis the DAO will cash out 100 tokens to be purchased on Uniswap, and then used to vote on how to spend the remaining DAO treasury on charitable efforts. “Most charities don't know how to deal with crypto so we are thinking of using a trusted facilitator to handle crypto to fiat conversion,” James Young, cofounder of Abridged, wrote in a Telegram channel. Young is also working on another DAO using MolochV1, where users can pool their DAI, and the interest will be used to fund covid19 tests, he said. “[I’m] calling it ""testTogether.” Will launch next week.”No, the loudest blue check on Twitter is not an epidemiologist. While social media has become a go-to source for information during these confusing times, it’s becoming evident that some people are speaking out of hand. Hive, a group of “crypto-minded researchers, engineers, designers” and fans of the space that scores and ranks trustworthy social accounts has developed another algorithm to map the actual epidemiologists to follow. Hive.one epidemiologists ranks 100 accounts that can speak authoritatively on the crisis, during this moment where it seems like no one is in charge. Hackaday.io is a website for people to collaborate on hardware development. During the coronavirus crisis, a number of open-source campaigns have started, seeking ways to build anything from solar-powered battery packs to positive air pressure respirator (PAPR) devices. Mike Rigsby even as a tool that prevents people from touching their face. His project, “Don't Touch Face,” activates a buzzer when you lift your arm “to let you know that your hand is causing trouble.”Researching and developing vaccines in the 21st century requires an incredible amount of computational power. Developers at LiquidApps have stepped up with a potential solution for underpowered labs. Called CoVax, this app will harness the spare processing power of personal computers around the world to assist vaccine research.“Processing power is essential for computational-heavy tasks involved in vaccine research, and many labs with which we have been in contact have highlighted their need for more processing power,” Beni Hakak, CEO of LiquidApps, said over Telegram. Learn more here about how your idle GPUs can be put to work modeling the molecular structure of Covid-19 and better understand how it infects humans.The rush to stock up ahead of a potential quarantine has emptied groceries and pharmacies of hand sanitizers. But, thankfully, you can make your own. A Popular Science article breaks down the steps in a how-to guide:Taking one cup of 91 percent isopropyl alcohol, half a cup of aloe vera gel and 15 drops of tea tree oil and stirring can yield a pretty effective hand sanitizer solution, according to the blog. The World Health Organization recommends a similarly easy solution, though it yields a massive quantity. The agency writes, in a 10-litre (2.6 gallon) glass or plastic bottle mix 8333 ml of 96 percent ethanol, 417 ml of hydrogen peroxide, and 145 ml glycerol. At least one Crypto Twitter fixture has tried the solution, and is now offering bottles to anyone in need. There aren’t enough ventilators to cope with the coronavirus, reports the New York Times. In this time of critical shortage, a number of do-it-yourself solutions have sprung up to meet demand.One, an open-source project hosted on GitHub, provides instructions for a “low-cost open-source ventilator-ish device.” “This rudimentary design could provide a target breathing rate, and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). It cannot guarantee a specific tidal volume, and doesn't regulate specific fractional oxygen (FiO2),” the project leads, write (not wholly reassuringly). Similarly, a group MIT students built a “disaster zone” ventilator for $100 in spare parts. While CoinDesk cannot in good faith recommend this as a solution, this could be an interesting project for the technically-inclined to while away the idle quarantine hours. Meanwhile, Panvent, a blogspot website, has a detailed list of personal protective equipment (PPE) that people can use to prevent the spread of disease – ranging from the CDC recommended n95 mask to a full-faced positive air pressure respirator (PAPR) – alongside their own workaround solutions. Grant Gulovsen of Gulovsen Law Office and Rafael Yakobi of The Crypto Lawyers have teamed up to offer free 20-minute legal consultations to members of the crypto community. The sessions will be conducted via online video conference. “Rafael Yakobi and I understand there’s a lot of friction and distrust of lawyers in the crypto community and thought this might be a way to break through some of that. Given the social distancing that everyone is being forced to perform as a result of the current health crisis, having these consultations online obviously made the most sense,” Gulovsen said in an email. Gulovsen said he and Yakobi work almost exclusively with individuals and startups innovating in the crypto and blockchain space, helping them with regulatory compliance as well as the ins and outs of corporate law.“It remains to be seen exactly how COVID will impact our client base, although I expect it will have the same sort of impact as it does on anyone trying to launch a startup. We are both adapting and responding to different questions that come up, especially as it relates to more traditional practice areas like employment law,” he said. The Covid-19 pandemic is disrupting all industries, including the arts. Band tours are being canceled as concert halls are boarded up. “With such a major revenue stream drying up almost entirely, finding ways to continue supporting artists in the coming months is now an urgent priority for anyone who cares about music and the artists who create it,” Ethan Diamond, co-founder and CEO of Bandcamp, said in a blog. To help ensure struggling or upstart musicians are able to pay rent, Bandcamp will waive its take of donations and payments made to artists this Friday, Mar. 20. Part of the Web 2.0 revolution, Bandcamp was at the forefront of placing pressure on the once-overpowered arbiters of musical judgment. “[I]f you’re lucky enough to be in a position to spare some funds, please consider sharing your good fortune by buying music and merchandise directly from artists.”Sam Altman, former president of Y Combinator and CEO of OpenAI, is looking to fund startups and projects helping with Covid-19. “[I]t’s basically the one thing I know how to do that can help,” Altman wrote on his blog. This open call to founders is meant to spur work on ventilator production, therapeutic solutions for the disease, and a new vaccine – “i.e., not doing what the big pharma companies are already doing,” he said. Altman is renowned in the VC circuit for striking early investments in Airbnb, Stripe, Reddit, and the pepper’s staple Soylent. CoCo Briefs is a decentralized approach to broadcasting, aiming “to empower anyone with an audience to spread positive, helpful, truth-based information – through blogs, videos, social media, and email blasts,” writes John Hargrave, the author of Blockchain for Everyone and CEO of Media Shower, in a company blog.CoCo provides a template to send actionable and inspiring posts into the ether of the internet, to to battle against the fear and misinformation that coronavirus raises. ""The final score will be Humans 20, COVID-19,"" Hargrave said.“We all have an audience, and we all have a voice. Your voice is stronger than you think,” he said. ""The COVID-19 quarantine has been the most surreal experience of my entire life. Here in China where I live and work this has been my lived experience for several months now. When the virus first exploded in January, I made the decision to stay in China for family and business reasons. From the extraordinary precautions being taken, it was immediately evident this was an extreme situation. I was staying at a fully booked hotel with a capacity of two hundred rooms. Very quickly the hotel emptied out until only three or four guests remained. Soon the hotel was ordered to close, and I made the decision to self-quarantine.Like many, if not most in China, I very rapidly realized that this was a time for extreme steps. I ordered a large quantity of masks for family, friends, and clients, paid a neighborhood kid to deliver food, and closed the door.Only in the last few days has China really started to venture back outside.Only in the last few days has China really started to venture back outside. The country feels like it’s coming back to life step by step, but yet, it’s not quite recognizable. There are thousands of people on the streets, and every single one wears a face mask. Checkpoints for temperature checks are everywhere, and we scan QR codes for big data contact tracing.Three days ago I went outside. The first time in six weeks.I feel safe. Safe, but worried for my friends and family back home.""People have been quick to notice how social media has become the de facto source of information since the outbreak of COVID-19. For weeks, the media and governments alike tried to downplay the potential impacts of the virus, to disastrous effect. That’s why Will Bleakley spun up the Covid-19 Live Display Hub, a real-time stream of COVID-19-related posts on various social platforms. The hub aggregates regional and country-specific content, so readers can stay up-to-date on what’s happening around them.For weeks, the media and governments alike tried to downplay the potential impacts of the virus, to disastrous effect.To decentralize the news gathering process, the Covid-19 Live Display Hub sources information from local media organizations, regional World Health Organization Pages, government agencies, politicians, and other public accounts. While the official line is to “Stay the F Home,” Drew Hinkes, a crypto attorney with Carlton Fields, ventured outside yesterday to cast a ballot.“Based on what we're hearing from scientists and specialists, it is smart to take precautions,” Hinkes said in an email. But still, there are some forms of public engagement that take precedence over public health, namely, the health of our democracy.“I do feel strongly that as Americans, we should vote while it's still safe to do so,” he said.Sky Guo, the founder and CEO of the smart contract platform Cypherium has some thoughts to share about the possibility of a market recovery, following the Covid scare. The virus has been contained in China, and is now under control in Korea. As long as quarantines and other measurements are adopted in a timely manner, we shouldn’t be afraid of the virus. The crypto markets, like our immune systems, can self-heal and gain strength for future crises. People in our community are not very worried about the crisis. They’ve been discussing the markets in a very calm and analytical way. People are hoping for a recovery, and for Bitcoin to reach a new all-time high after the halving this year.Jenny Balliet, founder and CEO Lula & Co., a consultancy that advises on blockchain applications among other fields, is curating an ongoing teaching guide for stressed-out parents who’ve never, until the past week’s wave of shutdowns, had to think of home-schooling their kids. She describes herself as a “diehard Vygotskian” – a reference to the cognitive development theories of Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky, who advocated social learning as a predecessor for cognitive development. Applying those ideas, Balliet came up with this handbook. The first updates to the guide, she says, will be about oil markets, bitcoin resources, gaming for a cure and writing meta-cognition.Test, test, test and test some more. That’s the mantra from pretty much every expert about how communities can get ahead of the coronavirus pandemic and figure out how best to respond and assign scarce resources. But none of that is good for much if the data on the pandemic is not captured, aggregated and delivered in a reliable way for health professionals, political leaders and ordinary folk to make sense of. This is why an initiative by Danny Yang, founder of block explorer Blockseer, is potentially so important. The site repeatedly scrapes data from all 50 states and Washington, D.C., and aggregates them in real-time, creating easy-to-follow charts. It may well be the most up-to-date, most reliable source of official data available.

But he’s best known in the crypto community for his interests in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and in pioneering an NFT fundraising model with the “Honu” turtle-cat CryptoKitty, which raised $140,000 for ocean conservation.Today he dedicated his blog to reflecting on what life in the busiest city in the world has become like in just a few short days. In doing so, he demonstrated the power of the written word and of storytelling to reach across the void and connect with others – as vital a service as any in this uncertain period of radical social distancing.“Here’s what’s going on,” began the level-headed Meltem Demirors, founder of crypto investment firm CoinShares. “This is my third crypto bear market and my second financial crisis, and our exec team has seen several macro market cycles and three global re-pricing events, so we are staying calm, analyzing the market, and building for opportunities we believe will we are well-suited to capitalize on in the weeks and months that follow,” she said.Demirors is focused on communicating and connecting with her team, clients, partners and portfolio companies in this time of uncertainty. In her own words:1. We’re actively reviewing all of our counter-party exposure, risk exposure, and business continuity plans, and proactively communicating internally and externally. Crypto community has been resilient, our counterparties are doing a great job! 2. Calling all of our portfolio execs on the venture investing side, sharing what we’re hearing, and making sure they’re feeling supported. Helping them secure 12 – 18 months of runway if needed: 3. Publishing fact-based research.4. Checking in and texting, calling, emailing, and letting people know I’m thinking of them. I’m setting up hangouts to chat, share ideas, and keep the community intact during these difficult times, and joining other people’s webinars and conference calls to hear what they’re thinking about. Also – lots of VR hangouts in bitcoin!  5. Lastly, memes and humor. A little bit of laughter never hurt anyone!With help from Bits and Tokens, a blockchain media company, and featuring a fireside chat with CoinDesk reporter William Foxley, CryptoMondays was able to avoid the perils of meatspace and convene digitally.Lou Kerner, the meetup's organizer said it “was pretty cool, until the trolls came.” Timothy Mackey, an adjunct professor at the University of California, San Diego, thinks that blockchain can help solve some of the current “choke points” affecting coronavirus patient care. Forbes reports the professor of health studies has added a blockchain solutions module to his Global Health Policy undergraduate course, which has since gone remote. Mackey believes blockchain is an important tool in helping to spread accurate information about infectious diseases, as well as maintaining healthcare supply chains. “This is likely just the beginning of a norm of the globalization of infectious disease outbreaks,” Mackey told Forbes. “And we can’t effectively respond without leveraging technology to enable better international cooperation.”The blockchain author and futurist writes:Bunkered in Charlestown, MA, overlooking a now-very-quiet Logan Airport, anxiously awaiting my delivering of TP from Amazon which allegedly will be within days not weeks. Heavily working the phones and chat groups to similarly isolated colleagues, some of whom are organizing data analytics syndicates to address COVID-19 related global health data sharing (leveraging work I did for the UN on training crisis response teams from UNOCHA and UNHCR on the use of big data during large-scale humanitarian crises).An insurance provider in China used a blockchain-based settlement system to offer quick, one-time payments to victims of the coronavirus. Xiang Hu Bao, an online mutual aid platform, reportedly began paying out (a maximum of) 100,000 yuan ($14,320) claims to some of its 104 million health plan participants. Ant Financial, the platform’s parent company, has funded the payments. “Xiang Hu Bao has been able to process claims and make payouts to participants quicker, due to the decentralised, trust-free nature of blockchain technology,” an Ant Financial spokesman told the South China Morning Post.Headspace, a meditation app startup, announced it will offer free subscriptions for healthcare professionals working in public settings.At a $70 value, the subscriptions will run until the end of 2020, according to PitchBook, a financial data provider.The healthcare startup has reportedly seen a doubling of inbound requests from members since Friday, as well as a 100 percent increase in corporate clients looking for ways to improve employee’s mental wellbeing, according to PitchBook. The CEO of the Ethereum-based startup writes:Some people take whatever solution they have knowledge of, be it cryptocash or cleaning products, and try to wedge it in to the crisis. We are against this. It’s important to be clear and realistic about the suitability and capability of one’s technology. That said, we are looking at the situation around the rapid, decentralized mass production of ventilator systems and other medical equipment, and wondering about things like certification of schematics, ""as manufactured"" parts lists, maintenance records, safety recalls and so on. Mattereum's core operating principles about product authentication work equally well for fine art as for engineering products, but this is a sobering scenario, and we are being responsible as we look at scenarios.Massimo Temporelli, founder of The FabLab in Milan, used a 3D printer to build a needed component for a breathing apparatus. According to industry publication 3Dprintingmedia.network, the machine was used to intubate 10 patients over the weekend, possibly saving their lives. “As the virus inevitably continues to spread worldwide and breaks supply chains, 3D printers – through people’s ingenuity and design abilities – can definitely lend a helping hand. Or valve, or protective gear, or masks, or anything you will need and can’t get from your usual supplier,” David Sher reports.The bitcoin meetup organizer and entrepreneur writes:During the first days was almost like normal life during the summer, when many shops and businesses are closed and few people around. Now, it's different because we basically can't move from home. The city is like a ghost town. It's becoming difficult to get food and I'm starting to see the negatives of the situation. I'm kinda reclusive, but this is very extreme... Because it's not only you, but everyone else who is living like this. Italians are great in keeping company and they are discovering digital ways to connect to each other or just singing from the balconies... So you don't feel so alone after all. We have to find a new routine, a new way to feel good and connect with the others. Reuben Yap, project steward at Zcoin, lives in Malaysia, which has recorded a total of 553 COVID-19 cases so far. He said the country is going into lockdown. His wife works on the frontlines at the Sarawak General Hospital. “She works in anesthesia and intensive care,” Yap said. “I have an elderly father as well who lives in a house down the road from me and my wife has her own family as well.”“The impacts are quite severe for my wife and I. This week she's undergoing hazmat suit training and if she's required to intubate or be exposed to the patient, she'll have to be quarantined in the hospital.”Today, Malaysia banned all foreign travelers from entering the country. “Malaysians can return and self-quarantine. They cannot fly out,” Yap said.“Essential shops are kept open but private offices, religious places, all societies and everything are closed. There are mad rushes to stock up now but luckily I stocked up earlier.”Bruce Fenton: Why ventilators are so important to most vulnerable, yet are in short supply. And, what you can do about it. Amid this period of severe market fluctuations, investor Ryan Zurrer is helping to prevent ""DeFi"" from defaulting. Zurrer, founder of Dialectic, a Swiss-based crypto-asset firm and former chief commercial officer at the Web3 Foundation, has taken on ""very conservative"" collateralized debt positions (CDPs) to keep MakerDAO functioning. MakerDAO nearly collapsed last week after the Ethereum blockchain failed to keep up with investor demand. To this end, Zurrer has also spun up a Keeper bot in anticipation of the potential auction – which could draw in a huge wave of investors, again – later this week. ""For me, MakerDAO is DeFi and one of the most compelling projects on Ethereum, so I will not let it capitulate to a full-on Black Swan event without doing everything in my power to protect it,"" Zurrer said. Avi Schiffmann, a high school junior from Mercer Island, just outside Seattle, launched a website to track instances of coronavirus in late December. It has since become a vital resource for researchers and the public working to stay safe in questionable times. Using the most recent figures from the World Health Organization and the Center for Disease Control, Schiffmann’s site presents the most up-to-date local, national and global information in an easy to read format. This includes information on the amount of confirmed and recovered cases, and deaths, as well as a Wiki and newsletter to provide basic facts about the virus. The site has been visited by millions of people.“The main goal of it was to provide just an easy way to see the straight facts and the data, you know, without having to make a website that was biased or, you know, full of ads or anything like that,” Schiffmann told Democracy Now!The Giving Block, a crypto charity initiative, is partnering with nonprofit charities to launch a crypto fundraiser this week.“Government responses are failing. Nonprofits, companies and individuals need to step up,” Giving Block co-founder Alex Wilson said in an email. “Crypto and tech saw it coming first so we're hoping this community will be particularly supportive.” All donations go directly to wallets controlled by the nonprofit, and clients have the option of automatically converting their crypto to fiat. Recently, The Giving Block teamed up with Gemini for an International Women's Day campaign that raised $15,000 (in crypto) in 24 hours.Gitcoin will match up to $100,000 in donations made in ETH or DAI during the campaign, and Brave will provide free advertisements. More details, including its nonprofit partners, are forthcoming tomorrow. The COO of the crypto PR firm writes:Apart from the financial worries that our economy if going to tank, I actually enjoy the luxury of extra time to do yoga, and I signed up for afternoon CNA training. That way I will be able to volunteer at the local hospital in case there is a need for extra hands. Don't get me wrong, doing PR for blockchain companies is a great job, but it might be nice to have a positive impact on some people's lives for a change... However, I hope in a couple of months life will be back to normal.New York Cares is hosting digital orientation sessions so volunteers will be ready to participate in their communities once it’s safe again to leave the house. “Whenever the coronavirus is in our rearview mirror, hopefully, we know that there’s going to be a huge amount of service that we’re going to try to grow and meet,” Gary Bagley, president of the volunteer coordinating agency, told The City. Folding@Home uses computer simulations to build models of virus proteins, which may assist in the hunt for a vaccine. They could use your help.

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Mar 13, 2020 at 12:40 UTC","William Mougayar, a CoinDesk columnist, is the author of “The Business Blockchain,” producer of the Token Summit and a venture investor and adviser.","We should stop trying to define or classify cryptocurrency as if it were a beast from another planet. Rather, we just need to accept it as the future of money. It is a currency, not a security, and it shouldn't be governed by securities laws. The dollar, euro, yuan, pound are not regulated by securities authorities.  ​There is little value in attempting to define, box-in, segment or categorize cryptocurrency as something that needs to be continuously examined, questioned and analyzed. Instead, let’s focus on promoting cryptocurrency’s adoption because it is here to flourish and stay.At a recent DLD 2020 panel, entitled ""Virtual Currencies & the Global Financial System,"" the first question from the moderator consisted of “defining cryptocurrencies.” Each of the three panelists (painfully) took a shot at suggesting their own definitions. Another panel from Davos 2020, ""From Token Assets to a Token Economy,"" discussed tokens as a type of cryptocurrency. In both panels, the definitions tried to depict tokens and cryptocurrency as a new type of animal.Is there a point trying to classify the various types of cryptocurrencies, really? See also: While We Wait for Laws, We Need Better Interpretations of Existing RegulationCryptocurrency is just like any currency, except with more powerful properties. It is that degree of power that is scaring incumbents while exciting new participants. Over the long term and in the end-state, cryptocurrency is going to be as pervasively used as today’s currency, but with a rivaling variety. Today we see cryptocurrency as the future of money, but tomorrow it will be an integral part of money. Email was new until it wasn’t. E-commerce was a novelty until it no longer was. Filing taxes electronically or renewing licenses online was a rarity until it became routine and sometimes the only option. Online banking was innovative until it became routine. Meeting friends online was extraordinary until it became very common. Reading online news was a parallel activity to printed newspapers until it became the norm for billions of people.Today, cryptocurrency is an anomaly whose usage and understanding are in the hands of the few. Soon enough, it will permeate our society, habits, business, government, and become second nature.If you go down the rabbit hole of classifications, you quickly realize the resulting madness and confusion from the nomenclature jargon: stablecoins, staked currency, utility tokens, security tokens, native coins, digital rights tokens, non-fungible tokens, etc.There are stablecoins and market-driven coins. Stablecoins, like the name implies are coins with less volatility (supported by algorithmic or asset-backing stability), whereas non-stablecoins are subject to market supply/demand price fluctuations. Cryptocurrency can be government or non-government backed. Government-backed cryptocurrency is still a rarity, and the subject of more discussion than action. As an aside, it will end up as a centrally controlled digital currency rather than being decentralized, programmable and native to a given blockchain.Sadly, we have invented many of these classifications to please regulators.We also have tokens that are in essence cryptocurrencies with a purpose. Then we enter the legal sphere, where tokens get labeled a utility, or security, based on how they were initially created, who received them and their ultimate functionality. For most tokens, there is a blurred line in demarcating the distinction between exclusive utility and their security-like properties of tokens.  Somewhere between a utility and security, we also have non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that are representations of unique ownership of a digital asset that has no physical equivalent (such as a CryptoKitty or a games related artifact like a special tank or sword.)Sadly, we have invented many of these classifications to please regulators. With tokens, regulators and governments get agitated because companies can now issue tokens as currency, whereas issuing money used to be the sole right of sovereign governments. But companies have been issuing stock for decades. A stock is another form of value that cryptographic tokens mimic when they function as a security. Then, we enter discussions about the functionality of these tokens: can they be earned? Sold? Bought? Spent? Awarded? Are they a payment unit? Or a right to a privileged action (like voting or getting access to information). Will their value increase if you don’t use them and just store them? Are they native to a blockchain network, or grafted on top of an existing platform or singular application? The above classifications are what we currently see, and there may be new representations we haven’t seen yet. While some of these functions are distinct from one another, many of them overlap with each other. That is why classifying cryptocurrency is not that useful, because we are still in the formation stages. Time for a reality check. Do we still attempt to define the internet? Not anymore. But in its early days, we did…until we didn’t anymore.Do we define money by its use cases, like something you buy groceries or pay a toll with? Or do we, rather, define money by its properties? See also: Cut the Consensus: You Can’t Run a Business Like a BlockchainMoney’s key properties consist of being a unit and a store of value that is transferable, fungible, verifiable, divisible and scarce.Cryptocurrency inherits all these properties, in addition to adding unique functions that money doesn’t have: its immutability is digital (the physical is gone), it can be fungible or non-fungible, its policy governance doesn’t need to be centralized, it has very powerful programmable capabilities with imbedded logic (if-this-then-that), and its transferability is peer-to-peer (without central intermediaries). In essence, cryptocurrency is money on steroids. Let us start using cryptocurrency according to its most common features first, the ones that it shares with the money we know. Then we can evolve from there. Just like early websites were glorified brochures on a screen, then we evolved way beyond that monochromatic use case into e-commerce, e-business, two-way communications, social interactions and much more.Using cryptocurrency hasn’t been easy for the average person, and that’s a valid challenge. But it is getting better. It is time to give cryptocurrency the place it deserves. If it is to claim a position as the new money, then we need to increase its usage, starting with the easier use cases and gradually increasing the variety and complexity.We need to bring cryptocurrencies to the fore and make them as popular as regular currency and web are. Let us stop defining and segmenting cryptocurrency in ways that limit it. Rather, let’s start using it in ways that open up the possibilities and allow it to cement itself in our lives and businesses so it is accepted, welcomed and not feared.Cryptocurrency is the new money and the new currency. It is time it enters the bloodstream of the mainstream.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Since 2011 he has built a decentralized social networking platform that has reached seven million users to date, and is working on tools to help bring power back into the hands of people and local communities.","For every technology we use today, there was a time it was laughably inadequate as a replacement for what came before. For decades, chess engines were a mere curiosity, but now a smart phone can beat any grandmaster. The same is now true of voting technology.As we look back on the recent failures of apps to secure our elections, from failing in Iowa to a few days later leaking millions of voter records in Israel, we are reminded that technology, especially in the hands of smaller contractors, can be fallible, and lead to massive data leaks.See also: CoinDesk's Post-Trust Election CoverageMany people say we don’t need tech to secure our elections, that paper ballots have been good enough for centuries. But is that really true? George W Bush was elected U.S. president in 2000 not because he got more delegates in the end, but because the recount of paper ballots took so long the Supreme Court had to step in and make a decision. The Iraq War may have never happened if we didn’t use paper ballots. The recent coronavirus epidemic also raises health concerns about shared voting facilities versus using personal touchscreen devices.Crypto and “Byzantine Consensus” was supposed to finally secure our elections. But so far dominant blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum have not been scalable enough to handle millions of people paying, or voting, all at once. For every technology we use today, there was a time it was laughably inadequate as a replacement for what came before.But a new generation of open-source innovation and protocols like Intercoin, MaidSAFE and Holochain, is showing how to build provably secure, scalable infrastructure that can handle voting and economies at scale. These new protocols are not based around a monolithic blockchain and do not have a central bottleneck such as a “miner” or a “mining pool.” Instead, each entity (a coin, a file or group activity) is secured by a small subset of the whole network, called a “shard” or a “section.” Much of this technology is not new. In fact, it predates bitcoin. BitTorrent and other peer-to-peer file-sharing systems are based on a technique called Kademlia, developed in 2004. These kinds of sharded networks can scale indefinitely, their embarrassingly parallel architecture supporting a practically unlimited number of simultaneous transactions. The networks are not just peer-to-peer, but also have the ability to aggregate results, for voting and other community applications. And all of this is done without “layer 2” solutions, which are almost always centralized “cop-outs” from an otherwise trustless infrastructure.Traditional networks are vulnerable because trust is concentrated in a single place – whether money, data or votes. This makes it economically attractive for both external and internal actors to try to subvert the guarantees we have come to rely on. John Dillinger didn’t waste his time robbing piggy banks. Brands won’t buy personal data from random sites with 20 users.A bitcoin wallet contains endlessly divisible balances (called “UTXOs” in bitcoin parlance). Because of this endless division, each full node must hold the entire history of every transaction just in case some of those balances may have come from fake transactions.An ethereum wallet contains token balances stored inside a smart contract on an Ethereum network. As more and more money is exchanged for this token, its total supply becomes very valuable and the smart contract becomes an attractive target for malicious actors. This is why it has been so hard to shard ethereum. If, for example, each smart contract was secured only by a few nodes, then at some point it could become economically attractive to attack this consensus, either to change some balances or just prevent further progress and kill the token. Either way, it is a bad outcome for the network.Intercoin wallets, on the other hand, hold coins, each one worth very little and watched by a small, effectively random group of nodes. Paying exact change is achieved by coins of denominations of 1/2, 1/4 and so on down, and interacting with “change bots” – accounts that exchange a coin for an equal amount of change. Coins on the MaidSAFE network (called “safecoins”) work similarly.The key is, there is a natural limit on how much individual coins are worth. There are no UTXOs or Token Contracts worth $50 Million. To attack the consensus, an attacker would have to infiltrate and subvert most or all of the nodes in one particular shard (called a “section” in MaidSAFE), but all they would take over is one small coin. To gain any significant amount of value, they’d need to attack a proportional amount of the network. Each individual attack becomes more and more difficult as the network grows, let alone the combined attacks to net anything of value.This means large transactions must involve large transfers of coins, just as ransom and drug deals in movies are done with large suitcases of $100 bills, each one presumably not trivial to obtain. Thus, such networks are suited for smaller, everyday payments with proportional fees, rather than storing and transferring huge amounts of value for a fixed fee. Where bitcoin and ethereum help store value, Intercoin and Maidsafe enable the other side of money – a scalable means of exchange.So, how does that help us trust our elections to an app? The truth is, blockchain technology is not enough. You need to string together several solutions at once, including a way of distributing one token to each voter; Merkle trees (or hash trees) that record information sequentially and allow multi-person verification; include several independent vendors, so voters can check, from different “user agents”, their vote recorded on the Merkle tree; and private keys for every voter.  The crypto community has already implemented much of this machinery to secure more valuable things than a single vote. Ethereum, for example, is built on a blockchain secured by many mutually distrusting parties. People may trust their favorite wallet client, but they will also verify using another wallet or a web based blockchain explorer such as Etherscan. The chances of all these entities colluding to steal someone’s tokens become smaller as more clients software is released and more miners secure the back-end network.See also: How Democracy Breaks: Everything That Could Go Wrong With the ElectionTowards the bottom of the Merkle tree, on the level of individual precincts, individual results do not represent juicy targets to subvert. The payoff is small – 1 percent of an Iowa delegate, perhaps. By the time the results have been entered on higher levels of the tree, though, they have been checked by a growing pyramid of multiple distrusting parties on every lower level, and fixed in a way that by then is mathematically infeasible to reverse.Each individual voter would be able to record his or her Merkle branch, in order to check that their vote was recorded and counted correctly. At each level in the tree, mutually distrusting witnesses agreed that they came together and recorded a result correctly. With information being deleted at every step, no one can verify how someone else voted, unless that other person chooses to reveal their vote and Merkle branch. A system could even be constructed where voters can furnish confidential zero-knowledge proofs of how they voted, without the recipients being able to prove it to anyone else.In a way, Bitcoin and Ethereum are like MySpace and Friendster – the first iterations of a new industry that will tackle trustless computing in increasingly sophisticated things. Ethereum’s blockchain is monolithic, completely public and anyone can check anything. But if new technology will bring down the cost of running elections you can trust, then every organization large and small will want to do one. And they may not want everyone to know the results – they may want privacy inside the organization.Crypto can liberate people to form communities and get things done without needing to hand over massive amounts of trust and control to third parties.This set of requirements for privacy calls for additional innovations that are now starting to be implemented by the crypto community (here “crypto” is being used in its original sense, meaning cryptography), including group encryption, group signatures and end-to-end encryption where research is ongoing about how to efficiently perform mathematical operations on encrypted data without knowing the original values. We may never completely get away from having to trust some entity that tries to ensure each person isn’t using multiple identities to vote, but studies have shown this happens exceedingly rarely when people vote in person. As people are able to vote from their couch, away from prying eyes, we may come to rely more and more on “verified identity” services to solve this remaining security issue. Efforts to standardize and innovate in this area are ongoing and perhaps one day we will even be able to obviate this final need to trust third parties.But until then, projects like Intercoin, Holochain and MaidSAFE represent a way forward for decentralized crypto infrastructure to finally let us as a society engage in payments, voting, governance, and other scalable activities. Technology and crypto can liberate people to form communities and get things done without needing to hand over massive amounts of trust and control to third parties.For those interested, more information and technical details can be found here.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Further, the agency is asking individuals to keep a record of the Australian dollar exchange rate at the time of their transactions, as this might significantly impact earnings.The tax office is utilizing its Data Matching Protocol for cryptocurrencies, which allows it to cross-check data it has on individuals with data provided by exchanges (dubbed crypto designated service providers) in an attempt to identify those who may have misreported on previous tax returns.“Under this program we obtain cryptocurrency transaction data from currency exchanges on taxpayers who have bought and sold cryptocurrency,” an ATO spokesman said in the report.The planned warnings come as other tax agencies around the world move to more closely monitor for tax evasion involving cryptocurrencies. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service last summer issued similar warning letters about misreporting income from trades, and released its first guidance on crypto tax for five years in October.Ukraine also said in recent weeks that taxpayers will need to include crypto earnings in their returns, listing them under intangible property.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Rival Celsius Network – which lends to 225 institutions, making up up a loan book of $400 million to $600 million at any given time – has seen margin calls in the hundreds of millions, according to CEO Alex Mashinsky. Meanwhile, Nexo’s co-founder Antoni Trenchev said some customers have repaid loans while it has liquidated other clients’ collateral, the equivalent of foreclosing on a home mortgage. And BlockFi reported in a blog post that it made margin calls on its dollar-denominated loan book, with some liquidations, but declined to comment further. “As of five minutes ago, everyone who needed to post collateral has,” Moro said. “We’ve had zero liquidation events. … What we have done to augment our lending is we have not made any additional loans in the last few days.” In the past year, crypto lending activity has mushroomed, as some holders sought to earn a yield on their assets, others sought to raise cash without selling their coins and market makers borrowed to fill orders quickly. The phenomenon could potentially improve liquidity and price discovery for crypto assets but it also has introduced systemic risks.   Read more: Crypto Lending 101Now, Genesis doesn’t plan to make any loans that are collateralized less than 100 percent until the market calms down, Moro said. While Genesis is still trying to figure out what interest rates should look like in the volatile environment, the unit of Digital Currency Group is raising collateral requirements on loans from around 105 percent to between 110 and 120 percent for loans backed by bitcoin, which make up the majority of its loan book. If volatility doesn’t subside, collateral levels could rise further, to anywhere between 130 and 150 percent, as underwriting standards continue to tighten. As the market dropped, Moro said demand shifted from fiat loans to bitcoin loans as traders looked to arbitrage the difference between bitcoin’s spot and futures prices. At sister company Genesis Trading, Moro said, only about 60 percent of clients were selling while 40 percent were still buying.Given the turmoil, “I would have expected it to be 80/20 or 90/10,” he said. Celsius also raised collateral standards after Thursday’s rout, but Mashinsky claimed it was the “best day ever” for the company as it “loaned more than ever and charged the most interest” than it ever has. For example, loans on ether now carry an eye-popping interest rate of around 260 percent compared to 15 to 20 percent under normal circumstances and 4 or 5 percent in the calmest of times, Mashinsky said. As Celsius grows, however, it plans to tighten the limits on credit lines it offers, Mashinsky said.Nexo is holding the launch of a product that would allow users to earn interest on their crypto, Trenchev said. (The company only offers crypto-collateralized fiat loans and interest on fiat and stablecoins.)“We were going to launch two weeks from now,” Trenchev said. “But we have to wait for this to play out, before we feel confident to launch.” Trenchev said he’s confident that demand for fiat loans will hold steady as bitcoin seems to have bottomed around $3,867 and he does not plan to change interest rates. Nexo’s loans are typically collateralized between 200 and 500 percent, he added.“The beauty of collateralized loans is you don’t have to worry about the underwriting process that much,” Trenchev said. “I would argue that digital assets are the best collateral – better than a penthouse on Fifth Avenue. You might have a steady price situation, but with digital assets you have instant liquidity.” The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Mar 24, 2020 at 19:41 UTC","The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) published its final guidance on ""actual delivery for digital assets"" Tuesday, seemingly settling a longstanding question on when a cryptocurrency can be ""delivered"" from one party to another.","The CFTC shared a 35-page document stating that in its view, ""actual delivery"" occurs when a customer has complete control over the asset and the offeror no longer has any control over the asset by the end of 28 days after the transaction. The publication comes following several years of public input from exchanges and other stakeholders.The regulator approved the draft on March 23, according to the document. How ""actual delivery"" is defined has long been an open question. In 2016, law firm Steptoe & Johnson LLP petitioned the CFTC after the federal commodities regulator settled charges with crypto exchange Bitfinex on trading violation allegations.The charges stemmed from CFTC allegations that Bitfinex maintained control over cryptocurrency private keys after delivering funds tied to margin trading, and therefore the funds weren't actually delivered. The charges were settled, with Bitfinex paying $75,000.Steptoe filed a petition shortly after, claiming the settlement did not provide any clarity to what ""actual delivery"" looked like. The petition argued that the definition of custody was unclear, which could be harmful to the crypto industry.Tuesday's filing might settle some of this gray area. ""However, the Commission notes that it does not intend to create a bright line definition given the evolving nature of the commodity and, in some instances, its underlying public distributed ledger technology,"" today's document said.CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert said in a statement he does not believe the agency will conduct enforcement actions for the next 90 days around potential delivery violations to ""prevent any potential market disruptions"" as firms abide by the new guidance.According to Tuesday's document, the CFTC defines ""actual delivery"" as having occurred when: ""(1) A customer secures: (i) possession and control of the entire quantity of the commodity, whether it was purchased on margin, or using leverage, or any other financing arrangement, and (ii) the ability to use the entire quantity of the commodity freely in commerce (away from any particular execution venue) no later than 28 days from the date of the transaction and at all times thereafter; and (2) The offeror and counterparty seller (including any of their respective affiliates or other persons acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty seller on a similar basis) do not retain any interest in, legal right, or control over any of the commodity purchased on margin, leverage, or other financing arrangement at the expiration of 28 days from the date of the transaction.""Read the full document below:The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Financial Crisis. Purchases of new PAXG – which represent one ...","Mar 26, 2020 at 17:00 UTC",Gold-backed crypto tokens continue to rise in price as sourcing gold itself during the coronavirus-induced downturn is reportedly getting more difficult.,"Demand for Paxos Gold (PAXG) and Tether Gold (XAUT), two of the most liquid gold-backed token projects, has surged this week. Both blockchain-backed tokens each represent a legal entitlement to one ounce of gold stored in institutional vaults. Both tokens are redeemable for physical gold.The uptick in demand comes as traditional gold suppliers face shortages and difficulties in bringing physical bullion to the market, according to reports.“The Fed completely changed the rules – the real rate of interest swung even more and so we are seeing all that money flow into gold immediately,” Roy Sebag, founder of metals custodian Goldmoney, said regarding the Federal Reserve in a phone interview with CoinDesk on Tuesday.Read more: Bitcoin and Gold: Evaluating Hard-Cap Currencies in Times of Financial CrisisPurchases of new PAXG – which represent one ounce of London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) institutional-grade gold – have nearly doubled day-over-day since Monday, according to Paxos spokesperson Becky McClain. Paxos said Thursday it had enough gold to cover current volumes.On the other hand, demand for Tether’s offering led to the XAUT market cap hitting $50 million on Wednesday, according to data provider Nomics. Yet supply-chain issues in sourcing the gold itself could hinder further issuance of the token, according to The Block. “XAUT simply represents a new and technologically innovative way for people to hold gold without annual fees,” Tether told CoinDesk in a statement, declining to comment on daily market movements. “We have seen strong growth for XAUT and we anticipate XAUT will continue to grow as it establishes itself as the dominant digital token representing gold ownership.”Trade volume for both tokens has also increased in recent days, according to market data from Nomics and CoinMarketCap.“We’ve all seen unprecedented volatility in the markets the past few weeks, so naturally people are looking to safe havens like gold,” Paxos executive Walter Hessert told CoinDesk. “As a blockchain-based token, it also offers holders the greatest level of control and accessibility outside the financial system.”An increase in demand for physical gold paired with supply chain issues for sourcing the precious metal has increased the price per ounce. Bloomberg reported earlier this week the price of gold futures spiked against the price of gold in a premium not seen in over 40 years due to the inability to settle contracts physically in New York City as COVID-19 spreads.Gold-backed crypto tokens currently hold a premium for traditional trading of both spot and futures gold markets on exchanges such as FTX. However, current prices could be a continuation of past premiums held by gold-backed tokens, according to CoinDesk Research.Indeed, PAXG and XAUT have consistently held above the spot price of gold since their inceptions. XAUT launched in January 2020; PAXG launched in September 2019.Read more: Bitcoin Is a Safe Haven for a Worse Storm Than ThisStill, traders are looking for small denominations of gold, which are becoming more and more difficult to find, Sebag said. “Something changed in the last few days. Not a lack of physical gold, but denomination problems,” Sebag said. “Definitely a shortage.”Paxos said the increased demand for PAXG is not leading to the supply constraints reportedly seen by Tether.“We're only dealing with London LBMA gold, and there is plenty of metal there! Benefits of being a trusted, regulated player – we can get access to that market unlike anyone else,” McClain said.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

There, a natively-integrated crypto widget executes actions via Binance and Binance.US, depending on the user’s country.  Most of those features are not functional at launch, CoinDesk found. The widget is only accessible on Brave’s “Nightly” developer-stage browser, and as of Wednesday afternoon it is limited to booting up purchase orders through the Binance Fiat Gateway. Brave said a wider release is expected in April.Brave’s CEO Brendan Eich declined to disclose the terms of the deal. “Adding a widget that seamlessly helps users acquire and trade crypto is a natural evolution of our features,” Eich told CoinDesk. He said the “crypto-savvy” user base has been “clamoring” for a trade function to go along with Brave’s existing ethereum wallet.See also: The Overton Window Opens for a Digital DollarBrave is working on mobile wallets and plans to expand it to other blockchains, he said. Brave has been courting the crypto community for much of its existence as a privacy-centric alternative to other, more popular browser services. In 2017, it ran a $35 million ICO for its ERC-20 “Basic Attention Tokens,” now the backbone for the Brave Rewards ad views compensation system. The addition of a trading tool puts Brave more squarely in the race with other crypto-focused browsers, like Opera, which holds over 2 percent market share according to statcounter (Brave’s privacy functions make it difficult to measure its slice of the pie).Opera recently expanded its integrated crypto purchase functions.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

He is also the cofounder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.","Most burgeoning crypto enthusiasts go through a phase in life where they think to themselves: “Bitcoin is neat, but it would be so much better if it could just do x and y?” At this point, they either decide to hop aboard a new blockchain project (typically seeking to own a larger fraction of the supply than the share of bitcoin they own), or they reject the notion and stick with bitcoin.I’ll call this former group (it could be better) ""crypto progressives."" Like political progressives, they are interested in making changes to society, unsatisfied with the status quo.Crypto progressives often wonder why Bitcoiners are interested only in bitcoin (BTC), given that so many apparently technically superior alternatives exist. How could they possibly ignore a dizzying buffet of alternatives? The crypto progressive sometimes accuse Bitcoiners of falling prey to the endowment effect, of refusing to budge because of their established stake in the Bitcoin system. And indeed, there are significant transaction costs involved with taking one’s bitcoin wealth and embracing a new blockchain. But this is not the chief reason for rejecting alternatives.See also: Nic Carter - How to Stop the Next Quadriga: Make Exchanges Prove Their ReservesBitcoiners tend to resent the accusation that their adherence to a sole project is merely contingent – a historical coincidence which they clung to out of habit. When pressed, they typically refer to one of two main justifications:1. Bitcoin is the sole instantiation of a set of political and economic conditions for a successful monetary project. In a sense, Bitcoin fulfilled requirements it may have already had for a successful monetary alternative, and it was only in 2009 that these requirements were met.2. Monetary goods rely on network effects by design; once a market leader is established, efforts at fragmentation are counterproductive.I tend to think the first set of arguments is persuasive on its own. Bitcoin prides certain important qualities that other alternatives jettison, and is genuinely unique in this way. This is not to say that other protocols are without merit but they generally opt for different tradeoffs, tending to prioritize innovation over institutional stability. Some of bitcoin’s underlying principles include:There’s other ways to describe the economic and political nature of bitcoin, but I would posit these as the most important. If you think values are important in the design of a monetary system, you are a Bitcoiner out of deliberate choice, not contingency. But there’s an even more persuasive argument to be made against mutinous alternatives. It is the logical incoherence of crypto progressivism.This is the idea that, if you replace a monetary standard and propose your own, you have no reasonable grounds to defend against someone else’s rebellion over your standard, and their campaign to replace it with their own. And so, if you commit to the permanent revolution, you end up with a recursive situation where no stable monetary standard is ever selected.Hal Finney was perhaps one of the first Bitcoiners to ever make this point. In a comment on Bitcointalk in 2011, he pithily explained the issue with crypto progressivism:“Any successful replacement of the Bitcoin blockchain will forever undermine the credibility of any successor. How is an investor to know that it won’t happen again?Rebooting now may benefit a few thousand early adopters. What happens when hundreds of millions use Bitcoin 2? They’ll be just as jealous and envious of you as you are of others. Given the precedent you want to set, how will you argue against yet another reboot?”Interestingly, Hal was responding to a thread (written in May 2011, when the price of bitcoin was about $8) suggesting the stash of coins Satoshi Nakamoto and others mined early in 2009 constituted a ""tax"" on late adopters, and agitating for a relaunch of bitcoin.See also: Nic Carter - Policymakers Shouldn’t Fear Digital Money: So Far It’s Maintaining the Dollar’s StatusHal understood that if one’s objection to bitcoin was the empowerment of early adopters this would be a problem for all other would-be replacements. Interestingly, the circumstances of bitcoin’s birth were rather favorable as far as distribution is concerned. Satoshi appears to not have claimed his million or so coins. Many cheaply acquired coins from that era are lost. And due to the lack of a pre-mine and the presence of PoW, everyone who earned coins had to pay market price for them (either at an exchange or with electricity).It’s an inescapable reality that the rise of any novel monetary system – which entails demonetizing an existing Store-of-Value asset in favor of a new one, as has happened countless times in history – will benefit those earliest to make the switch. This is the case, for example, in dollarization events, when it is those who are earliest to desert the local currency that benefit from favorable exchange rates, to the detriment of their laggard peers. So monetary transitions involve wealth redistribution by their very nature. So far, we have not devised a means to take a snapshot of the distribution of wealth and replicate it in a new monetary medium. The more pressing questions to me are: how frequently should we churn monetary systems? And how much better must a successor be, to justify replacing an established one?Those who style themselves crypto progressives when rejecting the orthodoxy almost inevitably become crypto conservatives as they settle on a system they like.The example of Ethereum is telling. Ethereum initially competed with Bitcoin on features such as a more expressive base layer, theoretically cheaper transactions, greater throughput, and a commitment to rapid innovation. But when other blockchains like EOS came about and took these ideas to their extreme (by compromising on validation costs, EOS offers more block space than Ethereum), most Ethereans did not desert their blockchain in favor of the newcomer. Even though they had justified their initial rejection of bitcoin with recourse to the exact same language that EOS fans were now using to renounce Ethereum, they for the most part held firm, making reference to the growing network effects in the Ethereum infrastructure that had been built so far. And this was a reasonable retort! From a societal perspective, it is costly to upend an established system every few years.So, those who style themselves crypto progressives when rejecting the orthodoxy almost inevitably become crypto-conservatives as they settle on a system they like. Therein lies the paradox. Now I am not suggesting that novel alternative blockchains that explore the tradeoff space are illegitimate. Rather, their proponents should admit that they are simply positing a different set of values to those espoused by established blockchains, rather than blandly touting their improved feature-set and assuming that users will make the switch. Monetary systems are fraught and political by their very nature, and coaxing users away is a matter of convincing them to upend an established institution that they have come to trust. The permanent revolution gets tiresome. Most people eventually want to settle down and cultivate their own garden.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The hostile hard fork is scheduled for Friday.","""My own opinion, Justin Sun thought this was a voting war,"" Blocktrades founder Dan Notestein told CoinDesk. Blocktrades is a leading validator on the Steem blockchain and Notestein is among the developers coordinating the hard fork's software.Sun's Tron Foundation acquired Steemit, Steem’s leading social media dapp, on Feb. 14. The acquisition kicked off a protracted fight between Sun and the Steem community over which side leads the chain. At issue is a pile of Steemit Inc.-controlled steem tokens known as the “ninja-mined stake” that Sun could have used to determine the blockchain’s fate.For this initial hard fork, one key thing will change: The tokens from the original development fund controlled by Steemit will not be carried over to the new chain. Everyone else's will be ported over.“He didn't understand that the underlying value of those tokens is the community,” Notestein said. “In the end, if not enough people support those tokens, they become worthless.""In short, rather than continue the fight for Steem, prominent community leaders hope to take their community with them to greener pastures.Read more: Justin Sun Bought Steemit. Steem Moved to Limit His PowerSteem is best known as a crypto alternative to Medium. Bloggers write posts and share a small portion of the block rewards based on the popularity of their posts.Notestein runs a top witness (like a bitcoin miner) on Steem. He also runs a service somewhat like ShapeShift that makes it easy to switch between coins.Last night he wrote a post on Steem that reflected conversations currently going on within a Slack group detailing the rough plan to hard fork the blockchain so the Tron Foundation gets shut out of it entirely. The new blockchain is tentatively known as ""Hive.""The nature of Steem makes this fairly easy.Read more: Why Crypto Should Care About Justin Sun’s Steem DramaBasically, the fork's developers will make a copy of the blockchain, which has the unique characteristic of carrying in it copies of all the blog posts that people have written to date.This means that with a hard fork all the blogging data is preserved. Other dapps supporting the blogging function can just redirect to the copy of that data on the new blockchain. Notestein said many of the dapps besides Steemit will do so, but CoinDesk has not been able to confirm that as of press time. Steemian, a Steemit alternative, said it would fully make the switch, though it would wait as long as a couple of weeks to help users transition over. The game Splinterlands, which is the most popular Steem dapp, according to Dapp.com, confirmed it would make the switch once the chain was stable and the team had adjusted all the technology on its end. The owner of SteemD, a block explorer, told CoinDesk it would do some kind of format that lets users choose between the two. For many dapps, the switch will require rebranding. The fork captures the decentralized nature of blockchains. Both chains will have all the content submitted before the hard fork. Which blockchain future content gets posted to will depend on which user interface a user uses. Presumably, if a user is used to blogging on Steemit, their post-hard-fork posts will still get saved on the chain with Justin Sun's tokens.The Tron Foundation did not respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk.In terms of steem token supplies, the developers will take a snapshot of all the wallets at some block then allocate the same token volume to all the wallets on the new chain. Everyone with tokens on Steem will also have tokens on the new chain; that is, except for the Steemit wallets controlled by Sun’s Tron Foundation.""Our immediate plan is to keep it simple. We are doing this very quickly,"" Notestein said. Read more: Steem Community Mobilizes Popular Vote in Battle With Justin SunHowever, there will be one tweak so that exchanges will be much less likely to vote their tokens on behalf of someone trying to run a governance coup, as Binance and Huobi did on Tron's behalf recently (each has since expressed regret for doing so). ""One of the initial changes will be an improvement in the DPoS [distributed proof-of-stake] system to prevent attacks of this sort,"" Notestein said. Basically, if a user on the new blockchain stakes their tokens, they won't be able to engage in governance votes for 30 days.Steem is unique in the degree to which governance requires users to really lock-in their assets. Once someone decides to vote their tokens, they are locked up for a long time (""powering up""). It takes 13 weeks for all the tokens to ""power down"" in Steem parlance (they release gradually over that time).Currently valued at $46 million on CoinMarketCap, Notestein expects steem tokens to plummet in value after the hard fork. He said users are holding now because they want to get the new blockchain's tokens, then he expects steem will be widely dumped. Notestein himself is a steem whale, and he said he plans to dump accordingly.In terms of establishing value for the new token, Notestein believes one exchange will list it. He also plans to launch an exchange on which the Steem community can use the new token. They already have the technology ready, he said.Notestein thinks much of the content-contributing community will switch over. Notestein's post about the fork yielded more than 1,700 votes and over 700 comments.""The way Justin Sun has come in, he's just rubbed everybody wrong,"" Notestein said. ""The thing about Steem is it basically introduces people to a lot of the ideas of crypto even if they just come here to blog.""Case in point: As talks broke down, Sun took to Steemit himself to urge witnesses to come over to his side. But he let his frustration show. In a March 5 post since largely deleted (but whose original lives on inside the blockchain) Sun asked: ""Do you like Justin Sun or you just want to fuck him?"" It went on from there in a similar spirit.""Steem is a much more social blockchain. It's kind of a different feel,"" Notestein said. ""That really was our number one goal: to maintain that community from really an existential threat from Tron.""The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

New warnings from authorities over the growing risks from the spreading coronavirus sent stocks reeling, leading to fresh promises of cash injections from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ","The largest cryptocurrency by market value slid 0.5 percent to $7,846 as of 20:20 UTC (4:20 p.m. Eastern time). It was the lowest price in two months, and the decline trimmed bitcoin’s year-to-date gains to 9.5 percent. Yet, the price drop in bitcoin was nowhere near the severity seen in U.S. stocks on Wednesday, with the benchmark S&P 500 Index plunging nearly 5 percent. The sell-off on Wall Street was so broad that even gold, seen by many investors as a reliable safe haven in times of economic and market distress, slid 1 percent to $1,644 an ounce. Governments and central banks around the world moved to provide new aid packages and monetary stimulus to blunt the economic impact of the contagion. The virus, and efforts to contain it, have led to widespread business disruptions and travel cancellations, while crimping supply chains for factories and sapping consumer confidence.The New York Fed, the biggest among the Federal Reserve’s 12 regional branches, said in a statement Wednesday afternoon it would increase an overnight lending program for Wall Street bond dealers for the second time this week. The cap on the short-term loans, which the firms rely on to supplement cash when market liquidity is tight, will now increase to $175 billion, from the $150 billion set on Monday. Previously, the so-called “repo” loans were capped at $100 billion. And in a move that was would have been unthinkable until recently, the European Central Bank could slash its benchmark interest rate, according to analysts at JPMorgan Chase. The biggest U.S. bank predicted the ECB, led by President Christine Lagarde, could decide Thursday after a meeting in Frankfurt to also boost its “quantitative easing” asset-purchasing program to 40 billion euros ($22 billion) a month from the current pace of 20 billion euros.“What you’re really seeing at a global level is this oscillation between risk-on and risk-off as you get this progressive disclosure of how bad is the actual virus, and also how bad is the response,” said Mike Alfred, co-founder and CEO of the cryptocurrency-focused data provider Digital Assets Data. “There’s going to be a lot more days like the last few days over the next few months.”The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus to be a pandemic, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a news conference in Berlin that some 60 percent to 70 percent of the population could become infected in the country of 82 million citizens. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a congressional hearing in Washington the coronavirus is at least 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu, even if the mortality rate ends up being lower than the World Health Organization’s current estimate of 3.4 percent, according to CNBC.The Bank of England took the emergency step of slashing interest rates to support the economy, coordinated with a U.K. government announcement of a new 30 billion-pound ($39 billion) fiscal stimulus package. Bank of America said Wednesday in a report the Federal Reserve, led by Chair Jerome Powell, might move as soon as next week to announce monetary-stimulus measures similar to those used in the financial crisis over a decade ago. In a matter of months in 2008, from August to December, the Fed’s balance sheet doubled in size to more than $2 trillion, and it doubled again during the next few years to over $4 trillion. Digital Assets Data’s Alfred drew a contrast between breadth of official responses in traditional markets and the absence of any changes in the computer-based protocol governing the decentralized blockchain network that bitcoin runs on. The system was designed 11 years ago with hard and specific rules that stipulate the pace of issuance of new units of the cryptocurrency. Indeed, many bitcoin investors say the digital asset’s price is likely to rise this year in conjunction with an upcoming, once-every-four-years “halving,” where the number of new bitcoins issued per new data block “mined” – roughly every 10 minutes or so – will decline by half to 6.25 from 12.5. It’s such a widely anticipated event that members of the cryptocurrency community have even created Internet-based countdown clocks to chronicle the event, now just 60 days away. That puts it on or around May 11.   “You would expect that to be a positive for bitcoin,” said Mark Warner, head of trading for London-based BCB Group, a financial firm focused on digital assets. Yet, in the current environment, there appears to be a rush by investors everywhere to avoid further losses, and bitcoin “is not immune,” Warner said. While he had expected recently that bitcoin’s price would find support around the $8,000 level, the market “blew through that.” He now sees potential support at $7,000, though he wouldn’t rule out a decline to $6,500. “Looking at what the coronavirus is doing, as well as what oil prices have done, there's just chaos all over and people are derisking,” Warner said. Greg Cipolaro, co-founder of the cryptocurrency-focused Digital Asset Research, told CoinDesk he has started keeping his own spreadsheet to track newly reported coronavirus cases. He’s watching for the moment when the number of new cases reported over the past seven days starts to fall below the number reported for the prior week. “I think it's topical,” Cipolaro wrote in an email. “My personal opinion is that markets won't settle down until we slow the coronavirus growth rate, like China and Korean have done. Fears are running rampant, and exponential growth models are being forecasted out ad infinitum.”Mati Greenspan, founder of the research firm Quantum Economics, which analyzes cryptocurrencies and foreign exchange, wrote in an email to clients that it’s not unreasonable to expect bitcoin to trade in synch with stocks for the foreseeable future.“This might come later on, once we understand more about the economic impact and how long it might take to see some sort of recovery,” Greenspan said.  The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Binance USD runs on top of the Ethereum blockchain.Stablecoins are blockchain-based and tied to traditional assets or currencies, such as U.S. dollars. They are used for trading on cryptocurrency exchanges, generally where crypto/fiat pairs are unavailable due to regulatory or banking reasons. BUSD is backed by U.S. dollars in an FDIC-insured U.S. bank and audited on a monthly basis. Binance is one such exchange where one cannot trade cryptocurrencies using dollars. Therefore, stablecoins like BUSD are important to its business. It lists several other stablecoins, including Tether (USDT), which has much higher volume on Binance than BUSD. In fact, the majority of trading in BUSD, almost 40 percent market, is with Tether while the BUSD/BTC trading pair is second at 35 percent, according to data from CoinGecko. Almost every asset listed on Binance is paired with Tether, and its volumes are substantial. For example, the USDT/BTC pair had $611 million in volume the past 24 hours. The BUSD/BTC pair only had $16 million in volume during that time.Yet, BUSD, with its promising early gains, has a shot at being the dollar-backed crypto asset to beat. New York-based Paxos told CoinDesk that BUSD’s market capitalization has grown by more than 400 percent in the past month to $115 million from $22 million.“The spectacular growth of BUSD shows that the market is hungry for an alternative. We're excited about this milestone and proud to partner with Binance to deliver an optimal solution for our global users,” Paxos co-founder Rich Teo said in a statement Wednesday. Stablecoin titan Tether, with a market cap of $4.6 billion, is facing a battle with New York's Attorney General in a court case delving into its financial practices. Tether has never issued a full audit of its reserves, although it does have a regularly updated transparency page. In addition to BUSD, other bank-audited stablecoins include the Circle and Coinbase-backed USDC, which has a $406 million market cap. Paxos also has its own branded stablecoin, Paxos Standard, which has a $206 million market capitalization. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Reactor, used in many cryptocurrency law enforcement actions, will help the exchange’s compliance officers police their network, according to a press release.The announcement follows the South Korean National Assembly's early March vote to amend the Special Financial Transactions Information Act, which, once signed into law, will force all virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to register with the government and submit to an internet security certification program. Bithumb is one of the few South Korean VASPs to have already completed both aspects.The National Assembly’s vote brings its money transmission laws more in line with the Financial Action Task Force’s recommendations around VASPs last year, ahead of a June deadline for countries to comply.But the 12-month deal with Chainalysis also addresses the spate of recent hacks against Bithumb, a historically hack-ridden exchange that has lost tens of millions in crypto – and in a country, South Korea, that has become an exchange raider’s billion-dollar honeypot.  “They had an immediate need for Reactor to manage their hack last year, and wanted to focus on boosting their investigative skills,” said Chainalysis’ Head of Communications Maddie Kennedy.Many private-sector crypto companies partner with Chainalysis, though not always for Reactor. Tether uses “Know Your Transaction” to build risk profiles, as does Bittrex, Binance and some 150 other VASPs around the world, by Chainalysis’ own count. Kennedy said Bithumb and Chainalysis are now in talks to provide KYT, too.Other above-board Korean VASPs are also gearing up for the new regulations. Korbit CEO Caleb Oh said his exchange “is considering making various investments” to comply with the amendment and the Financial Action Task Force’s “travel rule.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

PMI tracks the overall health of the U.S. manufacturing and service sectors and it came in at 40.5, down from 49.6 in February, the largest drop since 2008. “We may very well be in a recession, but I would point to the difference between this and a normal recession,” U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said March 26 in an interview with NBC. “There is nothing fundamentally wrong with our economy,” he added. On Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said his department will work with Congress on creating financing programs, which he estimated could involve as much as $4 trillion. In addition, the government intends to provide another $2 trillion in stimulus to individual Americans, a measure passed unanimously in the Senate and set for vote in the House Friday. “Pouring $6 trillion artificially creates somewhat of a ‘positive’ effect. But to me it’s like a bomb in slow motion.

But when the regulator decided in 2017 that companies hold just as much fiat as their clients held crypto – the “double-reserve” requirement – previously licensed crypto companies, including Coinbase, fled the state arguing that the mandate was irrational, untenable and bad for consumers. DFI now appears to recognize that its bar was too high. In the sandbox initiative's FAQ, HTDC writes that DFI “wanted to address the concerns” of businesses who could not meet the regulatory requirements.A DFI spokesman confirmed that the sandbox does away with the double reserve requirement.DFI pledged not to take action against sandbox participants, the press release said. “DFI is leveraging its statutory authority to provide an innovative way to introduce digital currency issuers into the State of Hawaii, while ensuring the safety of our consumers,” Iris Ikeda, Commissioner of Financial Institutions, said in the press release.Ikeda further stated that the sandbox would allow regulators to “craft legislation that is conducive to [cryptocurrencies] development in Hawaii.”Hawaii’s sandbox is not a regulatory free-for-all, according to the press release.

Running on an enterprise version of the RSK Smart Contract Network, Gasnet is designed to secure and speed Argentina’s chronically delayed gas certification processes.“When you want to certify a new gas connection for a home or a company today you need to send many documents,” said Grupo Sabra co-founder Pedro Perrota. From technician-consumer agreements to certification paperwork and other documentation, “all those things today in Argentina take a lot of time” to process, Perrota said. Up to three months, in fact.Not so under Gasnet. In the now-operational consortium network, certification documents and transaction details zip between Gasnor and Enargas, each of whom run a network node. That increases visibility and smooths out otherwise crippling delays, Perrota says, allowing technicians to ultimately bring consumer’s gas services online faster. “They are basically using the blockchain to certify the different steps,” said IOV Labs CEO Diego Gutierrez. “They’re giving private keys to each one of the professionals involved in the process, so they do the certification work using this shared system.”Certification is just the beginning, though. IOV Labs and Grupo Sabra say Gasnet’s shared ecosystem can facilitate any number of services. Technician’s credentials, for example, are crucially important, given the dangerous nature of natural gas infrastructure. But what of an unscrupulous contractor who flees a checkered safety history in Buenos Aires and sets up shop instead in, say, the far smaller town of Salta in the country's north? Under the current system, his track record does not necessarily follow him north, but with Gasnet it would. “When you have a common database, everyone can see your track record,” Pedro Perrota said. Gasnet has even bigger goals, too. It wants to become the common database for Argentina’s entire gas distribution ecosystem, for all nine regulated companies, Perrota and Gutierrez said.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Last Thursday also beat Coinbase’s previous traffic record by over 50 percent, Armstrong said. Where other platforms experienced issues and outages, Armstrong noted that Coinbase remained operational, saying the exchange has been preparing for a crisis “for the last couple years.”“This hard work contributed to our stability last week while many platforms, in both crypto and traditional equities, struggled with the increased volume,” Armstrong wrote, crediting the company's engineering team specifically.Jesse Pollak, the head of engineering for Coinbase's consumer division, told CoinDesk in a phone call the platform has been preparing since the 2017 bull run, focusing on both the actual exchange’s matching engine as well as consumer products such as its API.Some of this work included horizontal scaling on the database end, Pollak said. The company said it was scaling out its databases to enable more reads without interrupting writes (meaning the exchange can view the data stored on its servers while simultaneously adding new data without either operation slowing down the other as transactions are executed).The move comes, of course, as Coinbase and other firms deal with coronavirus-induced remote work mandates. Armstrong has for weeks publicized his exchange’s pandemic response in a regularly updated blog series. California announced a statewide shelter-in-place order on Thursday.Pollak said that though Coinbase’s employees are currently remote (the exchange began implementing remote work last week in response to the COVID-19 outbreak), the engineering team used a combination of automated alerts and chatrooms to keep up with the spikes in traffic. “If we're going to be hitting higher highs than what we've seen, we'll generally pull together people into a hangout just have them available, ready, hanging out, chatting there, looking at all the metrics,” he said.Still, Pollak told CoinDesk that trading platforms are complex, and a lack of mistakes doesn’t necessarily mean a platform won’t experience any issues.“From an engineering camaraderie perspective, I think it's just worth highlighting that scaling products is really freaking hard, and we put a lot of work into it and I think that paid off last weekend,” he said.

this ...","Mar 9, 2020 at 02:15 UTC","Micree Ketuan Zhan, the ousted co-founder of Bitmain, has filed another lawsuit in his fight to regain control of the bitcoin mining giant – this time in his home country.","A recent notice from the Changle District court in China’s Fujian province indicates Zhan has filed a lawsuit against Bitmain’s fully-owned subsidiary Fujian Zhanhua Intelligence Technologies, as well as Beijing Bitmain Technologies as a related third party. A hearing of the case was scheduled on Feb. 11, according to the notice, although it's likely postponed due to the disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak. While it’s not clear what the exact allegations are, the court says the case relates to a “shareholder qualification confirmation dispute.”The case adds to the ongoing litigation in the Cayman Islands Zhan has filed against the company he co-founded with Jihan Wu in 2013, casting further uncertainty on the outcome of the power struggle at the world’s largest miner maker as well as its planned initial public offering in the U.S.Zhan filed a lawsuit in December in the Caymans, where Bitmain’s parent holding entity is registered, asking a court to void a decision allegedly passed at a shareholder meeting that significantly curtailed his voting power. Lawyers representing Zhan in the Cayman Islands previously told CoinDesk that Zhan, as a major shareholder, was not aware of the meeting beforehand, and a hearing for the case might be scheduled after the Easter holiday. The lawsuit in China also followed an asset-protection petition filed by Zhan and approved by the same court in December, but the court’s full judgment was not made public until last Thursday.The court sided with Zhan to freeze 36 percent of Fujian Zhanhua’s 10 million yuan incorporated shares owned by Bitmain, worth 3.6 million yuan, or $500,000. Though the value of the frozen assets may be negligible for Bitmain, the percentage could be significant.Fujian Zhanhua is 100 percent owned by Beijing Bitmain, whose parent company is Cayman-registered BitMain Technologies Holding, of which Zhan remains the largest shareholder – with 36 percent. That means Zhan indirectly owns 36 percent of Fujian Zhanhua, suggesting the asset-protection move is intended to prevent his power over this subsidiary from being transferred or diluted.Under the court’s asset-protection order, Beijing Bitmain will not be able to transfer or pledge these frozen assets as collateral, nor would it be able to increase the subsidiary’s total incorporated capital in order to dilute the percentage of the frozen ownership. It may appear surprising that Zhan would file a case against one subsidiary out of a dozen entities under Bitmain’s holding firm, and in a court in Fujian instead of Bitmain’s home base in Beijing. But the importance of Fujian Zhanhua could hint at Zhan’s strategy for fighting back since he was ousted in a coup in November 2019.To be sure, Zhan, a Fujian native, is still the legal representative of Fujian Zhanhua, a firm that was ranked 58th by the Fujian provincial government in 2018 out of the top 100 taxpayer companies. And Bitmain’s Hong Kong IPO filing in 2018 listed Fujian Zhanhua as one of the four principal subordinate entities that had made material contribution to the financial results of Bitmain’s holding group, alongside Beijing Bitmain, Bitmain Hong Kong and a Shenzhen manufacturing subsidiary.The document specified the principal business activity of Fujian Zhanhua as Bitmain’s “sales center for cryptocurrency mining hardware” in China. Bitmain booked over $2.5 billion in revenue in 2017 alone, of which about 95 percent came from sales of its mining hardware. And the mainland China market counted for nearly 50 percent of the total sales volume that year.In fact, Bitmain’s two major sales channels – the AntMiner pre-sales and post-sales WeChat accounts – were previously owned and operated by Fujian Zhanhua. However, the ownership for both channels was migrated to another, lesser-known Bitmain subsidiary in December, whose legal representative is not Zhan.  Further, the IPO document revealed the Fujian subsidiary played a vital role in one of Bitmain’s financing activities in 2018.In July 2018, Beijing Bitmain signed a series of purchase agreements worth $100 million to buy an office building in Beijing. To finance that transaction, it borrowed $49 million from a local bank with the acquired property pledged as collateral and with Fujian Zhanhua as a guarantor, underscoring the financial wherewithal of the Fujian subsidiary. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Mar 9, 2020 at 05:00 UTC","It’s about to be easier than ever to take risky bets using ethereum-based financial products, thanks to the crypto wallet startup Argent. ","Paradigm, spearheaded by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam, just led Argent’s $12 million Series A, along with Compound founder Robert Leshner and Index Ventures. The London-based wallet startup has now raised $16 million since it was founded in December 2017. “I don’t know what the revenue model will be, but we know it’s going to attract a lot of users.” Leshner said of Argent. “They are creating one of the smoothest on-ramps to DeFi [decentralized finance] products.”Leshner said he was attracted to the investment opportunity because the startup offers a unique combination of “smart contract architecture” and a “convenient user experience.” Plus, the crypto wallet has social recovery features so users can get their accounts back if they lose phones.Argent Chief Executive Itamar Lesuisse said there are more than 3,000 active user accounts already during the six-month closed beta, and more than 1,000 people on the waiting list for the public launch in April. He said so far more than half of them use DeFi products, like loans and interest-bearing deposits.“DeFi was the reason to come to Argent,” Lessuisse described the user feedback as being.Users can now take out a crypto-backed loan, for example, with just a few clicks of a button. These DeFi products involve technical risks, he added, related to “bugs inside the smart contracts.” But he said the DeFi companies, not the wallet itself, are the ones responsible for disclosures related to specific products.One such provider, the Maker Foundation, said in a press statement it’s “very supportive of Argent's work to make it more easy, more secure and more convenient for more people to participate in DeFi.”Paradigm partner Matt Huang said his firm was attracted to Argent because it “strikes a nice balance between security and usability.”Lesuisse said his 17-person startup’s mobile wallet is “as simple as Venmo,” and will expand its DeFi product options this year.The mobile wallet is indeed designed for simplicity. It allows users to purchase crypto with their debit cards or Apple Pay accounts, through partnerships with Wyre and MoonPay. Yet, critics like blockchain consultant Udi Wertheimer say once funds from the wallet are plugged into the DeFi ecosystem, then Maker or Compound manage funds and the funds can be taken away from users at any point.This wallet has a unique identifier associated with the phone and a back-up recovery method set up with either Argent or the user’s friend or relative, which is unique compared to similar mobile wallets with private keys. However, the DeFi loans and contracts taken with the wallet are still arguably under the realm of various providers such as Compound. Last month, the DeFi project bZx, which isn’t accessible through Argent, was hacked through a smart contract vulnerability that led to a loss of just under $1 million. “Although we make the experience simple, these are still complex financial products,” Lesuisse said of DeFi.Argent is not currently focused on monetization. Instead, it receives some small fees from DeFi providers like the Kyber exchange. So far, Lesuisse said, the average user has roughly $2,000 in their Argent wallet.“It’s an easy way for consumers to interact with DeFi. Argent can’t prevent some of the risks that might occur in the DeFi space overall,” Huang said, acknowledging the risks associated with smart contract bugs. “As a user, you’re still exposed to and should be comfortable with the actions you take.” The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The Kleiman estate is suing Wright for half the bitcoin as well as intellectual property.After a mysterious ""bonded courier"" failed to arrive with the keys early in 2020, Wright told the court he is unable to prove his access to the trust due to attorney-client privilege.Earlier this month, presiding District Magistrate Bruce Reinhart dismissed Wright's argument and apparently questioned the lawyer's existence.According to a March 9 filing, Wright had presented a declaration stating: “I am lawyer [sic] and obtained my bachelor of law degree in 2007 from Moi University in Kenya.” Reinhart said he also introduced ""a printout of a LinkedIn profile that reflects Mr. Mayaka having a Bachelor of Laws degree from Moi University,"" and asserted that Mayaka is counsel to the trust.Also read: Messages Proving Wright Created Bitcoin Likely ‘Faked,’ Developer Testifies“I decline to rely on this kind of document, which could easily have been generated by anyone with word processing software and a pen,” Reinhart said.The judge found last summer that Wright had argued in bad faith, committed perjury and admitted false evidence during the case.According to Wright, the latest order ""improperly relied on prior conclusions about [the] defendant that were unrelated to the existence of an attorney-client relationship and, in so doing, ignored the fundamental and bedrock principle of our legal system.""Wright has notoriously said he is the inventor of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, but has yet to provide conclusive evidence to support the claim.Read Craig Wright's filing in full below:The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Although Israel's parliament is still hammering out the logistics of this mandatory program, Ynet news reported the Health Ministry activated the initiative on Wednesday, texting 400 people to inform them they were exposed to the virus and must now stay in quarantine.In the face of COVID-19’s exponential growth, governments worldwide are weighing which tools to deploy. Supporters of the emergency measures in Israel argue aggressive outreach will save lives, while critics say these government powers won’t be rolled back after the pandemic winds down. “Both sides are justified,” Libracamp and Matchpool co-founder Yonatan Ben Simon said. “I don’t worry about what I can’t control.”Surveillance is more widespread in this nation of nine million than in others, which is why many Israelis aren't panicking, even if they are skeptical of government intervention.“They will do it again for other things,” Ben Simon said of the emergency coronavirus measures.The Israeli bitcoin (BTC) community’s reaction to this news is as diverse as its participants. Some have suggested these measures are a threat to Israeli democracy itself while others are working with governments to build surveillance tools.“We’re seeing trust in the government shattered in a power grab that might destroy 80 years of democracy as we know it,” said blockchain consultant Maya Zehavi.See also: In Fight Against Coronavirus, Governments Face Trade-Offs on PrivacyTel Aviv Bitcoin Embassy volunteer Sarah Wiesner is also concerned about these emergency measures.“I imagined they could do this before. It's not shocking. But making this legally easy to access is terrifying and makes you want to wear [an anti-facial-recognition] mask and walk around without a cellphone,” she said.Given related responses to the spread of the virus, there’s reason to believe this crisis will catalyze other changes. For example, Israel’s transportation ministry is banning the use of cash on most public transit, a policy that was already in place in Tel Aviv. Instead, people use ID cards loaded at public offices.Wiesner isn’t sure whether her movements are tracked this way as well, but she is generally concerned about the normalization of sweeping surveillance.“They don't miss a chance to gather information,” she said of Israel’s government. “The cash ban on buses has nothing to do with the coronavirus. But they decided to push the schedule to the rest of Israel faster.”Many Israelis aren’t alarmed by these emergency measures because they seem to be more of the same for a country technically at war since its founding in 1948.One East Jerusalem resident, who asked to remain anonymous in order to speak freely, said such surveillance policies don’t concern him any more than usual. The Arab-Israeli citizen who used to commute to work in Tel Aviv’s crypto industry said coming under scrutiny is already routine for him.“[Soldiers] hang out a lot in our neighborhood. They know the color of our underwear. There’s not much to hide. It’s a small country so they know everything about everyone,” he said regarding how these surveillance tactics are already common for use against Palestinians. That's why, he said, he’s not bullish on bitcoin. In his situation, censorship-resistance feels futile.Bitcoin is more often viewed as another payment or investment tool in Israel these days, rarely as a political or criminal tool like in the West. In a country where most people go to the army, there’s a broad understanding that civilians and terrorists often use the same tools. Regardless of whether it’s with balloons or bitcoin, people who live under the watch of an army know tools can only be used to circumnavigate laws as long as the military doesn’t physically (or digitally) stop them.Back at the Tel Aviv Bitcoin Embassy, the bitcoin ATM will be the only open aspect of the nonprofit, said co-founder Meni Rosenfeld. Gatherings of over a dozen people are now strongly discouraged, and the government can tell through mobile data who disobeys. A civil liberties group has already started petitioning the Israeli Supreme Court to suspend the monitoring program.The East Jerusalem resident joked that now Jews can enjoy the same surveillance Palestinians have known for decades.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Preparations must include employee protection strategies, increased cyber-risk mitigation, disaster communication plans and procedures to ensure the continued functioning of critical operations “at a minimum.” They must also lay out their point-by-point plans for the eventuality of a potentially snowballing outbreak.The regulator showed particular concern over the possibility hackers might try exploiting the virus outbreak. NYDFS “underscored” the risk of under-the-radar hacks and implored firms to consider implementing more robust security measures that could detect “fraudulent trading or withdrawal behavior.”The agency further highlighted the chance remote workers could imperil custodied assets as they move funds from “cold” (offline) storage to “hot” (internet connected) wallets.Firms are required to submit their plans in the next 30 days, but preferably “as soon as possible,” according to the letter. A NYDFS press officer did not immediately respond to questions over whether the request applies to all BitLicense holders.The request offers a striking look at New York’s in-the-moment response to a crisis growing more layered by the hour. When NYDFS issued the memo on Tuesday, New York state was already days into a coronavirus-triggered state of emergency. But businesses across the state and its namesake city, where most of New York’s virtual currency firms are based, were still mulling what, if anything, to do in response to the outbreak.By Thursday, that dynamic had seemed to change, however. Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a moratorium on mass gatherings and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City declared a citywide state of emergency, warning the public that coronavirus could “easily be a six-month crisis” in near back-to-back press conferences.The drastic shift in public opinion, government outlook and business realities across the week made the plans that only days earlier seem preventative appear far more vital to New York state’s daily life.

Several exchanges were forced to close due to the banking restrictions and others eked out a living on crypto-to-crypto trading or other means.In its post, Kraken said it was ""thrilled"" to see the Reserve Bank of India's ban overturned, and would ""recommit resources to grow its service in the region through new features and offerings."" Among those was a hint it may target the massive remittance market in India, with Kraken keen to help Indians save and ""send value"" to friends and family overseas.For more precise information on its plans, we'll have to wait till later in the year, Kraken wrote.While the court ruling was exciting news for the crypto space, the regulatory situation in the nation is still not rosy, however. The central bank has reportedly said it would return to fight the supreme court ruling, though that may be a long shot. More worryingly, the country's government has been mulling cryptocurrency regulation for years, with some reports suggesting an outright ban.Even if untrue, India's crypto and blockchain industry can't fully thrive and find the investment it needs until the situation has been made clear. Local exchanges said this month there is a strong appetite for cryptocurrencies and derivatives in the nation.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Mar 12, 2020 at 18:40 UTC",A large drop in the price of ether (ETH) is testing the feasibility of Ethereum's entire system of lending and borrowing.,"MakerDAO is the largest and most important application in Ethereum's decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Right now, it faces an emergency shutdown with $4 million of its dollar-pegged dai stablecoin not backed by an underlying crypto asset, according to a stakeholder call held Thursday.If a shutdown were to occur, the crypto market would be flooded with some 2.4 million ETH even as the asset’s value plummets amid broader market turmoil.A spokesperson for the MakerDAO Foundation told CoinDesk: ""The MakerDAO community and the Maker Foundation have been working hand in hand to monitor, assess and resolve the current situation."" The Maker protocol works by creating dai loans when users load ETH or Basic Attention Token (BAT) into the system as collateral. Maker then automatically sells that collateral when the market tanks in order to get DAI off the market until the system hits its 150 percent collateral target. But the price dropped too sharply for MakerDAO's automated auctions to keep up.Last night at 22:00 UTC, ETH was trading at approximately $194, according to CoinDesk’s Ethereum Price Index, only to fall to a low of $124 at about 12:44 UTC today. The total dollar value of crypto locked in DeFi protocols has plummeted over 20 percent in USD terms overnight (from $889 million to $691 million, as of this writing) – this despite the fact that the total ETH in DeFi has actually increased some 200,000 ETH. The most likely driver: users with loans on Maker looking to boost their collateralization to head off a liquidation. The MakerDAO Foundation and holders of the MKR governance token are trying to decide what to do right now. Options on the table include lowering the dai savings rate, extending the length of time for liquidation auctions and even triggering the emergency shutdown, effectively a system reboot of MakerDAO. ""We are in a brave new world here,"" Rich Brown, the foundation's head of community, said on the call, describing some of the complexities of an open format governance approach. ""If we had a dictator just tell us what to do it'd be so much simpler.""In an emergency shutdown, new CDPs are frozen, auctions finalize and remaining dai can be redeemed for ETH at a fixed price set at the time of the shutdown. “If MakerDAO experiences an emergency shutdown, DAI becomes redeemable for the ether backing all of the DAI outstanding,"" Robert Leshner, founder of DeFi protocol Compound Finance, told CoinDesk. ""It stops behaving like a stablecoin and begins behaving like ether, price-wise. This will have unintended consequences for the entire ecosystem, some of which have planned for the possibility of this event, and others that have not.”The MakerDAO community does not have a rule of thumb for a metric that would trigger an emergency shutdown.“This certainly seems like a very rare 'black swan' event,” Tom Bean, co-founder and CEO of trading platform bZx, told CoinDesk. “I don’t recall the last time things fell this hard and fast and caused this much congestion.”The Maker community is in the middle of a hot debate now. As one community member who serves as a forum admin put it, ""Ideally we'd already have emergency response procedures in place. We didn't so we are figuring out what to do.""The system’s first automated move is to keep putting new MKR into the market until the protocol can buy back 4 million dai. This will work so long as MKR's value holds up enough in that time. The price is currently down 46 percent. The community is also considering adjusting the two settings mentioned above (auction time and 0-dai bids). There are also more complex moves that the community could make so that it takes both less capital and less technical skill to serve as a keeper. More people in the market should make it more likely for ETH to sell at a fair price in a liquidation, but of course the problem remains: Liquidation is profitable when liquidators get a discount on an asset that's somewhat stable.At this time, the mood inside the Maker forum is moving against the emergency shutdown because doing so would impose a cost on dai holders. Dai holders would pay the cost because at the end of the shutdown, the leftover ETH would be worth less in total than the dai in U.S. dollar terms.As Ryan Berckmans, a DeFi entrepreneur who is normally found in prediction markets, put it in a summary of today's emergency call, ""The social contract of MakerDAO is that MKR tokens take a haircut in the event of system failure."" Issuing new MKR accomplishes this because it dilutes all the MKR holders, including large ones such as crypto investment funds Dragonfly, Paradigm and Andreessen Horowitz, among others. Berckmans closed his summary with his personal perspective, writing:""Keepers and MKR buyers should prepare for sustained high gas prices, and downward pressure on ETH and MKR. The Dow Jones hit sell-off circuit breakers three times in the past week and a half. It’s a historic week.”Update (March 12, 21:54 UTC): This piece has been updated with more information about the MakerDAO system's unexpected under-collateralization and a summary of the community's discussion of its next steps.Update (March 23, 0:30 UTC): Corrects a transcription error in Rich Brown's quote.

to spend bitcoin in the UTXO model, the transaction drags along with ...","Mar 23, 2020 at 05:52 UTC","The Ethereum community now has a roadmap, albeit a confusing one.","Dropped Wednesday, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s state of the network map helps contextualize the next five to 10 years for a global community of 20,000 developers while highlighting a key issue for the blockchain’s next version: scalability.The Eth 2.0 research team is now leaning into a new concept called “polynomial commitments” to reduce the data used per computation on the network, according to a March 17 blog post by researcher Danny Ryan.Dubbed “magic math” by Buterin, polynomial commitments are being eyed as a way to verify the state of the network at low computational cost, a key goal of the future network.Still, Buterin’s map tags his magic math for network integration not until at least the third phase in the multi-year push to Eth 2.0.“Polynomial commitments could be the major breakthrough we’ve been looking for,” Ryan said, specifically regarding the storage of account data in the next version of Ethereum.The Ethereum Foundation did not respond to a request for comment by press time.Polynomial commitments are similar to the polynomials we all came to learn and love in elementary school: a math expression with both variables and coefficients (i.e., Y=2X).But, again, this is magic math so it’s not quite so simple. Buterin describes polynomial commitments as “a sort of ‘hash’ of some polynomial P(x) with the property that you can perform arithmetic checks on hashes.” The original paper on polynomial commitments, meanwhile, synthesizes the math scheme as “six algorithms” that show proof of an event occurring with as little computing data as possible.“We suggest replacing Merkle trees by magic math called “polynomial commitments” to accumulate blockchain state,” Buterin said in the Ethereum Foundation blog post. “Benefits include reducing the size of stateless client witnesses (excluding contract code and state data) to near zero.”(For the mathematically inclined, a three-part series on polynomial commitments hosted by Eth 2.0’s Justin Drake can be found below.)Blockchains record both the ins and outs users create when transacting. On the whole, blockchain accounting systems come in two kinds: the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model and the account-based model. Bitcoin uses the former while Ethereum uses the latter.When a user wishes to spend bitcoin in the UTXO model, the transaction drags along with it the entire history of those coins, which is then checked by every peer on the network. The account model, on the other hand, records only the transaction between the two peers while directing questions of the transaction's validity to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in conjunction with a proof of the transaction. The EVM executes state changes – the current accounts and balances of the blockchain – on behalf of users.Each block on Ethereum – which binds transactions into just that, a block – also contains a proof, a Merkle tree, which connects itself to the beginning of the network’s history. This proof contains the receipt of the state referenced above and is needed for the EVM to execute a transaction.This last part has been a sticky issue for Ethereum, however. Why? Merkle trees are data-efficient, yet not data-efficient enough for Eth 2.0’s ambitions. This is where the magic happens.The current Merkle tree setup takes about 0.5 MB per transaction. Ryan estimates polynomial commitment schemes would reduce the weight of state proofs to between 0.001 and 0.01 MB. For a network that recently averages around 700,000 transactions per day, the savings in terms of data computation add up.As such the idea of a stateless client has been in the works since at least October 2017 to reduce the amount of data used for ethereum’s big upgrade.Multiple projects outside of Ethereum also lean on polynomial commitments in their own way, including Zcash’s zero-knowledge proof, Halo. Buterin said his implementation of polynomial commitments remains one of many. Moreover, it’s still in the research phase.“Although incredibly promising, some of this research and magic math is very new. We need to spend more time better understanding the complexities and tradeoffs, as well as just getting more eyes on this new and exciting technique,” Ryan concluded.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

All profits, losses and account balances will be denominated in USDT, making it clearer and easier for traders to make investment decisions using USDT, the firm says.

Similar to Bybit’s existing perpetual contracts denominated in bitcoin, the USDT contracts will have no expiry date, and the price will be attached to the underlying index.With other contracts, a trader must hold account balances in multiple currencies because profits and losses are denominated in the currency underlying the contract. If they receive a margin call, it means filling their margin using the relevant asset underlying the contract.With the new USDT perpetuals, the process is more simplified for traders wishing to utilize cross-margin to make use of unrealized profit on their account.

Kevin Castel of the Southern District of New York said Tuesday that Telegram's 2018, $1.7 billion token sale appeared to be an unregistered securities sale, and barred the company from issuing grams after it launches its Telegram Open Network. The ruling granted a preliminary injunction request filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which sued Telegram last October.Telegram filed notice late Tuesday that it would be appealing the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, though it has not provided further details as of press time. An attorney for Telegram did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Telegram initially intended to launch its blockchain last year, but pushed the date to April after the SEC suit began. Lawyers Lewis Cohen and Gabriel Shapiro both agreed on Twitter that the judge's ruling made sense but both wished for more clarity and guidance from the opinion.See also: Russia Seeks to Block ‘Darknet’ Technologies, Including Telegram’s BlockchainShapiro wrote late on Tuesday that he ""would not be surprised if Telegram appeals,"" though in his view ""it's mostly a question of their appetite for continuing litigation and how willing SAFT [Simple Agreement for Future Tokens] buyers are to negotiate a new deal with Telegram over these issues.""Likewise, Coin Center Director of Research Peter Van Valkenburgh wrote the ruling was ""clear [and] well-reasoned.""""The novelty in this case, and in the SEC’s complaint, is the allegation that the purchasers of the presale arrangement are underwriters.

exactly ...","Mar 10, 2020 at 16:30 UTC","Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Future of Finance newsletter.","As I write this, Facebook is worth about $500 billion in market capitalization. The other members of the Libra Association (and the 1,500 other organizations interested in connecting to it) are probably worth another few $ trillion. Ethereum, on the other hand, is only about $20 billion in value. And yet, there are profound reasons why we should be paying attention not to regulatory movement around Libra, but to decentralized finance brewing on the open source network.See also: Lex Sokolin: Software Ate the World, Here’s How It Eats FinanceThe key mainstream piece of news is that Libra's approach to building its currency and payments network is likely to change as a result of governmental pressure. What started out as a desire to build a multi-currency portfolio of dollars, euros and other Facebook-selected moneys ended up running into the wall of sovereign opposition. While bitcoin (BTC) faces a similar wall, it is permissionless and therefore too squiggly to shut down. Not so with Facebook. We know exactly where its shareholders and operators are. As a result, we observe that you cannot create a new money without a new nation (e.g., Anon or 4chan nation). And if you live within another nation subject to its laws (e.g., the U.S.), well, you are subject to its laws.There continues to be a deep confusion about (1) an asset itself and (2) the operating infrastructure on which it travels. These are two entirely different propositions, and the difference cannot be hand-waved away. The nature of holding some investment and the exposure it gives you to the investment class is very different from the software on which it runs. The dollar and sterling may go up and down in value relative to each other – but that doesn't have much implication for the quality of the venue on which the trading occurs. Facebook was trying to do the former activity – re-build the actual dollar in a regulated, controlled environment.Facebook was trying to...rebuild the actual dollar in a regulated, controlled environment. Instead, it should be rebuilding the payment rails.Instead, it should be rebuilding the payment rails, which is why it is no surprise the Libra Association quitters are the companies that make payment rails: Stripe, PayPal, Visa and MasterCard. Those players are probably open to channeling new units of value across their super highways, but they shouldn't want to build competing ones. Once it becomes clear that the new unit of value ain't happening, what's the point of eating your own tail?JPMorgan recently published a fantastic equity-research style report on 2020 blockchain. There are a few connected, worthwhile points on the idea of cryptocurrency as an asset class worth referencing. First, if you are building the money itself, you are in the finance business and are taking economic exposure. That means, for example, that global yield curves become a problem. If 33 percent of global debt has negative interest rates, it might be hard for you to earn net interest income to sustain operations, which in turn may require customers to pay transaction fees on transfers, which gets you back to the existing banking/payments system already in place. To fix the math, you would need to build out a real capital markets business, which has at-scale liquidity networks, counterparties that can provide credit, and the buy-in of all the central banks in the system. That's a tough one for Facebook today.Another conclusion I found compelling is the ongoing discussion about the diversification usefulness of digital assets. On the one hand, many people still hold the view that bitcoin is an apocalypse hedge and should go up when the entire world burns down. Hoard the digital gold next to your video game guns! However, the track record on this claim is not particularly clear as of yet, and correlations tend to creep up with global markets as shocks become more systemic. For example, bitcoin correlation with the S&P 500 and Gold both approached 30 percent at one point in 2019.The JPMorgan takeaway is that crypto assets can be country fragility hedges rather than general hedges. In advanced nations, they represent novel and different idiosyncratic risks related to technology adoption curves, internet meme virality, and the mood of Federal Reserve and other officials. But nations with challenged economic and financial infrastructure offer clearer proof points for economic improvement. Which gets me back to the core point: Stop thinking about the asset, and start thinking about its gears and engines.While the political responses to Libra are shifting influence and technology approaches, Ethereum is where the experiment is already happening. It boasts  88 million unique addresses (i.e., accounts), over 40 million smart contract calls in February (i.e., a request to/from a software), and nearly a million smart contracts created in the same month (see  more growth statistics about it here.) An increasing amount of capital is being used as collateral – ""locked"" in the parlance of the industry – to power new financial machines.Further, the two charts here (above and below) show you the user growth, evolution, and interconnectedness between an emerging blockchain-based financial software industry (i.e., DeFi) between 2018 and 2020. Digital currency is collateralized on the right, invested across lending products in the middle, and then sent to multiple trading and derivative exchanges on the left. There is growth in the number of service providers, their specialization, and their users. There is also growth in the connection between these services, and the economic activity between them. This is both a strength and weakness. Systemic risk comes from too much interdependence. But so do network effects and a community.As more activity from real world economies is able to shift to public blockchains, this snapshot could be the seed from which the financial machine emerges. Of course, that transition is a massive assumption, and to date much of the economic activity of the digital world remains digital and aloof. However, there is evidence of movement. See also: Lex Sokolin: We Made No Progress, Other Than All the Progress We MadeAs you research these issues more deeply and think about the new software providers, do not treat them as investment managers, creating streams of return. The mistake would be to evaluate the investment quality of some particular subscale network token as unattractive and miss the bigger picture. You might spend too much time thinking about the Ethereum token, and not about its ability to power an asset allocation software like TokenSets (social trading) or PieDAO (roboadviser). To that end, the visualizations below give you the directionally correct comparison of a technology enabler, rather than the asset itself.The stunning thing about each of these offerings is not just that they are targeting a familiar use-case. Of course they are! Human nature does not change. Rather, it is that they target these use-cases while running on a common software infrastructure, being interoperable, and open source.To repeat – we are a stone's throw away from the global financial industry running on a common software infrastructure across asset classes, being natively interoperable and open source.

""While the harsh realities of COVID-19 affect the world at large, the risks presented by the virus are particularly acute for inmates.

In their submissions this month, Goettsche and Weeks argue they are unable to follow medical advice in jail because hand sanitizer is a controlled substance, and inmates are frequently in close proximity to one another. Weeks added that Essex County already has an ""exceptionally poor record of maintaining detainee health"" and that its measures to prevent a coronavirus outbreak did little to protect the health of inmates. Confinement in these circumstances will place greater restrictions on contact with their legal team, which could severely hamper their ability to prepare a defense ahead of trial, they add. Being accused of non-violent crimes, both Goettsche and Weeks say they would not pose any risk to society for the duration of their release. The pair also say they are unlikely to flee justice due to international travel bans and the fact their passports have already been confiscated.Further reading: House Stimulus Bills Envision ‘Digital Dollar’ to Ease Coronavirus RecessionLast week, a New York judge granted a motion for temporary release for another individual on the grounds that crowded detention centers allowed the virus to spread more easily.

Weddings and funerals are forbidden, she told CoinDesk. Most grocery shopping is done online, which leads to delayed deliveries.“Authorities told us we will always have food and drugs,” she said. “That has been true for the last 18 days. ... But still people are scared. Some are breaking into shops.” Meanwhile, veteran bitcoiner and cypherpunk icon Amir Taaki, known for creating Dark Wallet and fighting ISIS in Syria, is still hoping to open a cypherpunk academy in Barcelona later this year, after the virus quarantine policies end.“People are still severely underestimating the impact this thing [coronavirus] is going to have. People are home a lot more, so using credit cards a lot more,” Taaki said in a phone interview from his quarantine in a small Spanish village. “Governments are going to give themselves more powers that they can use for other purposes.”In the meantime, he’s working from home with the privacy tech startup Nym and, separately, with a small band of roughly 10 people to develop tools for “pools of liquidity in different jurisdictions.”“What’s the point in building an ecosystem that centers around U.S. banks and Chinese corporations, then when the economy has a meltdown they pull out anyway? It's all backwards,” Taaki said.In Milan, Liponi said the psychological aspect of quarantine already feels restrictive. People are only allowed to drive within the city for crucial work tasks, health care or groceries. She described the local health care system as “collapsing,” with doctors and nurses falling ill and hospitals woefully understaffed.“Things change every day,” Liponi said. “I'm a reclusive person by choice but now that it's imposed I feel like I want to break free.”There’s also a travel restriction on Italians. For example, they are no longer allowed to enter neighboring Austria. In Vienna, a hackerspace co-founder who goes by Exiledsurfer is organizing the virtual Noncon conference in April. A member of the cypherpunk collective Parallele Polis, Exiledsurfer said many bitcoiners rely on such events for work. It remains to be seen if the economics of virtual events can substitute for in-person gatherings.Regardless, the risks of continuing to hold events in cities without quarantine rules could be severe. Several veteran Ethereum community members reported feeling sick this week after flying home from a conference in Paris. Even in San Francisco, which declared a state of emergency in late February, companies like Coinbase adopted a suggested work-from-home policy effective March 9. Bitcoin Magazine’s annual conference, which was scheduled for March 27 in San Francisco, was postponed to the third quarter of 2020.For meetup organizers in complete lockdown like Liponi, she’s staying focused on the day-to-day and isn't sure yet how this will impact her international consulting company, Satoshi Design. Like Taaki and Exiledsurfer, she can work from home as she figures out her family’s situation. But if the broader economic slowdown continues, Taaki expects bitcoin (BTC) prices to drop even lower.“Dark money will stay in crypto, which guarantees its price. All the speculative capital in crypto, that’s going to exit,” he said. “There’s going to be second-and-third order effects, social, legal and economic.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Mar 25, 2020 at 19:47 UTC",Legislation introduced in the U.S. Congress this week signals the Overton Window – a metric of what’s politically feasible – is opening in favor of national digital currencies. ,"While it’s unlikely we’ll see a digital dollar any time soon, the coronavirus crisis may help precipitate adoption of novel forms of money, members of the cryptocurrency industry and other observers say. The legislation comes about as U.S. officials look for ways to get much-needed cash into American pockets. According to a Senate bill, using a central bank digital currency (CBDC)*, the federal government could send direct payments to citizen’s wallets held by the Federal Reserve, called FedWallets.While the proposed bills lack detail, and at least one has been scrubbed of reference to this new payment mechanism, many in the crypto community see this as validation of both an asset class and a set of ideas about the future of the financial system.  See also: Why the U.S.’s $2 Trillion Stimulus, Unlimited QE Will Expose the Monetary System’s Flaws""[T]his is not the last we'll see of the digital dollar movement,"" Lawson Baker, founder of Relayzero, a cryptocurrency investment and advisory firm, said in direct message. The dollar is the United States’ greatest export, and any technologist or financier would want to be a part of its next phase of existence, Baker said. “Favors. Pork. You name it. Everyone wants in to the digitization of the dollar payday.”Whether introduced out of sheer desperation, as a genuine attempt to utilize instantaneous and transparent payment technologies, or as “bill padding,” as Mati Greenspan, a digital asset researcher wrote, CBDCs are rising up the mainstream agenda. In a few short days, CBDCs have gone from being fringe to getting support from U.S. senators like Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who has proposed digitizing the existing currency and keeping accounts for the public at the Fed. This centralized version of sovereign national currency likely has the widest support in establishment circles, with backers like ex-Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Chris Giancarlo gathering support through his Digital Dollar Project. At the same time, Facebook and other private entities are also co-opting and sometimes improving on the work of Satoshi Nakamoto. “We are becoming resourceful in looking at existing technology – and at the flaws in the current system – and applying them to future and current needs,” said Catherine Coley, CEO of Binance.US. See also: US Senate Floats ‘Digital Dollar’ Bill After House Scrubs Term From Coronavirus Relief PlanColey wrote an op-ed last weekend urging Congress to consider blockchain-based stablecoins as a way to payout a direct stimulus. It would save money and reduce contagion risks, she argued. However, the current drafts make no mention of a digital dollar being maintained on a decentralized ledger.“I'm not going to say I prefer one way or the other as long as we're rapidly moving towards this solution,” Coley said. “Any progress on this matter is a win for everyone. The faster we can get funds into the hands of those that need financial support at this time is crucial.” Coley’s arguments for digitizing cash payments are pragmatic. There isn’t scientific consensus yet on how COVID-19 spreads, and mailing physical checks to home addresses may negligently expose people to the virus. See also: 4 Reasons Central Banks Should Launch Retail Digital CurrenciesSimilarly, Coley reasons that the last time the federal government posted rebates in the mail, in 2008, during Henry Paulson’s tenure at Treasury, many people without stable residences were excluded. “If the stimulus were delivered via digital assets, every American with internet access, a Social Security number and proof of address could have the ability to access their stimulus,” she wrote. “This [hygienic] distribution would provide a variety of ways for people to get access to cash,” she said. One possible impetus for the government’s examination of digital currencies during this crisis is the much-mistrusted Libra project, spearheaded by Facebook, but moving to decentralize. Coley said, “Libra is perfectly positioned to provide something like this,” but, if up and running, would require everyone to get a Facebook account. “Are you going to force everyone to open up an account on exchange? The answer is no, but there is an option now for people that are not near their mailboxes,” she said.As it stands, digital dollars would be paid to wallets maintained by the Federal Reserve. These payments wouldn’t be able to circulate widely throughout the economy, but people would be able to transfer them to their bank accounts and use later as they see fit.Even such a scaled back approach “would be a first step towards crypto technologies being widely adopted” Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association, a Washington D.C. lobbying firm, said. People could [grow to] understand that they can have full access to their financial lives.“Through dollar-backed stablecoins, people could [grow to] understand that they can have full access to their financial lives,” through other digital assets, she said. But not everyone takes such a rosy view of this solution. Daniel Gorfine, CEO of Gattaca Horizons, a fintech advisory firm, said the current crisis is forcing consideration of how existing technologies can expedite the deployment of money. But he cautioned against moving too quickly.“Implementing a true CBDC is a really large undertaking. It needs to be done with a lot of care and will involve important questions, design choices and trade-offs,” Gorfine said over the phone. “While jump-starting pilots and trials could make sense, I caution whether now is the right time to do something as full blown as broadly implementing a dollar-backed digital currency,” he said. “I think it's really important that this doesn't cause any delays in getting emergency funding to needy businesses and individuals through existing channels.” Gorfine, also the former chief innovation officer at the CFTC, proposed a “digital dollar” along with former CFTC Chairman Giancarlo. “There's a difference in my mind between doing meaningful pilots versus a whole scale implementation,” Gorfine said. “It seems to me to be something that will take months, if not, years of thoughtful planning.”Eric Turner, a crypto data researcher at Messari, agreed. ""[CBDCs] aren't a question of if, but when.” A dollar stimulus airdrop is the perfect test application. “But we are at least a year away from the U.S. building such a system,” he said. If rushed, the procedure could likely do more harm than good, said Josh Lawler, a partner of Zuber Lawler who specializes in crypto and securities law. “The virus situation points to the use case for quick, direct payments of this nature, but it will take more than five days to figure out a way to implement it and not end up in disaster,” he said. See also: Policymakers Shouldn’t Fear Digital Money: So Far It’s Maintaining the Dollar’s StatusLawler thinks the current proposals have  conceptual flaws “that would drag us in the wrong direction.”“Those that need it most are the ones that are unlikely to have or know how to use wallets,” he said. Additionally, a digital dollar could be a means of increasing government oversight over personal  transactions. “There are huge security concerns. The Fourth Amendment is at stake here,” Lawson Baker said. Earlier that day Baker tweeted, “Digital Dollar Fed Accounts for consumers [are] worse than the Bank Secrecy Act. Why? Because now the Fed will have direct access to all of your financial transactions AND direct control over the ledger.” He reasoned this would lead to asset seizure without warrants. While there are flaws with a bill so quickly introduced, Baker sees the moment as a calling for the crypto industry to rise to the occasion and move its agenda forward. “This will resonate with people. They'll understand what a digital dollar means. Even if [Congress] had to pull it back and say, ‘We don't want people connecting the dots,’” said Coley. “It means they already know what true digital assets are and therefore are afraid people would connect more dots.” *Definitions of CBDCs vary from digital ledger entries at central banks to systems necessarily with cryptocurrency design aspects.

Nearly a dozen countries are testing the software, Bloomberg reported.NSO Group’s surveillance technology has attracted widespread criticism from privacy-minded technologists in the crypto sector and beyond – for covertly accessing phones, activating cameras and collecting location data. Still, the company’s top ranks have significant ties to the blockchain industry, CoinDesk has learned.Several NSO Group founders and investors are also funding blockchain companies. For example, co-founders Omri Lavie and Shalev Hulio have invested in the bitcoin startup Simplex, while NSO Group investor Eddy Shalev has invested in the non-custodial wallet startup Portis, the exchange platform eToro and the privacy startup QEDIT. Eddy Shalev’s LinkedIn account also listed him as on the board of the bitcoin mining company Spondoolies Tech, which reportedly closed in 2016.“There’s a lot of what the cryptocurrency space is doing that is recreating what is already happening with traditional finance,” QEDIT CEO Jonathan Rouach said of Eddy Shalev. “He was one of the first people to recognize that banks will be interested in the same [blockchain] technology, but maybe not public consensus [mechanisms].”The three investors did not respond to requests for comment by press time. Another source with knowledge of QEDIT’s operations said the startup is not involved with the NSO Group’s coronavirus monitoring app. Although it’s unclear how these investors personally interact with the bitcoin (BTC) market, a former NSO Group employee allegedly tried to sell stolen software for $50 million worth of cryptocurrency in 2018. A source familiar with the matter said the above-mentioned investors are active bitcoiners, but declined to provide more details.Many bitcoiners imagine the crux of their movement lies in the divide between government agencies and cypherpunks. As a company making software tools for intelligence agencies,  NSO Group shows there may be a significant overlap between the two worlds. NSO Group isn’t the first case of such overlap either. Coinbase famously sparked industrywide backlash in 2019 when it acquired Neutrino, founded by three former members of a controversial Italian surveillance vendor called Hacking Team. To quell the kerfuffle, the San Francisco-based crypto exchange said those members would ""transition out of Coinbase,"" but has not since confirmed such a transition took place. Coinbase did not respond to requests for comment about whether it still employs former Hacking Team members.

It’s a sign of the continued maturation of the crypto insurance sector.“We’ve had lots of demand from small to large firms,” said Rodrigo Vicuna, BitGo’s CFO. “There have been small exchanges looking for an extra $5 million or $10 million. We also have had requests for as high as a couple hundred million. It really just depends on the size of the client and how much financial backstop is right for them.”A couple of years back, crypto custodians and large exchanges struggled to secure insurance against the loss of digital assets. But more recently, syndicates within Lloyd’s of London specialist insurance market have been taking on more risk and increasing capacity in the market. BitGo’s crypto policy is covered by Lloyd’s “specie market,” to use insurance industry parlance. This means insurance against theft or damage from vaults that typically hold cash, gold, fine art and so on. For crypto, this means a $100 million worth of cover, plus any excess added on, is to insure against the loss of digital assets from devices that are not and will never be connected to the internet. It covers loss from insider theft and if a third party gains physical access to storage media and cryptographic keys.BitGo announced the first customer for its new policy is Hong Kong-based exchange Crypto.com. Kris Marszalek, co-founder and CEO of Crypto.com, said in a statement, “BitGo carries a robust insurance program, elevating the scope of protection for our digital assets in their custody and providing further assurance to our customers that their funds are safe and protected.”BitGo’s excess policy offering is arranged through insurance broker Woodruff-Sawyer & Co. in partnership with London’s Paragon Brokers.As well as expanding its cold storage cover, BitGo also gives customers the option to add some hot wallet cover, thanks to a relationship with U.K.-based Coincover, which recently announced it was backed by Lloyd’s. Coincover offers a crime policy covering third-party hacks, by far the most common means by which crypto is stolen.BitGo had previously teamed with Digital Asset Insurance (DAI), which later changed its name to Coincover. The partnership meant BitGo business clients could purchase theft insurance and a key recovery service. “Anybody with a BitGo wallet could get hot-wallet coverage with us,” said David Janczewski, Coincover’s CEO.Janczewski said Lloyd’s offers the policy on a case-by-case basis. In terms of the typical limits to what is available for hot wallet cover “it's in the millions, possibly tens of millions,” he said.“When we came out with that announcement back in 2019 saying you can now have optional hot wallet insurance up to your limit, the reason we designed that program was so BitGo would provide the initial protection,” said BitGo’s Vicuna. “Then, on top of that, clients each have their unique needs.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The total sales sum up to a small fraction of her net worth ($500 million).Loeffler and Sprecher both jointly bought shares of Citrix, which offers a teleworking product, and Oracle. The two individually also bought shares of the Blackstone Real Estate Investment Trust.""Appreciate today's briefing from the President's top health officials on the novel coronavirus outbreak,"" Loeffler tweeted soon after the briefing. In the ensuing weeks, she took to Twitter to suggest the threat of the virus was being exaggerated by the Democrats. Just last week, before the major sell-off, Loeffler, who has an estimated net worth of $500 million, tweeted to assure citizens that a strong economy and response by the administration meant the U.S. was in a ""strong position"" to handle the coronavirus outbreak. See also: This Is What a Productive Congressional Blockchain Hearing Looks LikeAlthough Loeffler's office had not responded to the Daily Beast's requests for comment, she denied the reports on Twitter, calling them ""a ridiculous and baseless attack."" Her portfolio was managed by someone else, ""without my or my husband's knowledge or involvement,"" she claimed, and she had informed the Senate Ethics Committee when she became aware of changes in her investments. Loeffler said she was not aware of the sales until Feb. 16, after many had already been conducted. While her initial disclosure was filed on Feb. 7, the amended version was filed on March 12.It is illegal for members of Congress to trade based on non-public information gained from their public roles. An ICE spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment by press time.This is the second time concerns have been raised about Loeffler. In early January, she was appointed to the committee that oversees the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), just weeks after resigning as CEO of Bakkt.

An annual report from her husband's exchange group noted that many of its holdings were ""subject to extensive regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.""Responding to concerns there was a conflict of interest, Loeffler told the Wall Street Journal at the time she had tried to comply with the Senate's ethics rules and would recuse herself on a case by case basis. Fellow Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, has also come under fire for selling anywhere between $500,00 to $1.5 million in stock holdings just before markets tanked in February, the Center for Responsive Politics reported. Burr asked the Senate Ethics Committee to review his sales on Friday.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Mar 20, 2020 at 12:01 UTC",Major crypto exchanges Binance and Huobi have aligned behind a controversial hard fork of the Steem blockchain scheduled for Friday.,"An initiative developed by a Steem community group called Hive, the fork is set to go live at around 14:00 UTC.The blockchain split is the latest development in the ongoing dispute between Tron founder Justin Sun and the Steem community, who have been in a fight for control over who controls the social media and content-focused blockchain.On Feb. 14, Sun's Tron foundation acquired Steemit, Steem's leading social media dapp and, it's thought, its large hoard of steem tokens, which bring with them great voting power in the blockchain's governance. With the community seeing this as a potential takeover by the crypto entrepreneur, they moved to limit his power with a soft fork in late February that was ultimately unsuccessful.Sun claimed the move was brought by ""hackers"" at the time.While Huobi and Binance previously supported Sun's move to acquire Steem and used their token supply to back his moves, it would appear the exchanges have changed their stance. The firms now back the hard fork, which will port over steem tokens to the new chain, all but Sun's sizable stash, that is. The move would exempt him from holding any of the new hive tokens and, thus, voting power on the new chain.""We will take a snapshot of all STEEM tokens held by Binance users at the time of the final Steem block prior to 2020/03/20 2:00 p.m. (UTC) and will distribute HIVE tokens at a ratio of 1 STEEM = 1 HIVE,"" Binance said in an announcement on Friday. Huobi made a similar statement Wednesday.The new hive tokens will deny Sun control of the original development fund through his major share in Steem's ""ninja-mined stake"" tokens – perhaps 20 percent of the total supply. As such, fork backers hope to completely remove Sun from the picture when the hard fork goes live in a couple of hours.""The intention of this community-driven fork is to support and build on the strong Steem community values that have made our ecosystem so diverse and exciting,"" said Hive. ""This new direction steps away from the burden of the Steemit Inc. ninja-mined stake, which has impacted the long term ability to work towards further development and decentralization for years.""The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Mar 24, 2020 at 15:20 UTC",The Russian government may soon allow the creation of regulatory sandboxes for companies working on cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence and distributed ledgers. ,"Introduced in a new bill on March 17 by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, the plan does not directly mention blockchain or cryptocurrencies, but an explanatory note mentions distributed ledger as one of the technologies that could be explored in the new “experimental regulatory regimes.” Such regimes can be established to live-test the new technologies in medicine, transporation, distant learning, financial markets, online commerce and other sectors. The bill gives Russia’s regulators scope to deal with novel tech in a more flexible way, the document says. It’s also suggested that the country’s regions would be able to set up their own local sandboxes.   The Bank of Russia, the central bank, will be supervising the sandboxes related to fintech. Representatives of the Economic Development Ministry, which initiated the bill, told the Russian newspaper Izvestia that fintech projects operating within sandboxes would be subject to lighter regulation regarding cash reserves, financial reporting and foreign currency controls.Olga Shepeleva, a senior expert at the Center for Strategic Research, a Moscow-based think tank that helped draft the bill, told CoinDesk the law should have already been passed as a part of the government’s program on developing the digital economy in Russia. However, there were concerns that such a law would excessively skew the power balance in favor of the executive branch. “The main idea is that the government can choose to make a temporary exceptions from laws and regulations” for the sandboxes, Shepeleva said. The Bank of Russia has already been running a regulatory sandbox for fintech projects, and has even reported successfully testing a blockchain-based tokenization pilot by the mining and smelting company Nornickel. However, the central bank’s sandbox only helps to model the possible uses of the new technologies, but does not allow businesses to test their use cases on real clients; neither does it provide the means for expert and public control over such experiments. The new bill will allow the creation of sandboxes in which real businesses will be working with real customers, Shepeleva explained. Russia’s central bank has consistently maintained a skeptical stance towards cryptocurrencies and has recently said it's involved in drafting legislation that will block crypto marketplaces from operating in the country, though ownership would likely be tolerated. Mikhail Komin, research director at the Center for Advanced Governance in Moscow, said Russia is unlikely to become more accepting of cryptocurrencies anytime soon, saying: “For sure, the [coronavirus] pandemic and the financial crisis makes the government look for unorthodox solutions, but crypto is not a part of that.”.“The Bank of Russia is interested in lowering uncertainty in the financial and foreign currency markets caused by the volatility of the Russian ruble, and it believes cryptocurrencies would add even more uncertainty,” Komin said. ""The Bank of Russia’s position remains the winning one in this argument."" The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

If approved, retail investors and advisors would be able to trade the fund on popular platforms including Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade, said CEO Hunter Horsley.The company has several steps before it can begin trading. The first is an announcement to current shareholders, Horsley said, which occurred on Friday. Bitwise will also have to publish public disclosures in accordance with ATS reporting standards and have a market maker file a Form 211 with FINRA.Once FINRA approves the Form 211, trading can commence. ""We expect approval for trading in the second half of 2020,"" Horsley said. ""It’ll take a number of months for trading to commence.""He likened the process to Grayscale Investments' Bitcoin Trust product, which already trades on OTCQX. Grayscale currently lists shares of its Digital Large Cap Fund, Ethereum Trust and Ethereum Classic Trust on the platform. Like the Grayscale large-cap fund, the Bitwise 10 Index Fund is a diversified one. Horsley noted it holds assets representing 85 percent of the crypto market capitalization. ""[It] has a formal public methodology, has governance – both a committee and an advisory board – and it’s designed with several rules to screen and handle the nuances of the crypto space,"" he said.The fund includes bitcoin, ethereum, XRP, bitcoin cash, litecoin, EOS, tezos, stellar lumens, ADA and ethereum classic.Interest in this type of product is growing, Hunter said, adding that Bitwise is holding some 2,000 calls per month with advisors.According to a survey Bitwise published earlier this year, 72 percent of advisors said their clients were asking about crypto. About 6 percent of respondents already allocate funds to crypto assets, and this figure is set to double by the end of the year, Horsley said. Nor does he see the current economic downturn due to the COVID-19 outbreak to be a major concern.Still, he noted that ""during a panic, everything can happen.""Further on, Horsley said, he hopes to list a potential bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) – a product several companies have attempted to get approval from before – alongside the index fund. ""We’re continuing work on the bitcoin ETF, so the index fund here would exist alongside a future bitcoin ETF as another option,"" he said.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

for Emergents cards, essentially acting as a market maker.","Mar 18, 2020 at 14:00 UTC","Digital card games like Hearthstone are fun, but getting the cards needed to play is not.","That's a problem Coase – a company launched by Tezos co-founder Kathleen Breitman – aims to solve with its new game, Emergents. The new title, whose alpha version opens up to a select few in early April, comes as the market for online card games nears $2 billion in size and coronavirus-related shutdowns drive gamers indoors.Coase’s innovation: Let people easily acquire and swap the cards they actually want. ""Providing optionality makes people feel better and also it promotes experimentation, which is something that seems to have been lost in the transition to digital,"" Breitman told CoinDesk in an interview.In collectible card games, there are two giants. The original, analog version, Magic: The Gathering, which is arguably the most successful brand in the Hasbro portfolio; and the digital Hearthstone, which brings in an estimated $400 million for its owner, Blizzard Entertainment. But both have issues with how cards get distributed.For those who have never played Magic, cards are distributed in physical packs, which each have a distribution of cards of different rarities. Generally speaking, only one or two cards per pack are worth holding. Anyone who plays knows they will inevitably end up with loads of unwanted duplicates. There's a strong secondary market for Magic cards but the game's maker has largely pretended it doesn't exist.Hearthstone is more complicated. Players get free cards. They can buy packs. They can also trade in their cards to get other cards, sort of, but they lose a lot of value when they do that. So, ""Hearthstone"" has a built-in secondary market, but it's very extractive.For Coase co-founder Zvi Mowshowitz – who is also a 2007 inductee to Magic Hall of Fame – both distribution approaches leave a lot to be desired. Emergents will take a radically simple approach: Let people buy the cards they want.Brian David-Marshall, a third co-founder, said Coase has ""an economic model for doing a collectible card game on the blockchain that captures a lot of what makes physical card games great.""Coase will be the primary and secondary marketplace all in one. Like bitcoin on Square’s Cash App, Coase will be the seller and the buyer for Emergents cards, essentially acting as a market maker.The company is using bonding curves, much like Ethereum's token-swapping platform Uniswap, to distribute the cards. Cards will have a fixed supply and their prices will swing with demand, determined by an algorithm. New cards will come out and be sold on the site at a low price.Each card sold will make the next card sold just a little pricier, but each card sold back to Coase will make the next card sold a little cheaper. When the market for a given card is saturated, it will be cheap. As the card gets scarce, it will go way up in price.Cards can be sold back to the company at something like 95 percent of their value. ""One of the things we wanted to take advantage of with this blockchain technology is giving people the opportunity to feel really smart,"" David-Marshall said.So, for example, there could be a card that looks just OK to most players, but any longtime player of Magic knows that the value of cards can change swiftly as the community learns the game. If some player built a deck that did great things with that card, word would get around and it would go up in value fast.So in this case ""feeling smart"" would also mean the option to sell a card back to Coase's market for a nice gain.Users can trade directly, of course; this is crypto, and people will be able to set up exchanges for the cards as well. But the founders hope the user experience of buying and selling most cards through Coase will be so good that players will primarily rely on their markets.That said, the founders were very clear that the company will not resist users trading cards however they wish. Once they buy them, they are theirs to use however they wish.The whole project is being built on Tezos, so all trades will be made in the blockchain's native cryptocurrency, XTZ, but the company is also working to hide this behind fiat rails for users who don't care about the crypto aspect.Going digital also allows the company to spin up interesting mechanics. For example, one of the most popular forms of Magic is ""draft,"" where everyone buys three packs but players get some choice about what cards they keep.Emergents plans a phantom draft, where players will have a similar experience but can then choose whether they want to buy cards they played with at the end of the game (or not).Some cards will become more unique with use, which is where there might be opportunities for exchanges in uniquely blockchain-y circumstances.For example, Magic cards cannot keep track of games the cards have played. Digital cards can.So it all depends on how popular the games get, but if the fandom gets big enough, serious fans might care about somewhat intangible qualities of the game that can be logged and proven on the blockchain, even if they don't impact gameplay.""Our cards have memory,"" Mowshowitz said.That means a card could have a record showing that it played in the winning deck at a major tournament. An artist or player could also digitally sign someone's card, proving that the collector has met someone from the digital experience.Coase's bonding-curve-governed pools probably won't be good at illuminating the card's memory, which could create an opportunity for entrepreneurs to create a marketplace for cards with unique provenances. If the fanbase gets large enough, that is.However, one key question anyone from centralized gaming will wonder is this: Will the company mess with supply? For example, if the game suddenly spikes in popularity and supply gets tight, will they wreck card values by quickly pumping up supply?The Coase co-founders were very clear on this: No. Cards will come out with fixed supplies and they will stick to it, which could be painful one day for players who really want something but also great for people who got that card early.The view of the Coase team was that it had to be that way. ""This is crypto,"" Mowshowitz said.Right, the game.Of course, the plan for Coase works best if its first game comes out strong.Emergents is still in alpha, but basically it's a game of pitting super-beings against super-beings. The intellectual property is from an analog deck-builder created by David-Marshall called Emergents: Genesis.Players act as the team leader of a gang of super-beings who are slowly coming out and attempting to attack the other player. To attack they first have to get past their opponent’s own team of super-beings. The games are divided into different factions, powered by different sorts of resources.""The way you build your resources to play cards is by playing cards,"" David-Marshall said.There are some elements of the game where the Coase team believes they've added innovations to the form, but these don't hinge on the game’s usage of blockchain technology.""I think the needle that Zvi and Brian are trying to thread,"" Breitman explained, ""is making a game that has a lot of strategic depth that can also be enjoyed by novices.""There's also the ability to put cards on the field without using them immediately. That is, removing them from your hand but waiting for the right time to activate them.To start, there will be a bunch of tutorials. The company will release a base set of free cards everyone can start with, in a format called ""free card constructed."" Then other cards will come out each week that players can buy. This means there will be new cards all the time; it also means when the game gets out of balance in some way, Coase can quickly print new cards that deal with it.Additionally, the company will eventually release a software development kit (SDK) that would even allow users to create experiences for using their cards (new formats, new rules, new limitations). Magic cards have a basic game attached to them but players have invented lots of new games based on the cards. A player with some coding skill could do the same eventually with Emergents.And if blockchains start communicating effectively, Emergents could even evolve beyond Tezos. There is, after all, a full metaverse for games out there.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

There, visitors can “pledge” TrueUSD and UPUSD stablecoins as well as bitcoin (BTC), litecoin (LTC) and ether (ETH), earning up to 10 percent interest over the course of the term, according to Cred CEO Dan Schatt.The service premieres at a somewhat awkward moment for Dinwiddie and Cred, both of whom deal in businesses acutely impacted by the global coronavirus pandemic. A starter for the Nets, Dinwiddie and his season were upended two weeks ago by the indefinite suspension of NBA play. Four of his teammates have since tested positive for COVID-19. Cred, for its part, is a banking and financial services alternative at a time when global financial markets are in turmoil. Jobless claims for last week – a lagging economic indicator, but a telling one – have spiked more than at any point in over a decade, data from the Labor Department shows. The economic carnage is expected to worsen as the U.S. economy slams on its brakes. Schatt said that the state of the world right now makes the Cred-Dinwiddie partnership all the more important. It’s offering users a high potential return on a volatility-free crypto asset: stablecoins backed one-to-one with dollar reserves. “In an environment like this I think everyone is looking for that extra assurance. It just highlights the value of stablecoins,” Schatt said.It's also an opportunity to bring more people into the crypto fold, he said. Dinwiddie is the NBA’s most outspoken cryptocurrency and DeFi enthusiast, a title earned over months of fighting to tokenize his three-year, $35 million contract. “Spencer is a fantastic spokesperson for what's happening with blockchain and bitcoin – he’s really a thought leader in the sports industry,” Schatt said.Dinwiddie will donate 26 percent of his revenue share to his charity, the Dinwiddie Family Foundation, according to Schatt.  A Cred spokesperson declined to state what percentage of the overall revenue that slice represents. The firm's website says it offers ""up to 10 percent interest"" through its Earn offering.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Mar 23, 2020 at 16:42 UTC","The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Kik are pushing for a speedy resolution to their ongoing legal battle, with both claiming the other has provided insufficient evidence to support their case. ","In a motion for summary judgment filed at the District Court for the Southern District of New York, the SEC claimed Kik had failed to provide any ""cognizable defense"" for why it had not registered its kin token sale – which raised a total of $100 million in 2017 – with the regulator. The SEC claims Kik sold tokens to investors on the understanding they would see a return – a key legal characteristic of a securities offering – through expanding utility in a growing token ecosystem. In the filing, the regulator cites instances where CEO Ted Livingston suggested the kin price would likely increase in value.  The regulator also refutes Kik's claims that half its sale was exclusively for accredited investors, arguing that little effort was made to distinguish it from its public sale, with no restrictions on accredited investors selling newly-acquired kin tokens on the open market. ""This is a straightforward case in which Kik’s investment scheme and violation of Section 5 are easily identified,"" reads the SEC's filing. Although the Ontario-based company claims it does not come under the SEC's jurisdiction, the regulator says it made itself liable by selling to U.S. citizens.Established in 2009, the firm intended kin tokens to work as part of a token economy integrated into its messaging app. The company claimed it hadn't hosted an unregistered securities sale since the SEC first took action in early 2018. Relations between the two sides have deteriorated, with Kik claiming the SEC ""twisted facts"" about its token sale in 2019.In its motion for summary judgment, Kik argues that, contrary to the SEC's allegations, it followed U.S. securities legislation to the letter. The firm says it hosted two sales: a pre-sale round for accredited investors to raise funds for developing the Kin ecosystem, and a second public sale to distribute tokens to users. Kik claims to have filed a Form D notice for the pre-sale in September 2017, exempting it from registering the offering with the SEC. The company also argues its second sale, open to the public, was not a securities offering because Kik did not promise returns on investment or offer contractual obligations to investors. See also: Kik Sells Messaging App, Reaffirms Kin Crypto IntegrationKin tokens were also intended to become a new form of currency that, by law, are explicitly not classified as securities. This, Kik says, is in line with what other U.S. regulatory bodies, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS), have ruled in classifying cryptocurrencies as commodities.By disregarding key aspects of the sale and the nature of the token, Kik says the SEC is stepping outside of its remit: ""The SEC asks this Court to bless an unprecedented and dramatic expansion of the SEC’s regulatory authority.""As recently as January of this year, Kik had again been pushing for a jury trial to make its case that its initial coin offering was not, in fact, unlawful. Last summer, Livingston said the SEC complaint “presents a highly selective and grossly misleading picture of the facts and circumstances surrounding our 2017 pre-sale and token distribution event. We look forward to presenting the full story in court.”Summary judgments are usually granted in cases where a judge deems the outcome to be a foregone conclusion and therefore not worth taking to full trial. However, it is common practice for defendants to file motions for summary judgments, even if the chance of success is relatively slim.

value that bitcoin aspires to accomplish. The internet, even without ...","Mar 21, 2020 at 13:24 UTC","Ajit Tripathi, a CoinDesk columnist, is an entrepreneur and crypto co-host at the Breaking Banks Europe podcast. Previously, he served as a fintech partner at ConsenSys and a co-founder of PwC’s UK Blockchain Practice. ","Before coronavirus hit the West in late February, the world’s attention was focused on billionaires saving the world in Davos. This year saving the world involved three things: 1. artificial intelligence, 2. climate change and 3. central bank digital currencies (CBDC). After the virus hit, we realized how dangerous banknotes could be and CBDC became an even hotter topic.While much of the discussion in social media has centered around whether a CBDC requires a blockchain, for most central banks, this is a secondary concern. As the Bank of England highlighted in its brilliant discussion paper recently, designing a CBDC involves making a large number of complex economic, technical and policy decisions. Among these, “Who will use the CBDC?” is the most important decision. Therefore, first we must understand what CBDC is and how it differs from other forms of money. CBDCs come in two main flavors. There’s wholesale CBDC, which is a digital currency designed for use by financial institutions. Then there’s retail CBDC, which is designed for use by individuals, households and corporations. While wholesale CBDC is much more useful from a financial markets and monetary policy perspective, retail CBDC is far more complex and interesting. It could ensure the public has continued access to a risk‑free form of money issued by the central bank, which may be especially important in the future as cash use declines and new forms of privately issued money become more widely used in payments.Let’s assume, for some strange reason, we all live in the U.S. and the Federal Reserve has read this article and decided to issue a digital dollar. In this scenario, this digital dollar is money that is a liability of the Fed. If you have a CBDC, i.e. a digital dollar, in your wallet, the Fed owes you a dollar. In that sense, a retail CBDC performs the same function as a banknote issued by the central bank. If it’s in your wallet and you haven’t stolen it from someone else, congratulations, it’s 100 percent your own and Uncle Sam owes you that money.A retail CBDC performs the same function as a banknote. In our example, if the Fed is still issuing paper dollars, you can ask the Fed to exchange your digital dollar for a paper dollar. In contrast, if you hold a stablecoin, such as Tether or TrueUSD, in your exchange account, the Fed owes you nothing. If all those Tethers were just smoke rings and you are suddenly REKT, well, that’s on you, not Uncle Sam. See also: Michael Casey: Davos Elites Still Don't Get BlockchainThe money in your retail bank account today is also not CBDC because it’s just a number your bank says it owes you. If your bank fails, the most you can recover is the maximum FDIC-insured amount. The money in your PayPal wallet is also not CBDC because if you press the Send button and PayPal refuses to send that money to Bob, you can complain to the regulator but Uncle Sam doesn’t owe you that money. In short, CBDC is digital money Uncle Sam owes you. By extension, it’s money that only Uncle Sam can print and only Uncle Sam can burn.Many central banks around the world are designing and testing CBDCs, but the jury is still very much out on their efficacy and longevity as policies. In general, arguments about CBDC fall into three buckets:Digital revolutionaries are people who argue that now China is issuing a digital yuan, everyone who currently uses the U.S. dollar will immediately switch to digital renminbi and the great American empire will soon come tumbling down. There is little logical justification for such sweeping beliefs. But, let’s offend my revolutionary friends in another article, not this one.CBDC skeptics argue money is already digital. They note that in several western countries, most consumer payments are made through mobile banking, Venmo or PayPal, and the use of cash is diminishing rapidly. Digital money tracked in central bank ledgers exposes users to surveillance with little benefit. Skeptical officials at the Bank of England say that if consumers can hold central bank money directly, they will not want to hold any money with commercial banks in a time of crisis, thus causing banks, credit and monetary policies to fail.CBDCs can mitigate.. risks by providing a sound domestic internet based payments system for a wide range of consumer applications CBDC proponents like me argue a well-designed CBDC can increase the ability of the issuing central banks to conduct monetary and credit policy and promote financial stability, consumer protection, financial inclusion and cross-border payments. In this article, I will try to explain how.At the most basic level, money held in savings accounts or e-wallets is not backed by the full faith and credit of the central bank and therefore bears credit risk (i.e. that banks will run out of money). Since most of us have savings accounts with less money than the maximum amount the FDIC is willing to insure, this is generally not a problem. For small and medium businesses that hold several hundred thousand dollars with banks, or for large consumer purchases like homes, the risk of a bank going under or not being able to find enough liquidity to honor a payment instruction is small but real.  Overall, there are four major reasons why many central banks will launch a retail CBDC over the next decade. To Facebook’s credit, unlike central banks it recognized that digital money is not about digitizing money. Digital money is about digitizing identity. This applies to CBDC, too. In fact, the greatest benefit of retail CBDC will be in accelerating the buildout of a coherent, national and global internet based digital identity infrastructure. This is when retail CBDC as a concept will start to deliver on the vision of peer to peer electronic cash. Now where have we heard that before?See also: Cambodia Readies a Blockchain-Based Digital CurrencyLet’s take an example. While domestic retail payments in many Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries are now free, cross-border payments remain a minefield of pain, cost and delays for consumers. If I send money to my mum in India, she has no digital identity in the U.K. and I have no digital identity in India. So my bank in the U.K. verifies that I sent the money, my mum’s bank verifies that she’s the person the money is for and both the banks verify (or at least hope) that neither I nor my mum is a nefarious character. Then the banks wait until they have compared their respective spreadsheets and make me wait for this reconciliation. Only after that, both the banks take a nice cut on the FX and send the rest to my mum. If the bank was in rural Ghana instead of Delhi, there’d probably be two more banks in this bank.chain, which would quadruple the delay and the pain. This whole process of cross-border payments is not only a pain for consumers, it also makes the global anti-money laundering (AML) regime ineffective and unenforceable. Instead, if the Bank of England and the Reserve Bank of India both were to rely on a shared set of data standards for their respective digital currencies and for the corresponding digital identity infrastructure, the checks can be fully automated, reconciliations eliminated and cross border internet based payments made instant, painless, reliable and free. Unlike commercial banks, central banks are like public utilities. A few central banks might print money and bail out billionaires every few years, but none exist to make money. Therefore, in general there is little reason for a central bank to offer accounts directly to retail customers. However, in countries like Cambodia where banks are not very strong and most people don’t have a lot of money, a central bank partnering with fintechs can give millions of people access to a robust, fast, electronic payments system. This is exactly what Makoto Takemiya and Soramitsu have done with their Bakong Project for the Central Bank of Cambodia. Furthermore, even in first-world countries like Sweden, the U.S. and the U.K., there are thousands of people who are too poor for a commercial bank to serve profitably. Many such consumers are also not technically or financially savvy enough to use mobile-only services. Right in the middle of a relatively prosperous country like America, there is an invisible Cambodia hoping that a Bakong like CBDC will happen. Let me state without proof that all money is debt. If you pay me with 10 libras, Facebook (strictly speaking, the Libra Association) owes me 10 libras more than it did before, and Facebook owes you 10 libras less than it did before. You in turn owe me 10 libras less than you did before. In that sense, a payment from you to me is a transfer of a debt obligation from you to Facebook. For this debt to be money, I need to be sure Facebook will be able to honor my claim when I ask Facebook to do so. If I don’t trust Facebook, I won’t accept your payment and those libras are worthless to me. If no one trusts facebook, then all the libras in the world are worthless indeed, which is unfortunately a more realistic scenario than it sounds.  See also: 10% of Central Banks Surveyed Close to Issuing Digital Currencies: BISWhen people lose trust in the ability of banks to honor their claims, they try to pull out all their money suddenly. This is known as a bank run. When banks don’t trust hedge funds and corporations, and therefore each other to honor their obligations in the overnight funding and commercial paper market, this should be known as the coronavirus financial crisis that has led the Fed to print $850 billion in bailout money last week. This is why people in financial services love to talk about trust. Financial stability is about preventing the financial system from becoming unstable and thus causing financial distress for consumers. Unlike cash and reserves, a retail CBDC will allow a central bank to become the lender of last resort for households and small businesses rather than for billionaires and banks. In a financial crisis, this will allow the central bank to bail out consumers instead of  corporations, which in turn will reduce the incentives for mega corporations to borrow too much. That, in turn, will reduce aggregate national debt and improve financial stability. The last thing governments want is for people to use Facebook’s libra or magic privately issued internet money like IOTA. First, if you don’t depend on the government’s money, the government has a lot less power over you than Facebook does. Second, if you do use magic internet money or Facebook’s money, the government still has to worry about how you will vote when you lose your keys or say when the founders of IOTA shut down the whole network leaving you to carry your bags. Retail CBDCs can mitigate these risks by providing a sound domestic internet based payments system for a wide range of consumer applications including gaming, paying for online content, electronic payments, device to device micropayments and so on.In summary, global standards-based retail CBDCs can deliver the internet of value that bitcoin aspires to accomplish. The internet, even without a native protocol for money has added trillions of dollars to global GDP. Now just imagine what the internet of value can do.In my next article, we will explore wholesale CBDC. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Mar 23, 2020 at 19:15 UTC","DeFi has an open security issue. A team of product designers for ZenGo, a noncustodial wallet company, found an exploit that can drain users’ funds from nearly all dapp wallets. While the security flaw has been known for two years, Ouriel Ohayon, CEO of ZenGo, is sounding the alarm, arguing the flaw poses a risk to users that has not been fully addressed.  ","The security issue, named BaDApprove, is not a code bug but a problem with how wallets interact with users and set transaction permissions by default. Researching a number of high-profile wallets – including Metamask, Opera and imToken – Ohayon found that when users approve a specific transaction, they are also often approving all future transactions by default. This opens the doors for malicious decentralized applications to interact with user funds without their knowledge or consent, possibly pilfering entire ether (ETH) holdings. See also: How Ethereum Applications Earn A+ Security RatingsThe bug is well documented, though Ohayon’s complaint rekindles a seminal conflict in crypto: Should crypto companies do what they can to protect users, or should crypto holders take full responsibility for their digital asset wealth? The ZenGo team set up a dapp demonstration to alert users of this potential exploit. The video shows a user who sends a few FRTs (a testnet currency) to the “rogue swapping app” and permits it to withdraw said tokens and automate transactions. Then, the BaDApprove dapp drains the user’s entire balance. Wallets should be showing this information front and center to users, and having alerts if it thinks something sketchy is going on.“It’s like saying, ‘by doing this bank transfer you accept the recipient will receive full access to your bank account,’” Ohayon said over Telegram. The situation is aggravated by the fact that many wallets do not communicate to their users these permissions stand, even if users stop using the dapp. Contacted by CoinDesk, Sunny Aggarwal, a research scientist at Tendermint and Cosmos, ran the simulation and also saw the consequences. “Ethereum dapps, if they want to interact with your ERC20 tokens, first need to ask approval to be allowed to move up to some number of them,” Aggarwal said in a direct message. “What happened here is that the dapp asked to approve an extremely high amount of tokens, [without showing] how much is being approved.”Aggarwal used the popular Metamask wallet, which he said only showed the transaction amount after he clicked ""Show More Details."" “And even then you'll see it displayed as 1.1579…………e+59,” or in scientific notation, “which is way too easy for someone to misread and accidentally think it's approving like ~1.15 tokens.” “This is a failure on the part of the wallets,” he said. “Wallets should be showing this information front and center to users, and having alerts if it thinks something sketchy is going on.” What Ohayon and ZenGo have highlighted has been a known issue in the DeFi (decentralized finance) community for years. The larger question is why it hasn’t been fixed. To some in the dapp world, the answer is it isn’t so much a flaw or a bug as a non-good feature. In September 2018, Jordan Randolph, a representative of Ethex, a decentralized exchange, outlined the problem in a Medium post. One-time approvals to move “a nearly infinite amount of tokens … can be convenient,” he wrote. “However, having a nearly infinite number of tokens approved means all of [your] token[s are] available to be transferred by the smart contract.”The wallet preset comes down to a choice between convenience and security, he said. Randolph did not respond to a request for comment. See also: OPINION: Thanks to Better UX, This Year Dapps Will Go Mainstream“Dapps that only offer one option – the approval of a huge number of tokens – harbor a fatal security flaw.” Over the past few weeks, ZenGo has raised the issue with a number of prominent wallets, often receiving pushback. “This issue is a known risk and requires user interaction. We have already clearly notified the user when they are entering a third-party dapp. But we still thank you for your report,” an imToken representative told Tal Be'ery, ZenGo cofounder, over Twitter. Reached by CoinDesk, Ben He, imToken CEO, said, “It's not a security exploit, it's a not-good convention to the whole Ethereum ecosystem that most of dapps/DeFi apps request unlimited allowance from users.”To address the issue, the imToken dapp browser has two popup modals, he said. One is when a first-time user visits the dapp URL, and the second pops up asking for user consent before transacting. “It's critical a user signs transactions cautiously and we see this is a proper and friendly reminder to the community,” he said, adding the company is “polishing our UI (user interface) to mitigate the concerns.”Metamask presented a similar response when queried about unlimited permissions. “This is actually a secure feature that users regularly use responsibly. It is not some kind of bug or problem,” an individual from MetaMask's support line said.  “[T]here is not an inherent issue with the ERC-20 standard, but [it] is fundamental to allowing smart contracts to interoperate with tokens,” he said. The firm has been proactive in adding safeguards, like popup messages that ask for confirmation to send funds and let users adjust the approved sum under advanced settings.See also: The US Should Use Stablecoins for Emergency Coronavirus PaymentsAdditionally, according to the representative, Metamask has “plans to give the users even more control,” such as features making it easier to revoke this allowance.Ohayon also cited Brave and Coinbase as displaying a “meaningful warning,” though this does not remove the risk that malicious actors can exploit dapp users. “Some security compromises that might have been acceptable in the era when users were scarce and highly technical are not acceptable when DeFi goes mainstream, acquiring many non-technical users, and handling crypto tokens in the billions (USD),” Alex Manuskin, ZenGo researcher, wrote in a blog post. He believes if crypto is ever to go mainstream, proper safeguards will have to be put in place to make sure new users are not exploited. A similar issue was raised two weeks ago following the crypto flash, when the question of trading “circuit breakers” came up. For many, these precautions vie against the crypto ethos of decentralization and personal autonomy. UPDATE: In response to ZenGo's research, imToken representative Philipp Seifert got in touch to say the firm will add push notifications for transactions and a way to edit allowances.""While this doesn't stop users from setting unlimited allowances, we are sure that it helps to make educated decisions,"" according to an imToken Medium post.

People can buy NFTs with credit cards and cash out directly to their bank accounts when they sell.To start, the collectibles exchange is working with mixed martial arts fighter Cris Cyborg and photographer Lyle Owerko, whose patrons include Justin Timberlake, Beyonce and Jay Z. “I’ve known Tyler and Cameron for a few years now. We met socially in New York, through friends,” Owerko said. “It’s fun to be an early adopter. … It’s like being a painter in the 1880s and seeing a camera for the first time.”He’ll offer a series of six images through Nifty’s marketplace for $200 to $2,500 each, depending on the image. Some images will have 25 copies available while others only have one NFT. “I did this of my own volition,” Owerko added when asked if the company paid him for lending his art to this format. He said this deal was “mutually beneficial.”Since the platform expects to make revenue from transaction fees, Nifty Gateway would need to attract enough volume to support the five-man team within Gemini. It remains to be seen if there’s enough consumer demand for such digital collectibles.The Nifty Gateway team estimated NFTs were a $200 million market in 2018, wrongly predicting the collectibles game CryptoKitties would remain a “project to watch” in 2019. CryptoKitties now attracts fewer than 200 weekly users, according to DappRadar, down from the 2017 peak of 14,914 daily active users. The NFT market is still seeing dismal growth in traditional tech terms. Nonfungible.com estimates the gaming startup Decentraland is one of the top three NFT market leaders yet facilitated roughly 50 transactions in the past week.By comparison, the Nifty team’s initial experiment with 10,000 “Crypto Punk” NTFs garnered roughly 3,569 transactions in two years, meaning fewer than half of them sold and few of them traded. On the other hand, OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer said his NFT marketplace now sees roughly $1.5 million in monthly trading volume, with a little under 10,000 active user accounts. With the Ethereum network buckling under congestion from coronavirus-induced volatility, Finzer said this may increase transaction fees the platforms pay for each swap.“If the Ethereum network remains super clogged, developers may just not build NFTs anymore,” he said. “Then more NFT projects may move to other main chains.”Indeed, CryptoKitties creator Dapper Labs is making progress on its forthcoming Flow blockchain, debuting a test environment for developers earlier this month.Given the instability among Ethereum’s fan base, the Cock Foster twins are looking to tap into celebrity fandoms, hoping to launch NFTs with more athletes and artists with devoted followings.“In the art world you don’t really see Picasso’s trading cap or trading volume,” Duncan Cock Foster said. “We’re also working on Nifty display devices. … People have to be able to hang their NFT up on their wall.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

People who struggle with anxiety, gambling addiction and a wide array of other other mental health issues may want to develop healthy habits for engaging with financial tools like cryptocurrency.Most American researchers agree these days that roughly 2 percent of the population is estimated to be at high risk for gambling addiction. Case in point: When Texas Tech University Assistant Professor Devin Mills surveyed 876 people who had gambled within the previous month, more than half of the respondents traded cryptocurrency. “Our data suggests that around 40 percent of regular gamblers who traded cryptocurrencies in the past year reported elevated levels of either depression or anxiety, or both,” Mills said. However, the frequency with which the respondents traded cryptocurrencies was positively associated with most other types of gambling. The data doesn’t suggest bitcoin (BTC) uniquely causes a gambling addiction, online harassment, or other mental health risks. It may simply be that people who already face these challenges are more likely to trade.See Also: Leigh's article about how cryptocurrency can be used as a tool by survivors of sexual harassment and domestic abuse.  “There is a good Russian saying: The pig will find the dirt,” said New York therapist Yevgenia Mastyayeva, who specializes in gambling addiction. “The technology and society shape your addiction, give it a particular form, but it is you who are predisposed or not to develop addiction in the first place.”There are also other mental health risks associated with cryptocurrency communities, namely habits that exacerbate anxiety disorders or expose users to anxiety-inducing harassment. Psychiatrist turned crypto entrepreneur Prash Puspanathan said financial distress can fuel some people’s pre-existing anxiety disorders, which could contribute to suicides. And, regardless of whether someone has an anxiety disorder, routine online harassment is stressful. Puspanathan also described online harassment related to “women sexually shamed... with occasionally devastating consequences.” According to a Pew Research Center survey in 2017, nearly 20 percent of Americans reported online harassment damaged their relationships at home, work or school, sometimes making it more difficult to find housing or employment.In short, a healthy bitcoiner should strive to find a balance of habits, minimized exposure to online harassers, and watch out for signs of erratic or addictive behavior. Some people might prefer to keep a separate budget for crypto investments versus household spending, plus use multisig wallets for long-term holdings, Mills said.Mastyayeva agreed bitcoin custody setups and trading platforms that simplify “realization of the impulse” might not be the best choice for those who display signs of addictive behavior. Limiting screen time can be helpful. What else do doctors suggest? Sleep. According to cognitive economist Leigh Caldwell, author of “The Psychology of Price,” it also might be prudent for people to avoid financial choices based mainly on Crypto Twitter. For daily insights and unique perspectives listen or subscribe to the CoinDesk Podcast Network with Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocketcasts, Google Podcasts, Castbox, Stitcher, RadioPublica, IHeartRadio or RSS.

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Mar 10, 2020 at 17:01 UTC","For once, U.S. lawmakers had an informative conversation about blockchain technology without posturing. ","The House Committee on Small Business hearing last week lasted only an hour, and only four members asked questions. But in some respects it was far more productive than an eight-hour hearing of the larger Financial Services Committee might have been.It was a sharp contrast from past Capitol Hill proceedings, when lawmakers took their entire allotted time to compare Libra to terrorist attacks or ask pointed questions about how Silicon Valley is biased toward one partisan slant or another. Rather, the small-business hearing saw only detailed questions about the legal or practical implications of blockchain and distributed ledger technology.The specific question at hand was how small businesses might be able to use blockchain technology for data storage or fundraising. Ranking member Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) asked if blockchain has any areas which need to be worked out prior to mass adoption. Protocol Labs’ Marvin Ammori answered that user interfaces are probably the key holdup. Rep. Sharice Davids (D-Kan.) asked how blockchain can protect personal information and records. PopComm’s Dawn Dickson said an individual can more selectively grant access using blockchain. Chairwoman Nydia Velazquez (D-N.Y.) opened the hearing by saying that while cryptocurrencies are the obvious use case people associate with blockchain, it is not the only one. “Much of the power of the internet is concentrated in a few multi-billion dollar companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon,” she said. “Blockchain technology can help small businesses compete on a more level playing field.”The witnesses likewise focused on practical applications.“Blockchain is not a silver bullet, but it can solve problems that small businesses face,” said Dickson, whose company provides software services to retailers.  Dickson told CoinDesk after the hearing she felt it was a positive experience, noting that she had been invited to testify as the operator of a small business. Perianne Boring, who leads the Chamber of Digital Commerce trade group, said the hearing was a step forward in relations between Congress and stakeholders in the private sector. “The next step is to create incentives for cooperation between companies that access and develop blockchain applications and government agencies focused on helping small businesses innovate and grow,” she said. Jim Harper, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, described the hearing as another advance in Congress’s push to better understand cryptocurrency and blockchain. “Agencies and committees are thinking through the details,” he said. Taxation is probably the largest regulatory issue that needs to be tackled, however, Harper said. The Internal Revenue Service has not published much guidance around taxing crypto, particularly cryptocurrencies being used for spending. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

For one thing, it is “public permissioned,” meaning ...","Mar 11, 2020 at 10:06 UTC","Figure Technologies has completed a long-awaited $150 million securitization of a bundle of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), billed as the first such transaction in which all aspects of the process were managed on a blockchain.","In other words, everything from the origination of the loans to the issuance of the bonds to the collection of borrowers' monthly payments is run on Provenance, Figure’s blockchain, according to the company. This distinguishes the transaction from most enterprise blockchain projects, which have either been demonstrations of the technology rather than live applications or touched just one piece of a complex process.  As such, the bond issue may serve as a showcase for the benefits of distributed ledger technology (DLT) to businesses at a time when such use cases no longer generate the same buzz as five years ago. Corporate experimentation with the technology now tends to take place under the radar, with the word “blockchain” spoken in hushed tones, if at all.“While there are certainly other companies trying blockchain-based securitization, Figure's project is at minimum a notable and high-profile effort,” said Lewis Cohen, a principal at DLx Law, who was not involved in the transaction. “The future of securitization involves a level of detailed and accurate information about underlying assets that blockchain technology is well suited to provide.”U.S. brokerage Jefferies Group and Japanese financial giant Nomura managed the bond sale for Figure. The two-year-old startup has raised over $225 million at a $1.2 billion valuation, including a $103 million Series C funding round in November. It has drawn a spate of serious backers in the blockchain space, including Morgan Creek, Digital Currency Group, Foxconn’s investing arm HCM Capital, Rabbit Capital and MUFG. As it stands, securitization – the decades-old Wall Street practice of repackaging loans into bonds sold to investors – can resemble a Rube Goldberg machine. One company may take the consumer’s application (the “originator”); another may fund the loan (the “warehouse lender”); yet another will sell the securities to investors (the “underwriter”); still another will mail the monthly bills and dun late payers (the “servicer”). That’s a simplified version. By automating all these steps on Provenance, Figure says it can speed up the process and cut expenses. “It costs us significantly less to originate loans on blockchain,” said Mike Cagney, Figure’s CEO.For example, managing the information on one ledger can minimize errors, ensure those that do occur are caught and fixed sooner and eliminate fees for things such as transferring the loan between parties, according to Figure. “We don’t have to pay for boarding costs, loan defects, while reducing quality control expenses,” said Cagney, the former CEO of online lender Social Finance. Figure says it can approve a HELOC in five minutes and fund the loan in five days instead of the typical 30 to 60 days. The firm claims its technology could save $30 billion in costs for the $3 trillion annual securitization market if applied widely.  That’s still a big if.There is still skepticism about the potential benefits of blockchain adoption in the traditional financial services space, where centralized systems are seen as more efficient. ""Blockchain is really a bad way to do almost anything,” said Chris Whalen, chairman of Whalen Global Advisors and a longtime Wall Street analyst and investment banker. “A simple XML ledger is far more efficient. Using blockchain in finance is like learning Urdu to enhance enterprise security.""And by all accounts, getting Figure’s first deal done was difficult. It’s been in the works since at least May 2019, when the company announced it had obtained a warehouse line from WSFS Bank to fund the loans, with an eventual securitization as the endgame.According to a Feb. 7 article in Asset-Backed Alert, a respected industry newsletter, the bond sale was originally scheduled for October 2019 but was held up due to a prospective rating agency’s concerns about the collateral, which included third liens. (Most HELOCs are second liens, meaning that in event of foreclosure, they wait in line to be repaid after the original mortgage lender; third liens, which are rarer and riskier, get whatever is left after that.)Figure denied the report (the firm is suing the publication) and Cagney said the main cause for the delay was the fact that auditors are not familiar with on-chain practices.    Unlike most securitizations, Figure’s was not rated by an agency like Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s, nor was it registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As an unrated private placement, the bonds would be more difficult to sell in the secondary market should the investors ever want to unload them.However, Figure did successfully sell the bonds to third-party investors: Jeffrey Gundlach’s DoubleLine for the $127 million of senior notes and Tilden Park Capital Management for the riskier $22 million subordinated tranche, according to a white paper from Figure. Previously, European financial institutions Santander and Societe Generale have issued bonds on the public Ethereum blockchain, but only to themselves.DoubleLine will be paid a 4 percent coupon on the senior bonds, which are expected to be paid down in three years. That’s more than three percentage points higher than the current yield on three-year U.S. Treasury bonds.Cagney said the pricing on the senior bond was on par with comparable products and the firm did not have to compensate investors extra for the novelty of a blockchain, which he said adds value. “There wasn't a premium we had to pay on the blockchain side,” he said. Provenance is different from the blockchains underpinning cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. For one thing, it is “public permissioned,” meaning that while anyone can view the ledger, only authorized parties may write to it. No one needs permission to send a bitcoin transaction, and while mining on that network is an expensive undertaking, theoretically it’s open to all comers. Further, there are 12 nodes validating transactions on the Provenance network, and Figure would identify only one of the operators, mutual fund giant Franklin Templeton. Thousands of nodes run on the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks worldwide.  Figure developed Provenance in-house, using the consensus mechanism of Hyperledger, one of the three main open-source enterprise blockchain platforms (the others being R3’s Corda and private versions of Ethereum).The firm aims to securitize another $200 million of HELOCs in the next four weeks and to issue its first student loan-backed bonds in the second quarter, according to Cagney. And if Figure’s model catches on, it might ameliorate some of the problems that contributed to the global market meltdown of 2008.“Securitization failed in the financial crisis because too many pools were originated without investors being able to efficiently understand what was in the pool and what they were lending against,” said Cohen, who made his name as a securitization lawyer and now specializes in blockchain work. “You could have detailed information without verification and you can have accurate information that may not be very granular.” By contrast, “blockchain can give investors a better sense of what they are buying and how they are performing.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

""It is our obligation to inform the Cardano community of legal proceedings recently initiated by the Z/Yen Group Limited (UK) against the Cardano Foundation (Switzerland),"" the foundation said.The dispute revolves around a reported agreement between the two organizations that the foundation allegedly terminated or voided for reasons not disclosed in the blog post. ""The Cardano Foundation fully rejects the claims raised by the Z/Yen Group Limited,"" the blog post reads, adding it would not provide any further information while proceedings were underway.However, the agreement in question appears to be one made in December 2017, when the foundation partnered with Z/Yen's Distributed Futures practice for collaborating on new research papers, as well as exploring potential applications for Cardano and its ADA cryptocurrency. At the time, Michael Parsons, the foundation's then-chairman and executive director, described the Z/Yen partnership as ""extremely important."" He said the two organizations would work together on the ongoing development of new tools and functionalities that would help increase industry understanding of governance and regulatory issues. In February 2018, the Cardano Foundation's official Twitter account posted about an event run by ""our research partner"" Z/Yen, for exploring how quantum computing could be used for blockchain security. Later that year, Z/Yen announced plans to experiment with smart ledgers for administering pension schemes, which would be sponsored by the Cardano Foundation according to a press release. Charles Hoskinson, founder and CEO of IOHK, a Cardano developer, said the lawsuit is a ""commercial dispute"" and a ""leftover"" from the former administration of the foundation. He added that none of Z/Yen's research had been used in the Cardano protocol.Z/Yen's co-founder and executive chairman, Michael Mainelli ,told CoinDesk neither he or Z/Yen were able to comment on the legal case while it was undergoing judicial consideration.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Mar 17, 2020 at 06:00 UTC","Cathy Barrera, a CoinDesk columnist, is a founding economist at Prysm Group, an economic advisory group, and was chief economist at ZipRecruiter. She has a PhD in business economics from Harvard. ","The MakerDAO network is currently in a state of peril. The rapid drop in the price of ETH – which fell from roughly $200 on Wednesday, March 11, to a low of roughly $95 on March 12 (and it has since hovered around $110-$120) due to global market turmoil – reduced the value of the DAI’s collateral and triggered automatic liquidations. The already-clogged ethereum network could not quickly process additional collateral deposits by Vault holders, and the automated bots of Keepers, who play the role of liquidators, were not calibrated for the sudden increase in gas prices. Some reports suggest that a stuck oracle triggered unnecessary liquidations even after the price of ETH rebounded. At least one enterprising Keeper successfully purchased auctioned ETH from Vaults for $0, resulting in a mass deficit (initially $4 millon, and now $5.7 million as of March 16) for the MakerDAO system. The situation is still actively developing as of the writing of this column; for more, see previous Coindesk articles. Crises like these are the worst nightmare of the founding teams of decentralized platforms. Many would consider MakerDAO’s current situation to be the result of an impossible-to-foresee “black swan event” in ETH markets or broader crypto markets. They would argue there was no way to plan in advance for such a situation to be managed. After all, the entire point of a “black swan event” is that its occurrence and timing cannot be reasonably anticipated ahead of time.See also: MakerDAO Debts Grow as DeFi Leader Moves to Stabilize ProtocolHowever, even though this particular crisis could not have been foreseen, there are steps the Maker team could have taken to prepare for these unknown unknowns. This situation, while still actively developing, highlights that those teams who design DeFi networks cannot treat economic and governance design as “optional future TBDs.” They must proactively consider all possible (covarying) risks, assuming that users will behave in their own best interests, and make it a priority to implement governance systems that are robust to these sorts of crises.  As we have written about previously, the governance of a blockchain platform is distinct from its operational structures and rules.  When founding teams design blockchain platforms, they spend most of their time focused on the operational structures. These are the mutually agreed upon rules and processes put in place to help manage the day-to-day functioning of the platform and the interactions that users have with each other. For example, algorithms that assist in determining the next block in the chain, and the size of the block rewards granted to validators, are components of the operational structures. Many components of economic design, such as contract and marketplace design, fall under this category.Governance, in contrast, is the set of mechanisms by which the stakeholders collectively make choices regarding changes or updates to a platform’s operational rules, and to make decisions regarding events that the operational rules do not address.  If operational rules consist of all of the written procedures and agreements in black and white, governance is the set of processes that help us address the grey areas in between.It is better to address these issues beforehand, rather than trying to repair the damage and pick up the pieces after.From an economic point of view, governance is essential in any blockchain platform because market conditions inevitably change and black swan events are unavoidable. No matter how thorough or well thought out a system design is, or how well-specified the algorithms of a platform are, there is always some future twist or turn that will cause users to need to change the rules of the protocol.  In a firm or organization, executive leadership typically takes this role. In a decentralized blockchain platform, the community must have processes in place to take equivalent collective action.Well-designed governance has many parts.  There need to be clearly defined rules regarding the scope of problems the governance system can address; how proposals for actions are collected; who is allowed to participate in any voting or decision-making; how results are communicated; and how any decisions are enforced. A core component of any well-designed governance process is crisis governance.The MakerDAO community continues to discuss and debate the best path forward. As this crisis resolves, there are several lessons blockchain projects can take as they proceed with their own governance design.   Crisis governance will be more necessary than founders think.For founders of platforms who give so much to their projects, it can be difficult to contemplate their users could potentially exploit the platform for their own personal gain. However, founding teams need to plan for a crisis occurs and not all users are on the platform’s side. A well-defined, pre-specified plan for crisis intervention by a set of trusted stakeholders is often necessary.See also: ""Rune Radio,"" CoinDesk's Most Influential profile of MakerDAO impresario Rune ChristensenA core stakeholder role on the MakerDAO platform is the Keeper. From MakerDAO’s white paper, a Keeper is “an independent (usually automated) actor that is incentivized by arbitrage opportunities to provide liquidity in various aspects of a decentralized system. In the Maker Protocol, Keepers are market participants that help Dai maintain its Target Price ($1): they sell Dai when the market price is above the Target Price, and buy Dai when the market price is below the Target Price.”  As the price of ETH dropped and Vault liquidations were automatically triggered, Keepers could participate in auctions to purchase ETH from the liquidated Vaults. These auctions typically have multiple Keepers submitting bids, and effectively result in competitive exchange rates between DAI and ETH.  But, given the high volume of liquidations, at least one Keeper was able to successfully bid 0 DAI for Vaults’ liquidated ETH over a 2-3 hour time period, fueling the multi-million dollar debt (AKA “negative system surplus”) that the platform is now trying to resolve.Before this crisis, a founding team might argue that no individual Keeper would bid 0 DAI even if they could, because it would hurt the MakerDAO system’s credibility and reputation. However, when disaster occurred, this concern for communal well-being was not sufficient incentive to prevent one or more of these Keepers from taking advantage of the fact that they were the sole active Keeper in liquidation auctions.Founding teams don’t want to contemplate that their projects might be faced with crises and might need to have levers to intervene rapidly.  Crisis governance needs to be well-specified in advance of the crisis.MakerDAO was previously considered a strong project and a beacon of DeFi. Venture capital firms purchased over $34 million of the MKR governance token in late 2019, signaling confidence in the Maker platform. However, this crisis situation has revealed the extent to which certain aspects of the Maker system – namely crisis governance procedures – were not fully specified. MakerDAO’s white paper notes the holders of MKR tokens – the platform’s governance token -- and the MakerDAO Foundation have the option to engage in an emergency shutdown. However, the specific parameters under which these parties could – or should – elect to shut the platform down were not specified. Stakeholders who were unable to deposit additional collateral in their Vaults because of congestion in the ETH market were confused about whether a shutdown would occur, as well as whether they would be compensated by MakerDAO for losses from automatically triggered liquidations if the platform continued to run. The community continued to be confused even after clarifying blog posts were posted by the MakerDAO leadership, as evidenced by the MakerDAO chat forum and subreddit.Although the Maker team is now considering (and actively making) changes to the platform, the interim confusion caused significant distress in the community and a lot of time invested in determining next steps. Many stakeholders are now aggrieved because they feel they were liquidated unfairly and with a much higher penalty than the previously advertised 13 percent liquidation penalty. Crisis governance may need the power to change fundamental platform parameters.See also: DeFi Leader MakerDAO Weighs Emergency Shutdown Following ETH Price DropThe choice of parameters for Vault liquidation auctions gave Keepers the opportunity to effectively get something for nothing. Instituting a reserve price, or minimum bid, for auctions of ETH liquidated from Vaults could have prevented ETH being sold for 0 DAI.  Prior to the crisis, the Maker team had discussed the design of minimum bid increments, but to our knowledge had not considered a minimum bid.  An alternative to shutting down the platform would be to allow crisis governance to more quickly adjust fundamental platform parameters, such as the minimum bid in a liquidation auction. A crisis decision-making process that allowed the Maker team to quickly implement a minimum bid of DAI for ETH could have potentially mitigated the current situation. Specifying carefully not only the crisis governance process, but also what elements of the platform the process can address, can have a large impact on its efficacy. It can be difficult in the early phases of platform design to have the tough conversations about in-the-weeds governance design. Hopeful founding teams don’t want to contemplate that their projects might be faced with crises and might need to have levers to intervene rapidly.  Without specifying these processes in advance and giving them sufficient flexibility and power, founding teams will be vulnerable to unexpected (yet not impossible) events like the ones we saw this week. As tough as it may be, it is better to address these issues beforehand, rather than trying to repair the damage and pick up the pieces after.Prysm Group Associate Johnny Antos contributed to this article.  The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

As the new head of business, Grant fills that role, a spokesman for SDX confirmed.  Grant has also previously served as CEO of the R3 Lab and Research Centre. SDX selected R3’s Corda platform to supply the DLT infrastructure for the new digital asset exchange in March 2019. “I am very excited to join the leadership team at SDX as they aim to launch the world’s first end-to-end digital exchange,” said Grant in a statement. “The team has already made huge progress and I’m looking forward to contributing my experience and working with our institutional clients around the work to continue the growth and expansion of the next generation of financial market infrastructure.”It’s unclear where this leaves Grant’s other venture, DrumG. The startup, which aimed to create interoperability between enterprise versions of ethereum and R3’s Corda network, had raised some $6.5 million in Series A funding from ConsenSys back in October 2018, and Joe Lubin, CEO of the Ethereum studio, had joined DrumG’s board of directors.As recently as last September, Grant was taking to the stage espousing the merits of DrumG Technologies, which employs about 20 staff across offices in New York, London and Bermuda. However, ConsenSys appears to be re-calibrating its outgoings and has been forced to cut staff this year from some parts of its operations.Neither Grant, DrumG nor ConsenSys returned requests for comment on the state of the venture by press time. Bumpy roadThe past 18 months have been something of a bumpy road for SDX.  The project was forced to delay its rollout, slated for summer 2019, until around the end of this year. In addition, Ivo Sauter, SDX’s head of clients and products, and Sven Roth, its chief digital officer, both left their full-time positions in January, with a “disalignment” from the project’s original goals being cited after original SDX chief Martin Halblaub departed last summer. Tomas Kindler, who was filling in for Halblaud, expressed a wish to take a senior position within the main exchange group, according to a SIX spokesman. Kindler would help oversee the planned integration of Bolsas y Mercados Españoles (BME), the Spanish stock exchange SIX has bid for. “Tim has a comprehensive background in both the new and old worlds of capital markets innovation,” said Thomas Zeeb, head Securities & Exchanges at SIX Group, and chairman of SDX, said in a statement.“This background is an essential prerequisite to successfully lead the development of SDX and to fulfil SIX’s growth ambition to build the financial ecosystem of the future.

Those came after one filed by the SEC two months earlier, which immediately pushed the company’s stock price down by 17 percent. On Dec. 9, the e-commerce giant was hit by one subpoena requesting “documents related to the GSR transaction and the alternative trading system run by tZERO ATS, LLC,” the filing said. The transaction in question appears likely to be a $5 million investment in tZero from Chinese private equity firm GSR.The troublesome deal, initially planned in 2018 as a $400 million purchase of tZERO tokens by GSR, kept shrinking as the buyer renegotiated it throughout 2019, finally closing last March as a far more modest $5 million in equity. Makara Capital, another company initially planning to invest along with GSR, backed off the deal, as Overstock reported in August. Even the agreed upon $5 million may not have been paid in full yet. The filing indicates that by Dec. 31 GSR had provided only $4.4 million, with the rest to be paid by March 31, 2020. The final SEC subpoena, filed Dec. 19, was related to Overstock’s “insider trading policies as well as certain employment and consulting agreements,” the filing says. The regulator has also been requesting Overstock's communications with the company’s founder and former CEO, Patrick Byrne, who quit his position and left the company in August. Overstock is also still under investigation by the SEC regarding the 2018 sale of tZERO tokens. “We are cooperating with the SEC's investigation and have provided documents requested in the subpoenas,” Overstock said in the latest filing. tZERO CEO Saum Noursalehi did not respond CoinDesk's request for comment by press time. The end of the year didn't bring good news for Overstock in terms of its finances either. According to the annual report, earnings for its retail business fell over 20 percent compared to 2018. For the year ending Dec. 31, net annual revenue had dropped from $1.82 billion to $1.46 billion. Overstock’s online store has been the source of funding for all the blockchain subsidiaries of Overstock, including tZERO.Plans to launch a digital stock marketplace together with the Boston Stock Exchange have also been pushed back. The SEC extended the review period for a proposed rule change for the second time on Jan. 16, the report says. The Boston Stock Exchange submitted an amended filing on March 9.Overstock’s blockchain subsidiary tZERO was launched last January, after raising $134 million in a security token offering. From the start, though, volumes have been light on the platform, which is constrained by the same rules that apply to traditional securities trading platforms.   tZERO launched its own crypto trading app and listed Overstock’s Digital Voting Series A-1 Preferred shares – a digital security – last summer. The company paid dividends on the blockchain shares soon after. In September, an investor launched a class action lawsuit against Overstock, Byrne and the firm's former chief financial officer, Gregory Iverson, over how the dividend payout was structured and how Byrne had sold his own shares of Overstock when departing.

Read ...","Mar 19, 2020 at 15:00 UTC","The legal team representing the brother of Craig Wright's deceased business partner greatly overclaimed on legal fees, according to the judge overseeing the case.","Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart of the federal court of the Southern District of Florida criticized the fees claimed by the attorneys representing Ira Kleiman – who is suing Wright for 50 percent of the bitcoin (BTC) and intellectual property he owned before 2014 – as ""excessive"" and ruled they wouldn't be granted in full.Kleiman's four-man legal team filed for a total of $658,500, comprised of more than $592,000 in attorney fees, as well as roughly $66,000 in other expenses like subject experts. But finding these rates too high, the judge slashed what the Kleiman team can actually claim to $113,760 in fees and $52,000 in expenses. That's a grand total of $165,800 – approximately a quarter of the amount originally sought. Kleiman's suit against Wright – which claims Wright had tried to seize assets that rightfully belonged to his dead brother's estate – has been rocky for the Australian tech entrepreneur (who also claims he's bitcoin's inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto). Wright has been found in contempt of court for not revealing bitcoin holdings and accused of abusing privilege to withhold documents potentially crucial to the case. In November 2019, Wright pulled out of an out of court settlement that had been tentatively agreed upon two months previously. See also: Judge Blasts Craig Wright’s Evidence, ‘Inconsistent’ Testimony in Kleiman TrialBut in this week's order, Judge Reinhart found Kleiman's four attorneys claimed fees at rates that either exceeded their experience or were simply out of proportion to the amount usually charged in the Florida court system. He also found the legal team inflated billable hours, by either overstaffing or exaggerating the time it took to perform tasks. ""I find all these rates to be excessive. I am personally familiar with the hourly rates charged by the top civil litigators in Palm Beach County,"" said Judge Reinhart.In one example, the judge asked why three attorneys were needed to prepare and review the response to a motion from the defendant. ""It was not reasonable to have three lawyers involved to this extent to review a draft [for] a relatively straight-forward pleading,"" he said. In another instance, Judge Reinhart said the attendance of three attorneys at an evidentiary hearing was excessive.The costs were awarded due to ""protracted litigation over production of documents identifying Dr. Wright’s bitcoin holdings,"" according to the order.Wright now has until March 30 to pay out the legal team's reduced fees and expenses.

At press time the situation was growing more chaotic: Italy, China and New Rochelle, N.Y., are in various states of lockdown; universities are moving their classes online; businesses are going remote; and financial markets are wiping away a decade of steady gains.Against this, the FCA warned of “too good to be true” investments, particularly those in crypto.

enabled a new feature that will let customers use cash to buy bitcoin.","Mar 10, 2020 at 13:00 UTC","BlockFi, a financial company focused on cryptocurrencies, says it has enabled a new feature that will let customers use cash to buy bitcoin. ","Previously, the Jersey City, N.J.-based crypto lender only allowed customers to bring digital assets onto its platform, such as stablecoins linked to the U.S. dollar, Chief Executive Zac Prince said in a phone interview. The system relied solely on “crypto payment rails,” he said. Starting Tuesday, customers can send cash to BlockFi via wire transfers through a partnership with Silvergate Capital, a bank holding company based in La Jolla, Calif. The publicly traded Silvergate is one of the few commercial lenders willing to do business with cryptocurrency-focused companies.The cash transfers can also be used to deposit money with BlockFi and earn interest, currently set at an 8.6 percent annual rate – some 860 times higher than the 0.01 percent rate offered on a JPMorgan Chase bank account. Unlike Chase, BlockFi isn’t a bank, however, so the accounts don’t come with federal deposit insurance protection. But also unlike Chase, BlockFi lets customers choose an option that lets them get the interest paid in bitcoin (BTC). ""In an increasingly low-yield and volatile market, opportunities like earning 8.6 percent on stablecoin deposits with BlockFi stands out in the crypto sector,"" Prince said in a statement. ""Adding support for inbound wires will facilitate increased liquidity on BlockFi's platform, which flows through and improves liquidity in the broader crypto ecosystem.""More individual investors are becoming interested in cryptocurrencies, especially following the recent outperformance of bitcoin compared with U.S. stocks. Fears related to the economic impact of the spreading coronavirus have sent the S&P 500 Index of large U.S. stocks down 15 percent on a year-to-date basis. Bitcoin, by contrast, is up 13 percent in 2020. Prince said BlockFi started developing the wire-transfer capability after being inundated by “requests every day from our existing clients, and also from folks who aren't already cryptocurrency owners.” For now, the new feature only allows for U.S. dollar wire transfers, according to a BlockFi spokesman. When the money comes in, it's immediately converted into Gemini's GUSD stablecoin and held in the user's account in that form.   BlockFi, founded in 2017, announced in February it had raised $30 million in fresh funding from investors including Valar Ventures, Morgan Creek Digital and Winklevoss Capital. The closely held company disclosed last month it had $650 million of assets on its platform, including cryptocurrency-backed loans, and that revenue surged 20-fold in 2019. The company said in Tuesday’s statement it recently obtained a money-services business license from the state of Florida, allowing residents of the state to use BlockFi’s trading service and interest accounts.

The lists, including real names and symptoms, have not been confirmed in full by CoinDesk. ""This instinctive and dutiful radical transparency may change behaviours and save lives,” list creator Justin Drake tweeted.One anonymous EthCC attendee in her 20s who tested positive for COVID-19, but may have contracted the virus from her partner at home who also tested positive, said there weren’t many precautionary measures at the event in Paris. The event was planned by the nonprofit Ethereum France and staffed by volunteers from ConsenSys and other crypto companies. “There were a few people with masks and hand sanitizer, but not many,” she said. “Most of the EthCC attendees were young and still thinking the virus wouldn’t affect them.”She added she was hospitalized for two days after returning to the U.S., and is still quite ill. She is not listed on the documents currently being circulated, suggesting the infection count from the event are likely higher.“The one thing they don't tell you about is it basically makes it so you’re not able to breathe … it basically feels like you are drowning,” she said of the respiratory disease. “I’m really surprised that EthCC wasn’t canceled and the whole thing held virtually. … I think it should have been completely virtual.”ConsenSys Labs investor Min Teo tweeted that anyone who attended the conference, regardless of symptoms, should self-quarantine. Along those lines, another anonymous EthCC attendee said he wished the Ethereum Foundation would take a more active approach in warning event organizers.This raises questions about leadership and responsibility across the ecosystem, an anonymous EthCC attendee told CoinDesk.“I believe there was a responsibility from the EF to warn people early not to gather at upcoming conferences, especially since people were also sick at ETHDenver,” he said. “I get that the EF doesn't control EthCC or EthGlobal, but perhaps a warning from the leadership early on?”The crowdsourced lists may be a step in the right direction for stopping further spread of the disease. However, Claire Brindis, co-director of USCF’s National Adolescent and Young Adult Health Information Center, said such lists could actually put people at even greater risk down the line. “In particular, when we see the type of xenophobia we have these days, people on such lists could be endangered,” Brindis said. “I anticipate there could be unexpected, negative ramifications. I would want to be notified if I have been exposed, but not in a public venue like this. I’m worried about how people might use this information against others.”For some ethereum fans, this outbreak raises questions about community leadership.“The Bitcoin community doesn't suffer from this issue of having a leader figure that can impact Bitcoin's ecosystem,” the anonymous male attendee said. “I hope this will change the way these things [Ethereum events] are run. It seems like the [Ethereum] leadership needs to be more aware of global issues happening.” As for ConsenSys, spearheaded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, the company issued a public statement saying it is “well-positioned to weather this disruption and maintain business continuity” because of its remote-first company policy. Obviously, company travel and meetups are now going fully virtual, including the firm’s banner Ethereal event in New York in May.Although Lubin and other ConsenSys executives are noticeably absent from public infection lists, some list participants remain anonymous. Both Lubin and Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin were at EthCC in Paris, according to attendees.Buterin tweeted on Saturday that he’s in good health and will update the community if he develops any symptoms.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The report found an average dollar loss in crypto-focused fraud of $3,000 for victims age 25 to 44. The relatively high figure was the result of nefarious actors taking advantage of those who lacked foundational knowledge of digital assets, BBB said.Thirty-two percent of scams involved the exchange of cryptocurrencies for goods, services or fiat currency, while 23.4 percent involved the purchase of digital assets as purported investment opportunities, BBB found. Roughly one-third (31 percent) of cryptocurrency scams with a financial loss involved a company known as C2CX, apparently based in China. It's worth noting that crypto crimes measured in the scam statistics include loss of funds resulting from hackers who infiltrated exchanges considered ""vulnerable."" BBB didn't provide data on how much of the risk rating arose from such hacks as opposed to fraudulent schemes.The report looked at 10 different types of scam, with crypto ranking just above ""online purchase"" types of fraud, which came in third.Cryptocurrency, however, fell behind employment scams to rank as the second most risky type with an index rating of 93.8, an internal measurement that takes into account a number of varying factors including susceptibility and exposure.Exposure to crypto scams rose by just 0.4 percent year on year, one of the least, while employment scams rose by a much larger margin of around 9.3 percent. The latter type of fraud involves bad actors attempting to trick victims into sending money for a supposed ""guaranteed"" way to make quick bucks or gain a high-salaried job.For the risk assessment, BBB looked at a combination of  exposure, susceptibility and monetary loss.

As per a court order signed by Judge Katherine Polk Failla dated March 10, the proceedings have now been discontinued. The class action was first brought in April 2018, when Tucker complained Chase had charged him more than $160 in fees and interest for regularly purchasing cryptocurrencies from Coinbase using his credit card. Tucker accused the bank of violating the Truth in Lending Act for not informing customers that crypto purchases were being treated as ""cash advances,"" which incur higher fees. He also complained the bank refused to refund the charges to affected customers. ""[T]he complete lack of fair notice to Chase’s cardholders caused them to unknowingly incur millions of dollars in cash advance fees and sky-high interest charges on each and every crypto purchase,"" reads the original complaint. The bank did not charge similar fees for purchases made on debit cards. In February 2018, Chase, like some other U.S. consumer banks, banned users from purchasing crypto on their credit cards. Even though JPMorgan revealed its own blockchain-based settlements solution and ""JPMCoin"" token in 2019, the ban on crypto purchases on credit cards has not been lifted.

model behind Bitcoin, and “classical,” which uses majority vote.","Mar 24, 2020 at 09:00 UTC","AVA Labs, the first project building on the “Avalanche protocol” blockchain network, is looking to modernize financial infrastructure. ","As first envisioned in a 2018 white paper by the pseudonymous “Team Rocket,” Avalanche protocol uses random network sampling to reach consensus. But it is AVA Labs' ambition in building new infrastructure for the financial markets that now drives the firm forward. The new platform could have special value for financial infrastructure and applications, not just in decentralized finance (DeFi) but for Wall Street firms, too, said AVA co-founder Kevin Sekniqi. That’s why the team decided to base itself in Brooklyn, N.Y., instead of the more tech-savvy Bay Area in California, where Sekniqi admits AVA Labs’ “hackers and engineers at heart” might fit in more naturally. AVA open sourced its initial codebase on March 11.See also: Long-Festering DeFi Dapp Bug Still Not Fixed by IndustryAVA is now looking to move even closer to New York’s financial gearworks. Sekniqi has tentative plans to abandon its current Brooklyn HQ in favor of offices within striking distance of the Financial District in lower Manhattan, where physical proximity to banks, brokers and firms can raise awareness of the product. “We’re going to have a big push in the financial sector, so we’re going to need to meet with a lot of people in that area, downtown in FiDi,” Sekniqi said. He said those meetings could go a long way to getting institutions to take blockchain solutions more seriously. Too often there’s a breakdown in messaging in which institutions do not see the value of blockchain because they do not see how it solves their business “pain points” in digitizing assets.  “Everything is lacking right now, primarily in technology,” Sekniqi said.AVA is still in the process of building its first network. To that end, it released the codebase for the Avalanche protocol earlier this month, fleshing out the technical elements for an ecosystem AVA’s founders hope will challenge the supremacy of other leading consensus families.The launch gives the developer community a look at AVA Lab’s multiyear effort to piece together a workable source code for Avalanche. Avalanche’s random sample method presents a significant break from two popular consensus families: Nakamoto, the proof-of-work model behind Bitcoin, and “classical,” which uses majority vote. Proponents say Avalanche takes the best of both protocols while detractors scoff at what they deem a lesser derivative. See also: Why Polynomial Commitments Might Be a ‘Breakthrough’ for Ethereum 2.0“We’ve been hearing from people that they want much more scalable, much faster consensus protocols,” Sekniqi said, comparing Avalanche’s protocol to Cosmos.For its part, AVA’s leaders are betting Avalanche has the potential. Running on $6 million funding from a 2019 venture capital round, the 30-person team has been building out their mainnet backend, developing a system Sekniqi says could be the “seed” for a new generation of projects and dApps. “It's a much better foundation for building blockchain platforms,” Sekniqi said. He admits his pro-Avalanche bias. “Our end goal here is we want to be the platform on which all assets are issued, we really want to encompass DeFi and much more broadly alternative assets,” he said. “We’re taking a very long-term approach to this.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The ""main motivation for the decision"" had been to ""safeguard the IOTA Foundation's runway"" over the next 12 months, he added. The foundation was forced to suspend the IOTA network in February after hackers stole more than 8.5 million in IOTA's native token MIOTA, worth approximately $1.4 million at the time of writing. The network only came fully back online again on Tuesday.Sonstebo announced he would personally reimburse victims earlier this week, following weeks of internal discussion. ""It's just preemptive step in the worst-case scenario of something drastic happening overnight,"" he said. IOTA has predominately funded itself from a pot of community donations of MIOTA tokens, held in an endowment fund administered by its foundation. Like many other digital assets, MIOTA has been hit hard by the market turmoil arising from fears over coronavirus pandemic. The token's price fell by 40 percent over the past seven days, and its total market value was down around $270 million at the time of writing.""We are very cognizant of our runway and we spend very responsibly; of course, when the token price or the crypto market as a whole has been in such a bear market it's definitely been on our mind from time to time,"" Sonstebo said. ""It's not like we're in any panic mode or desperate, but we are taking the necessary steps [such as by] using my own personal holdings, rather than the foundations' holdings.""Although Sonstebo emphasized the foundation was ""well funded at the moment,"" it has started diversifying revenue, trying to identify new ventures so they no longer have to rely solely on the endowment fund. Foundation co-founder Dominik Schiener said to CoinDesk that IOTA ""regularly gets grants from governments,"" having already received four so far this year. He didn't specify which governments he was referring to, the size of the investments or what they were funding. Sonstebo said IOTA has also received funding from some big corporates who ""are paying for the development of the joint ventures."" That includes, according to Schiener, some members of the IOTA working group founded back in February.""I believe we will, by the end of this year, be sustainable without the token endowment being touched,"" Sonstebo said.Until then, the IOTA project finds itself sailing between ever-tightening fiscal straits. ""In the long term, over the next 12 months, we hope that the majority of our costs will be covered by grants and revenue streams,"" Sonstebo said, ""but at the moment right now it's just important that over the next month we continue without any disturbance or any concern about the runway.""""While the IOTA Foundation is well funded at the moment, we still have a long road ahead,"" the founder said.

The list includes messaging app company Telegram’s yet-to-be-launched blockchain. ","The call for bids was published on March 3 by the General Radio Frequency Center, the agency controlling the use of radio frequencies in Russia, and first reported by the Russian-language cryptocurrency news outlet Forklog.  According to the notice, the agency is looking for research on what technologies can be used to access restricted content, including content deemed extremist, beyond traditional internet protocols. The research should point at ways to block access to such tech, the agency told would-be contractors. The list of such technologies in the document includes mesh networks, internet of things (IoT) protocols and protocols allowing anonymous browsing, including Invisible Internet Project (I2P), The Onion Router (TOR), Freenet, Zeronet, anoNet – and one blockchain, the Telegram Open Network (TON). Such technologies are “used to build anonymous Darknet networks,” according to the agency. Bitcoin (BTC) isn't mentioned, nor any other cryptocurrencies. It’s not clear how the list was formed. TON could have been included because the blockchain network Telegram has been building is designed to support applications for peer-to-peer networks (TON P2P Network), website hosting (TON DNS) and anonymity (TON Proxy).According to the TON white paper, such a system, once launched in full, would allow browsing beyond the restrictions imposed by state actors on the service providers. “User network anonymity can be easily preserved by means of TON Proxy, and all services will be effectively unblockable,” the white paper said.Even as Telegram is currently mired in a legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is seeking to halt TON’s launch, there are signs the company keeps rolling out the components of the future network. Last week, Telegram published instructions for registering websites using TON DNS. The General Radio Frequency Center did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment by press time. Telegram has a history of confronting Russia’s authorities, which have tried to control the app or shut it down. In 2017, Russia’s counterintelligence agency, the Federal Security Service (FSB), demanded Telegram share the encryption key for its flagship messenger app. Telegram lost in court trying to fight that requirement but refused to hand over the keys anyway. Since the summer of 2017, Roscomnadzor, the General Radio Frequency Center's supervising agency, has been trying to block Telegram in Russia but failed. Telegram used a technique called domain fronting, hiding its traffic behind other services’ domains. As a result, while chasing Telegram, Roscomnadzor kept misfiring, blocking multiple other websites but not Telegram and provoking the anger of internet users and a wave of memes. As for the future TON network, according to Mitja Goroshevsky, the CTO of TON Labs, the startup working on tools for TON developers, blocking TON would be even a trickier task.“Even if there is an 'Iron Curtain' and all the communication channels with the outside world are blocked, chances to block it are around 5 percent,“ Goroshevsky said, pointing out that even during the Cold War people tuned into U.S. radio stations including Voice of America or Radio Liberty using home transistors. “It’s gonna be just a new disgrace for Roscomnadzor,” he said.And to interfere with the network itself, no less than 30 percent of all validators would have to be compromised, and most validators will most likely be located outside of Russia, Goroshevsky said. The reason being, in Russia, there are no big cloud service providers like Google or Amazon, plus the risk of arbitrary blocking discourages validators from relying on Russia-based servers, he said.In the meantime, Russia recently tested a mechanism for unplugging its segment of the internet from the rest of the world, following a law calling for a “sovereign Runet"" similar to China's Great Firewall.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Mar 24, 2020 at 21:47 UTC",A growing chorus of U.S. states have directed “blockchain managers” in food and agriculture to keep working through their states’ respective COVID-19 shutdowns.,"The governors of Michigan, Massachusetts, Delaware, Ohio, Louisiana, California, Indiana and Washington state had all issued stay-at-home exemptions for blockchain managers by Tuesday afternoon, covering some 88 million residents currently or soon to be sheltering in place. The orders by governors and their public health officials add legal heft to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA) March 19 recommendation that blockchain managers be considered critical infrastructure. CISA is a branch of the Department of Homeland Security, and its memo, a fleshing out of U.S. President Donald Trump’s March 16 “Coronavirus Guidance for America,” was non-binding in nature. “If you work in a critical infrastructure industry, as defined by the DHS, such as healthcare services and pharmaceutical and food supply, you have a special responsibility to maintain your normal work schedule,” the president’s directive read.See also: Users See ‘Buying Opportunity’ in Coronavirus Market Downturn, Says Crypto.comCISA followed up with an extensive nine-page list of “critical infrastructure industries” that included blockchain managers in food and agriculture.“Employees and firms supporting food, feed and beverage distribution, including warehouse workers, vendor managed inventory controllers and blockchain managers” must not let the crisis stop their work, the memo advised. Eight states have used that section verbatim or referenced its umbrella memo in their respective stay-at-home exemption actions, CoinDesk found.  What the memo did not specify is what a blockchain manager is or what these apparently critical workers actually do. Neither CISA nor any of the states that have taken action so far responded to requests for comment.Allen Gulley, a research fellow at Auburn University's RFID Lab, said the CISA memo likely targets a small cadre of systems engineers working at the administrative level. They’re the ones “making sure that things aren’t going up in flames” across the supply chain. He pointed to IBM Food Trust, one of the industry’s largest enterprise blockchain platforms and a partner of massive supermarket chains from Walmart to Albertsons, both of which track lettuce on its blockchain. They would need a blockchain manager, he said. ""You need to have a blockchain manager behind the scenes making sure that everything's going according to plan,” Gulley said.The Consumer Technology Association (CTA), a standards and trade group for the tech industry, believes that blockchain can play “a critical role in national manufacturing.” The group hailed the CISA memo in a tweet last week.See also: The CFTC Just Defined What ‘Actual Delivery’ of Crypto Should Look LikeCTA’s state and local tech policy director Nathan Trail said blockchain managers keep everything moving. “One thing that we forget with [internet of things], blockchain, algorithms and so forth is there's still a very human element that’s necessary in tracking and monitoring the systems to ensure they’re maintained as they should be,” he said.Gulley has worked at the forefront of manufacturing and supply chain blockchain systems, most recently in an RFID Lab trial for Nike. He says the tech is still too new to have much of a presence across major supply chains – food, manufacturing, pharma or otherwise. “There are some production grade networks out there where companies are really running their operations on some sort of blockchain platform,” Gulley said. “But there’s far more people that are just playing with it right now.”Stay-at-home orders are therefore unlikely to kneecap that handful of companies, he said. Plus, their blockchain managers can easily do the job from home. Even so, Gulley said CISA’s recommendation and the states' subsequent orders could validate a profession still in its infancy. There’s a certain pride that comes with being labeled “critical infrastructure,” and he said players in the industry are taking note.  “I think that’s why people have been excited about it,” he said. “It's crisis time and people are recognizing that there’s a blockchain role critical to keep everything functioning.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

COVID-19 has quickly overtaken vast swaths of the east and west U.S. coasts, sending states into lockdown and forcing non-essential commerce to a blistering halt. But the spread is largely happening via “person-to-person contact,” not cash exchanges, said the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia spokesman, Joey Lee, citing Centers for Disease Control (CDC) findings. As such there’s no need to destroy potentially infected banknotes from hardest-hit regions, according to the Fed. The People’s Bank of China reportedly took that step last month when it seized all banknotes processed in high-risk COVID-19 zones, according to the South China Morning Post. “While the Federal Reserve is not considering cash destruction, the Federal Reserve System always has a contingency stock of new currency that can be circulated to the public and is staying in close contact with the CDC to ensure we are aware of the latest thinking on how COVID-19 spreads,” Lee said.The Fed has unveiled a slew of programs, rate cuts and initiatives to keep the U.S. economy afloat in recent days. In addition to those macroeconomic policy actions, coronavirus is also changing the way the Fed handles its physical notes.For example, it has begun quarantining U.S. dollars shipped from overseas – first Asia and now Europe as well, according to Lee.“As a precautionary measure, cash handling procedures have been modified at Reserve Banks that receive currency shipments from Asia and Europe to provide for a longer holding period of 7 to 10 days before processing these deposits,” he said.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

There are currently about 3,000 users on the platform.  “Decentralization benefits the cloud in many ways, and our first customers are already seeing how it improves security, privacy, and resiliency, while also lowering costs,” said Ben Golub, Storj Labs executive chairman, who joined the company from Docker back in early 2018.  When a file is uploaded, it is encrypted and then split into 80 fragments distributed on separate nodes. To hedge against the possibility an individual node could become compromised or experience an outage,  users only need 29 pieces to fully reconstruct a file. Speaking to CoinDesk, Storj's co-founder and chief strategy officer, Shawn Wilkinson, said the firm starts ""at about half the price"" of centralized cloud storage providers"" such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). There are also no bandwidth caps, meaning users can store as much data as they like on the platform.Based in Atlanta, Storj raised $3 million in seed funding from Google Ventures, Qualcomm Ventures and Techstars in 2017 when it decided to pivot towards becoming an enterprise storage system. The protocol launched in private alpha at the end of 2018.The platform migrated its storage service from bitcoin to ethereum back in 2017. Wilkinson said the company has no further plans to move protocols. ""Ethereum allows us to affordably send thousands of transactions to thousands of Storage Node Operators each month,"" he said.

That opens the proposal up to feedback from interested members of the public. BOX wants the SEC to sign off on its new subsidiary, the Boston Security Token Exchange (BSTX), a trading platform for tokenized equity that will also store ownership data on the Ethereum blockchain.The amended filing, with notable tweaks from the version submitted by BOX in December, increases the number of market makers required for an initial listing from two to three, and makes listing standards closer to those set by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The exchange also took pains to stress once more that BSTX records held on Ethereum would only be ""ancillary records that would not create or convey any ownership of security tokens or shareholder equity.""  In other words, Ethereum won't be used as a substitute for conventional ownership records anytime soon.   BSTX is a joint venture announced by BOX and tZero, the company that hosted one of the first proper security token offerings (STOs) back in 2018. BOX filed its first version of a ""rulebook for the first regulated security token exchange"" in May 2019, which the SEC published for public consultation in October the same year.Judging by the summing-up section, BOX looks to be trying to allay any possible concerns from the SEC so it can make the ""important first step"" in integrating blockchain into the U.S. financial system. Success might mean that other entities, including traditional finance institutions, could also begin experimenting with the technology, the filing suggests.A BOX spokesperson said the firm was not able to comment at this stage of the process. Although blockchain technology enables round-the-clock permissionless trading, BOX has also reiterated that, in keeping with U.S. financial regulation, BSTX would only be open during U.S. market hours and users would need to be approved first before they can begin trading on the exchange.

In January, Xinhua reported the platform was used by a network of 38 banks with total combined volumes exceeding 90 billion yuan ($13 billion). The new funding from Beijing is expected to help PBoC drive adoption for its trade finance platform among businesses.

Karpeles says Greene – who filed his initial complaint against Karpeles and Mt. Gox the day the exchange declared bankruptcy – violated court precedent by bringing a ""host of new factual allegations"" not alleged in the original class action complaint. ""Mr. Greene doomed his fraud claim by directly contradicting the underlying allegations in his Complaint of the purported fraud or deception during discovery,"" reads the filing. ""His addition of new allegations of fraud in response to a motion to summary judgment violates Seventh Circuit precedent."" The filing claims Greene changed his claim to include allegations from other complainants that signed up to the exchange on the basis of Mt. Gox's Terms of Use, which assured users the exchange had enough cash and bitcoin (BTC) to cover users' deposits. Although Greene argued he has always said this was part of his complaint, Karpeles argued in the filing that this was ""impossible, as [Greene's] creation of an account and making a deposit on the Mt. Gox Exchange preceded the existence of the Terms of Use by at least more than two weeks.""Karpeles has accused Greene of attempting to change his claim so it could stand up to summary judgment – a motion allowing a presiding judge to rule on a case before it goes to trial and usually granted in cases where the outcome is considered a foregone conclusion.Greene's original complaint included three claims: the fraud claim, as well as since-dismissed counts of negligence and conversion. Some original allegations, like a purported statement on the Mt. Gox website claiming the exchange was useful as a safe place to store bitcoin, were renounced at the original deposition. Last March, a judge refused a motion by Karpeles to stay the U.S. case. In a separate case brought forward in Japan, Karpeles was cleared of charges of embezzlement and breach of trust but found guilty of manipulating exchange data.Read the full filing below:The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

AMF has consistently advocated a forward-thinking approach to blockchain and distributed ledger technology for years, approving initial coin offerings, drafting blockchain bills and releasing experimental frameworks for crypto firms to regulate themselves. “These frameworks were designed to frame centralized market infrastructures,'' AMF President Robert Ophèle said in a speech. He explained that “they are not suited to the decentralized nature of the blockchain environment” and therefore render many projects almost unprofitable.But Ophèle insisted Europe could not just adopt new regulations for blockchain and security tokens overnight.“We are faced with a ‘chicken and egg’ paradox,” Ophèle said. The space cannot develop under the current framework, but without documentation new frameworks cannot evolve either. A Digital Lab sandbox would give regulators both, Ophèle said. Authorities would closely monitor how these projects evolve when unshackled from Europe’s traditional markets regulation, collecting three years of feedback and data to shape the formation of new, more flexible regulations. “As a regulatory authority, we need to understand these changes and ensure that our regulatory frameworks remain appropriate. These frameworks must make it possible to manage risks – to effectively protect users – without losing the benefit of innovations,” Ophèle said.It remains to be seen how other continental financial regulators will react to AMF’s latest recommendation. The press offices for Germany’s, Italy’s, Austria’s, Ireland’s and Finland’s respective securities regulators did not immediately respond to requests for comment, and neither did the European Securities and Markets Authority, the top securities watchdog for the European Union.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

ASX announced a successful first trial in 2016 and finally confirmed it would replace CHESS with a DLT-based system in December 2017. An original launch date was scheduled for Q1 2020, but was then postponed until Q2 2021. In its annual report, published August 2019, ASX said it was ""on track"" to complete the system in time for that date. ASX said Wednesday it would utilize the extra time to work on the system's operational readiness, review possible changes to its rules of operation and allow back-end engineers to become more familiar with the system ahead of launch. Plans to trial the new DLT trading infrastructure in an Industry Test Environment (ITE) are still on target for July.“ASX remains fully committed to CHESS replacement,"" Hiom added. ""The investments we are making in the new system and in distributed ledger technology are for the long-term benefit of the financial services industry and the Australian economy.""See also: Australian Tax Office to Warn Investors Over Crypto MisreportingLast month, the National Stock Exchange of Australia – ASX's rival – said it was building a digital securities platform to launch in the early part of 2021.

187,www.coindesk.com,1 month ago,SEC Proposal Could (Eventually) Unleash Security Token Sales,https://www.coindesk.com/sec-proposal-could-eventually-unleash-security-token-sales,"Both traditional and crypto markets saw immense volatility last week, with 
the S&P 500 tanking more than 7 percent twice and bitcoin ...","Mar 16, 2020 at 09:00 UTC",Companies looking to raise funds via security token offerings (STOs) might soon get some relief from regulatory burdens in the U.S. ,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published a proposal to amend its capital formation rules for early stage startups of all stripes earlier this month. If adopted, the modified rule would raise the cap on proceeds to $75 million from $50 million for security offerings sold under Regulation A+ and to $5 million from $1 million for Regulation CF (crowdfunding). These rules, which put the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act of 2012 into practice, allow companies to raise funds from the public without having to register as a public company.More broadly, the proposed rule amendment could mark a shift in how the SEC perceives the token space. “I think there’s also a bit of recognition from the SEC that the world is changing and they’re going to adapt which I think is very good and healthy,” said Muneeb Ali, CEO of Blockstack, which raised $23 million under a Reg A+ exemption last year.The proposal may even be a sign the SEC is moving to “unclog the blockage of approvals” for companies looking to raise funds compliantly, said Vince Molinari, the former CEO and co-founder of regulated token trader Templum. To be clear, young companies might not be able to raise funds soon, regardless of regulation, given the impact of coronavirus on the world’s economy. Both traditional and crypto markets saw immense volatility last week, with the S&P 500 tanking more than 7 percent twice and bitcoin (BTC)fluctuating between $3,900 and $8,000.Rather, the SEC’s proposed changes may lay the groundwork for easier fundraising after an eventual recovery. The agency said it was seeking to “harmonize, simplify and improve” the guidelines surrounding capital formation.“This particular proposed rule has great potential to help everyone, including those in the DLT/blockchain space to raise capital,” said Dina Ellis-Rochkind, counsel in the government affairs practice of the law firm Paul Hastings.Daniel Gorfine, former head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s fintech wing LabCFTC, agreed, saying the proposed rule change could expand the number of compliant security offerings based around tokens.Enacted nearly a decade ago, the JOBS Act essentially provided a bridge between the internet and financial markets through investing, including the potential to expand investment opportunities including for small businesses and startups, Gorfine said. “Then crypto and its underlying blockchain technology gained global mindshare towards the end of the last decade, and demonstrated how the Internet and social media could disintermediate traditional actors involved in the capital-raising process,” he said. Initial coin offerings (ICOs), which became fashionable during the crypto bull market of 2017, allowed investors to directly purchase from ventures. “Unfortunately, many of the capital-raising efforts done through ICOs failed to comply with securities laws,” Gorfine noted. A raft of SEC enforcement actions followed. Security tokens typically represent traditional securities, meaning they’re often backed by a real-world asset despite being built on a blockchain like Ethereum. Unlike most of the ICOs seen in 2017, security tokens are usually sold in a manner compliant with federal laws. Ellis-Rochkind, who worked on the JOBS Act as a Senate staffer, noted that currently, most compliant token sales are using exemptions derived from the law. The SEC’s proposal would make it easier for startups to conduct security token offerings, she said. “The SEC is providing regulatory relief when it comes to private placement and exemptions,” she said. “It’s not a gigantic step, but it makes it easier to raise capital.”The general public can weigh in on the amendment by emailing or filling out a form on the SEC’s website. The comment period will remain open for 60 days after the filing is published in the Federal Register, the official national document archive (the filing was not in the Register as of press time).The comment period might be a good opportunity for stakeholders to seek clarity on some outstanding questions, such as when tokens might transition from something that appears to be a security to something that does not appear to, Ellis-Rochkind said. (Some crypto advocates believe there is room under the law for “utility tokens,” meaning tokens which have a function and do not meet the legal definition of a security, but which might still be used in sales and secondary trading. SEC Chair Jay Clayton disagrees with this premise.)“If you believe, and I’m not saying I do, if you think the SEC is doing this case by case, if you believe that something can change into a utility or service or good, this is an opportunity to really put proposals in front of the SEC,” she said.The immediate impact of the proposal would be that companies – including crypto startups – can raise more as they build out their systems and try to launch novel products.The proposal doesn’t discuss tokenized offerings in depth, but it does consider them, Gorfine noted. “By harmonizing the types of securities that could be offered through Reg CF and Reg A+, it stands to reason you could essentially run a tokenized security offering through the crowdfunding exemption up to a $5 million cap as proposed by the SEC,” he said. Ali called the proposal “a step in the right direction,” and said he would expect more companies to look at the new caps.While the Reg A+ fundraising cap is immense, he said the Reg CF change is likely far more significant for companies. Firms raising $50 million to $75 million are already established and likely on their second or third fundraising rounds, he said. Companies looking to raise through Reg CF are more likely to be early-stage firms.“The difference between $1 million and $5 million is huge. I think $5 million is a very healthy limit and we might see a lot more people doing it,” he said. “The legal overhead is a lot lower with a Reg CF.”Essentially, companies could see a greater return per dollar spent on legal fees and efforts.But Molinari said the Reg A+ amendment might have a wider impact. In his view, the modified Reg A+ “could be a perfect mechanism” for digital securities, as it provides one possible answer to the question of “what is a security or what is not.”In practice, how the SEC ultimately defines the lockup period for tokens will also have an impact, he said. If a company can begin trading tokens within a few months of the sale, it would benefit them. However, if a company has to wait longer than six months, it may not be worth it.“If it takes six to 12 months it’s not going to get market acceptance because companies can’t afford to sit around and wait that long,” he said. The proposed amendments would also create a “demo day” carve-out for companies which would let them present their businesses to potential investors without violating rules prohibiting “general solicitation.” In addition, the changes would require clearer communications to investors.Gorfine noted that Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFTs) and Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) were mentioned in the proposal, though the SEC appears to be warning against these fundraising methods. Molinari said he expects to see additional movement on the capital markets front in the long term.“Ultimately, these developments could help satisfy the original intent of the JOBS Act by leveraging the potential of crypto and blockchain technology to give retail investors access to startup and small business investment opportunities,” Gorfine said.Still, being able to raise funds is only half of the story, Ali said. In his view, how a security token project can transition to a decentralized, operational network is equally as important as the sale itself. His company is working on defining how this might look, though there is currently no framework for other startups to look at. “The SEC is actually taking a very deep, thoughtful look at these problems. It’s clearly on their agenda, it’s clearly on their minds, and I do think it’s a positive signal that they're highlighting crypto,” he said. While the agency is moving slowly, the enforcement actions it has taken may be helping regulate the space to protect against fraudulent token sales. Ellis-Rochkind concluded by saying entities in the crypto space should engage with regulators at the right places. “This is the best chance of getting anything done,” she said. Sebastian Sinclair contributed reporting.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Calling the project ""very exciting,"" Securitize CEO and co-founder Carlos Domingo said this was the beginning for both Securitize and LIFULL to ""modernize the Japanese real estate market together.""Although Japan has some of the most densely populated cities in the world, this has come at the expense of the surrounding countryside, which has experienced significant population decline over the decades. It's estimated nearly 900 towns and villages across Japan will be deserted by 2040.Securitize's platform is designed to open the rural property market up to the outside world, providing much-needed funding to revitalize and even repopulate settlements with low or aging populations. Because there are few restrictions on foreigners buying properties in Japan, the platform can operate with relative regulatory clarity. Securitize said the crowdfunding platform, which leverages Ethereum-based digital securities, is faster, transparent and more regulatory compliant than comparable legacy systems. Being built on a public blockchain means investors can also review and monitor the flow of funds.In November, Securitize received a reported seven-figure sum from Japanese investment bank SBI Holdings to open an office in the country. Domingo told CoinDesk at the time the placement would enable his firm to begin offering digital securities to the Japanese market. Securitize became involved in the crowdfunding platform after it acquired Japanese blockchain consultancy firm BUILDL in December.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Mar 10, 2020 at 14:00 UTC",Circle’s full-tilt pivot into stablecoins is nearly complete. ,"The payments startup intends to sell SeedInvest, the crowdfunding platform it bought a year ago, and focus its remaining assets on developing stablecoin products, said Jeremy Allaire, one of Circle’s co-founders and its remaining CEO (fellow co-founder and one-time co-CEO Sean Neville stepped down last year).As part of this process, on Tuesday the company will roll out new APIs and Circle Business Accounts, which corporate clients can use to conduct business in USDC, a token on the Ethereum blockchain designed to hold its value against the U.S. dollar.Circle has multiple revenue streams, Allaire told CoinDesk in an interview last month. But to maximize its research and development wings, its focus since last summer has been on new products centered around the USDC token, which Circle issues. Circle is also part of the CENTRE Consortium with Coinbase, which Allaire said created the standards around stablecoin issuance. However, the story of Circle in recent months has been what it’s lost. In the past year, Circle has sold Poloniex, the crypto exchange it acquired in 2018; shuttered Circle Pay, its longstanding payments app; sold Circle Invest to brokerage firm Voyager; sold its Circle Trade over-the-counter desk to Kraken; and is now looking to sell SeedInvest (as The Block first reported).SeedInvest no longer fits into what Allaire sees as Circle’s core business, he explained. The “strategic rationale for acquiring” the firm centered around Circle’s trading business. “We were excited about this idea of tokenization and having tokens that were issued connected to all kinds of assets,” he said. “We exited the exchange business ... so the need for that set of licensing just doesn’t exist anymore. The second thing is this whole kind of tokenization, having regulated broker-dealers and tokenized securities, that’s been slow-rolled” by cautious regulators.The company has seen its headcount similarly shrink, falling from a peak of 300 employees to roughly 125 as of January 2020, Allaire said. Part of the reduction comes from employees moving with their various departments as they were sold. “We had about 100 people who went with these different spinouts … [it was] a natural way for people to go with those businesses and product lines,” Allaire said. Moving forward, Allaire said Circle intends to announce new stablecoin products, reiterating a view of the payment startup’s future first shared via a blog post late last year. The first wave of products included the new business accounts, which Circle hopes to offer for free to new startups, but will offer subscriptions based on usage after.“We’ve been executing like crazy on USDC,” he said. “We’ve tokenized over $1.6 billion in USDC, crossed the $500 million market cap recently.”Attached is the transcript of our conversation, which covers Circle’s roadmap, Allaire’s approach to investments and his views on how the regulatory landscape will shift as stablecoin use goes mainstream. It has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.CoinDesk: You said SeedInvest is getting spun off. Are you looking to secure a buyer or do you think it’s a company that can operate on its own?Allaire: The way I look at it, there are a lot of strategic alternatives. [SeedInvest] is able to operate independently and can grow a lot. It's got fundamental economics and it exists in a competitive position within the market. I think with more capital behind it, it could grow significantly.There are a couple of ways it can do this. It could find companies that want to add something strategic to their product portfolio. It could also find financial investors that are excited about the business and want to effectively take it over, inject capital in and scale it. Of course, we’re going to look at all those options. Do you have a rough idea of its value right now?Value is something that the market discovers. I'm pretty sure you're on Twitter, and I’m pretty sure you're seeing all the commentary around Circle regarding its runway. Are you confident you'll be able to continue through 2020 or 2021 without having to make further layoffs?I have a few things to say on that. I mean, the first is sort of obvious: We don't disclose our financials and things like that.Second, by undertaking changes in our approach to new businesses and products that will be meaningful in terms of revenue and value, as well as axing businesses that we don't think are core, we’re radically improving the financial position of the company. I could say pretty definitely that we’re improving the financial position of the company. Circle makes small fee revenue through USDC. Do you have other revenue streams right now, or is that part of the longer-term plan?We have multiple revenue streams but, as you know, as a private company we don't break out exactly what those are. Some of those are revenue streams associated with prior lines of business, existing lines of business and new products we’ve publicly announced.In early January, you published a blog post announcing a full pivot to USDC and stablecoins, and it sounds like you're going to be announcing new products around that soon. Could you give a rough overview of what those products look like right now? So, just to be clear, we started working on new product development last summer and only first started publicly talking about that in January. There are two key buckets, products targeted at businesses, which will provide products and services to businesses rather than midmarket individuals. Those really fall into two categories. One is accounts that businesses can open. We think of these as a new type of financial account that any business that wants to can use, store, custody, make payments with, and automate the use of stablecoins, can use those account services from us. This is all stablecoin-native and accessible in 150 countries with integrations with the banking system. The really critical thing is what a business can do with these products. To that end, we’re introducing a new set of platform APIs. You can think of it as a platform-as-a-service or banking-as-a-service model for developers that want to build infrastructure to integrate stablecoins into payments, commerce, finance, or any programmable money use case.I know Coinbase is also part of the CENTRE consortium. Can you speak to their involvement in all this, or is Circle operating independently of CENTRE? So the CENTRE consortium is a standards and governance body for stablecoins. The first stablecoin from the CENTRE Consortium is USDC. We’ve publicly conveyed together with Coinbase through CENTRE that there's a roadmap to add additional currencies and blockchains to support those stablecoins. The consortium will set the standards and governance model for those, meaning it governs how reserves are managed and the compliance policies to be a vendor or issuer of a stablecoin. It’s a bit like what VISA did originally. VISA was a nonprofit organization of member banks. Rather than having each bank set their own standards and issue their own plastic cards that could only be used by businesses and consumers that work with a specific bank, they created a set of interoperable standards so it didn’t matter [whom] you banked with. And it created a governance framework for compliance and liability. We think these types of cooperatives will be really critical to the mainstream adoption of stablecoins. And that when regulators and policymakers set standards for stablecoin issuing, they will lean a lot on consortiums like this to be at the frontline of regulation and issuance. We imagine a world with tons and tons of different competing stablecoins, but a limited number of consortiums with standards and interoperability. CENTRE is the only live consortium model in the entire market. The Libra Association is a proposal to do something similar, but the Libra model has its own proprietary blockchain while CENTRE is designed to work with existing, public, open blockchains. There is no relationship to these businesses that Circle is building. As a member [Circle] is able to issue and offer USD through their brokerage and exchange product. Circle can build whatever services it sees fit. Again to bring up VISA: It’s a network consortium model made up of banks that all still compete with one another. There’s retail banks. There's commercial banks. There's merchant banks. There are all these financial institutions that plug into this standard infrastructure. In a similar way, in the world of stablecoins, you're going to have business-to-business focus, retail-focused products and services, and you’re going to have payments versus trading. There's a lot of different use cases. And that’s sort of the relationship of CENTRE to this.Switching gears, it looks like regulators have been slow-rolling broker-dealer licenses. How has the regulatory outlook changed in the last couple of months? Well, I would say one area that I'm seeing a really significant change is around stablecoins, specifically. I think policymakers and regulators are hyper-focused on this right now, because of what's happening organically in the market with things like USDC and because of the Libra network proposal.There's a very high-level engagement in Congress, in central banks and among financial regulators. Just yesterday there were public comments from the chair of the G-20 finance ministers saying they are going to work on a specific set of regulatory policies on stablecoins as early as April, which could be finalized at the G-20 Summit in September. If you want to have this be really the future payments of commerce and really believe this could be used broadly in mainstream business, you need the rules of the road to be laid down. It’s about making businesses and consumers feel safe to participate. Would you say there has been a real shift in how domestic regulators are approaching U.S. dollar stablecoins?Like I said just now, I think major national regulators in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions are trying to formulate what will ultimately become new guidance or specific policy recommendations. Some of which might need to be enacted by Congress, others that could become public guidelines. But I think that there's gonna be changes there. Right now, there's a self-regulatory organization around stablecoins through the CENTRE consortium, making it the only stablecoin with a robust self-regulatory scheme around it. The only members of CENTRE that can issue USDC are all fully regulated in the United States as money transmission companies or trust-bank companies. We maintain the proper licenses. We go through examinations. We notify regulators of what we’re doing with these products. That includes state banking regulators throughout the United States, as well as the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, FinCEN. But, because stablecoins are likely to take on a bigger role in the financial system in the coming years, you're likely to see a policy shift from just the state level to a national focus. I know you guys put out attestations about stablecoins reserves but don't on the banking relationship side. Have you had any issues, or have you seen any kind of change in how banks approach storing reserves for stablecoins?I can't speak on behalf of other stablecoins but at CENTRE we’ve seen really robust demand from significant banking institutions to get involved in reserve banking stablecoin clients. That's not just here, but in international markets as well. Will you continue investing in other companies in 2020? That’s a good question. I’ve built two publicly traded companies, through a mixture of investment and M&A. Circle itself has done some M&A and we’ve obviously done some divestitures as well. When you build out a company you're constantly looking at what are you best suited to build? Are there things that you could invest in or acquire? We'll continue to look at that as we build out, but it's not like a specific strategy that we're gonna do this or that in 2021.Going a little off the reservation here: When you set up a bank account for Circle’s new products, whose name actually appears on the account: Is it CENTRE, Circle or the entity holding the account? The way it works is, CENTRE appoints reserve banks, issuers of USDC must be able to onboard with those reserve banks and each member issuer holds an account with those banks. The U.S. dollar reserves are rebalanced between the different issuers and accounts on a daily basis, but the accounts themselves are held by each consortium member. I can't imagine the banks have seen that before. There are lots of analogies in market structure in financial markets.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Only $20 million USDC can be used on the system but with up to 20 percent interest rate earnings, according to the newly established USDC risk parameters. Users will be able to deposit USDC as collateral (in addition to the system’s two other underlying assets, ether (ETH) and Basic Attention Token (BAT)) and receive dai in return.Almost $1 million in USDC-backed dai has been minted since the vote’s passage, according to data site Dai Stats.At the heart of the USDC addition is a pressing issue: dai’s dwindling supply.

If there was ever a time to be brave and do this, now is the time,” he said of adding USDC.Dai’s peg has continued to sit uncomfortably high above the U.S. dollar after “Black Thursday.” Users flocked to dai for stability in the wake of ETH’s crash, increasing the token's price and lowering supply on the market.The Maker Foundation has made several efforts to find liquidity for dai since March 12. A governance vote by MKR token holders tinkered with various network metrics to increase the supply of dai and therefore alleviate illiquidity. Monday’s vote also lowered dai’s interest rate (also known as the “Stability Fee”) from 4 percent to 0 percent.It didn’t work, so the team called in the cavalry: centralized stablecoin USDC.The pros and cons of adding the collateral asset were weighed Monday on both a governance call and on the Maker Foundation forum. A chief concern was USDC’s issuer and final authority: Coinbase and Circle. Those in favor of alternatives, such as linking Maker with other DeFi liquidity pools, noted Circle’s right to censor addresses at its discretion.The addition was unprecedented given the DeFi network’s intent to create a “completely decentralized” stablecoin, dai, backed by other cryptocurrencies, according to the white paper.As events have panned out, dai’s hold above $1.00 – and the potential consequences from it – have remained a larger concern for the Foundation and MKR holders who executed the vote. Dai is a barometer for Maker. If the stablecoin sits above the dollar peg, it means the underlying token economics are not working as intended.In this situation, particularly after ETH’s price drop, Maker community members held two concerns: the system is vulnerable to a second flash drop in ETH’s value and dai is extremely illiquid on the general market right now, according to Maker Foundation community manager LongForWisdom in Monday’s call.First, ETH’s last flash drop created a $5.7 million debt within the Maker system. This debt was created by a flaw in the auction of the collateralized debt that users put in smart contracts to create dai. These smart contracts are called collateralized debt positions (CDP).In short, the price of ETH dropped below the collateral levels for some CDPs, triggering instant liquidations. Liquidations are sold on an open market between automated market makers called “keepers.” This open market, as it turned out, was not so open. Due to a bug in the system, certain keepers were able to purchase auctioned collateral (typically ETH) for practically no cost during the chaos of Thursday and early Friday’s trading action. The network announced the printing and sale of MKR tokens to cover the debt. This token auction is provisioned in the white paper.What is not provided for – and as unhappy investors CoinDesk spoke with expressed – was the total loss of ETH from CDPs. A 13 percent “slashing fee” to cover the liquidation of ETH is what most investors expected. Pete Johnson, a Maker CDP holder who claims to have lost some 2,700 ETH (currently valued at roughly $315,000), is now forming a legal effort against the Maker Foundation with some of the other 4,000 CDP vaults that lost large portions of ETH to the protocol. (Note: One vault does not equal one owner.)Will it succeed? To a large degree, it doesn’t matter. What does matter is that the largest DeFi protocol choked during a stress test.Another drop in ETH’s price could not only create another debt burden on the system, but could create an untenable leakage of DeFi enthusiasts.“Due to the on-going liquidity situation and dai price instability, we need to make a quick decision on risk parameters such that the executive can go on-chain as quickly as possible,” MakerDAO community member Cyrus said in the proposal forum Monday.Indeed, the Maker team rushed to find a patch. Not only was a 24-hour governance timeout rule to safeguard the system from internal enemies dropped to four on Saturday, but Maker added USDC when the same conversation six months earlier, concerning tether (USDT), called for a “comprehensive evaluation process” that would “lay out all the risks and problems associated with the collateral.”If Maker goes, where goes DeFi? Probably not a question most Ethereum fans want to ask right now, though some are preparing. A list of over 100 DeFi enthusiasts have vowed to act as the “buyer of last resort” for the upcoming MKR token sale.Still, the underlying issue in Maker remains dai, Messari researcher Jack Purdy told CoinDesk. For now, the Maker community is pinning its hopes on the more centralized USDC.To be fair, there is precedent. You can buy dai on plenty of exchanges with USDC.And again, backing a decentralized stablecoin with a centralized stablecoin is not a new idea for Maker. The concept was floated around last September with USDT.At the time, MakerDAO founder and CEO Rune Christensen said adding a stablecoin like USDT to the Maker ecosystem added liquidity for market makers, which, in turn, would bring price stability to dai.In asset trading, market makers present buying and selling options across a wide range of prices. They make small arbitrage gains across large volumes while providing the market with much-needed liquidity. In other words, market makers help pricing.Stability, of course, should be a feature of a stablecoin. Historically, dai and other less liquid stablecoins have lacked price stability compared to the most liquid stablecoin on the market, USDT. (Stablecoin price and volume data below via Nomics.) “The result is that Dai will become significantly more liquid against any stablecoin that is onboarded as Dai collateral,” Christensen wrote at the time. “At scale, you can almost think of it as if Dai starts behaving like a fiat-backed stablecoin itself, in that it will be so easy to exchange it 1:1 with very low spreads to USD and fiat.”All choices have trade-offs, however.To add a stablecoin such as USDT would decrease Maker’s censorship resistance. A company, Tether Inc., is behind USDT, unlike dai, community members said. Companies can be censored or shut down; decentralized protocols can’t. Ultimately the team decided to refrain from adding USDT until the need for another asset became more apparent.That day came six months later as the price of ETH tanked and dai’s price skyrocketed, hitting $1.22 on CoinGecko while accruing upwards of 20 percent interest on DeFi platform Compound. The price jump left CDP holders paying extra to close positions along with difficulty in locating dai on the market. One week later, dai continues to sit seven cents above its peg while the Maker community jengas its token back to normalcy.From a technical standpoint it’s likely the addition of USDC will work. Dai faced a similar issue in spring 2019 where dai sat about as far on the other side of the dollar as it currently does.In response, the community voted to up the Stability Fee (interest given to dai holders) from 0.5 percent to 19.5 percent over multiple months. The 39-fold increase flummoxed some, but gradually restored the dollar peg by increasing demand to hold dai.The rushed decision and addition of a decidedly non-decentralized asset to Maker’s ecosystem is another question entirely. Indeed, market participants in Asia woke up to the passed governance vote without being asked about its consequences.Moreover, liquidity and undercapitalization are not the same thing, Messari’s Purdy said. “It makes sense to get more dai liquidity, although it doesn't help the underlying undercapitalization issue,” he said about the USDC addition.UPDATE (17, March 21:50 UTC): A previous version of this article included a supply chart for single collateral dai under the impression it represented multi-collateral dai. It has been removed.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Mar 17, 2020 at 22:09 UTC",History can come at you fast.,"I live in Spain. Not on the balmy coasts – I live in Madrid, smack in the middle of the peninsula. Surprisingly, COVID-19 did not show up in the country’s epicenter first; that honor is held by the tourist-packed Canary Islands. But it was only a matter of time before we started to have cases here and, man, did it accelerate quickly. Spain has seen its share of wars. My husband’s mother and aunts would tell tales of hunger and luck, unimaginable to younger generations. It’s seen its share of explosions – last week was the 16th anniversary of the Al-Qaeda bombs on commuter trains that killed almost 200 people and injured thousands more. I remember that day well – everyone was totally stunned, not from fear but from shock. Except for sirens, the city was silent. What I also remember about that day is how truly amazing human spirit can be. People stood in line for hours to give blood. Bus drivers turned their vehicles into transports for the wounded. And everyone checked in with everyone. We were together.This spirit is not unique to Spain. On September 11, 2001, my husband was on his way to an early morning meeting on the 94th floor of 2 World Trade Center. Mercifully, he was running late and was still downstairs when the first plane hit. Trudging the 65 blocks uptown back to the hotel, he told me about all the people emerging from their apartments to offer water, phones, hugs. It’s one thing not wanting to go out much. It’s another thing entirely being told you can’t.The Spanish have a special affinity for being together, for hanging out in public. In my neighborhood, there is literally at least one cafe-bar on every block and they’re usually busy. Most people go grocery shopping several times a week. Parks are plentiful and full of people sitting, chatting, watching the kids or the dogs play.On March 8, we were told that schools were canceled as of March 11. Madrid had fewer than 200 confirmed cases, Spain overall about 800. Four people had died of the disease. My daughter is 17 and in her last year of school. She had her last mock university entrance exam on Tuesday and went off worried about a bit more than calculus formulas. She asked me that night: “Mom, is there a chance today was my last day of school ever?” She and her friends have no idea whether the actual university exams will even go ahead.See also: Why Bitcoin’s Safe-Haven Narrative Has Flown Out the WindowThe school closures started to spook people – the next morning, even with all registers open at the supermarket, lines of piled-high shopping carts stretched to the back of the store. We tried again the following morning and managed to snag one of the last packs of toilet paper, some cookies and an insane amount of pasta. On the way home, we saw people strolling into bars for their morning coffee. Although my husband and I did ask each other “What are they doing?,” I confess I marveled at the resilience of the social instinct. That was naïve. By Thursday, Madrid had 1,400 confirmed cases. Spain had 2,700. The death toll was at 84.On Friday, Madrid’s mayor ordered the closure of all bars and restaurants. It’s hard to explain what a shock that was to the Madrid way of life. But more was to come.Later that day, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced a “State of Alarm” for the first time ever in Spain’s history. With this, the central government assumed control of the regional governments and their police forces, giving the federal government the right to cut off highways, stop people, do whatever it felt was necessary.On Saturday, my husband and I headed out to the supermarket for what was probably going to be our last excursion together for a while. The streets were eerily empty, with virtually no traffic. As we approached the supermarket, though, the number of pedestrians increased, all heading to the same place. No toilet paper whatsoever, but I did manage to get one of the last bottles of gin.Later that day, we entered national lockdown. You can leave your home to go to the supermarket, the pharmacy, the bank, work (if you have to), as well as to care for others or walk your dog. Any other excursions could be met with a fine of between €1,500 and €600,000. On Saturday, Madrid reached almost 3,000 confirmed cases, Spain almost 6,000. The death toll was at 140.Already a day late, I was still struggling to put the Institutional Crypto newsletter together. I confess I have never had such trouble concentrating. At one stage, desperately trying to will my thoughts into some sort of coherent order (and having little success), I looked out of the window next to my desk. My neighbors across the street had taken it upon themselves to try to cheer people up by hanging out a handmade banner that said, “It’ll all be ok.”My whole family are introverts. I love being with people in short doses, and my idea of a really good time is a stimulating conversation. But I’m happy at home, and can think of nothing nicer than an excuse to curl up with a glass of wine and a good book or series. But it’s one thing not wanting to go out much. It’s another thing entirely being told you can’t. It’s inexplicably emotionally bruising, and I have it really easy. I can’t imagine how stressful it must be for parents with small children.Word got out, via the news and circulated text messages, that at 10 p.m. local time we were to all head out to our balconies or windows to applaud the health workers. Of course, it ended up being more than just that. At 10 p.m. in my neighborhood, someone cranked up the national anthem. Everyone on my street was out on the balconies or leaning out the windows, clapping and cheering and crying ""Viva España!"". Looking out over the rooftops I could see people in windows across the whole area. The clapping went on for a good 10 minutes, with people shouting encouragement, and ""Vamos!,"" and ""Podemos con esto!"" It was moving. I may or may not have got a bit teary for a moment.In Spain, we have a great sense of community and friendship and resilience. We know we’ll get through this.On Sunday morning, my husband took the dog down to do his stuff. Another guy walking his dog came up to him (maintaining a healthy distance) and said: “So, your family also squabbling over who gets to take the dog out?” Those who don’t have dogs are getting creative.In the evening of the second day of lockdown, this time at 8 p.m. sharp, again everyone was out on the balconies, applauding and calling encouragement. Last night, day three, the same.Today, the number of confirmed cases in Madrid has blown past 4,000. A week ago, we were under 800. Spain has reached almost 10,000, and the number of deaths is over 300. Life in Madrid has not ground to a complete halt. Some people are still going to work, public transport is still functional although less frequent, and my local supermarket had a pretty good supply of fresh food (but still no toilet paper). And the Spanish community spirit is still admirable. My neighbor just underneath is an elderly lady who lives alone – I was the third person in the building to offer to get her groceries. And it’s a small building. Humor is still everywhere. One of our leading radio talk show hosts has just appealed to the population to take it easy – dogs are collapsing from exhaustion.But there are dents. Police cars with bullhorns are patrolling the streets, urging people to stay home. Fines are being handed out for those with no obvious and approved destination. Celebrations for Easter, one of the most important festivals for Spanish culture, even more so than Christmas, have been canceled.And there is a pervasive worry. There are three of us holed up in this apartment, wondering which of us will get it first. It is totally possible that we’ll be among the lucky ones, but it’s never a good idea to count on that. I’m worried about my son living in Germany – if he gets sick, I won’t be able to go and help.I miss my friends, and I miss my colleagues. I am sad that I couldn’t be in New York this week as planned, to welcome a new member of our team. I am starting to worry about keeping fit (yes, I have my yoga app, but I miss walking). See also: Bitcoin, Bonds and Gold: Why Markets Are Upended in a Time of FearAnd what’s happening in the markets and what’s coming for the economy are pretty damn scary.But we’re lucky. We’re lucky that this is the worst thing most of us have had to live through. We’re lucky that we can communicate with each other, pretty much whenever we want, and sometimes with symbolic backgrounds. In Spain, we are especially lucky because we have an excellent public health system with relatively good resources and world-class doctors. We have a great sense of community and friendship and resilience. We know we’ll get through this. For those in the U.S. and elsewhere, waiting for your lockdown turn to come, I can tell you this (from my vast experience of three days): It’s not so bad. It’s not at all nice, but the discomfort is largely emotional and psychological, and while that is definitely real, it’s a whole lot better than being sick. It’s a whole lot better than inadvertently infecting others. Most of us go through life with an arrogant belief that we’re immune from the worst life can throw at us. We’re not, but even if that were the case, this is not about us anymore. It's about our loved ones, our friends, our neighbors, your best friend’s grandma, the guy who runs the local bodega, the street cleaner, your kid’s teacher. It’s about doctors and nurses who are terrified of not being able to help everyone who needs it, it’s about politicians who don’t know what to do, it’s about workers who feel fear but need to keep things running, and it’s about analysts and economists who are struggling to make sense of it all.It’s about everyone, and one thing I am sure of: we will all emerge from this with a totally different sense of the word “community.” This could have repercussions much deeper than we realize.Stay safe, everyone.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Mar 17, 2020 at 09:30 UTC",Sweden’s Riksbank says its digital currency researchers are the best in central banking.,"That lofty claim comes in Riksbank’s March 3 bid to host a Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub, an initiative by the ""bank of central banks"" that wants to scatter the world with local financial innovation policy clearinghouses.One of the Hubs’ fields of study is sure to be central bank digital currencies. And there the Swedes, who are weeks into a long-term e-krona pilot project that report writers toiled over for years, are sure they’ve got a “comparative advantage” over the “tough competition” – “other central banks.”The innovation hub is not an average non-governmental organization, the Swedish bid shows. It's actually a BIS outpost: an extrajudicial annex within whatever country one pops up. As such, Innovation Hub employees, and activities, are granted immunity from local prosecution.“Given that the Riksbank has already come a long way in analyzing CBDC, it can, just as BIS requires from a hub, quickly supply analyses on the basis of already established collaboration between the public sector, private sector, academics and other central banks,” the petition said.With the formal launch of the e-krona pilot, Sweden joined a fast-growing arena of central banks actively toying with digitizing some form of their money, including China, Cambodia, South Korea, Switzerland, Ukraine.  But in many respects Sweden is years ahead. Riskbank began seriously looking into a CBDC in 2017 when it decided something had to be done about its citizens’ rapid move away from physical cash. In consecutive reports it outlined many of the CBDC talking points – technology, policy, purpose – on which other central banks are just now getting started.Riksbank now thinks its knowledge base makes it a strong contender to host an Innovation Hub, and it’s asking two key players – the Swedish parliament and the BIS – to agree.It’s not free to host. Riksbank is asking parliament to allocate SEK 30 million ($3,203,500) a year for five years of Innovation Hub operations, which represents about half of Riksbank’s annual BIS equity dividend. Riksbank controls about 3.2 percent of BIS stock.Riksbank sees this as a worthwhile investment, however. Its citizens are eschewing cash whether or not an Innovation Hub comes to town, and “there will still be a need to analyse financial technology developments in the payment market” if Sweden is not selected.BIS declined to discuss its selection process.The clash over hosting an Innovation Hub comes at a pivotal moment for the BIS and central banks in general. Just last week BIS signaled its belief the world’s payments landscape is rapidly changing with a quarterly report entirely dedicated to that digital future. Against this, private stablecoin initiatives are posing a potential threat to central banks’ hold on monetary policy and financial stability - if the bakers’ public comments are any indication. In the bid documents Riksbank says Libra has triggered a wave of new action, even though its own CBDC dreams long preceded the stablecoin’s 2019 inception.“After Facebook announced its intention, in partnership with a large number of companies, to introduce a global digital currency – Libra – central banks around the world have understood even more the need to cooperate to meet the challenges faced and take advantage of the opportunities offered by digitalisation to the global financial system,” the report sadThat’s spurred a lot of new activity, and, as Riskbank notes, a lot of interest in hosting a BIS Innovation Hub. “In other words, there is tough competition for the other hubs that BIS will establish,” the report said.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

But this time, it’s for plastics recycling. ","Blockchains are proving extremely useful for tracking materials across all sorts of supply chains and creating transparent and immutable audit trails. Meanwhile, governments around the world are issuing legislation requiring retailers and plastics producers to show they are meeting minimum levels of recycling, requirements that are likely to intensify going forward.That’s where a handful of blockchain startups see opportunity, by connecting major refining companies with new types of plastics recycling in a bid to reinvent current supply chains. Blockchain’s appeal here: measuring action and demonstrating it to the public.Currently, only rigid plastics that go into things like bottles are mechanically recycled into lower-grade plastics, a process that can be repeated twice at the most. But a combination of clever industrial technologies is set to make plastics recycling more sophisticated over the next few years, returning the chemically altered raw materials back into the manufacturing process.This means reducing plastic to the crude sludge from whence it came and then refining it again into any order of new products, creating a completely circular economy for a waste product that has become a scourge to the planet (as much as 12 million tons of waste plastic enters the oceans each year).The prospect of chemically recycled plastic entering global supply chains is the next step for large oil and gas refining companies, said Juan Miguel Perez, CEO of Finboot, which uses enterprise blockchains to help firms measure and reduce their carbon footprints.Finboot is working with Repsol, the Spanish energy giant committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. (Repsol acquired an 8 percent stake in Finboot in July of last year.) Read more: Hyperledger Conference Shows Where Blockchain Can Fight Global WarmingRepsol, which creates polypropylene used in plastic bottles, is now looking to take the lead in plastics recycling, showing how this could demonstrably transform downstream supply chains. “It’s a hard goal, but eventually you could show how consumer plastics from waste collection companies can be added into your supply chain as raw materials,” Miguel Pérez said. “It’s the next step in the process of tracing assets and linking supply chains.”Repsol was not ready to comment on its chemical plastics recycling at this time.U.K.-based startup Circulor is also looking at tracing recycled plastic across supply chains, going beyond the work it’s doing with conflict minerals like cobalt.“I’m very excited about plastic waste,” said Circulor CEO Doug Johnson-Poensgen. “In many European countries, governments are proposing taxes on retailers who sell plastic which doesn't contain a minimum of 30 percent recycled. The obvious thing that’s required is a way to prove it, which is what blockchains can do.”Read more: Everledger Looks Beyond Blood Diamonds With ESG Supply Chain CollaborationThe same issue is faced at an oil refinery, he said. “The challenge for the oil majors like Total and BP is that if you are producing all these plastic materials, how much of it is recycled? This is why traceability is an important part of that.”The chemical recycling of plastic is the future, said Johnson-Poensgen, and the proper infrastructure to do this is gradually being put in place, adding that Circulor is “scoping out” a project with U.K.-based Recycling Technologies, which manufactures the equipment to chemically recycle plastic.Recycling Technologies, which this month received backing from Neste, the world’s leading provider of renewable diesel and jet fuel, creates seed stock for new plastic production. This also improves on mechanical means by incorporating so-called soft plastics, which generally end up in landfills or simply bleed into the environment, said Recycling Technologies marketing manager Lisa Zafferani.Her company uses a system of thermal cracking, turning waste plastic into a gas which can then be distilled into an oil and refined by a petrochemical firm, in the same way crude oil from the ground is refined. “I think what is really interesting for the waste and recycling industry is how you can use technology like blockchain to trace plastic waste in those processes of recycling and the output from them,” Zafferani said.

Silvergate, like many community banks, uses Finastra’s cloud data centers as opposed to hosting those centers on the bank’s premises. When Finastra detected anomalies in its systems as a potential cyberattack, the service provider shut down its system, cutting off wire transfers for Silvergate’s customers. According to Lane, the La Jolla, Calif.-based Silvergate was one of the first banks on Finastra’s network that became fully operational. Finastra did not respond to request for comment. The bank is one of the few banks in the U.S. totally focused on the cryptocurrency industry, with 804 clients in the digital currency space.The Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) was uninterrupted and customers that had funds already on the platform were able to trade, Lane said.By Thursday, the bank was already 90 percent remote, but the wire desk and technology support team were in the office when the outage occurred. (Bankers are still considered essential workers under California’s statewide shelter-in-place order. Nearly all of Silvergate’s staff is now working from home.)Any of the large crypto exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks that had integrated with Silvergate through an application programming interface (API) came online early yesterday morning. “We have been working on updating our SEN portal so that ultimately at some point this year all of our customers will be able to access the API version through a portal without having to go through online banking,” Lane said. The outage on Friday had some worried about how Silvergate was faring after the market downturn.Despite a crash in both equities and bitcoin, Silvergate remains well capitalized. At the end of 2019, its Tier 1 leverage ratio was 11.4 percent, double the 5 percent ratio that regulators require, according to its fourth-quarter earnings report. The bank’s total risk-based capital ratio is 26.5 percent compared to the 10 percent required. “Silvergate is very strong, liquid and well capitalized,” Lane said. “The issue we experienced was with a third-party service provider who worked with us around the clock, and everything is working again and we’re open for business.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

said ...","Mar 27, 2020 at 13:00 UTC","For governments, fighting the coronavirus pandemic is like fighting a war. ","The leaders of Italy, Spain and Germany have used the analogy – along with the CEOs of Bank of America and the U.S. telecommunications giant AT&T – to describe the mass-scale efforts needed to combat the disease: mobilizations of the health care industry, a retooling by factories to produce masks and makeshift morgues to accommodate a fast-rising death count.During a televised press conference this week, U.S. President Donald Trump characterized himself as a “wartime president.” Now, it’s becoming clearer that the economic toll of the virus, as in a war, is likely to be dire. In the U.S. alone, a record 3.3 million jobless claims were filed last week. Deutsche Bank predicts the country’s job losses might exceed 15 million, with Europe approaching a similar level. Countries are prepping aid and stimulus packages into the trillions of dollars, stretching already heavily indebted government balance sheets. Central banks led by the U.S. Federal Reserve have pledged nearly unlimited support to financial markets. Investors have flown to safety in U.S. dollars, and in doing so driven down emerging-market currencies, inflicting additional economic damage on some of the world’s poorest countries.See also: Why the US’ $2 Trillion Stimulus, Unlimited QE Will Expose the Monetary System’s FlawsSo with officials starting to envision what it might take to rebuild damaged economies and restore society to a semblance of normal, speculation is mounting that seismic shifts might be in the offing for the global monetary system — a phenomenon that historically has occurred in the wake of world wars. Think Bretton Woods, the historic gathering in 1944 at a mountaintop resort in New Hampshire, which set the template for the current system and entrenched the dollar’s near-century-long reign as the world’s dominant currency. “I wouldn't rule out anything at this point,” says Markus Brunnermeier, a Princeton University economics professor who has advised the International Monetary Fund, Federal Reserve Bank of New York and European Systemic Risk Board. Even before the coronavirus hit, questions were percolating among some economists and monetary officials over whether the dollar-based system could last through the 2020s. One concern is that monetary policy in the U.S. – actions by the Fed to maximize domestic employment and keep prices stable – reverberates through countries all over the globe, often saddling them with higher inflation whenever their currencies weaken versus the dollar; while exporters of raw materials or manufactured goods might become more competitive, consumers feel the pinch from higher prices for imported goods. Another factor is that so many commodities such as oil, copper and gold are priced in dollars, leaving producers including Russia, Brazil and South Africa at the mercy of foreign-exchange markets.   See also: Don’t Apply 2008 Thinking to Today’s CrisisBank of England President Mark Carney floated the idea of a “synthetic hegemonic currency,” possibly based on new digital-asset technologies, to reduce the dollar’s “domineering influence” on global trade. China, the world’s second-largest economy, has been pressing forward with a digital version of its yuan that might be used more widely in global trade. Facebook, the social network, proposed last year to create its own payment token, libra. Bitcoin, launched in the throes of the 2008-09 financial meltdown, offers another alternative. “Eventually we're going to get past this crisis,” said Tim Shaler, a former portfolio manager at the bond fund Pimco who now serves as chief economist for iTrust Capital, which allows clients to buy cryptocurrencies and physical gold through their retirement accounts.  “If there's a possibility to create some digital currency not tied to any domestic economy, there might be an opportunity for somebody to figure that out.” It’s little surprise the Federal Reserve is intervening so deeply in U.S. markets during a time of crisis. That ""quantitative easing"" (QE) playbook was put in place by former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke, who garnered the moniker “Helicopter Ben” thanks to his advocacy for plying the financial system with large quantities of much money when needed. In a matter of months in 2008, from August to December, the Fed’s balance sheet doubled in size to more than $2 trillion. It doubled again during the next few years to over $4 trillion. On Monday, the U.S. central bank, now led by Chair Jerome Powell, made an unprecedented pledge to buy bonds in unlimited amounts to support markets, while reviving 2008-era QE emergency-lending programs to ply banks, Wall Street dealers and even corporations with fresh liquidity. The new efforts could quickly balloon the Fed’s balance sheet to north of $8 trillion, says Stephen Cecchetti, who headed the monetary and economic department at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, in the early 2010s.If there's a possibility to create some digital currency not tied to any domestic economy, there might be an opportunity for somebody to figure that out.On Wednesday, lawmakers in Washington were negotiating a $2 trillion aid package, but the investment-research firm Evercore ISI predicted this week in a report that another $3 trillion might be needed. Some of the Treasury bonds issued to finance surging U.S. government budget deficits might get sopped up by the Fed.  “The central bank has to be a part of the war machine,” said Cecchetti, now a professor of international economics at Brandeis University. Despite the flood of new dollars, the U.S. currency has surged in recent weeks to its strongest levels in three years. Inflation is muted, and the economy’s weakness means prices in the U.S. won’t be pressured upward anytime soon. But the Fed’s trillions could eventually lead to higher inflation. There also might be a renewed outcry that such money injections merely bail out bankers and rich people, with few of the benefits going to the middle or lower classes – similar to the arguments of the Occupy Wall Street movement that followed the 2008 crisis. Outside the U.S., central banks might emerge from the coronavirus shock with a stronger appetite for independence from American influence over the global monetary system. See also: Geopolitical Crisis May Benefit Oil, Gold and CBDCs, Not Bitcoin“It's going to be interesting to see how it plays out when we have at least two major financial players that are going to emerge from this,” said Omer Ozden, CEO of RockTree Capital, a merchant bank with expertise in blockchain technology. “China will have its own thoughts and may take a different direction from, let's say, a Bretton Woods-style global organization.”It’s highly unlikely the global monetary system would see a negotiated accord along the lines of the Bretton Woods accord, which was joined by 44 countries, said Edwin Truman, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who oversaw the Federal Reserve’s division of international finance from the late 1970s through the late 1990s. Trump’s brash, freewheeling style and protectionist impulses in recent years have alienated former allies in Europe, and his border wall campaign has ratcheted up tensions with Mexico. He demonized China in last year’s trade war and recently referred to the coronavirus as the “China virus.” See also: Bitcoin and Gold: Evaluating Hard-Cap Currencies in Times of Financial Crisis“One of the big challenges of today, in contrast to 2008-2009, is that the state of national cooperation is pretty low,” Truman said. “In order to do, collectively, a big change in the system, people would have to agree, and everyone seems to be fending for themselves.” For George McDonaugh, CEO and co-founder of Isle of Man-based KR1, a publicly traded cryptocurrency investment company, it’s the head-scratcher of “helicopter money” that might ultimately raise fundamental criticisms of the current monetary system. Deep interest rate cuts and central bank money injections in ever-growing quantities appear to have become the default solution whenever a market crisis hits every seven to 11 years.   The Fed’s trillion-dollar money injections during the 2008 financial crisis did little to weaken the dollar’s dominance in the years since, but this time might be different. “If someone on TV says we can have infinite money, someone on the other side of that TV screen says, 'Why have I been working my ass off for the past 40 years?'” McDonough said. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

He allegedly sold over 2,000 videos and had ties to 303 virtual currency accounts, according to a press release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia.Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) funded the bulk of the operation, according to the complaint against the man filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Customers allegedly sent the cryptocurrencies as payment for videos or could upload their own. Their video submissions had to follow “specific rules,” though. As detailed extensively in the complaint, the videos had to be explicitly “obscene.”“The types of crimes described in this indictment are the most disgusting I’ve encountered in 30 years of law enforcement,” said Don Fort, chief of the Internal Revenue Service’s Criminal Investigation team (IRS-CI), in a press release. “It is a special kind of evil to prey on and profit from the pain of others.”Federal agents discovered DarkScandals while investigating the Welcome to Video case last year. That operation led to hundreds of arrests, the seizure of hundreds of thousands of videos and the dismantling of what was deemed the “largest darknet child pornography website” by investigators at the time.It also led investigators straight to DarkScandals, the complaint said. “A subsequent review of a Washington, D.C.-based 'Welcome to Video' customer’s virtual currency records lead to the discovery of the DarkScandals sites.”The case serves as another reminder that cryptocurrencies are a double-edged sword for criminals. On the one hand, transactions cannot be blocked by a regulated third party like a bank or payment processor; on the other hand, they leave a trail of crumbs for investigators that is difficult to obscure.Agents with IRS and Homeland Security Investigations traced 303 digital currency transactions in the course of this latest investigation. The IRS had used Chainalysis’ transaction tracing software in the Welcome to Video investigation, but a spokesperson for Chainalysis declined to comment on this most recent one.“If you thought you were anonymous, think again,” Fort said. U.S. investigators worked in partnership with the Dutch National Police, Europol and the German Federal Criminal Police in parallel investigations, according to DOJ.Prosecutors are seeking to charge the man on nine counts and seize the operation’s digital currency holdings.

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Mar 18, 2020 at 07:45 UTC",Digital asset manager Wave Financial is tokenizing a whole year's production of Kentucky bourbon so global investors can gain exposure to the growing U.S. whiskey market. ,"Wave announced Wednesday it had finalized an agreement with the Danville, Kentucky-based Wilderness Trail Distillery to tokenize between 10,000 and 20,000 barrels of bourbon whiskey, worth up to $20 million, that will be made publicly available through a specialized digital asset fund. Known as the Wave Kentucky Whiskey 2020 Digital Fund, investors will be able to purchase asset-backed tokens linked to an inventory of whiskey barreled this year. Stored and maintained by the Wilderness Trail Distillery, Wave estimates the fund will represent as many as four million bottles of bourbon.The U.S. whiskey market has experienced something of a renaissance, becoming the most exported U.S. spirit in 2018. Over the past 10 years, domestic production capacity has repeatedly expanded year on year in order to meet demand.By tokenizing it, Wave says investors can gain exposure to bourbon's value appreciation and can also share some of the proceeds from when the whiskey is sold wholesale to merchants, three years after the whiskey is first distilled and tokens issued to investors.  Wave's president and manager of the new whiskey fund, Benjamin Tsai, said in an announcement the fund gave investors a ""rare opportunity to access this unique asset class traditionally unavailable due to high upfront costs and purchase minimums, low liquidity, scarcity of production capacity, and technical know-how.""Unlike many other consumable goods, which perish and lose value over time, whiskey does the opposite: the older the whiskey, the more valuable it becomes. This is due to whiskey's natural aging process. Once distilled, the spirit is stored in a barrel so ingredients continue to mix and the water either evaporates or soaks into the wooden barrel, improving the whiskey's flavor and making it more valuable.Specifically with the bourbon Wave selected, markup can increase from $1,000 per barrel when first distilled to as much as $4,000 five years down the line.Tsai told CoinDesk that a fund administrator and auditor will calculate the value of the barrels on a quarterly basis, which will be presented a regular inventory report and will provide investors will a benchmark price for their tokens. Users will be able to trade their tokens at whatever price they wish. Wave is also in discussions with some security token exchanges to develop an official secondary market infrastructure to facilitate better trading in the whiskey-backed tokens. The new tokens have created something of a buzz among blockchain protocols, some representatives have approached Wave asking whether they would consider launching on their platform. ""We're keeping our eyes open on the protocols we could use for this,"" Tsai said, adding that the company was using Vertalo, a Tezos-partnered developer house, to create the token. A Wave spokesperson added that the token was available for accredited investors from all around the world, with a first close at the end of March, and a second at the end of June. A final close is expected to take place in September. Token issuance will take place a year after the sale, to comply with the SEC's one-year lockup requirement.UPDATE (Mar. 18, 09:05 UTC): This article has been updated with additional information about the token sale and issuance.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Gys is also a partner at Digital Asset Consulting (DIAC), a consulting firm specialized in asset tokenization. ","Imagine a web-based taxi company where the drivers are the co-owners, a company that automatically distributes its increasing profits to its drivers. Or imagine a delivery platform that pays its couriers higher wages as it gets more popular. Unfortunately, the driving forces behind the growing gig economy, companies such as Uber and DoorDash, do exactly the opposite. The growth of the gig economy is a huge concern for governments and policymakers worldwide. Technological innovation is a crucial part of every modern economy, but the companies that have created the gig economy consistently exploit the rights of their workers and users. The examples are numerous: Uber drivers having to work 60 hours a week to earn the minimum wage, startups not contributing to retirement. The list goes on. Blockchain-based co-ops can help governments create an economy of inclusion, and re-write the social contract for the 21st century. There is a solution to this problem and it does not lie in stricter regulation. Traditional regulatory approaches for old-fashioned companies don’t work well for borderless digital platforms. It lies in creating a regulatory framework for a viable alternative: digital cooperatives. Co-ops are usually associated with agriculture or banks, but the digital platforms of the internet economy – social networks, takeaway delivery, holiday rentals and taxi platforms – actually are the embodiment of cooperative work. The cooperative efforts of the contributors and customers of these platforms create the real value – the platforms themselves only coordinate the efforts. The technology that would enable the creation of digital cooperatives is blockchain. Bitcoin (BTC), the digital currency, has become the most prominent example of blockchain technology. But there are many more uses for it. The keyword is tokenization. Tokenization is the creation of a new digital currency – or tokens – that serves as the exclusive payment mechanism for these digital cooperatives. Let’s take the example of Uber. This web platform has been establishing footholds in many countries by initially subsidizing taxi rides. These cheap rides create demand from passengers, which leads to drivers joining. But as more drivers join, competition increases. Uber can then force its drivers to accept less pay and increase its margins. The beneficiaries of this race to the bottom are Uber’s investors and shareholders. If Uber, or a company like it, was a tokenized digital cooperative then the dynamics would change dramatically. The drivers of this cooperative taxi platform would be paid in its own currency, which would easily be exchanged for dollars or euros. Because a limited total amount of these tokens would be created, their value will increase as the popularity of the service grows. This would attract more drivers, which will lead to more customers and another increase in demand and value for the tokens. This digital cooperative model has a lot of benefits for other sectors of the digital economy as well. Think of a social network, like Facebook, but one that pays its users for selling their data to advertisers. A network of users are also members and have a say in the governance of it. Tokenized digital cooperatives will help people cooperate because everybody involved will benefit. Pooling resources, sharing equipment or new kinds of pension and insurance schemes are a possibility as well. All transactions will be entered into a blockchain and can, therefore, be verified. Blockchain-based co-ops can help governments create an economy of inclusion and re-write the social contract for the 21st century. A clear regulatory framework is needed for this to happen. The way these digital co-ops and their tokens can be created needs to be enshrined in law. Expanding current cooperative law by including digital co-ops and the creation of tokens, plus tokenized owner and membership, could be a good way forward. Regulators have been wary of the dark sides of bitcoin, which has slowed innovation in token-based business models. A clear legal status for digital co-ops would allow cutting-edge technology to use market mechanisms to solve one of the bigger issues of our times: the shift to a digital economy that harms many workers. Tokenized digital cooperatives also provide the possibility for investors to support startups with capital in exchange for a certain number of the tokens created. This way, they will become part of the inclusive economy and no longer need to gain wealth on the backs of customers or workers. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Striking amid a public health crisis in which hospital systems from Milan to Seattle are getting crushed by COVID-19 patients and governments are fretting if their emergency stockpiles can meet unprecedented demand, scammers are looking to consumers, also weary of the novel coronavirus, as a boon. “Criminals are exploiting the fear and uncertainty created by COVID-19 to prey on innocent citizens who are only looking to protect their health and that of their loved ones,” said INTERPOL Secretary General Jürgen Stock, in a recent coronavirus consumer fraud notice from Europe’s police force.Some of these scams are being facilitated through crypto, said Steven Yang, AnChain.AI’s marketing director. His firm claims to have traced millions of dollars worth of swindled crypto funds in the first two weeks of an investigative partnership with an unnamed “affiliated law enforcement agency” in Asia.AnChain.AI’s leadership has taken a top-down approach to investigating the coronavirus medical supply scams. “Our CEO actually ordered some face masks off of Amazon and had this done to him,” Yang said of AnChain.AI CEO Victor Fang, who in early February paid for a 100-pack of surgical masks that still have not come. (Fang did not pay in crypto for these masks).Fang brought the scam to AnChain.AI’s immediate attention, but coronavirus fraud schemes have already been raging for months. Primarily in Asia, and particularly in regions infected well before the contagion’s recent march west, consumers have thronged to any apparent source of hard-to-come-by medical supplies, sometimes paying dubious vendors in crypto. AnChain.AI said that two weeks ago it began investigating at the request of the unnamed law enforcement agency. Investigators noticed a pattern: Scammers posted supplies on trusted e-commerce sites including Amazon, eBay, and social media marketplaces; then lured consumers off the sites, to messaging platforms with no third-party oversight; they then took payment and printed a phony shipping label as “proof” to fool the marketplace and the consumer.Buyers were left thinking their medical supplies were days or weeks from arriving at their doorstep, realizing only weeks later they had been scammed. In some instances, Yang said, the scammers sent an empty box.By that point the victims' crypto was long gone.“They launder the money through a large number of jumping and pass-through addresses, or using things like tumblers and mixers, before liquidating through exchanges,” Yang explained.So far, more than 90 percent of the scam crypto transactions were received in tether (USDT), 5 percent in bitcoin (BTC), 2 percent in ether (ETH) and a small amount in “a wide breadth” of other cryptocurrencies.Many of the scams began in east and Southeast Asia, but some are now popping up around the world – even in the United States, according to Yang.The swindled crypto does flow back to Asia, though.“While we are still investigating this process, and the scam itself is observed worldwide, the liquidation itself is primarily going through big Asia-based exchanges,” said Yang, who suspects this is because of exchange rate and liquidity concerns (he declined to name the exchanges).Yang said AnChain.AI’s investigation is ongoing and may begin expanding to other “nationalities.” Coronavirus shows no signs of stopping, and as such it is unlikely scammers will die down either.In the long term AnChain.AI hopes to identify scammers at the point of exit – the exchanges – which would likely need to happen through official law enforcement inquiries and legal procedures. More immediately, though, the firm wants to raise awareness with a general public desperate to buy supplies and protect themselves during the ongoing public health crisis. Yang offered some recommendations for pandemic shoppers: Don’t buy medical supplies from untrusted marketplaces; never conduct deals over WhatsApp and WeChat; and approach crypto-first vendors skeptically – some are indeed legitimate, but others may well be scammers.“Anyone who is thinking of buying medical supplies online should take a moment and verify that you are in fact dealing with a legitimate, reputable company, otherwise your money could be lost to unscrupulous criminals,” Interpol Chief Jurgen Stock said in his presser.

WHO did not respond to a request for comment as of press time.IBM Blockchain CTO Gari Singh said everyone he had spoken with agreed it was important to “kickstart a consortium” as soon as possible.“We started off brainstorming ideas on how to collect, provide and use verified information about the virus,” said Singh. “It's not that we were trying to force blockchain into this solution, but we thought we need to replicate data, we need to have trusted sources, we need to make sure it can't be tampered with.”IBM is also bringing the Call for Code initiative to work on the platform to rapidly create tools that might be able to help stem the crisis. Looking ahead to the coming weeks, Singh said things like coronavirus testing data could be added to the platform.“You could think of a simple set of applications for the drive-through testing,” he said. “Using an iPad you could enter some information without having to know who the person was. We can start to collect that and build new applications off that.”Hacera’s Levi said analytics tools can provide powerful insights, provided everyone can be sure and agree all the data on the platform (which is entirely open and free to use) is correct and consistently versioned. He said a host of companies are offering their data smarts to help curb the virus.“Lots of data tool providers are getting involved. Everybody is rushing to help and nobody is charging a cent,” said Levi.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

210,www.coindesk.com,1 month ago,Into the Unknown: No Limit on Fed Money Injections,https://www.coindesk.com/into-the-unknown-no-limit-on-fed-money-injections,"Bitcoin (BTC), viewed by some cryptocurrency investors as a hedge against 
the inflationary pressures from central bank money-printing, ...","Mar 23, 2020 at 16:49 UTC","The Federal Reserve pledged Monday to buy bonds in an unlimited quantity while allocating at least $300 billion to new emergency-lending programs. These measures are being taken as Wall Street reels from fresh predictions of a steep drop-off in economic output due to coronavirus-related lockdowns, business disruptions and job losses.","“The coronavirus pandemic is causing tremendous hardship across the United States and around the world,” the central bank said in a statement on its website. “Aggressive efforts must be taken across the public and private sectors to limit the losses to jobs and incomes and to promote a swift recovery once the disruptions abate.”The expanded liquidity injections signaled the Fed’s willingness to go beyond even the already-dramatic steps taken in recent weeks to keep traditional Wall Street stock and bond markets from convulsing. In a previously unscheduled meeting on March 15, policymakers led by Chair Jerome Powell slashed short-term interest rates close to zero, just days after pledging to inject $1.5 trillion into the financial system via short-term loans to Wall Street dealers. The latest announcement, made early in the U.S. day, came after overnight trading in Asian markets and futures contracts were indicating the S&P 500 Index was headed for another steep drop. Investor confidence was further eroded by U.S. lawmakers’ failure to reach agreement late Sunday over a proposed $1.8 trillion aid package. Yet, even with the latest pledge of support from the Fed, the S&P 500 was down about 2.8 percent in early trading on Monday.  Bitcoin (BTC), viewed by some cryptocurrency investors as a hedge against the inflationary pressures from central bank money-printing, climbed 7.3 percent to a price of $6,272 as of 13:31 UTC (9:31 a.m. in New York). The move trimmed bitcoin’s year-to-date loss to 13 percent, less than half of the S&P 500’s 31 percent loss so far in 2020. With the new round of emergency-lending programs, the Fed has now undone nearly all of its efforts to “normalize” financing conditions following the unprecedented actions taken during the 2008 financial crisis. In that era, the Fed also cut rates close to zero and provided some $1.2 trillion of secret emergency financing to the world’s largest banks, on top of the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) bailout package approved by lawmakers.  In Monday’s statement, the Fed said new emergency-financing programs of up to $300 billion would support borrowing by employers, consumers and businesses. The Treasury Department will provide $30 billion of equity for the new programs, indicating taxpayers would take the first hit from any defaults before the central bank suffered any losses.See also: Unlimited QE and Why Markets Can’t Price In COVID-19The Fed also said it would start buying bonds backed by commercial mortgages as part of a previously announced pledge to purchase Treasury bonds and residential mortgage-backed securities. Previously the central bank had allocated $700 billion to the asset purchases, but those purchases now will be made “in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning,” according to the statement. And in keeping with Powell’s recent pledge to use emergency programs hatched during the 2008 financial crisis, the central bank rolled out a series of lending initiatives to support bonds backed by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans, small business loans and “certain other assets.” A new Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility, or PMCCF, will be set up to help finance new bond and loan issuances. A Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility will provide liquidity for outstanding corporate bonds. “The PMCCF will allow companies access to credit so that they are better able to maintain business operations and capacity during the period of dislocations related to the pandemic,” the central bank said. The program will provide four-year loans, and borrowers may elect to defer interest and principal payments during the first six months, extendable at the Fed’s discretion. A recently revived fund to support money-market mutual funds will now include bank certificates of deposit and a special type of instrument known as ""variable-rate demand notes"" used to provide financing to municipalities.     The Fed added that it would “soon” establish a Main Street Business Lending Program to support lending to small and medium-size businesses. The Fed’s monetary-policy committee, consisting of presidential appointees and a selection of the top executives of the central bank’s regional branches, is set up as an independent government entity with so-called lender-of-last-resort powers. That means it has the wherewithal to provide freshly printed money to banks when other funding sources dry up. The Fed committee typically meets in secret, with full transcripts of meetings released only years afterward. The structure gives the central bank leeway to act quickly to provide stimulus, though it also opens up policymakers to after-the-fact scrutiny and criticism — including suggestions large-scale money-printing might eventually stoke runaway inflation. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a separate statement he authorized the new Fed emergency-lending funds along with the expansion of the previously announced programs. “This administration is working with the Federal Reserve and will continue to take aggressive action to address liquidity issues,” Mnuchin said.

The flight to safety has pushed down the 10-year note’s yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, to historically low levels below 1 percent.“These changes are being made to address highly unusual disruptions in Treasury financing markets associated with the coronavirus outbreak,” the New York Fed said in a statement on its website. The announcement follows announcements by the Fed branch earlier in the week that it would increase the maximum amount of overnight loans provided to Wall Street bond dealers through “repo” markets — essentially short-term collateralized loans — to $175 billion from $100 billion. The pumping of trillions of dollars of fresh liquidity into the financial system recalled the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented efforts during the crisis of 2008 and the years afterward to ply banks and markets with money in a bid to revive the economy in the wake of Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy.    The New York Fed said Thursday it would initiate the injections as soon as Thursday afternoon, beginning with $500 billion of three-month repo loans. On Friday, the bank will offer additional repo operations with $500 billion of three-month loans and $500 billion of one-month loans. “Three-month and one-month repo operations for $500 billion will be offered on a weekly basis for the remainder of the monthly schedule,” according to the statement. “The Desk will continue to offer at least $175 billion in daily overnight repo operations and at least $45 billion in two-week term repo operations twice per week over this period.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Mar 23, 2020 at 21:00 UTC","As the coronavirus pandemic spreads across Asia, nations leveraged significant surveillance networks to trace the virus’s spread and forced governments around the world to weigh the trade-offs of public health and privacy for millions of people. Now, recent reports say the U.S. government is in talks with controversial surveillance and data gathering companies to enlist them in addressing the coronavirus crisis, signaling an escalation in the use of surveillance tools. ","Last week the Wall Street Journal reported the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) enlisted Palantir, a data-analysis behemoth that works with law enforcement and other government security agencies, to model outbreak data. Palantir and Clearview AI, the facial recognition startup that acquired billions of facial images through public web scraping, have been in contact with state governments about tracking people who came in contact with infected individuals. See also: In Fight Against Coronavirus, Governments Face Trade-Offs on PrivacyThe reports caused alarm among privacy advocates who, while noting the need to address the public health crisis, worry about the companies that are being pulled in to help. “During times of crisis, civil liberties are most at risk because the normal balance of safety versus privacy becomes tilted toward safety,” says Michele Gilman, a privacy lawyer and fellow at Data & Society, a think tank that studies the social impact of data-centric tech.“A major concern is that new surveillance technologies deployed during the coronavirus crises will become the ‘new normal’ and permanently embedded in everyday life after the crisis passes. This can result in ongoing mass surveillance of the population without adequate transparency, accountability or fairness,” she said.   There is a precedent for this, and from not long ago. The 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 led to an expansion of surveillance cameras and networks across the U.S. and the Patriot Act, a federal law that removed legislative guardrails to government surveillance and decreased transparency, accelerating the National Security Agency’s intrusive and massive surveillance capabilities later revealed by whistleblower Edward Snowden. Despite the public backlash against the NSA’s practices, lawmakers have yet to de-authorize it. “Ambiguous policies around what happens to the data collected after its intended use... rip away control and transparency for people.” “Many of the directives implemented as part of the Patriot Act led to the abuses that were exposed by Snowden,” says Steven Waterhouse, the CEO and co-founder of Orchid Labs, a privacy focused VPN company. “What abuses will we learn about later, after this crisis has passed? What legislation will be rammed through the government during this time of crisis?”Things that may now be considered mundane, such as an abundance of surveillance cameras, being subjected to full body screens at the airport and the idea that we are constantly being observed, weren’t always the case. Often, public crises provide opportunities for surveillance architecture to move forward and become normalized fixtures of society. and create commercial opportunities for tech companies to provide new and ever more intrusive ways of tracking individuals. That’s the case with Clearview AI, a facial recognition startup that claims to have scraped billions of public images off the web and created software that can identify a face within seconds. It markets itself to law enforcement within the U.S. but also targeted authoritarian regimes around the world with records of human rights abuses as part of a rapid expansion plan, according to documents obtained by Buzzfeed News. The company has also overstated the effectiveness of its technology, claiming police departments solved cases after using it when that was not the case. The company now faces legal challenges from other companies, and state governments. “Clearview has a  pretty consistent pattern of not being forthcoming about information but also intentionally misleading their clients in my view,” says Clare Garvie, senior associate at the Georgetown University Law Center's Center on Privacy and Technology. “Whatever means the government implements or various state and local governments implement to combat the spread of this virus must be the least intrusive means possible. What Clearview AI is proposing is not the least intrusive means possible.”Extensive research shows facial recognition is not equally accurate on everyone. See also: Mass Surveillance Threatens Personal Privacy Amid Coronavirus“Facial recognition is notoriously inaccurate for women and people of color,” says Gilman. “Given this, why would we adopt such technologies to battle coronavirus? Moreover, we need much more information on how these technologies are effective in battling a global pandemic.”China has facial recognition systems that detect elevated temperature, while South Korea has tracked people using cell phone data and locations of financial transactions. Palantir, meanwhile, has extensive contracts with law enforcement and has little to no transparency about its practices unless you’re a customer. In a rare user manual for law enforcement obtained by Vice in 2019, the program Palantir Gotham is said to be in use at law enforcement centers that target data sources including day care centers, email providers and traffic accidents for data that builds profiles of suspects, and their friends, family and business associates. The company was co-founded by Peter Thiel, the liberatarian billionaire who was also an early investor in Facebook. Privacy advocates have reason to fear his motives. In a 2009 essay for the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington, D.C., Thiel wrote that “most importantly, I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.”If privacy experts seem skeptical of companies like Clearview AI and Palantir, this is perhaps one reason why. “Creating public-private partnerships to share sensitive data in times of crisis, such as a terrorism attack or a pandemic, brings short-term benefits but has an alarming impact on data privacy long after the emergency passes,” says Raullen Chai, CEO of IoTeX, a Silicon Valley company that develops privacy-protecting smart devices using blockchain. “Ambiguous policies around what happens to the data collected after its intended use, as well as subjective triggers of ‘emergency-only’ practices, rip away control and transparency for people.” Experts recognize the fundamental need to address immediate consequences of the coronavirus pandemic, but there is skepticism Clearview AI or Palantir would offer the required transparency and least intrusive approach. Garvie worries about crisis profiteering. “It’s the use of fear to market surveillance tools,” says Garvie.  “I just caution anyone considering contracting for these tools to make sure the decision is not being driven by the supplier, by the company, using the crisis to push through unnecessary surveillance mechanisms.”Note: The description of Palantir's business has been updated.

An investigation from CoinDesk Korea found Cho primarily dealt in the privacy-enhancing cryptocurrency monero (XMR) so he could cover his tracks. Korean authorities took the unusual step Wednesday of publicly naming Cho as the alleged ringleader of a Telegram chat group known as the Doctor's Room, following a petition signed by more than five million South Koreans. He stands accused of violating the child protection, privacy and sexual abuse acts, as well as charges surrounding abuse, blackmail and threatening others. Following a Supreme Court case in 2018, cryptocurrencies are considered a form of property subject to forfeit after conviction in South Korea. But there are complications. Authorities have to find the wallets in which digital assets are stored, as well as the private key to access them. ""We may say that Mr. Cho has forgotten his private key,"" said Han Seo-hee, a Korean lawyer, to CoinDesk Korea. ""If I refuse to submit it, there is no way to force it [from him].""Although CoinDesk Korea has been able to show Cho received more than 8,800 ether (ETH), currently worth around $1.2 million, from more than 500 wallets from around the world, the majority of his payments were in monero. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, where transactions can readily be viewed on a public blockchain, monero jumbles them together, making it next to impossible for third parties to trace payments. Even the amount he received may never be known without his cooperation. Cho is accused of blackmailing at least 58 women and 16 girls to send degrading and sexually exploitative images of themselves, forcing many to carve 'slave' into their bodies. He operated multiple rooms on Telegram, with users paying extra to view more graphic or extreme material. Korean authorities have also arrested 124 suspects and 18 operators linked to the case. “I apologize to those who were hurt by me,” Cho said following his public reveal Wednesday. “Thank you for ending the life of a demon that I couldn’t stop.”Cho did not respond to questions from reporters on whether he had admitted to the charges.

The opaque data policies that routinely top 10,000 words and legal experts agree are nonsensical. The use of trackers and pixels to allow data players to reach far outside their own domain and index web traffic not even remotely attached to the “services” they offer. Especially the data and content creators who are routinely either completely excluded or massively de-prioritized when it comes to divvying up the value of the platforms they power. Our data paradigm has been broken for a while now. We generally acknowledge this break with some form of “yeah, I know Google is building an archetype of me for their own purposes, but what else am I gonna do? Plus look how pretty their site is!” Regulators acknowledge this challenge and there have been well-meaning attempts to legislate a better outcome to this with privacy focused legislations such as GDPR and CCPA. These laws are well-intentioned, but I believe fatally incomplete in two ways. See also: Alex McDougall - Data Creators Should Share in the Profits From Big DataFirst, until you either fix the fundamental mismatch of privacy and profit, or alter the system by which investors expect ever increasing quarterly earnings, we will never get a real “private” future led by today’s tech giants. They are too nimble, too powerful, too incentivized by profits and operate in a world that’s too ill defined to be shackled by slow-moving legislation. Legislation that can be innovated around or worse, repurposed for their own intentions.Secondly, especially in a post COVID-19 virtualized world, “privacy” by forced disconnection is NOT what we need. Prior to this devastating global outbreak, despite mounting work from home and virtual office technology, the majority of business still happens face to face. That’s especially true of the high-value “closing” type interactions and the high-value networking engagements (the real point of conferences!). Legislation that can be innovated around or worse, repurposed for their own intentions.Same story with social interactions. Yes, social media has been the defining force of our past 15 years, but the majority of the important interactions in our lives still happen in person, especially the high-emotional-engagement interactions (romance, family gatherings). Same story with health and wellness. You learn digitally, but execute treatment plans in person. We don’t need further disconnection, we need a new digital paradigm to replace our most important interactions without completely losing our humanity.You may recognize a correlation here between the things we generally do in person and the events that would be most valuable for current data players to observe and model. For example, buy decisions, romantic choices and family dynamics. Up until now, you’ve always been able to, at least somewhat convincingly, “opt-out” of the data paradigm. While it’s a wrench to leave Facebook when all your friends and family are there, it’s possible. You can live without Facebook.In the future, it may be impossible to leave society’s dominant data matrix behind. With the COVID-19 pandemic causing widespread isolating lockdowns and sweeping social distancing measures, we’re about to enter into a world of unprecedented digital mediation. Our digital mediators, with all-time low trust and all-time power high, are about to get even more omnipotent in our lives. See also: Lindsey Barrett - When Corporations Violate Privacy, They Do Concrete HarmUnfortunately, privacy by itself isn’t the answer to this; it would be a lot simpler if it was. Our data feeds are the lifeblood of our digital personas and our digital personas are about to become our only personas. Slowing down and blocking them at a time where we’re about to lose our ability to physically connect is a recipe for isolation socially and economically. In the current world, we don’t have control  over our digital personas. They are generated, enhanced, tailored and monetized in the shadows. The profiles are rich and detailed and, in some cases, incredibly accurate. Have a look at what Google knows about you sometime. More privacy without fixing the underlying paradigm isn’t what we need.Why don’t we have the infrastructure we can control? I can see my Google profile and even download an Excel of it. Why isn’t there a secure vehicle where I take that Google profile, correct what’s wrong and supplement it with my Twitter, Netflix, Lyft, Apple Health, government ID, health and personal information to make a real digital version of me that I can use to connect and share myself? There are many reasons, including slow emerging distributed technology and strong consumer inertia, that this doesn’t exist today. But this user-controlled, 360-degree, digital profile is what’s going to form the kernel of a world where we can capture some semblance of our valuable physical interactions, in a digital setting. See also: Elizabeth Renieris - An Identity Layer for the Web Would Identify Us EverywhereMore privacy without fixing the underlying paradigm isn’t what we need. We need more rich data to make better algorithms and more virtual spaces that facilitate deeper, self-sovereign digital interactions. Here are three key pieces of infrastructure, as I see it:Sounds like a lot of stuff to build right? Luckily, we have a secret weapon: Our data is exponentially more valuable when we’re sharing it willingly. Google has become one of the most valuable companies on Earth by quietly trying to run digital simulations of all of us. Still, the value of  years of surveillance is a tiny fraction of the value of you or I filling out  an honest 10-minute survey. We’re at a tipping point. We need to re-orient our data paradigm away from the “abstract and extract” model to one where individuals and businesses  start our own digital identities. We need the tools, products, ecosystem and user willingness to adopt this new world. It won’t be an overnight solution.

Hoarders say yes, health experts say maybe and the visionaries say no: COVID-19 is the catalyst for systemic payments change.","This wrecking ball of a virus stands to change the way consumers, and businesses, think about their use of physical currency. In many countries, cash is already on the margins: for example, Sweden, whose central bank is actively examining digital alternatives.Cash is slowly receding from American life as well, though not as dramatically as it has for the Swedes. Cash comprised some 26 percent of transactions in 2018, down four percentage points from the previous year, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s most recent annual Diary of Consumer Payment Choice.On the other side of this crisis could be a more profound shift in the way we pay for goods. In the short term, though, coronavirus is spooking some people into limiting their interactions with bills of all forms. “The question is, if we’re all forced into social isolation, well, cash isn’t much good,” said Dave Birch, director of Consult Hyperion and a longtime advocate of digitization. “But what else is better?”Governments now mandate what health experts and doctors implore: Don’t leave your house except to buy food and medicine, and keep six feet of distance from others when you do. And Don’t. Shake. Hands.In light of that mandate, exchanging paper money seems absurd. Those colorful cloth-and-paper stores of value pass directly between hands all the time, collecting — and maybe spreading — a veritable universe of unknown microbes up and down the chain. The mere possibility that SARS-CoV-2 (this novel coronavirus’ scientific name) could be among them has prompted countries to swiftly move away from person-to-person cash exchange. German Chancellor Angela Merkel paid by card on a recent trip to the grocery store, breaking with her nation’s cash tradition and limiting her direct interaction with the cashier.See also: How a Flurry of ‘Digital Dollar’ Proposals Made It to CongressBusinesses, too, are beginning to tout “no contact” services, including DoorDash and GrubHub, two food-delivery services getting blitzed with orders as people stay home. Rather than handing customers their orders, drivers leave packages at the door. Governments have gone even further. In China, where the virus started its spread, the central bank ordered the sterilizing of potentially contaminated banknotes and only distributed new notes after a 14-day quarantine. South Korea has reportedly taken similar measures.But it’s not yet clear how effective or necessary these efforts are in the fight to stop COVID-19. While researchers believe the virus can sit, and spread, on surfaces, they do not know yet if it can be transmitted on currency. The Federal Reserve told CoinDesk it’s not overly concerned about cash-based viral transmission. “Currently, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has determined that COVID-19 spreads mainly through person-to-person contact,” a spokesperson said when asked if the central bank was considering destroying potentially infected banknotes. However, while it won’t be destroying money, it does have a “contingency stock” of clean bills ready to go and is staying in “close contact with the CDC” in case the thinking changes.In the absence of a scientific determination, banks are deploying a mix of tactics to battle contagion fear, including asking consumers not to hoard paper money at home. The Colorado Bankers Association begged consumers to keep their cash in the bank, in a March 18 press release.“A single dollar bill can be home to as many as 3,000 different bacteria and has changed hands upwards of a thousand times,” CBA said, proclaiming bank deposits as a “prudent defense against contamination.”By contrast, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have encouraged financial institutions to work with communities in responding to COVID-19, in part by asking them to raise ATM daily withdrawal limits.“The FDIC recognizes that such efforts serve the long-term interests of communities and the financial system when conducted with appropriate management oversight,” the agency said.The regulator is nonetheless encouraging Americans to keep most of their cash in the bank. It reminded consumers that “FDIC-insured banks remain the safest place to keep their money,” in a March 18 press release.“The last thing that you should be doing is pulling your money out of the banks now, thinking it’s going to be safer someplace else,” Federal Deposit Insurance Commission Chair Jelena McWilliams said in a widely shared March 24 video. She also warned against mattress stuffing, saying, “It didn’t pan out well for so many people.”See also: Don’t Apply 2008 Thinking to Today’s CrisisIn addition to the public health concerns, these organizations are trying to get ahead of a potential bank run. COVID-19 threatens to trigger an economic downturn comparable in some respects to the Great Depression, during which panicking consumers, fearful of bank failures, withdrew their cash deposits en masse. But the COVID-19 crisis is not a banking crisis, noted Jeffrey Saut, former chief investment strategist for Raymond James. There’s no reason for consumers to liquidate their accounts because the banks have not been affected by COVID-19, he said.Indeed, banks in the U.S. are healthier than they were going into the last global financial crisis. According to FDIC data, the leverage ratio for all insured institutions nationwide was 9.66 percent on Dec. 31, 2019 (the most recent date for which figures are available). That’s up from 7.81 percent on Sept. 30, 2008, two weeks after Lehman Brothers failed. The higher the ratio, the more capital banks have to withstand losses.On a more systemic level investors are putting their faith and credit in their banks, said Tobias Adrian, director of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Monetary and Capital Markets Department. “Cash, the physical object, is now potentially contagious but cash, the financial asset, is still a safe option,” Adrian said.The global equity sell-off has seen investors move over to safer assets, of which cash in the bank is certainly one, he said. “Bank deposits are a form of safer asset, like digital cash.”Nevertheless, consumers have apparently begun lining up for small-scale cash withdrawals. Already bulking up on canned goods and toilet paper, consumers are reportedly building out their physical cash reserves with repeated trips to the ATM. Cash, the physical object, is now potentially contagious but cash, the financial asset, is still a safe option.They’re not necessarily losing faith in the banking system specifically. Rather, said sociologist Andreas Folkers, these hoarders – of cash, cans, food, medicine, anything – are reacting to a wider breakdown in society’s day-to-day routine that strips them of trust overall. “When expectations of what the normal state of things is and what can be expected in the future break down, this immaterial or social intangible resource of trust gets lost,” said Folkers, a researcher at the University of Giessen’s Institute of Sociology in Germany. “This is definitely one reason why people cling to very tangible or material goods in times of crisis, because that's something they can hold on to without being dependent on trusting people and trusting the state of events,” he said.Put simply, during a crisis it’s easier to trust the money in your hand than it is the money in the bank, whether or not you have reason to believe that the intangible money is under any specific threat. Governments and the private sector have an opportunity to build robust payment and value transfer systems that work in ways cash can’t, said Birch. He points to China’s AliPay. With nearly 55 percent market share as of Q3 2019, it's the e-payments giant in Chinese consumerism – a tenet of daily economic life. That prevalence makes it a valuable asset in China’s fight against coronavirus. A built-in “Alipay Health Code” function now assigns users a color – green, yellow or red – representing their health status.See also: Privacy Advocates Are Sounding Alarms Over Coronavirus SurveillanceIt’s an ingenious way to track users’ potential exposure to coronavirus, Birch notes. “Green” users – presumably those who have tested negative for the virus – are allowed to move about the public, and they scan QR codes to “check into” densely populated areas like subway cars as they do. “If somebody in the subway car is found to have the virus, you don't have to test everybody on the train, you only have to test people in the car,” Birch said. But Alipay Health Code’s tracking and tracing may grant the Chinese government a wide-open back door: A New York Times investigation found the program forwards users’ locations and personal information to servers at every scan point. The forwarding function’s name? “ReportInfoAndLocationToPolice.”Alipay Health Code amounts to a startlingly effective and strikingly pervasive surveillance apparatus hard-coded into consumers’ electronic payments portal of choice. Swap “government” for “Facebook,” though, Birch said, and the reality may feel a bit closer to home. He argues that two surveillance “systems” prevail. “You have the Chinese system, where the government spies on you and knows everything you do, and you have the American system, where companies spy on you and know everything you do,” he said.“Neither of those seem, really, the best way forward.”Governments and companies will have to build systems that prioritize responsible anonymity instead of exploiting people’s data, Birch said. COVID-19’s most profound impact on money may come in months ahead, when it is hoped society returns to a semblance of normal as people try to resume their daily lives. One aggressive scenario envisioned by Jeff Dorman, the chief investment officer of digital asset investments firm Arca, is a sudden rush to cryptocurrency. He predicts more people will move more cash into more crypto after the pandemic, causing yet more people to do the same. It’s recursive feedback. Exponential growth. An unflattened curve. COVID-19 “is just one more step in that acceleration process,” Dorman said, acknowledging that pinpointing any one “tipping point” is next to impossible. “Everything from people being scared of their own currencies because of all the money printing that's going on, that might move more people into a bitcoin or a tether. The people afraid of physical cash, that might move more people into a bitcoin or a tether. Sooner or later when you know everyone owns it, you just start making payments with it,” he said.A slightly more mainstream prediction is that COVID-19 will push governments to more seriously consider digital payment alternatives. Governments may well leverage this crisis to move in the direction of a “cashless society,” said Jason Hsu, former legislator with the Taiwanese government who now advises on policy. See also: US Senate Floats ‘Digital Dollar’ Bill After House Scrubs Term From Coronavirus Relief PlanHe’s advocating Taiwan take a radical stance on government cryptocurrency – a central bank digital currency – in the face of this crisis, especially when it comes to disseminating Taiwan’s $2 billion coronavirus stimulus package, a rescue effort on par with that of other virus-shattered economies. “I'm now advising the government to set up a blockchain-based cryptocurrency deployment method to deploy this stimulus package,” Hsu said.In the meantime, Adrian at the IMF said he’s turning to established “contactless cash” alternatives whenever possible to limit exposure to the virus. He predicted non-contact payment methods will remain appealing post-crisis, perhaps as a holdover from these maniacal days of no social contact – at least not within six feet.

She is also an investor in early-stage startups with Slow Ventures.","Yesterday, it was reported that 3.28 million Americans filed for unemployment in the past week. This number dwarfed official expectations (about one million) as well as any previous figures ever reported, including during the Great Recession.There is also good reason to believe this number does not even capture all of those who lost their livelihoods in the last seven days. A combination of confusion, bad information and bureaucracy, coupled with the fact that many of these Americans will be filing for the first time, means the number laid off may be much higher.See also: Stop Treating Bitcoin as Risky. It’s a Safer Asset Than MostYet, in the hours after the announcement, the U.S. equities market rallied 4 percent, extending a three-day “winning streak,” as many of those in the business would call it.But let’s be clear: There are no winners to be declared in the midst of this crisis.President Donald Trump has been quick to express hope for a fast economic re-opening. Wall Street has been continually calling out for a “V-shaped” recovery, or a quick rebound off a bottom. A string of hedge fund managers, politicians and pundits appear on television and in our Twitter feeds daily, reassuring us of what is possible.Financial markets, with little left to grasp onto, have clung to this sentiment. Deep breaths. It will all be okay. This, too, shall pass. Thoughts and prayers.In 2008, banks were undercapitalized. This was really the root of the systemic failure that occurred. This time, it is hospitals that are overcapacity.
Economists, analysts and big bank CEOs tell us that there is nothing to fear because this time is different from 2008. This time there is no risk of systemic failure.There are three points I would like to raise in light of this argument:1. Dismissing risk of systemic failure is premature. Systemic failure is almost by definition hard to discern ahead of time or even in the moment. It is nearly impossible to accurately forecast the cascade of downstream effects.Very few have the privilege of a bird’s-eye view perspective in any given crisis. We are more likely to be foot soldiers in the fog of war than generals drawing battle lines. Therefore, it is devilishly difficult to see how a systemic failure will develop and affect other parts of the system as well as other systems altogether.See also: Cryptocurrency Is Most Useful for Breaking Laws and Social ConstructsEven those who are in a position to see it all often do not. Like the general in his bunker, it is too easy to become disconnected from reality on the ground.Banks are well capitalized this time, so from the perspective of the financial system, that particular systemic risk appears to no longer be relevant. But there are plenty of other cracks that are currently coming under pressure. Notably, central bankers globally have few conventional options left to stimulate growth as they have pursued nothing but easy monetary policies for the last decade. 2. When the foundation itself is crumbling, a cascade of systemic failures is unnecessary to bring down the structure.It is a known phenomenon that political leaders rely on comfortable, old fashioned frameworks when confronting novel  crises. American and European leaders demonstrated this in the 1950s and 1960s, turning to World War II paradigms as they confronted a geopolitical landscape in which that thinking no longer applied. The same can be said of American leaders who responded to 9/11 by leaning on Cold War reasoning.I believe the same is happening now with political and financial leaders in regard to 2008. “Because there is no systemic risk,” the 2008 line of reasoning goes, “the fallout will be contained.”See also: Don’t Obsess Over Crypto End Users, We Still Need Developers to Build the Back EndBut when more than three million people lose their jobs in a single week, you don’t need systemic risk to see unmitigated fallout. This may not be a financial crisis, but it is certainly an economic crisis.3. Just because systemic failure is not occurring within the financial system does not mean it is not happening.Just look at the health care system.In 2008, banks were undercapitalized. This was really the root of the systemic failure that occurred. This time, it is hospitals that are overcapacity.The overwhelming number of severe cases of coronavirus is overwhelming hospital resources around the world. Ventilators, personal protective equipment and health care workers themselves are suddenly in very short supply. This affects not only COVID-19 patients but all those who need medical attention for any reason. Pregnant women, gunshot victims, kids with broken wrists, older folks with a bad case of the run-of-the-mill flu all get affected. There’s your systemic failure.I generally subscribe to the old adage that the most dangerous words in investing are, “This time is different.” But this time really is different from the last crisis we saw. It is so different, in fact, that we cannot take refuge [in thinking] that it does not look like 2008. That reality should not be used as a salve or a comfort but should be taken as a warning to us. If it did look like 2008, at a minimum we would be dealing with a known. Instead, we are confronting the unknown, and all of the unknown unknowns that go along with that.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Such reports always include a “general risks” section detailing worst-case business scenarios. This year, Riot added two pandemic-specific subsections to discuss COVID-19.Riot Blockchain is getting thrashed by the response to COVID-19, the general risk section shows. Its workers are being quarantined and going into self-isolation while its supply chain is seizing up under border restrictions and factory closures, according to the filing.It also has the unwanted label of being a “nonessential business.” According to the 10-K, Riot has not been classified as an essential business in any of  “the jurisdictions that have decided that issue to date.” That potentially cuts off access to Riot’s offices and mining rigs.“If we are unable to effectively service our miners, our ability to mine bitcoin will be adversely affected as miners go offline,” Riot wrote. See also: Microsoft Files Patent Application for Crypto Mining System Powered by Human ActivityRiot's concerns echo issues Chinese mining farms faced nearly two months ago. In early February,  PandaMiner Chief Operating Officer Abe Yang told CoinDesk his company had difficulty operating some of its farms due to quarantine controls in certain provinces because they had limited staff repairing machines and running the hardware.At present, Riot's Oklahoma City operation features 4,000 Bitmain S17 Pro Antminers purchased over December 2019 for $6.35 million total, according to two press releases issued at the time. Those rigs replaced Riot's older fleet of about 8,000 S9 models, now offline, the 10-K shows. The “catastrophic” business ramifications of COVID-19 are hardly unique to Riot Blockchain; nearly every business is facing an existential threat that only four months ago would have sounded absurd. It’s an open question where all this will lead. Riot admits that the pandemic’s “sweeping nature” makes it next to impossible to predict the long term impact. One thing is certain, though:“If not resolved quickly, the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.
