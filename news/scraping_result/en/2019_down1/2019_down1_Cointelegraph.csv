A subsequent breakdown over the weekend sent Bitcoin below $10,000.Publishing a dedicated thread on the chances of Trump banning the cryptocurrency, Krueger argued he could theoretically have some success.By targeting entry and exit points for retail and institutional investors, the president would turn Bitcoin into an isolated, more illiquid asset as it is used by lay consumers. “Trump could also go after fiat onramps, by simply forbidding banks to service crypto exchanges, or by requiring banks to not service exchanges unless conditions XYZ are fulfilled (and make that practically impossible),” Krueger summarized.In reality, however, Trump would need to convince Congress of the need to ban Bitcoin, and lawmakers could overturn his demands, even if they occurred via an executive order or similar emergency measures.A ban is thus feasible but the probability of it becoming law is extremely low, Krueger concluded. His comments came several days after mainstream media suggested Trump had inadvertently made Bitcoin a campaign issue for the upcoming 2020 presidential elections. As Forbes noted, competing hopefuls, notably Andrew Yang, have long held an opposing view — that Bitcoin is in fact something to be embraced at national policy level."

It means the rise in bitcoin has not been accompanied by massive hype,” he added.In the short term, however, others were warning about impending moves lower.

The Fed chairman said: “I think things like that [the obsolescence of today’s reserve currencies] are possible but we really […] haven’t seen widespread adoption. Bitcoin is a good example, almost no one uses it for payments [...] it’s a speculative store of value like gold.”Powell’s comparison is noteworthy given the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s role as a custodian for the gold held by entities such as the U.S. and foreign governments, other central banks, and official international organizations. Powell acknowledged that the prospect of cryptocurrencies coming to replace reserve currencies has been implied since their inception and that its realization could see the global financial system — and specifically the Federal Reserve System — profoundly transformed. He noted: “People have been talking about this since cryptocurrencies emerged, but we haven’t seen it. That’s not to say we won’t — and if we do, then yes, you could see a return to an era in the United States where we had many different currencies, in the so-called national banking era.”As reported, Powell had testified before the House Financial Services Committee earlier this week and acknowledged that the impact of Facebook’s forthcoming stablecoin Libra could be of a “potentially systemic scale” for the global financial and regulatory landscape.In China, central banking veterans have characterized the widespread anticipation of Libra as being “inseparable from the global dollarization trend,” and stressed that Beijing should respond with precautions and rigorous policy research to seek to maintain a strong monetary status."

According to statistics from monitoring resource and wallet provider Blockchain, however, the more recent figures appeared to coincide with a sharp spike in the average block size on the Bitcoin blockchain.For July 13 and 14, the average block size suddenly jumped from around 1 megabyte to over 3 megabytes — by far the highest average in Bitcoin’s history. While the data is not repeated across other monitoring resources, VeriBlock will likely fuel existing speculation its activities overload the Bitcoin network with transactions, which are not genuine. The company has refuted that idea, its website still hosting comments from educator Andreas Antonopoulos from January, when he discussed VeriBlock and the issue of “spam” transactions. Despite the block size increasing, however, Bitcoin’s fee market appeared little changed in recent days.

This work is difficult, demanding, and often thankless. We believe it is the duty of corporations to give back to the projects from which they benefit – and from which their very business model stems.”The post outlines that the grant is exclusive and requires Ford to work on Bitcoin Core in his capacity as a Core software maintainer — pointing to issues such as further developing the network’s robustness, scalability and privacy.Equally, HDR Global Trading claims that the grant is awarded on a no-strings-attached basis — presumably implying that Ford will not be expected to contribute to BitMEX itself.The announcement emphasizes that it is only thanks to the critical development work of developers such as Ford that platforms such as BitMEX have sealed their success:“Without the millions of free man-hours from dedicated OSS developers powering everything from our operating systems, to our web servers, to our ops tools and Bitcoin itself, the BitMEX trading platform could not have been built.”HDR Global Trading has also recently made an unconditional donation to the MIT Digital Currency initiative — which conducts research into the development of the global crypto ecosystem — noting at the time that it was particularly keen to help support the work of Bitcoin Core developers Wladimir van der Laan and Cory Fields. In late June, BitMEX — the world’s single biggest bitcoin derivatives provider — posted record volumes across its operations as Bitcoin (BTC) hit $13,000.

network to become a temporary scalability solution for Ethereum.","Jul 15, 2019",Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed to using the Bitcoin Cash blockchain as a temporary scalability solution for the Ethereum network. The programmer introduced a summary of the idea in a July 13 post on the Ethereum Research.,"As previously reported, the Ethereum network has experienced some scalability issues, with its native blockchain capable of processing as few as 15 transactions per second (TPS), while its major competitor Ripple is reportedly estimated to have a TPS capacity of 1,500. As such, the Ethereum community has been working on Ethereum 2.0, a major network upgrade that is expected to improve its scalability once ETH shifts from proof-of-work to the proof-of-stake algorithm.While the first stages of the Ethereum 2.0 shift are expected to come in early 2020, Buterin has now suggested deploying other blockchains as a new option for improving Ethereum scalability in the short term. Specifically, Buterin said the Bitcoin Cash blockchain is a perfect match for this purpose as the hard fork cryptocurrency provides a data throughput of around 53 kilobytes (KB) per second, as opposed to Ethereum’s 8 KB.Additionally, Buterin outlined three other compelling reasons for using the blockchain, including low fees, the readiness of necessary machinery and the Bitcoin Cash community’s openness to people using the blockchain “for whatever they want as long as they pay the transaction fees.”In the post, Buterin noted Bitcoin Cash’s 10 minute block time as the main impediment to becoming a good Ethereum scalability solution. However, the expert noted that this problem could be solved by zero-confirmation payments using techniques like Avalanche pre-consensus.The crypto community on Twitter took a negative view on Buterin’s new Bitcoin Cash integration proposal, with some commentators forecasting that such a scenario could lead both Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash to a faster collapse.Francis Pouliot, co-founder of blockchain consulting firm Catallaxy, tweeted that the recent proposal by Buterin signifies a failure of the Ethereum project, while Bitcoin integration will just delay and unsolved scalability crisis.Recently, another Ethereum co-founder, Joseph Lubin, claimed that Ethereum has “already scaled quite significantly.”"

As the report outlines:“[B]y design, when a thief attempts to steal funds on the lightning network, if caught, they do not only lose the money they tried to steal, they lose all the funds in the relevant channel. This ‘punishment’ is expected to act as a deterrent and is sometimes called ‘justice’.BitMEX researchers claim to have potentially identified 241 justice transactions since the second-layer network’s in December 2017 — all the while noting that there is a possibility the data includes false positives and that other, more robust tools exist to identify such transactions than the basic search methodology used for their report.BitMEX’s data apparently reveals that the highest number of justice transactions — over 60 apparent instances — occurred in October 2018. April 2018 saw the second-highest number of justice transactions — over 30.Notably, while the period from February to April 2019 saw a relatively high number of justice transactions — between 20 and 30 instances — it eclipsed both October 2018 and April 2018 in terms of the absolute value in BTC claimed by honest nodes via the mechanism. February 2019 alone represented the absolute peak in terms of monthly total, at roughly 0.67BTC:BTC reclaimed by honest nodes using justice transactions. Source: BitMEX ResearchBitMEX’s report further qualifies the findings by noting that 2.22 BTC does not necessarily indicate that thieves tried and failed to steal that amount — given that potential thieves may have been punished by an amount larger than the value they tried to steal. Instead, the figure represents:“[T]he total funds claimed by honest non channel closing nodes, part of this value is funds originally owned by the dis-honest nodes and part of the value will be the value they tried to steal.”In conclusion, the report notes that the total number of justice transactions on Lightning since its inception represent just 0.7% of the number of currently active channels: while an optimal proportion of justice transactions is hard to determine, BitMEX Research notes, this current level appears to be a reasonable figure sufficient to prevent the risk of “large systemic channel thefts” in future.As reported, Bitrefill has recently made it possible for users of major American crypto exchange Coinbase to access its full suite of Lightning services directly from within their native exchange accounts. A couple of crypto payment processors have meanwhile this year released intermediary services to enable Lightning payments for products sold on Amazon."

U.S.-based payments startup Fold has made Lightning Network ...","Jul 11, 2019","United States-based payments startup Fold has made Lightning Network (LN) payments possible at Amazon, Starbucks, Uber and other big name retailers. The news was revealed in an official blog post published on July 10.","As previously reported, the Bitcoin (BTC) Lightning Network is a second-layer solution to bitcoin’s scalability limitations, opening payment channels between users that keep the majority of transactions off-chain, turning to the underlying blockchain only to record the net results.In its announcement, Fold reveals that participating selected retailers will settle users’ LN payments — denominated in satoshis, or one hundred millionth of one Bitcoin — via their prepaid access programs in a currency of their choice. LN payments are thus processed via the Fold site, where users can select a retailer and pay the relevant invoice using their Lightning wallet. Once paid, this provides them with a gift card — at a maximum value of $25 — that is redeemable either in-store using a barcode or online via alphanumeric code. Beyond the evident scalability and accessibility benefits of providing LN support at major retailers, Fold underscores that its services more broadly aim to keep faith with the cornerstone principles of crypto: meaning no Know-Your-Customer (KYC) checks, a non-custodial system and — in an outburst of Bitcoin maximalism — no support for altcoins.Beyond the aforementioned Amazon, Starbucks, and Uber, Fold’s Lightning payment service is also available for REI, Home Depot, Southwest Airlines, Target, AMC, Whole Foods and others. Fold follows other third-party crypto payment processors aiming to provide ways for users to use Lightning at major e-commerce and retail locations. This April, fellow startup Moon launched a web browser extension allowing online shoppers to use their Lightning wallets for purchases on Amazon and similar sites. As Fold, Moon serves as an intermediary — meaning that household names like Amazon are for now still not handling or processing the crypto directly.As reported, Fold had rolled out its Bitcoin payments service — this time explicitly designed as a gift card — that was available for use at retailers such as Starbucks as early as 2015.This March, blockchain development firm Lightning Labs announced the initial release of the Lightning offramp Lightning Loop, providing a non-custodial way to receive funds via the network."

American embargo, while he also claimed that the U.S. Congress is trying ...","Jul 12, 2019","If there's one thing the United States has had a history of, it's imposing sanctions on its enemies. Venezuela, Cuba, North Korea, Russia and numerous other nations have been subject to restrictions and penalties over the years, with the U.S. harnessing its economic muscle in order to punish pretty much any country that doesn't play by the international rulebook. One of the most notable of these countries is Iran — which, since the Iran hostage crisis of 1979, has been on the receiving end of a long series of prohibitions, blocks and sanctions.","Some of these sanctions were lifted in January 2016, when the then-President Barack Obama, signed an executive order revoking them as part of the previous year's historic nuclear deal with Iran. However, they were reinstated in November 2018, five months after the current president, Donald Trump, had decided to withdraw the U.S. from the aforementioned deal. And since then, things have only picked up steam, with the Trump administration announcing new sanctions in June in retaliation for the downing of a U.S. drone and then with American lawmakers introducing a bill in December that would place restrictions on Iran's ability to operate a digital currency.Following in the footsteps of Venezuela, the Iranian government is reportedly planning its own central bank digital currency, while a significant number of Iranian citizens have been mining various preexisting cryptocurrencies as part of an effort to mitigate the effects of a hyper-inflating national currency, the rial. But even if Iran could be distantly admired for demonstrating some degree of ingenuity here, the U.S. is working out how to curtail the Islamic Republic's ability to profit from cryptocurrency. Iranian officials complained at the beginning of July that the U.S. Congress is aiming to block Iran's access to Bitcoin (BTC) mining and other cryptocurrencies more generally, without specifying how exactly it intends to achieve such an aim.Related: Iran's Crypto Barometer — Regular Users Feeling the HeatBut while there's little doubt that the U.S. would much prefer Iran to have no access whatsoever to cryptocurrency — as well as no ability to mint its own digital currencies — it doesn't seem likely that it can do anything to restrict the Middle Eastern country other than introducing sanctions that prohibit American and foreign firms from having crypto-related dealings with the Islamic Republic.On July 6, local news outlet Al-Fars reported that the Iranian assistant minister of industry, trade and supply, Saeed Zarandi, released a statement concerning cryptocurrency. In it, Zarandi noted that Bitcoin can be used as a tool to circumvent the American embargo, while he also claimed that the U.S. Congress is trying to prevent the production of Bitcoin in Iran. How exactly American lawmakers are hoping to do this, he didn't explain. Nonetheless, he did add that several Iranian ministries are collaborating with the Central Bank of Iran to “resolve the issue of Bitcoin mining,” while more recently, the central bank’s governor announced that the government is planning to legalize mining, which it had previously been cracking down on. This would imply that the Iranian government is now intent on encouraging the use of cryptocurrencies as a means of resisting American-led pressures while also planning to develop its own central bank digital currency.Related: Regulatory Overview of Crypto Mining in Different CountriesGiven this possible change of direction, it would be instructive to consider how the U.S. could possibly restrict or prevent cryptocurrency mining and production from taking place in Iran. Or, to put this question differently, it would be instructive to consider just how much real power the U.S. government could potentially wield over Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.When it comes to technical ways of preventing cryptocurrency mining and use, Bitcoin and blockchain experts argue that this would be very difficult for even the U.S. government to achieve. As Bitcoin Core developer Jimmy Song explained to Cointelegraph, the success of such an endeavour would be unlikely, as every country in which mining takes place will have to get involved. According to Song:""A ban would require coordination on a massive scale, with every mining operation being compelled by their respective jurisdictions to not accept blocks that their governments ban. It's really difficult to do, as anyone anywhere can mine. They would need at least 51% of the network, though practically speaking, the number would have to be much higher, like 75%, to enforce this ban in a reasonably efficient way.""As Song concluded, ""Too much mining power is outside the U.S. and it's hard to prevent anything in a decentralized system."" This point is key, since the only realistic scenario in which the U.S. government could block cryptocurrency mining is if the activity took place only in the United States, as explained to Cointelegraph by Spencer Lievens, the CDOO of Duality Blockchain Solutions:“ISP providers can be required to block mining pools or anything related to mining. However, governments will have more luck in preventing mining in the countries they control than in preventing the mining of other, sovereign nations.” Thus, it's highly unlikely that America could prevent Bitcoin or cryptocurrency mining directly, as there's no way it could gain control of Iran’s internet or gather enough hash power to reject blocks originating from Iran. Similarly, Song also believes it's highly improbable that it could prevent Iran from developing and producing its own digital currency, largely because the Iranian government or central bank would control this currency's blockchain. ""Iran can produce its own digital currency anytime it wants and no one can stop it,"" he said.Other Bitcoin developers agree with Song's analysis, with fellow BTC developer Nicolas Dorier telling Cointelegraph in no uncertain terms, ""It is not possible to prevent mining."" However, both Song and Dorier agree that there are indirect ways of restricting cryptocurrency mining in Iran and of frustrating the Islamic Republic's attempts to profit from its own digital currency. For one, Dorier agrees that the U.S. could ""prevent American miner manufacturers like Bitfury from selling their products to Iran, but there are many other miner manufacturers (e.g. in China).""In much the same vein, Song adds that, while Iran could certainly produce its own currency without much harassment from the U.S. and its agencies, ""getting other people to accept that as a means of payment or getting them to store their wealth in it is another matter altogether.""In both cases, the issue once again turns to sanctions — something that the U.S. has already deployed in curtailing Venezuela's ability to make a success of the ill-fated Petro. The U.S. could certainly pass legislation or an executive order that prohibits American citizens from purchasing any Iranian digital currency, and such legislation could potentially also prohibit any kind of transaction with the Iranian cryptocurrency sector, thereby making it harder for Iranians to access mining equipment, for instance.Related: CBDCs of the World: The Benefits and Drawbacks of National Cryptos, According to Different JurisdictionsIn fact, this is indeed what the U.S. is attempting to do, as the ""Blocking Iran Illicit Finance Act"" — which is currently working its way through Congress — intends to make it very hard for Iranian crypto to exist. For instance, Section 303 of the act declares, ""All transactions related to, provision of financing for, and other dealings in Iranian digital currency by a United States person or within the United States are prohibited."" And the act doesn't stop with U.S. citizens. Section 304 states: ""The President shall impose 5 or more of the sanctions described in section 6(a) of the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 with respect to any foreign person that the President determines knowingly engages, on or after the date of the enactment of this Act, in a significant transaction for the sale, supply, or transfer to Iran of significant goods or services, or technological support, used in connection with the development of Iranian digital currency.""Put simply, the Blocking Iran Illicit Finance Act will prohibit any U.S. citizen or foreign person from buying an Iranian digital currency or helping with the development of this currency. This doesn't specifically address Bitcoin mining, but it's probable that there will be some jurisdictional overlap insofar as equipment sold to Iranians to mine Bitcoin could potentially be construed as being used in connection with the development of an Iranian cryptocurrency. As such, the act may have an impact on the production (i.e., mining) of Bitcoin in Iran — at least, to the extent that it prevents American mining manufacturers from selling relevant equipment to Iranian organizations.However, even if the act succeeds in preventing such manufacturers in most countries from selling mining units to Iran, even this might not prevent Bitcoin or cryptocurrency mining from taking place in the Islamic Republic. As Dorier put it, ""Manufacturing miners is a well-understood process, so if there is unmet demand somewhere, I don't think it would be too hard for a motivated entrepreneur to create or smuggle the supply."" Lievens added to this point:“There’s always a way around blockages. The US would have to control Iran’s digital infrastructure. With Iran seeing support from Russia, this is an unlikely scenario.”Indeed, if Iran is capable of building its own atomic weapons (as is often claimed), then it will certainly be capable of building its own ASIC chips and mining units. Then again, if the Blocking Iran Illicit Finance Act is passed, it will certainly find it much harder to profit from its own digital currency, with or without the ability to mine crypto. Just ask Venezuela."

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.","Market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.The sharp recovery from the lows led by Bitcoin was largely based on the pretext that institutional players had finally started to take greater interest in the asset class. The sharp uptick in Bitcoin futures volumes and increased demand for Grayscale Bitcoin Trust shares was thought to be indicative of this. However, Binance's chief executive Changpeng Zhao, in an interview with Bloomberg, said that there has been an equal growth in both institutional and retail trading. The retail traders still account for about 60% of trading volume at Binance, which shows that institutional trading growth “has not increased that tremendously in 2019 yet.""Strong opposition to Facebook’s Libra project and negative tweets by United States President Donald Trump gave reasons for bulls to book profits. Though some major altcoins have corrected close to their yearly lows, Bitcoin is still holding well above it. Hence, we are viewing the current fall as a buying opportunity. Should traders buy now or wait for lower levels? Let’s analyze the charts.Bitcoin (BTC) broke below the symmetrical triangle on July 14, which is a bearish sign. The 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI is just below 50, which suggests a balance between buyers and sellers. Currently, the BTC/USD pair is attempting to bounce off the 50-day SMA. The bulls will face stiff resistance at 20-day EMA but if they succeed in pushing the price above it, a rally to the resistance line of the triangle is probable.However, if the price reverses direction from the 20-day EMA and plummets below the 50-day SMA, it can drop to $8,900 and if that level also breaks down, the next support is way lower at $7451.63. As the pair has been strong and is still quoting above its 50-day SMA, we remain bullish on it. However, we will wait for the price to show signs of a turnaround before recommending a long position in it.The bulls could not push Ether (ETH) above 50-day SMA on July 12. The price turned down sharply and broke below the next support of $224.086. Currently, the digital currency is attempting to bounce off the uptrend line. The moving averages are on the verge of a bearish crossover, which shows that bears are back in the game. A breakdown of the uptrend line will be a negative sign that can result in a deeper correction to $160.Conversely, if bulls succeed in sustaining the price above $224.086, it will indicate demand at lower levels. Any rally will face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA. We will wait for the price to trade above $224.086 for a few days before suggesting a long position in it.Ripple (XRP) has been among the worst-performing major cryptocurrencies. It did not participate in the recovery and has fallen sharply when the sentiment turned negative. The next supports on the downside are at $0.27795 and below it at the yearly low of $0.24508. Both the moving averages have turned down and the RSI is close to oversold territory. This suggests that the bears are in command. A breakdown to new yearly lows will be a huge negative for the cryptocurrency.However, the XRP/USD pair has not closed (UTC time frame) below $0.27795 since mid-December last year. Hence, we anticipate buying close to the support. Any attempt to recover will face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA. We will wait for buyers interest to return in the pair before recommending a trade in it.Litecoin (LTC) has broken down of the ascending channel. It is currently bouncing off the next support of $83.65. The 20-day EMA is sloping down and the RSI is in oversold territory, which suggests bears are in the driver’s seat. If the digital currency breaks down of $83.65, it can drop to $66.Conversely, if the LTC/USD pair bounces off $83.650 and re-enters the channel, it will be a positive sign. Any recovery will face selling at the 20-day EMA. We will wait for the price to sustain inside the channel before suggesting a trade in it.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is in a downtrend. It is trading inside a descending channel. The 20-day EMA is sloping down and the RSI is close to oversold territory, which suggests the bears are in command. The bulls are currently attempting to keep the BCH/USD pair inside the channel. If successful, the price can move up to the resistance line of the channel. A breakout of the channel will be the first sign of a trend change. However, if the price breaks down of the channel, the next support is at $227.70. If this support also cracks, the correction can reach $166.98. EOS plunged below the first support of $4.4930 on July 14 and has bounced off the support at $3.8723. Both the moving averages have turned down and the RSI has dipped into the oversold zone, which shows that sellers have the advantage. If $3.8723 fails to provide support, the next stop might be $3. On the other hand, if the EOS/USD pair bounces off $3.8723, it can move up to 20-day EMA, which is likely to act as a stiff resistance. If the next pullback to $3.8723 holds, we might suggest a trade in it. Until then, we remain neutral on the cryptocurrency. The pullback in Binance Coin (BNB) reversed direction from the 20-day EMA and broke below the critical support of $28.7168. Currently, bulls are attempting to hold the uptrend line. Both the moving averages have completed a bearish crossover for the first time in 2019. This signals a likely change in trend. If the BNB/USD pair breaks down of the uptrend line and the descending channel, it will turn negative and can drop to the next support at $18.30. Conversely, if bulls defend the uptrend line, it will try to move up to the resistance line of the descending channel. A breakout of the moving averages will indicate strength. Though it has been one of the outperformers, we will wait for it to resume its up-move before proposing a trade in it.Bitcoin SV (BSV) broke below the descending channel and the critical support of $134.360 on July 14. When the price easily breaks through important support levels, it shows that sellers are in a hurry to get out and buyers are not willing to step in. This is a bearish sign. Both moving averages have completed a bearish crossover and the RSI has dipped into oversold territory. This shows that bears are in command. There is a minor psychological support at $100 and below that at $93.680, which is the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement of the rally. If both these supports give way, the BSV/USD pair can plummet to $50.030, a full 100% retracement of the rally. Any attempt to recover will face resistance at the 20-day EMA, which is sloping down. Tron (TRX) plunged below the trendline of the ascending channel on July 14. This is a bearish sign because this is the first instance when price has broken down of the trendline since the end of November last year. The 20-day EMA is sloping down and the RSI has dropped close to the oversold zone. This suggests bears are in command. The next support is at $0.022 and if that breaks, the fall can extend to $0.017. However, before that, we expect a retest of the breakdown level. If the bulls can push the price back inside the channel, the current breakdown will be considered as a bear trap. Nevertheless, if the price fails to stay inside the channel and turns down, it will confirm a downtrend. We will get a clear picture within the next few days. Until then, we suggest traders remain on the sidelines.Stellar (XLM) dipped below $0.085 but found support closer to $0.080. Hence, it might remain range-bound between $0.08 and $0.145. Both the moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is close to the oversold zone. This shows that bears have the upper hand. If the XLM/USD pair plunges below $0.080, it can retest the lows at $0.072545. A breakdown to new yearly lows will be very negative. However, with the $0.080–$0.085 support zone holding, bulls will try to keep the pair inside the range. The first resistance on the upside is at the 20-day EMA. A breakout of it will be a sign that the bulls are back in the game. Therefore, we suggest traders wait for the price to bounce off the support and rise above 20-day EMA before initiating a long position.Market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange."

merged mining, according to Binance Research. 26096 Total views.","Jul 12, 2019","The effect of block reward halvings for both Bitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin (BTC) mining could be mitigated by merged mining, according to a report by a research arm of major crypto exchange Binance released on July 12.","Following Charlie Lee’s prediction that some miners may shut down Litecoin mining after the halving, which is expected to take place on Aug. 5, 2019, Binance Research analyzed the potential of so-called merged mining to retain incentives for crypto miners.Merged mining is a practice of using the work done for one blockchain, or parent blockchain, on other smaller child blockchains by implementing auxiliary proof-of-work (AuxPoW). To date, there are three major examples of merged mining, including Bitcoin blockchain-parented Namecoin (NMC), Litecoin-merged Dogecoin (DOGE) and Myriadcoin (XMY), which is merged with both LTC and BTC.In the new report, Binance Research concluded that merged mining could potentially increase mining rewards in the light of future block reward halving scheduled for both Litecoin and Bitcoin. Alongside, other smaller chains could also potentially move to AuxPoW in order to support a higher level of network security while reducing the need for a separate mining set, the firm added.At the same time, Binance Research warned about the potential shortcomings of merged mining from both a miner’s and a project team’s perspectives. Miners may not be incentivized to support child blockchains due to a significant level of operations costs as well as a potential decline in the given coin’s market price.From the perspective of a project team working on a PoW crypto-asset, risks include dependency on the parent blockchain and new potential attack vectors.In the report, Binance Research also considered Dogecoin, which has been operating for about six years to date, as the most successful example of merged mining. After Dogecoin adopted the merged mining model in August 2014, the coin’s mining hashrate increased by 1,500% while also showing correlation with Litecoin’s hash rate. According to the report, almost 90% of Dogecoin’s total hash rate derives from large Litecoin mining pools as of July 2019.On July 5, Binance exchange listed Dogecoin on its crypto trading platform. On the same day, the exchange released its “2019 Q2 Crypto-Correlations Review,” stating that Dogecoin has become less correlated with other cryptos in Q2 2019, alongside with Bitcoin. However, the coin has continued to be significantly correlated with Litecoin, mostly due to the shared mining of two coins, the firm wrote.On July 9, mining difficulty of bitcoin has reached a new all-time high by hitting a 9.06 trillion at an average hash rate of 64.85 quintillions per second (EH/s)."

This shows that the sharp recovery from the lows is taking a breather. While the unveiling of Facebook’s Libra project was a major boost to cryptocurrencies, the recent opposition to it from various quarters has led to profit booking. While a number of altcoins have hit a rough patch and have given up the majority of their gains accrued over the past few weeks, Bitcoin is still looking strong. Hence, we view this fall as a buying opportunity. However, we do not suggest buying when the trend is down. Traders can wait for the price to stop falling and form a short-term bottom before initiating long positions.The rally after the current corrective phase will clearly separate the winners from the losers. We suggest traders look to buy cryptocurrencies that have held above their strong supports and are quick to bounce back from the fall. Let’s see if we spot any trading opportunities in the top five performers of the past seven days.A number of big names spoke against Bitcoin (BTC) in the past week. The most important statement was from United States president Donald Trump who said that he was not a fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as he believed that it was not money, highly volatile and its value was “based on thin air.” However, the crypto community took this statement as a huge positive because it gave wide publicity to the asset class and showed that it has become so important that the U.S. president would comment on it.The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that no one used Bitcoin for payments and it was only a “speculative store of value like gold.” The European Central Bank also voiced its opposition and said that Bitcoin was not a currency but a volatile asset, hence, it did not have any plans to add Bitcoin to its reserves.On the other hand, Chamath Palihapitiya, CEO of VC firm Social Capital, said that Bitcoin is the best hedge against the traditional financial system. Similarly, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust showed a considerable inflow of funds. This shows that while the central banks and world leaders continue to voice their opposition to Bitcoin, it is finding a place in the portfolio of large investors. So, should traders buy now or wait for lower levels? Let’s find out.The recovery in the BTC/USD pair hit a barrier at $13,156.96 and turned down from there. It can now correct to the first support of $9,781.81, which is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the recent rally. If this support holds, it will indicate that bulls are not willing to wait for lower levels to buy, which is a positive sign. The next rally is likely to retest $13,973.50.On the other hand, if bears sink the price below $9,871.81, the next support is at the 50% retracement level of $8,604.80. The 20-week EMA is also close to it, hence, we expect a rebound from one of the supports.As the RSI is still in overbought territory, the pair might not run up in a hurry. It might consolidate for a few weeks before resuming the up-move. We will wait for the price to complete the correction and show signs of a turnaround before suggesting a trade in it.Chain Link (Link) announced a collaboration with IoTeX on oracle research and development to provide real-world data to blockchain applications. It also tied up with Ampleforth and Neblio in the past seven days. The sharp rally in the LINK/USD pair could not sustain above $4. In the past two weeks, the pair corrected to $2.60, which is just above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $2.4465. As the RSI is still deep in overbought territory, we expect the price to enter into a range for a few weeks.Contrary to our assumption, if bears sink the digital currency below $2.4665, it can drop to $1.9671, which is the 61.80% Fibonacci retracement of the rally. A breakdown of this support will be a negative move. We suggest traders wait for the formation of a clear range before initiating long positions.Though Monero (XMR) fell over 10% in the past seven days, it was the third-best performer. It has been a consistent performer in the past few weeks. Can it keep up the momentum and move up or will it enter a corrective phase? Let’s look at the charts.  Contrary to our assumption, the rebound in the XMR/USD pair hit a wall at $108.840. The price has turned down sharply and is retesting the critical support at $81. This is a bearish sign. Both the moving averages and the horizontal support are located at this level, hence, we anticipate a strong defense by the bulls. If successful, we might see another attempt by the bulls to propel the price towards $120.However, if the digital currency plunges below $81, it can drop to the next support at $60.147. Both the moving averages are flat and the RSI is close to the midpoint, which suggests consolidation in the short term. The traders can retain the stop loss on the long positions at $78.The world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced the launch of margin trading with its 2.0 platform. Though margin trading is risky, with proper risk management, it can be a boon to the experienced trader. Novices, however, should stay away from margin trading. The exchange announced support to additional pairs on its fiat-enabled trading platform in Singapore. Its research arm said that merged mining can mitigate the effects of halvings for Bitcoin and Litecoin. How does Binance Coin’s (BNB) chart look?The BNB/USD pair continues to be strong with both the moving averages sloping up and the RSI still in the positive territory. The bulls held the first support of $28.7168 during the week, which is also a positive sign. They will now attempt a recovery from the current levels. If the support holds, the pair might remain range-bound for a few weeks.However, if the rebound fizzles out and the pair plunges below $28.7168, it can correct to the uptrend line. The 20-week EMA is also located at this level, hence, we expect the bulls to defend this support. Traders can watch this level closely and initiate long positions on a strong bounce off it, but should stay away if this support cracks.Stellar (XLM) again climbed back into the list of top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization in the past week. The list of winners of the first Stellar Community Fund was announced on July 9. Can the digital currency maintain its spot in the top ten or will it correct and lose its spot?The XLM/USD pair has dropped to the bottom of $0.0850–$0.1450 range. The 20-week EMA has started to slope down and the RSI is back in the negative territory, which suggests that the bears are back in action. A breakdown of the range can result in a retest of the lows. The pair will become very negative if the bears sink the price to new yearly lows. However, if the price rebounds off the support of $0.085, bulls will attempt to push it back towards the top of the range at $0.01450. Traders should wait for the price to show a strong bounce before entering a trade in it.The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. "

The mob was likely a collection of victims who lost money through Bitcoin Wallet, according to a report by local newspaper Ladysmith Gazette on July 10. ","The local police have been investigating an unnamed Ponzi Scheme in Ladysmith, as reported by major South African news site IOL. According to the report, however, Bitcoin Wallet minimally appears to have made get-rich-quick promises to prospective investors.An unnamed community member reportedly told the publication that Bitcoin Wallet promised to double investors’ money within a matter of weeks: “From what we have heard, Bitcoin Wallet is an investment, not a pyramid scheme. [...] He (the owner) has spoken in the media, that he invests the money in bitcoins and is able to double that money within three hours. [...] If you put in an amount of R100000, you get back an amount of R200000 in 15 days.”As per an earlier announcement, Sgumza told Ladysmith Gazette, just five days prior to the arson event, that he was simply a manager, without knowledge or power over the company’s alleged back-end troubles:“I don’t know what’s going on. I don’t know online or how this system works. I have to be workshopped. The owner of the company is operating the online business. I was only the manager of the Ladysmith branch.”Sgumza further claimed that he himself lost money and was now out of a job:“I won’t continue working. I don’t have cash anymore. The owner says people must go online and collect their money online. I, myself, have invested my money in there. I submitted my banking details online and now I am also waiting.”Tensions have reportedly been high in the area, with a communications officer receiving complaints about crowds, public disturbance, and traffic congestion. Moreover, clients reportedly engaged in a scuffle when Bitcoin Wallets staff turned them away while they tried to enter the company offices.Sgumza reportedly said in a radio interview on July 9 that Bitcoin Wallets customers were being defrauded by a presumably unrelated scam. The scam reportedly targeted people who were creditors of Bitcoin Wallets, saying they needed to log onto a website to collect their funds. As reported by Cointelegraph on July 2, South Africa was trading Bitcoin at almost $11,000 on the crypto exchange Luno, which was 10.5% higher than Cointelegraph’s price index at the time. Adamant Capital partner Tuur Demeester, however, cautioned that the listed price likely represents “inflation that is simply not recognized by the government.”"

Trump remarked that the value of crypto is “highly volatile and based on thin air” and that they can “facilitate unlawful behavior.”According to Mnuchin, the Treasury has stressed — to Facebook and Bitcoin (BTC) users among others — that digital financial services are bound by the same Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism policies as traditional institutions such as banks.Additionally, he said that any crypto transmitters must comply with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN): a bureau of the Treasury. FinCEN is the federal regulator that implements the BSA in practice, and has authority over all money service transmitters — including cryptocurrency projects such as Libra.Mnuchin also established the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s Working Group on Digital Assets, which reportedly includes key regulatory players such as the SEC, CFTC, and the Fed in addition to FinCEN. The idea of this group is to mitigate purported regulatory risks associated with cryptocurrencies."

At the start of this year, it was reported that RBI had paused its plans to issue its own central bank digital currency.Meanwhile, Facebook is alleged to have withheld from applying to RBI for approval for its forthcoming Libra token, in light of the country’s rumored consideration of a complete prohibition of cryptocurrencies and long history of crypto-adversarial actions. This June, RBI has denied it has any knowledge or involvement in the drafting of such a prohibition by the government."

Specifically, the FDD analyzed how countries such as Russia, China, Venezuela and Iran are deploying digital currency technology, and in what way this phenomenon could influence United States sanctions in future.In the report, the FDD warns against a scenario in which one of the above countries convinces other nations to use a state-based cryptocurrency based on a major commodity export such as oil, sanctions would be much harder to enforce. Another scenario of concern would arise if an adversary were to make progress in the creation of digital currency wallet infrastructure in which its citizens can hold and trade the cryptocurrency, as well as use it for transactions with local companies.The report further cautions against a U.S. adversary’s success with blockchain technology in its domestic banking system to a degree that it can integrate its platform into other nations’ financial system sectors. The FDD also identified the following threat:“An independent cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin [BTC] gains wide adoption in commerce and becomes more relevant to the global financial system. Then, a U.S. adversary begins to build significant reserves in the cryptocurrency. The state thus uses its holdings to gain more influence in the global financial system.”Meanwhile, Russian parliament, the State Duma, has again postponed the adoption of the country’s major crypto bill “On Digital Financial Assets” until the autumn session as officials have not been able to reach a common position on the fate of digital currencies in Russia.China’s central bank is reportedly developing its own digital currency in response to Facebook’s Libra, as the latter could purportedly pose a threat to the country’s financial system. Notably, the bank’s plans come at a time when China has taken a hard line toward cryptocurrency trading, with financial institutions banning Bitcoin trading, initial coin offerings and crypto exchanges.In mid-May, Cointelegraph reported that Venezuela was considering to close mutual trade settlements with Russia using the ruble, as well as Venezuela’s oil-backed Petro digital currency, a controversial project that was first launched in February 2018.In Iran, purchasing and selling cryptocurrencies is illegal, as deputy governor for new technologies at the Central Bank of Iran Nasser Hakimi announced. On July 6, Iranian Assistant Minister of Industry, Trade, and Supply stated that the United States Congress was working to stop Iran’s access to crypto and Bitcoin mining in an attempt to prevent evasion of sanctions."

The announcement reveals that version 2.0 of Binance also features “an advanced trading engine for better order matching and press indexes for margin level calculations to enable lower liquidations.”The exchange has launched a specialized so-dubbed Margin Wallet, from which funds can be moved to the primary Binance Wallet without fees. Full details of users’ choice of collaterals, marginable assets and pairs have been released, extending across six cryptos: Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), XRP, Binance Coin (BNB), Tron (TRX), and Tether (USDT).As previously reported, Binance had first pledged margin trading in the feature rollout section of its white paper — claiming it would be implemented after spot trading yet before futures. Even ahead of Zhao’s disclosure, commentators noted changes to the exchange’s public Application Programming Interface (API) revealing the platform’s progress with the feature’s development.This February, major Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange OKEx added four new margin trading pairs to its platform with up to 100x leverage.

As the crypto community is bidding farewell to the regulator’s outgoing head, J. Christopher Giancarlo, his successor’s stance on digital assets remains unknown. Turning to Tarbert’s record as a civil servant and attorney in the financial markets field could shed some light on the direction that the agency might take under his leadership.","Giancarlo’s five-year tenure saw the rise of cryptocurrency derivatives as an object of regulatory oversight. Widely regarded as the crypto industry’s ally, “Crypto Dad” superintended the historic launch of regulated Bitcoin futures and advocated for a “do no harm” approach to blockchain regulation in his testimony before the U.S. Congress. At the same time, as some observers have pointed out, Giancarlo has stepped up enforcement efforts, turning the CFTC into an agency with teeth.The news of President Donald Trump nominating Tarbert, a senior official in the Treasury Department, to serve as the new head of the CFTC emerged in December 2018. On June 5, 2019, the Senate voted to confirm his appointment by a wide margin, 84-9. Although Giancarlo’s tenure expired in April 2019, he agreed to stay until mid-July to oversee the agency’s transition to new leadership. In a statement, the outgoing chairman offered praise to his heritor, calling him highly qualified to continue transforming the agency “into a 21st Century regulator for today’s digital markets.”A native of Baltimore, MD, Heath Tarbert received his bachelor’s degree in accounting and international business from Mount St. Mary, a Catholic liberal arts university located in his home state. He then spent four years in law school at the Ivy League University of Pennsylvania, consecutively earning his Juris Doctor and Doctor of Juridical Science. Tarbert then received the Thouron Award, a prestigious postgraduate scholarship that allowed him to pursue yet another advanced degree: a Ph.D. in comparative law from Oxford.Having sealed this illustrious scholarly record, Tarbert began his industry career with a series of junior positions at law firms and clerkships in the judicial branch of the U.S. government. Between 2007 and 2008, he worked for the conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. This appointment likely played a significant role in Tarbert’s subsequent return to public service in the wake of Trump’s accession to the White House. According to one estimate, about 20% of Thomas office’s alumni have landed either political appointments or judicial nominations since early 2017, earning their former boss the informal status of “the Trump administration’s legal godfather.”Upon concluding his clerkship with Justice Thomas, Heath Tarbert went on to serve as Associate Counsel to the President of the United States in the last months of the George W. Bush administration before leaving for the private sector early into Barack Obama’s first term, with a short stop as Special Counsel to the Senate Banking Committee. Tarbert worked for the international law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP and then Allen & Overy LLP, where he spearheaded the global financial regulatory practice.Tarbert also served on the board of advisors for the the journal “Review of Securities and Commodities Regulation.” During his years in the private sector, he co-authored two articles that appeared in the journal “The Review of Banking & Financial Services.” Both are on the subject of the Volcker Rule, a regulation that restricts banks’ ability to use customers’ deposits to make certain kinds of speculative investments.In April 2017, President Trump announced his intent to nominate Tarbert to fill the position of Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for International Markets and Development. In October, the nominee was sworn in. In 2017 and 2018, Tarbert served as acting U.S. executive director on the board of the World Bank Group, negotiating global institutional reforms. In April 2019, Tarbert was promoted to acting under secretary for international affairs.Throughout his term with the Treasury, Tarbert represented the U.S. in several major international organizations in the area of financial markets regulation, such as the Financial Stability Board. He also led U.S. delegations at the G-7 and G-20 Finance Ministers’ and Central Bank Governors’ Deputies meetings. As policy chair of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), Tarbert championed the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, a bill aimed at strengthening regulation of foreign investment in the U.S. so as to better protect national security.The latter aspect of Tarbert’s Treasury career has been arguably the most publicly visible. As the CFIUS policy chair, he promoted the heightened review of foreign investments before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs and the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection, during which time he called for tighter standards for protecting the nation’s technological edge:“Today, the acquisition of a Silicon Valley start-up may raise just as serious concerns from a national security perspective as the acquisition of a defense or aerospace company, CFIUS’s traditional area of focus.”The bill enjoyed bipartisan support and was passed by the U.S. Congress in August 2018.One practical manifestation of this turn toward curbing foreign powers’ attempts to get a hold of the U.S-sourced technology has been the Trump administration’s standoff with China. Tarbert was at the helm of this effort as well: It was him who announced in April 2018 that the government was considering invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to give Trump the power to limit Chinese investment in sensitive sectors of the U.S. economy.Domestically, following his nomination as the CFTC chairman, Tarbert managed to muster support from across the industry that is perhaps the most dependent on the health of derivatives markets: the agricultural sector. In the buildup to the confirmation vote, many agricultural groups appeared as signatories on a letter to the U.S. Senate endorsing Tarbert for the regulator’s leadership. Particularly, the petition noted Tarbert’s willingness to walk the extra mile to learn the ins and outs of a brand new industry and its use of derivatives products.The new CFTC boss is inheriting a lot of work in progress: the impact of Brexit on international financial markets, another round in the fight for U.S. financial sovereignty in the face of the European Union seeking to impose new regulations on international swaps clearing houses and much more. The crypto derivatives agenda, which emerged as a major concern for the agency during Giancarlo’s term, is not going anywhere, either. Some matters — for example, Bakkt’s continued attempts to get regulatory clearance for its cryptocurrency futures platform — will require prompt decisions. What will these decisions look like? The evidence of where Heath Tarbert’s might stand on digital assets is piecemeal and scant.Given his enormous experience with international financial regulation, there is no way Tarbert would not realize the importance of digital technologies to derivatives markets. However, every such attestation available is accompanied by the usual cautious acknowledgement of both “opportunities and risks.” In a statement before the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry in March 2019, he said:“We should acknowledge that our derivatives markets have recently been transformed by digital technologies that present opportunities as well as risks. The CFTC must remain committed to promulgating regulations that allow technological innovations to flourish, but also protect our markets and consumers from harm.”In June, commenting on the new U.S-United Kingdom Financial Innovation Partnership, Tarbert observed that “technology is the future of financial services and innovation drives growth.”Granted, these stock declarations are far from a ringing endorsement of fintech’s role in the area of the CFTC’s oversight. However, signs of formal acknowledgement are better than no signs at all. The takeaway from Tarbert’s history of fighting for U.S. national technological security is also rather ambiguous: His determination to assist domestic blockchain innovators could lead him to rid them of unnecessary regulatory hurdles, but at the same time, the cross-border nature of digital assets may trigger security concerns.Some experts argue that the personal opinions of the CFTC chair might not be of immense importance to the crypto industry. Andrew Bull, a founding partner of BullBlockchainLaw, told Cointelegraph:“Giancarlo is favorable towards the crypto industry, but this has not really impacted how the industry functions. In other words, the compliance requirements have not changed much as applied to crypto even though he was favorable to the industry. Anyways, the agency is not nearly as involved in the crypto industry as the SEC is, but has stated through guidance that crypto based derivatives without a doubt fall under the Act. Therefore, my conclusion is that not much will change, especially due to the lack of activity the CFTC actually has in the space.”Regardless of personal factors, the CFTC holds great systemic importance for the blockchain sector’s development. Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner at Nexo, attested:“Any major move of the CFTC is a milestone in the financialization of the digital assets sector. [...] A firm but business-friendly regulatory framework paves the way for the institutional players in the crypto space and we already see this happening with Fidelity providing custodial services, traditional banking institutions such as Nomura, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan are exploring offerings in the same direction. A regulated and above all liquid derivative market is a great signal with a permanent impact to retail and institutional investors that technology and cryptocurrencies built on blockchain are maturing into an asset class worth exploring.”After all, the agency’s regulatory powers are vast. The CFTC has identified digital currencies as commodities in 2015, and now it has full jurisdiction over crypto derivatives and other financial products subject to the Commodity Exchange Act. These include futures, options and derivatives contracts, as well as any crypto-based trading platform that utilizes margins, leverages or financing. Although the spot markets (in which commodities are traded in cash) underlying these instruments are outside of the commission’s purview, the CFTC has the authority to intervene if it believes fraud or manipulation are involved, which renders the scope very broad. The hope is that, as he takes the reins of the regulatory agency that is immensely important for the blockchain sector, Heath Tarbert would act so as to earn the honorable title of “Crypto Dad” as well, despite what President Trump may have to say."

Ron Paul delivered his remarks in a “Squawk Alley” interview on CNBC on July 15.,"According to Paul, cryptocurrencies are a great idea, and governments should only step in to regulate the space to prevent fraud:“I’m for the least amount of regulation. I don’t know what’s gonna happen to cryptocurrencies. I think it’s a great idea. And I only have one rule: no fraud […] I think that the government has a role. And somebody has a case that there is fraud, I think it should be investigated […]  What I want to do is legalize the freedom of choice, absent blatant fraud.”Ron Paul also drew several comparisons to the traditional asset gold. One way in which Paul appears to think gold is similar to crypto is that both are assets competing with fiat money. Paul said, “governments aren’t very tolerant of competition, and they’re not even tolerant with using the Constitution to compete with the fiat dollar. Because gold and silver, you can’t use it.”Ron Paul has previously discussed his bullish views on cryptocurrency. In 2014, Paul expressed concerns about the backing of Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto in general, but adopted a pro-crypto attitude that is bearish on fiat money in the long run:“I just don’t think the dollar is going to last. I don’t think any fiat currency lasts forever. They all self-destruct. Right now, the world is engulfed with fiat currency; they’re all paper currencies. That’s one of the other reasons the dollar holds up: What are you competing against, the euro and the yen? The competition out there isn’t any good.”"

If a big percentage does that, then blocks will slow down for some time. For litecoin it’s three and a half days before the next change, so possibly like seven days of slower blocks, and then after that, the difficulty will readjust and everything will be fine.”Given that the reduction of mining rewards reduces the cryptocurrency’s supply, anticipation of the halving is generally thought to be accompanied by a corresponding price appreciation — but Lee gave a more nuanced perspective of how supply, demand and market sentiment interrelate:“In terms of the price, the halvening should be priced in because everyone knows about it since the beginning. But the thing is people kind of expect the price to go up. So a lot of people are buying in because they expect the price to go up and that’s kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy. So, because they’re buying in, the price does actually go up.”As Mickey notes, Litecoin’s last halving — back in August 2015 — saw the coin peaking in early July of that year, going on to lose almost 50% in value by the time of the block rewards reduction — and hitting a 75% in the halving’s aftermath.To press time, Litecoin is reporting an almost 36% gain on its 3-month chart, but remains almost 67% down from its all-time highs in December 2017, according to Coin360 data. LTC 3-month price chart.

Stein said:“The hope is that now that there is going to be a requirement to register and comply, and oversight by FinTRAC, that banks and other financial entities are going to be more open to providing services to and dealing with virtual-currency businesses.”However, Stein points out that some international exchanges may not be willing to comply with the new Canadian rules. Some other experts reportedly agree, saying that having mandatory regulation requirements could result in cryptocurrency exchanges opting to exit from the Canadian marketplace.The CEO of blockchain startup Bitaccess, Moe Adham, told The Globe and Mail, “I expect to see a number of firms relocate outside of Canada, as well as international firms limiting access to Canadians.”The new regulatory policies may also drive crypto exchange customers away, some say. “This has the potential to drive cryptocurrency underground again,"" said Canadian crypto exchange Coinsquare’s AML officer, Charlene Cieslik.

Trading will be disabled entirely on July 24. Veil co-founder Paul Fletcher-Hill recommended that users redeem open positions, withdraw positions from active markets, and withdraw Veil Ether and convert it to Ether. Veil was a type of extension to the Ethereum-based predictions market Augur. Augur is a predictions market — that still exists — that uses smart contracts to let users create and bet on the outcome of any event with the cryptocurrency Ether. For instance, the top three bets listed on the Augur market, at press time, are “Will Novak Djokovic be the 2019 Wimbledon Men's Singles winner?,” “Who will Win the The First Democratic Primary Debate?,” and “Will Serena Williams be the 2019 Wimbledon Women's Singles winner?”In April, Augur also added the option to use the stablecoin by MakerDAO, DAI, on its platform.According to its website, Veil was intended to “bring Augur mainstream” and improve user experience by speeding up its transaction processes. Veil purportedly let users trade on the Augur marketplace faster via the 0x protocol, and provided instant settlement by allowing users to sell their shares to Veil before native finalization of Augur transactions on the blockchain.In discussing the reasons Veil did not meet its success goals,  Fletcher-Hill noted a number of issues, including that the platform may not have been friendly enough to crypto novices:“We didn’t offer a good onboarding experience. Crypto as a user base is still early, and we didn’t make it easy enough for users without crypto or a wallet to get started.”Some other areas of concern he noted include not being decentralized, not being regulated, and perhaps trying to offer too many options as a broad-scale predictions market. Fletcher-Hill wrote:“ultimately we failed to find a good fit between what we were building and the market as it exists today. … But today the community of users is small, and we think there are higher impact products and services we can build for the immediate future.”As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Augur came under fire from Reddit and major crypto exchange Binance due to having an apparent design flaw. The flaw apparently allows users to run scams, of sorts, by issuing predictions with unclear or contradictory conditions for resolution.Binance also said that low liquidity, barebones functionality, complex mechanics, and an unclear approach to governance were additional issues it saw with Augur."

CoinDesk reports that Coinbase and Aon see the insurance subsidiary as a potential solution to the alleged shortage of insurance available to cryptocurrency exchanges.Per the report, crypto exchanges often set aside some crypto assets to cover any asset losses in the event of a hack. Still, this approach lacks a formal structure and allows the firm to access the funds also for any other reason, decreasing the coverage. With a captive insurance firm, on the other hand, the funds are regulated, audited, and segregated.While neither Aon or Coinbase have allegedly answered to the outlet’s inquiry concerning their collaboration, the insurance giant reportedly revealed that it established the industry’s first insurance captive this year, for an unnamed client. Managing director and the financial institutions practice leader at Aon, Jacqueline Quintal, noted that cryptocurrency exchanges are increasingly considering this solution. Quintal said: “There is a lack of capacity and some are uncomfortable with what is available in the marketplace and are looking to alternative solutions. [...] I think the path for most will be to buy some amount of traditional insurance first and then to explore alternative structures, potentially including a captive — and we are having more and more of these conversations.”Previously, in April, it has been reported that Coinbase revealed details of its insurance coverage for its hot wallet crypto holdings, reportedly covering a $255 million limit via a Lloyd’s of London-registered broker.As Cointelegraph reported last month, Aon will reportedly provide crypto custody solutions provider Metaco with crime insurance coverage via a panel of London insurers."

CROWDLITOKEN AG is thus a pioneer for new financial innovations. The Security Token Offering (STO) is now running in European countries. By using blockchain technology, qualified and retail investors are enabled to invest in first-class real estate in Europe. Also the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) has confirmed that no special regulatory approval is needed to market this new class of digital assets in Switzerland.","The company CROWDLITOKEN AG, based in Triesen/Liechtenstein, is launching a security token that combines the advantages of direct and indirect real estate investments. CEO Domenic Kurt comments: “This represents an evolution in the world of financial products. New technologies are enabling us to launch a first-class product that not only offers new investment opportunities, but also remedies inefficiencies, cuts costs and safeguards transparency.” In concrete terms, the product is a digital representation of a subordinated bond, whereby both the bond as well as the underlying real estate is digitised via blockchain. The token – named the “CRT” – replicates the income streams and the value changes of the real estate properties. Holders of the tokens can select their properties to invest in and thereby tailor their own portfolio. They will benefit from an attractive yield of 5–7% p.a. The ability to invest small amounts in selected European real estate, the easy tradability on digital stock exchanges (in preparation) and the investment flexibility are key innovative features of this unique real estate investment product. The STO is divided into several phases. The private sale for the first 10 million tokens, which is open to all types of investors, is currently underway with a discount of 25% (equivalent to CHF 0.75 per token, 1 CRT = CHF 1.00). This is followed by the pre-public sale (20%) and public sale (10%). The minimum investment in all these phases is 100 CHF each. CROWDLITOKEN AG targets to raise 100 million tokens through the STO, the funds will be used to build up the real estate portfolio. CROWDLITOKEN’s clear goal is to bring real estate investments into the digital era by using blockchain technology and thus democratise access to the market. For more information, please visit crowdlitoken.com.CROWDLITOKEN AG is a Liechtenstein-based start-up that provides investors with access to European core real estate via blockchain technology. This is based on real estate-linked security tokens – termed “CRTs” – i.e. a digital representation of a bond that returns a yield equating to 5–7% p.a. CRTs are fully compliant and combine the advantages of direct and indirect real estate investments."

Blockchain-Based Platform Says. The Evolution of Bitcoin's Technology Stack.","Jul 10, 2019","While we often get to hear about how cryptocurrency adoption is rapidly gaining ground in the West, a number of countries across the Middle East — such as Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia — often tend to get overlooked, despite them having made tremendous strides when it comes to establishing regulatory frameworks that are geared toward the optimal utilization of this burgeoning asset class.","For example, a recent report by Asia Times has revealed that the UAE is one of the few nations in the world where the local government has placed special emphasis on promoting the use of crypto. In this regard, we can see that over the first quarter of 2019, UAE-based blockchain startups were able to raise a total of $210 million — thereby putting the Gulf nation at the apex of the world’s top-10 token sale list, even surpassing countries like the United States and the United Kingdom. What is most surprising is that just over a year ago, the UAE didn't even make it on this list, thus proving that the onset of this recent crypto wave throughout the Middle East is somewhat of a recent phenomenon. In the same breath, it is also worth pointing out that the U.S. has now slid from the number one spot to sixth in the aforementioned crypto funding list, primarily because the nation’s lawmakers have adopted a somewhat confusing stance toward the digital asset industry as a whole. On the subject, Alex Buelau, the CEO of CoinSchedule, tends to agree with the notion that, due to a number of regulatory concerns, more and more companies are moving away from the U.S. in favor of more hospitable regions such as the Cayman Islands, Singapore, etc. Related: US a Crypto Exchange Scarecrow — What Needs to Change?Not only that, Buelau also pointed out that, owing to the heavy-footed approach that countries such as China and India have adopted toward their local crypto markets, it appears as though the Middle East is now primed to lead the way for crypto adoption across Asia.Lastly, according to reports, the Ethereum Foundation has recently been trying to make its way into the Gulf altcoin market by cooperating with financial experts. If successful, the organization could possibly help push partnerships with other established crypto firms in the coming future.As many of our regular readers may be well aware of, Bahrain has made a lot of “under the radar,” crypto-friendly moves since the start of 2019 — with the nation’s central banking authority introducing an economic framework earlier this February that covers a host of rules related to the digital asset domain. On this recent development, Khalid Hamad, an executive director at the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB), was quoted as saying:“The CBBs introduction of the rules relating to crypto assets are in line with its goal to develop comprehensive rules for the fintech ecosystem supporting Bahrain’s position as a leading financial hub in the Middle East and North Africa”Additionally, the Bahraini government was also involved in a joint crypto pilot venture along with Saudi Arabia and the UAE so as to help increase local awareness about blockchain technology as well as make cross-border payments between these countries more streamlined and hassle-free.In a similar vein, Saudi Arabia is another nation that is also making use of blockchain technology to facilitate its international monetary transfers. For example, as per the announcement made by the Saudi British Bank (SABB) at the beginning of this year, the financial institution has partnered with California-based blockchain firm Ripple to launch an instant cross-border transfer service for its clients. Not only that, even the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) is making use of a blockchain-based remittance system to facilitate transactions between various banks located within Saudi and the UAE.Another recent phenomenon that seems to be attracting attention is that established crypto entities are turning to the Middle East in order to acquire investments for their envisioned projects. For example, it recently came to light that the Ethereum Foundation was partnering with finance experts from the Persian Gulf in order to showcase the compatibility of their blockchain ecosystem with existing Islamic rules and regulations — sharia in particular.This is probably the first time a big-name crypto organization has taken such a step to secure a large-scale investment from the region’s financial elites. On the subject, Ethereum Foundation’s head of special projects, Virgil Griffith, was quoted as saying:“My job is to keep rolling dice. Probably nothing will happen. But there’s a hypothetical case where say, the Saudi sovereign wealth fund invests, like, a trillion dollars [in Ethereum projects], which would be a real boon. That would be really great.”Not only that, there are also firms like Houston-based Data Gumbo that have been successful in creating a blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) platform that is now being used by various offshore drilling firms situated in the Gulf region. Through its Series A equity funding round, Data Gumbo was able to raise a sizeable sum of $6 million from the Saudi Arabian national petroleum and natural gas company Saudi Aramco and leading Norewegian energy operator Equinor.Also in a conversation with Cointelegraph, Matthew J. Martin, founder and CEO of Blossom Finance, said:“The DIFC (Dubai International Financial Center) with its FinTech Hive is attracting many interesting ventures. Since DIFC companies are allowed 100% foreign ownership, it's a solid option for many international teams looking for either their primary jurisdiction, or as a primary base to support operations regionally. The acquisition of Souq by Amazon was also great validation of the exit potential for investors, and this will likely increase the volume of venture capital pouring in. With the strong public sector support for blockchain projects we're seeing in the UAE, it's likely that more international teams will chose the DIFC to incorporate.”It is worth pointing out that there is an overarching issue that the Gulf oil and gas industry is currently facing in the form of data inconsistency. This is because niche measurements related to the weight, speed, delivery time, volume, etc. of crude oil are interpreted differently by various operators, service providers and suppliers. This not only results in tangible work-related delays but also causes large-scale payment disputes among all of the member parties. Data Gumbo’s aforementioned platform minimizes such issues through the use of its BaaS network and smart contract technology, as it allows participating firms to obtain automated calculations on their invoice line items in real time. This enables important transactions to take place in a transparent manner. On the future potential of Data Gumbo’s BaaS-enabled platform, the company’s CEO, Andrew Bruce, noted:“We enabled the first application of blockchain technology in the offshore drilling industry and will continue to break new ground with applications of BaaS to improve the bottom line of companies of all sizes. Blockchain will have a major impact on the oil and gas industry — and all global industries — and we will lead the charge in its broad adoption for sweeping operational improvements.”ADNOC: The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), which is the UAE’s largest oil firm, recently collaborated with IBM to devise a novel blockchain-based automated system to keep a close eye on the financial values of each transaction taking place between its operating members. Additionally, the new platform has been built atop Hyperledger and makes use of the IBM’s native Cloud computing technology.S&P Global Platts: The world-renowned energy and commodities information provider released a blog post recently announcing its decision to create a blockchain network that would allow market participants to provide the Fujairah Oil Industry Zone (FOIZ) with weekly inventory oil storage reports in a highly streamlined manner. FOIZ currently lays claim to the title of being the Middle East’s biggest commercial storage region for refined oil products.NBAD: The National Bank of Abu Dhabi (NBAD) signed an agreement with Ripple back in 2017 in order to make use of the firm’s various blockchain offerings. The entire point of this exercise for NBAD was to streamline its monetary transactions and make international payments more accessible for its customers.Even though a number of novel blockchain projects have emerged from across the Middle East over the past year or so, various roadblocks that are preventing many Western firms from capitalizing on this untapped market segment still exist. For starters, the issue of shaira compliance is preventing various big-name companies from accessing the $3.4 trillion market simply because their operational protocols do not adhere to existing Islamic law. But it is not as if Gulf nations such as Saudi Arabia, Oman, the UAE are not interested in making use of blockchain tech, as just last year, the crown prince of Dubai has announced that the city was going to deploy a blockchain-based administration system by 2020 that will allow the local government to digitize the ID, tax and registry details of its citizens and will store the data on a blockchain network.Related: From Qatar to Palestine: How Cryptocurrencies Are Regulated in the Middle EastWith that being said, the Islamic banking sector at large is still holding on to its skeptical view of blockchain because most financial institutions operating within the region adhere to certain long-held traditions that are in direct conflict with the way Western banks work. For example, sharia law prohibits the lending of money using a fixed interest rate model (Riba) — a common practice used by many banks across the world. However, since crypto and blockchain makes use of a fractionalized ownership framework, it is possible to make money lending complaint with the Islamic way of doing things. In the same way, sharia also prohibits monetary transactions that are ambiguous in nature (i.e., deals that do not have defined legal boundaries). In this regard, smart contracts can be quite useful, as they clearly outline the terms and conditions of a particular exchange beforehand — thereby leaving no scope for future uncertainty.As the global crypto economy continues to evolve, it seems as though established players such as the Ethereum Foundation and Ripple will continue to try to tap into the Gulf market because of the amazing monetary potential it offers. Cointelegraph recently got in touch with Atif Yaqub — an executive partner at UKP Assets — who is of the belief that, as we move into the future, the Middle East will start playing an ever-increasing role in shaping the digital currency landscape. According to Yaqub:“As the Gulf nations move to diversify from their oil based economies, there is a huge drive in tech investment. There has been much interest in Blockchain and Crypto companies on the State and private level.”   Similarly, while elaborating on the topic of how foreign firms are reaching out to Gulf states for ties, partnerships and money, he added:“The Gulf offers untapped growth opportunities and entry to the wider region. Pursuing comprehensive Shariah certification for a network, like Ethereum has been doing, lifts many barriers to entry. This just expands the use cases and audience.”Last but not least, with Facebook’s Libra coin all set to enter the altcoin market in the near future, it will be interesting to how crypto adoption spreads throughout the Middle East — especially considering that the social media juggernaut has a little over 265.4 million active users spread across the region."

While other firms have previously taken advantage of Regulation A+ funding, this marks the first time that investors will receive a token, rather than shares in the company.Regulation A+ is an initial public offering (IPO) alternative geared towards startups in need of early funding. Regulation A+ funding was introduced in 2012 via the “Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act.” As the report says, any member of the public can partake in a Regulation A+ funding round.While Regulation A+ has more lenient disclosure obligations than as with an IPO, it has two tiers with hard caps on raised funds, maxing out at $50 million within a 12-month period.This is possibly a precedent-setting moment for the crypto space, as per the report. Initial coin offerings (ICOs) have been on the decline. Crypto firms raised billions of dollars through ICOs until the SEC began an ongoing crackdown in the name of investor-protection laws, as per the report. The report cites research from TokenData, which apparently shows that ICO funding dropped from $6.9 billion in Q1 2018 to $118 million in Q1 2019.Blockstack founders Muneeb Ali and Ryan Shea reportedly spent 10 months and approximately $2 million to gain approval from the SEC. Ali apparently said that Blockstack had to develop a protocol for running what is essentially a regulated ICO through Regulation A+ from the ground up. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Blockstart applied for SEC approval to run a $50 million token sale in April.As the report says, some blockchain-based startups have conducted token sales under SEC Regulation D, including Blockstart. Unlike Regulation A+ sales, Regulation D sales do not require SEC approval; however, they are limited only to accredited investors, i.e. companies that hold a minimum of $5 million in assets and $1 million in its figures’ cumulative net worth.  Blockstart reportedly received $47 million through Regulation D funding in 2017, along with an additional $5 million from venture-capital funding.According to the WSJ, crypto-based startup YouNow Inc. has also has filed for a Regulation A+ funding round.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, major traditional exchanges such as Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange have shied away from Regulation A+ IPOs due to recent events."

In particular, Siemens is exploring the use of blockchain in the transportation industry, as per a report by Forbes on July 15.","According to Siemens Corporate Technology’s head of cybersecurity and blockchain, Andreas Kind, Siemens is looking to incorporate blockchain tech into carsharing via Siemens Mobility — one of Siemens’ subsidiaries.According to the Enterprise CarShare website, carsharing reportedly refers to using or renting a car for a short period of time. As a popular example, the report cites the rental service Zipcar.One issue with this system, says Kind, is with the associated fueling cards, which allow the car renters to refill on gas. However, using the card is subject to a number of restrictions on the customer end e.g. they can only use the card at specific stations and they are sometimes stolen. Kind said he believes that this type of technology could be improved via a blockchain solution:""It's not only inconvenient for the drivers, it's inconvenient for the companies because fueling cards get stolen [and] they get sold on the internet [...] That's an example where, in an industrial context, you need something, a technology, that brings together different participants that [don't] fully trust each other [...] That's exactly where blockchain can add value.""Siemens is also considering other areas within the transportation sector for blockchain solutions. Siemens' Corporate Technology reportedly presented on a possible blockchain solution for “blockchain-based smart parking” at Bosch's 2019 Connected World conference.According to the report, Siemens is also considering blockchain use cases for supply chains and manufacturing. Siemens is also apparently leaning toward using a permissioned blockchain, however, the firm is still in the testing and discovery phase, and is still reportedly exploring the viability of various use cases.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Grand View Research has suggested that blockchain is a digital technology driving market growth in the global transportation management systems (TMS) sector.

The outlet quotes an anonymous Shinhan Card official commenting on the development:“Services using those key functions of credit cards will be extended to the blockchain-based system, a notable advancement from the status quo whereby most blockchain-based services available are limited to cash wiring or user identification for online transactions.”The official also reportedly explained that the company has been awarded the patent about a year and a half after conducting a feasibility study, and that the firm is currently working to also obtain patents in European countries, the U.S., Japan, China, Vietnam and Indonesia. According to the article, the system could also soon allow for cardless transactions via a mobile app.Per the report, the initiatives could result in a phase-out of the network of three intermediaries, namely credit card firms, a value-added network service provider and a Payment Gate. Value-added networks are service providers connecting credit card companies and member stores to verify and approve transactions, while the payment gate is tasked with carrying out the payment.Company information website Crunchbase claims that Shinhan Card is South Korea’s leading credit card provider and corporate analytics service Owler estimates the firm’s annual revenue to be $841.6 million.As Cointelegraph reported yesterday, a consortium of major South Korean firms partnered to launch a blockchain-based mobile identification system in 2020.At the end of June, Crypterium, a crypto payment firm led by former Visa exec, revealed it shipped about 4,000 crypto debit cards in a week since the launch of the card."

The latest iteration is called Galileo — v.0.6.0 — as announced by Binance on July 15.","According to the announcement, there are four major changes implemented in Galileo: the matching engine has been revised with “Taker” and “Maker” matching logic, trading pairs on Binances decentralized exchange, Binance DEX, can be delisted, Binance Chain token assets can now be time-locked, and state sync options have been enhanced.For Binance DEX, validators can now reportedly make a proposal to vote on delisting trading pairs for reasons such as low volume of use. This could, the announcement suggests, improve overall liquidity.Time-locking tokens is also a new feature that is reportedly sought by a number of projects looking to list their crypto assets. As fully explained in the initial BEP-9 proposal — and echoed in the Galileo announcement — businesses sometimes like to use time-locked tokens as a means of securing commitment from founders, or for collateral:“Some business plans decide to lock certain amount tokens for pre-defined periods of time, and only vest in the future according to the schedules. For example, some projects may lock some allocation of the issued tokens as a commitment by the founding team; some business scenarios also need to lock some tokens as collateral for value.”According to the full rundown of Galileo, the latest mainnet is a hardfork of its previous version. This means Galileo required at least two-thirds consensus from validators in order to successfully upgrade from the previous version.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Binance recently released its margin trading platform on July 11.

Pay-to-Play Gaming Is Flawed, Blockchain-Based Platform Says.","Jul 15, 2019","Bezant Foundation Ltd (Singapore), which provides for the world’s first BaaS (blockchain as a service) based on Hyperledger Fabric, has just released their Q2 2019 Progress Report this Monday, July 15, 2019. The Report provides two significant updates which may be a game-changer not just for the much-hyped crypto project, but also for the industry as a whole.","In their Q2 Update, Bezant singles out crypto companies such as Omisego (OMG), Facebook (Libra), and others for addressing in their arguably cliche mission statements that they will ‘solve the problems of the unbanked’. Bezant writes that: “OMG is currently focused on their ‘Plasma’ backend technology as opposed to creating products that the unbanked can actually use; and Facebook’s Libra will actually require users to have a bank account or credit card in order to purchase Libra coins, in effect, creating their own crypto for use within their ‘banked’ ecosystem.”This year,  Bezant, has partnered with Jehmi Thailand to launch their P2P lending platform based in Bangkok, Thailand called Transwiz. The goal of Transwiz is to provide alternative lending to the 450 million unbanked in the Southeast Asia region by providing services to 70% of the population who do not have access to bank accounts.Transwiz will run on the Bezantium blockchain which will provide: transaction speed/scalability of at least 1,000 tps, transparency (immutable ledger), the privacy of information (permissioned network), and security (consensus), and is developer-friendly through smart contracts (chain code) that can be programmed in Java, Node.js (java script) and Golang.Led by Phadet Wongpayaban, a former Executive at Thaicom, a leading satellite operator in Asia, the Transwiz lending service was preliminary launched in February 2019 and has seen the loan values grow at a rate of 50x over a four-month period, as well as a 17x growth in users over the same period.  The service is currently in beta with participation by invite only and on a limited basis. Full services are expected to launch in 4Q of this year.Bezant believes that a longer term approach to “liquidity” and market value is needed for the sustainability of any token project. After careful consideration, Bezant applied to be Listed on Binance DEX (Decentralized Exchange), a new type of cryptocurrency exchange, in which traders own their private keys and control their funds. By listing on the DEX, Binance would enhance its interoperability between the Bezant blockchain and Binance Chain.The journey towards listing on Binance was a momentous one: after Bezant’s Community Proposal was posted on June 25th, 2019, Bezant quickly rose to become the #1 Project Listing for that period in a matter of 48 hours, and then received a unanimous 11 out of 11 vote by Binance DEX’s validators to be listed on July 5th, 2019. The BZNT-464/BNB trading pair was then listed to begin trading on the Binance DEX on July 7th, 2019.  Today until Tuesday, July 16, 2019, with Bezant joining the Binance Chain, Bezant has begun swapping an initial 25% of ERC-20 BZNT (1 Billion total token supply) to the BEP-2 Token. The swap between the BEP-2 BZNT token and ERC-20 BZNT token, will allow for two separate token systems, while still maintaining the same total token supply. In order to stabilize the Bezant token ecosystem, we will provide a limited token swap period but after this swap period ends, token swaps will be closed indefinitely.Moving forward: Bezant will be making efforts to qualify and be selected for the Binance BEP2 Community Listing Program, which would allow the BZNT token to be listed on the Binance CEX or Main exchange. This could potentially take place as early as the end of August. With the addition of a Binance CEX listing, our token holders will have liquidity options on the top-2 global cryptocurrency exchanges.The Bezant team is comprised of experienced professionals from Kakao, Bithumb, Nexon, Xsolla, MOL, Razer, et al. The Bezant foundation completed the “Fastest ICO in Asia” in May 2018 with a public token sale that ended in less than one hour.In April 2019, Bezant launched the world’s first commercial blockchain service co-developed with IBM, based on Hyperledger Fabric. The Bezant blockchain service provides enterprise-level scalability, ease of use, and ease of integration for dApp developers as it supports the most-popular programming languages Java and Javascript. Bezant is focused on providing a blockchain-based digital payments platform to business customers which is a US$4.15 trillion market. The team is initially targeting Korea and Southeast Asian customers as there is a strong need for the Bezant blockchain service to solve solutions in payments, lending, remittance, contents, data, et al.For more information, visit us at the Bezant website (https://bezant.io/)"

at Potential' of Creating Virtual Currency, CEO Reveals.","Jul 10, 2019",The former governor of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) says “China should take precautions” against the trend represented by Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency.,"Twitter-based Chinese crypto news source CnLedger reported on Xiaochuan Zhou’s remarks on July 9.Zhou notably served as PBoC governor between 2003 and 2018, a period which saw Beijing pursue its notorious onslaught of anti-crypto regulations — including the historic blanket criminalization of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and exchange crackdown.CnLedger reports that Zhou characterized Libra as representative of the global trend in cryptocurrencies — singling out its stablecoin-like properties and ambitions to tackle the pain point of cross-border remittances in emerging economies. Equally representative, per Zhou, is the fact that the token will still face challenges such as anti-money-laundering compliance and fund custody. Contextualizing this trend more broadly, Zhou reportedly claimed that “people valuing Libra is inseparable from the global dollarization trend,” and that the imperative for China is to maintain a strong monetary status, take precautions and pursue rigorous policy research.The former governor further predicted, in CnLedger’s summary, that:“In future there may emerge a more internationalized, globalized currency, a currency so strong that will cause major currencies to establish exchange relations with it. It may not necessarily be Libra, but there will be more institutions and people try creating it.”As previously reported, Beijing’s perception that the cornerstone principles of the crypto revolution — disintermediation and the frictionless circulation of value — will undercut its strict capital controls and economic strategy has translated into a series of attempts to insulate both its domestic financial system and individual investors from the global crypto space.The current deputy PBoC governor, Pan Gongsheng, recently characterized Security Token Offerings (STOs) as an “illegal” financing activity similar to ICOs, claiming that both remain rampant in mainland China — notwithstanding the authorities’ ever-more-adversarial stance.The United States Congress has meanwhile demanded hearings on Facebook’s forthcoming Libra, and requested that Facebook and its partners impose an official moratorium on Libra development until its concerns are examined and addressed."

to Delist Monero Due to Money Laundering Concerns. Monero ...","Jul 15, 2019","Cryptocurrency is so far on the cutting edge that it almost defines it, yet some are finding out the hard way that it’s even sharper than anticipated. The frightening reveal of nine security bugs through HackerOne internet security platform that had affected Monero (XMR) in recent months — ranging from the insignificant and solved to the malicious and live — was a big wake-up call for blockchain enthusiasts. Five of these vulnerabilities constituted a dire DDoS risk (one of that was labeled critica)l, but eight of the bugs are now fixed, including the most severe one discovered.","On June 3, a blockchain developer on HackerOne announced the discovery of a severe exploit in Monero that had granted hackers the ability to ""create"" fake XMR and send them to exchanges. The report stated:“By mining a specially crafted block that still passes daemon verification, an attacker can create a miner transaction that appears to the wallet to include sum of XMR picked by the attacker. It is our belief that this can be exploited to steal money from exchanges.""Though the fake XMR bug is one among a list of issues with Monero — and the biggest losers are exchanges rather than traders or investors — it demonstrates that even the most private and security-centric coins can be compromised. This is nothing less than a very visible threat to the entire ecosystem. Cryptocurrency is absolutely worthless if it fails to deliver on its most foundational promise of security and transparency. With (currently) limited functionality for cryptocurrencies in comparison to fiat money, if coins concede on their primary advantage, then what’s the point? CEO of the exchange Codex, Serge Vasylchuk, told Cointelegraph:“Most of the vulnerabilities were disclosed few months ago, yet were only now fixed. While Monero developers are doing great work, they cannot guarantee no new coins were minted by deceiving an exchange. If such an attack would occur, it might've taken a long time until the exchange would've noticed it, unless their security mechanisms are advanced enough to scan its cold wallet storage and compare it with account deposits very quickly.”Especially for Monero — a self-proclaimed privacy and security coin — these failings may seem unforgivable. They raise significant doubts about the idea that cryptocurrencies are generally infallible and put greater onus on exchanges to complete regular audits and be more selective in the tokens they list. This concept wasn’t as judiciously considered before now, but with the latest problems in Monero, we may see an industry-wide effort to clean up shop. The sheer number of issues revealed simultaneously by Monero, even if most had already been fixed, shows the desperate efforts that projects make to close gaps soon after they appear.Another issue that has been exposed by Monero is that crypto is highly susceptible to the domino effect, given how the newest solutions are often stacks of first-iteration blockchain software. The other critical issue reported on HackerOne was one affecting all tokens using the CryptoLive application layer, and not just Monero. A CryptoLive bug that led to DDoS susceptibility would affect all projects, cryptocurrency exchanges on which these coins appear and investors as well. This illustrates the idea that crypto is anything but airtight, and that its close-knit ecosystem may instead be ripe for contagion.However, there’s somewhat of a silver lining to these recent events: There was no report of these bugs appearing elsewhere — and the fact that Monero brought it to the community’s attention willingly does mean a lot — and a progressive angle that capably addresses the potential domino effect. By being historically public (rather than muddying the waters) about the issues in their software, Monero has effectively warned others in the space about potential predicaments and shows that it’s committed to its users. It also harkens to last year when a Monero wallet bug was revealed by the company and immediately solved alongside a public statement warning of crypto’s risks and novelty.Regarding this, Charles Guillemet, the chief security officer at hardware wallet Ledger,, told Cointelegraph in a conversation that transparency increases the trust one can have in these blockchains. On the other hand, a disclosure putting users at risk would be irresponsible.No company that was only interested in capital, or in being the “first-mover” rather than a blockchain leader, would publish that their issues are “again an effective reminder that cryptocurrency and the corresponding software are still in its infancy and thus quite prone to (critical) bugs,” like Monero did in a recent blog post.Another concern that arises from this whole XMR situation is the bug repayment issue. Are bug bounties a sufficient method for raising security issues in the blockchain space, or does Monero's handling of its own issues demonstrate the need for a better or more prompt solution? Guillemet has also commented to Cointelegraph regarding this:“Bounty programs are an excellent way to incentive security researchers to behave responsibly. It becomes problematic when companies / organizations use bounties to outsource their security work. Bounties shall not replace red teaming, secure development and third party audits by recognized labs. A common mistake consists in thinking that open source and bounty program guarantees security. It's clearly wrong and we have seen many examples of this.”The other major hacks occurring in the crypto industry help put Monero’s troubles in context, and when zooming out, one quickly realizes that the technology may not be ready for the mainstream as it exists now. If a decentralized app or platform on the scale of many that are popular today — Facebook Messenger, WeChat, Airbnb — were to be hacked in the way that Monero was, it would be an international crisis in the same league as Cambridge Analytica or beyond. Frankly, the size of some crypto hacks should make us grateful that digital tokens aren’t a bigger part of how the world works at this point in time.Earlier this year, the monthly count for vulnerabilities in major blockchain platforms and projects climbed to 43, with issues found in Coinbase, Brave, Tendermint, Ledger and others. At present the white-hat hacker crowd and internal developers are the majority of sweat equity being invested into bug fixes, with tens of thousands given out each month by projects that put bounties on their biggest glitches. Regulators are undoubtedly struggling with the overwhelming and precarious pyramid of projects they’ve been tasked to organize, but it must happen (even with a restricting one-size-fits-all set of regulations) before a project with code that resembles swiss cheese is allowed to handle vast public data and funds. Charles Guillemet, believes that, “Monero is not the first example and won't be the last one unfortunately.” He continued by clarifying the steps such platforms need to undertake in order to protect themselves from such situations: “Red teaming, independent third party audit, peer review of scientific articles. New cryptographic protocols need time to be reviewed and assessed.”Binance Chain — and its supported initial exchange offering platform, the Binance Launchpad — relies on Tendermint, for example, but what would happen to the nascent projects being nurtured by Binance if a nasty exploit were to fester too long? The consequences beg no guessing. Though Monero has demonstrated the ascent to mainstream may take longer than imagined, it also showed us the safest path up the mountain, and that’s one where blockchain projects support one another rather than racing to the finish line."

French Central ...","Jul 11, 2019","Central bank digital currencies (CBDC) will not hold much interest for the general public unless they provide full anonymity, the deputy governor of Mexico's central bank has argued. The executive’s remarks were published by the Bank for International Settlements on July 11.","Javier Calafell, deputy governor of the Bank of Mexico (Banxico), delivered a speech on potential strengths and weaknesses of CBDC during an event held by the United States Federal Reserve Bank and the OMFIF Foundation on July 9.While outlining CBDCs’ advantages such as security of payments and cost effectiveness, Calafell believes that there are a number of significant factors that prove their ineffectiveness. According to the official, the existing digital systems already satisfy payment functions of CBDC, while its back-up function does not make much sense since the central bank handles the main part of the payment systems.Calafell argued that cash is unlikely to see a significant decline in demand in the foreseeable future, which makes it difficult to expect that the issuance of CBDCs will change the trend meaningfully.The Banxico official highlighted the issue of privacy as a major impediment to the adoption of CBDCs, citing reputational risks associated with a fully anonymous CBDC. The general public will not be interested in a CBDC if it does not provide sufficient privacy, Calafell declared, claiming that a “CBDC design with anything less than full anonymity is likely to dent interest among the general public.”At the same time, the Banxico executive cautioned against disregarding the subject of CBDCs, as well as issues surrounding the technology. Calafell outlined that CBDCs are “still in a very early stage of development,” while the global community should not miss the potentials of new technologies.Calafell concluded:“In any event, while we have to be open and attentive to new technologies, it is also true that we need to be cautious in adopting them, especially when, as in the case of CBDCs, we are dealing with an issue with potential major implications and still many unknowns.”Previously, the Banxico published a circular requiring local crypto exchanges and banks to receive a permit from the bank in order to provide crypto-related services.Recently, the International Monetary Fund released a report forecasting that global central banks will be issuing digital currencies in the future."
