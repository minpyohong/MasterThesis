[+] including institutional interest and leveraged trading.","Bitcoin enjoyed sharp gains during the first six months of this year, rising more than 200% as the digital currency benefited from numerous tailwinds.The cryptocurrency, which started out 2019 below $4,000, climbed to nearly $14,000 in late June, according to CoinDesk data.The digital asset finished the first half of the year at $11,139.22, returning 202% in that time, additional CoinDesk figures show. Bitcoin volatility was relatively modest during the first quarter, but increased significantly during the second.While the digital currency was up only 11.7% year-to-date (YTD) at the end of March, it had risen 44.3%, 131.7% and 201.86% by the end of April, May and June.[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]Multiple TailwindsWhen explaining what drove these gains, some analysts highlighted a variety of potential causes.Erik Finman, a young entrepreneur and early bitcoin adopter, listed several ""key components.""He specifically mentioned ""1. Tariffs (when they were happening) 2. Election season 3. Major retail companies like AT&T accepting Bitcoin 4. New platforms like CoinBits emerging to provide access to Bitcoin investments 5. Facebook Libra coin.""""These 5 things did not exist in the first quarter and are changing the way people look at cryptocurrency,"" he emphasized.Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of asset manager Arca, also pointed to numerous factors as fueling bitcoin's recent gains.""There was a confluence of many real macro events/catalysts that led to Bitcoin's rise,"" said Dorman, including ""trade wars,"" ""Flight to safety from countries with tight capital controls (China)"" and growing awareness of the digital currency.Institutional InterestOne bullish factor singled out by several market observers was increased institutional interest.This contrasts sharply with the bull run that bitcoin experienced between 2017 and 2018, which was attributed largely to retail investors.The latest run-up ""certainly has not been a retail-led rally, which is very notable for the space,"" said Cole Walton, cofounder of Plouton Mining and head trader at Kanos Capital Management, LLC. ""Google searches have not spiked and anecdotal accounts have confirmed the general public does not fully believe bitcoin is back yet,"" he added.Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency fund of hedge funds BitBull Capital, also weighed in.""Bitcoin price grew rather steadily in the first quarter of this year as compared to the violent movements of late because the sentiment shift was not retail oriented,"" he stated.""We believe institutions were actively buying Bitcoin since it's lows late last year and retail investors only joined in once major psychological barriers were broken, namely the $10k level."" LibraSeveral analysts singled out the hype surrounding libra, the cryptocurrency that social media giant Facebook plans to release.The company formally announced its intention to release this digital currency, designed to allow seamless transactions between parties around the world, on June 18th, according to TechCrunch.Facebook's plans have provoked a deluge of media coverage, with some lawmakers calling for the social media giant to halt all development on the project.Since the company had nearly 2.4 billion monthly active users as of March 31st, it can potentially tap a very sizable market by offering its user base the ability to make timely transactions.Dorman spoke to this, noting that the launch of this cryptocurrency ""immediately introduces 2 billion people to digital wallets."" Walton emphasized that if libra gets off the ground, it ""will be the biggest on-ramp into crypto we have seen yet, and institutional money knows this."" Leverage/DerivativesMarket observers also pointed to the key role that derivatives and leveraged trading played in pushing bitcoin higher.Dipasquale, for example, described these factors as ""instrumental"" to the cryptocurrency's gains.Dave Hendricks, cofounder and CEO of digital asset management platform Vertalo, also commented on this situation, emphasizing how the market has matured over time.""During the 2017 run up Bitcoin didn't even have a futures market in place,"" he emphasized. ""In the 18 months since the ATH, many more institutions have started following and investing in BTC,"" said Hendricks. ""With new leverage products and a more sophisticated buyer base, it's possible for larger leveraged  orders to impact the market,"" he noted. Sentiment DataOne form of information that can help market observers understand bitcoin's robust gains is sentiment data.Joshua Frank, cofounder of digital analytics platform TheTIE.io, helped shed some light on this particular area.The chart below, provided by his company, plots the sentiment (measured by collecting and assessing social media posts) of bitcoin, along with the number of tweets surrounding the cryptocurrency.The blue line represents tweet volume, while the purple line corresponds with long-term sentiment, which is calculated by conversations on Twitter over the last 50 days to a 200-day moving average.This graph depicts bitcoin's price, sentiment data and tweet volume.""After bottoming in December 2018, the long-term sentiment on Bitcoin has continued to grow in each over the last 7 months,"" noted Frank. ""Tweet volumes (blue line middle chart) have continued to increase over the last year."" ""Continued increases in positive long-term sentiment means that conversations around cryptocurrency are increasingly becoming more positive,"" he emphasized. Frank also weighed in on libra, and how its announcement affected the sentiment surrounding bitcoin.""After Facebook’s official partner list for Libra Coin was revealed on June 14th sentiment on Bitcoin almost immediately flipped positive leading significant upwards price movement,"" he noted. Going forward, he provided a rosy outlook for the world's most prominent digital currency.""Conversations around Bitcoin remain bullish and we anticipate that Bitcoin, while volatile, will continue to see upwards price movement.""Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ether. "

The number of institutions coming into this industry has not increased that tremendously in 2019 yet.""According to CZ, retail investors still account for about 60% of trading volume on Binance, about the same percentage as last year, though both have increased.Margin trading, where traders can borrow against their deposits on an exchange, may also be having an effect on the bitcoin price as investors have a larger pot of funds to speculate with. Earlier this month Malta-based Binance allowed traders to borrow up to three times their deposit, while rival bitcoin exchange Bitfinex is allowing loans of 100 times deposits. ""I would say the majority of people by the end of the year will be using margin in some capacity,"" CZ, who has been compared to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, told Bloomberg. ""It’s quite safe to use, to be honest. There will be more trading volume and potentially higher volatility.""Bitcoin's epic 2017 bull run, which saw the bitcoin price rise from under $1,000 per bitcoin to almost $20,000 in less than 12 months, is largely thought to have been driven by retail investors, with this latest rally believed to be somewhat more mature.The bitcoin price has been rising so far this year as bitcoin and cryptocurrency fever again sweeps... [+] the world.Those who have branded this year's bull run as different from 2017 have pointed to bitcoin and crypto interest from the likes of social media giant Facebook and iPhone maker Apple, and institutional adoption from the New York Stock Exchange-owner backed bitcoin and cryptocurrency platform Bakkt, and Fidelity Investments, one of the largest asset managers in the world.Others have suggested the fast-approaching next bitcoin halvening, where the number of bitcoin tokens awarded to miners will be cut by half, could cause a ""supply shock"" in the market."

""Unregulated crypto-assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.""The bitcoin price has swung wildly over the last few years, rising from under $1,000 per bitcoin to almost $20,000 over the course of 2017 and then plummeting to around $3,000 last year.Trump, who added ""Facebook Libra’s 'virtual currency' will have little standing or dependability,"" said that Facebook will have to comply with U.S. and international banking regulations if it wants to ""become a bank.""""We have only one real currency in the U.S.A., and it is stronger than ever, both dependable and reliable,"" Trump said. ""It is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the world, and it will always stay that way.

BTC repriced as predicted around $11,000-$12,000 and depending on how you analyze the equilibrium it has been trading at, is making a good stab at breaking out to another big run upwards.You might say it has happened and that the equilibrium range closed and now it is on the way up again, but that is an aggressive reading. A breakout is a 20% chance and thinking this is it, is at best 50/50, but a break above $14,000 would push it to 75% or to me optically as a dead cert. Let’s just say bitcoin above $14,000 will see me cracking open a nice Claret.Make no mistake this is an incredible chart. The volatility is truly epic. The bigger the volatility the bigger the upside if it breaks. Volatility is energy and its scales have all moved. Of course, that can be bad news as any leveraged crypto trade will have suffered, as one of my recent articles warned. Various parties will try to stop longs out so try not to be levered up to your eyeballs or even levered at all. It would have been almost impossible to lever into this market as it has unfurled, without being spiked out. Leverage kills in even mundane markets and fast markets make it impossible often by design.Changes in geopolitics could spoil the magic as this remains a capital preservation move by ME and APAC, read Iran, China, Hong Kong and their zones of influence. The global general public has yet to reawaken and when and if they do they will dive in head first and this will indicate the end of the run.The parabolic price chart is so reminiscent of many boom and bubble markets that it is hard to expect anything but an oncoming vertical. Lots of economic studies say it isn’t so, but time and again it is. A parabolic move by bitcoin now is hard to guess at sensible levels and we are perhaps less than half way up a proper commodity or tech style hockey stick chart move. Rest assured this is not ""normal.""However, if you chose to play the trading game you must stick to the basics and a solid rule is ‘to trade what you see’ not what you want to see or expect to see. Is it even possible to see anything else but a rocketing market?Consequently I am left wondering about strategy above $20,000 where I am expecting the bitcoin price to come to rest in what looks to be a time not too distant.Normally it would be a safe bet to expect BTC to pull back from approaching $14,000 but the current move is very strong. If it does pull back the tactic remains the same. No decision will be made till Bitcoin’s price breaks above or below the current equilibrium and until Bitcoin breaks above $14,000 moves should be considered noise. That’s the plan but the market is looking so strong now its easy to jump ahead and see the next move already underway and we will know very soon.Introducing Forbes Blockchain 50: Learn about the companies investing in the tech that will speed up business processes, increase transparency and potentially save billions of dollars.----Clem Chambers is the CEO of private investors website ADVFN.com and author of Be Rich, The Game in Wall Street and Trading Cryptocurrencies: A Beginner’s Guide.

Marshawn Lynch, former Seattle Seahawks running back and Superbowl XLVIII Champion, invested in a blockchain company in 2015. His teammate, Richard Sherman, started accepting Bitcoin for merchandise on his website as early as 2014.Despite the early enthusiasm, many cryptocurrency projects in the professional sports payments space have been limited or short lived.The Litecoin Foundation, in partnership with the Miami Dolphins, announced today that it would begin accepting both Bitcoin and Litecoin for payments beginning in the 2019/2020 NFL season.Aliant Payments, a Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based payment processing and independent merchant services provider, will be powering the cryptocurrency payment solution.

We see this as a powerful way to raise awareness and educate people about Litecoin and cryptocurrencies on a tremendous scale.”Bitcoin, however, still leads as the cryptocurrency with the highest market cap.As merchants like Whole Foods, Home Depot, Nordstrom, and Crate and Barrel accept Bitcoin payments, customers will have more choice as to how--and with what--they pay for their merchandise and experiences. Professional sports franchises accepting Bitcoin and Litecoin for an in game experience is just the beginning.Beyond payments for tickets, merchandise, and stadium concessions, many sports and esports franchises are embracing broader approaches to incorporating cryptocurrencies and blockchain into their businesses.

Unlike another retail-focused crypto payments app announced earlier this year, Fold is focused on sticking to Bitcoin’s roots and allowing their users to avoid issues associated with the legacy financial system such as Know-Your-Customer (KYC) restrictions and mandatory signups.The Power of LightningLongtime Bitcoin users will remember Fold as one of the earliest startups built around the peer-to-peer digital cash system back in 2014. Back then, the app’s main functionality was allowing its users to save 20% on their Starbucks coffees by paying with Bitcoin. However, the company eventually ran into usability issues a few years ago as the Bitcoin network became congested and on-chain transaction fees rose to levels unsuitable for Fold’s use case.“We noticed very quickly that Layer 1 was not going to be the ideal payment rail that we hoped,” said Fold CEO Will Reeves when reached for comment. “Long confirmation times and, especially, high on-chain fees made it unworkable for most consumer and retail situations. Because of those challenges, we've been very proactive in adopting and building on Layer 2 solutions, like Lightning, as early as we could so we could actually make bitcoin payments work.”As a quick overview, the Lightning Network is a secondary payments layer built on top of the base Bitcoin network that allows users to transact with each other directly rather than publishing all transactions to the blockchain. This enables Bitcoin payments that are faster, cheaper, and potentially more private (see this previous post for a more thorough walkthrough of the Lightning Network and its possible implications on the cryptocurrency market).The Lightning Network has seen steady growth as a means of making Bitcoin payments in 2019. Earlier this year, one online retailer revealed that the Lightning Network has already become a more popular payment option than any of the altcoins they accept. Additionally, the public beta of a non-custodial exchange powered by the Lightning Network went live in April.Here's how Fold's Lightning Network integration works.For Fold, the Lightning Network enables faster, cheaper Bitcoin payments for their users, while also preserving the technology’s core ethos of decentralization.Before adding Lightning Network functionality to their core app, Fold tested the new payments network with a pizza ordering service known as Lightning Pizza.“We launched Lightning Pizza to test a hypothesis that if Bitcoin payments were as easy and rewarding as using a credit card, people would change their habits around spending,” said Reeves. “We were blown away by the results. An instant, one tap, zero-fee payment with good incentives spurred people to spend regularly via Lightning. Lightning Pizza sells tons of pizzas daily with thousands of repeat customers spending tens of thousands of dollars. There are many UX and technical issues to iron out, but bringing Lightning into the core Fold product is going to garner the same results and make bitcoin payments as easy as using a credit card. We'll be quickly rolling out new features that make it just as rewarding and widely accepted as well.”Startups Using Lightning and Rewards to Grow Bitcoin PaymentsAs mentioned above, early Fold users will remember that they used to be able to use the app to effectively get 20% off on their Starbucks purchases. While these sorts of kickbacks are not available as the app today, Fold plans to bring them back in the coming weeks for various retailers featured on the platform.In this way, Fold’s rewards program is somewhat similar to another Bitcoin startup, Lolli, which is focused on improving the Bitcoin-related interactions between merchants and consumers. At the recent Bitcoin 2019 conference in San Francisco, Lolli CEO Alex Adelman discussed the company’s master plan for eventually leveraging their userbase to take Bitcoin payments mainstream.Obviously, the last mile of Bitcoin payments is to combine the use of Bitcoin by merchants and consumers at the same time. For now, Fold acts as a gateway between Bitcoin holders and various retailers’ gift card platforms and digital payment systems.Like many other Bitcoin startups these days, Fold also want to help build new tools for Bitcoin users on top of the Lightning Network. Additionally, the company plans to expand their list of participating retailers on their platform in the near future."

Photographer: Al Drago/Bloomberg","U.S. president Donald Trump set the crypto-verse ablaze on July 11th when he directed a series of tweets at bitcoin, Libra, and cryptocurrencies writ large, dismissing them as unregulated assets with no innate value or use cases other than to support illicit activity. As expected, crypto-twitter responded en masse from all angles in defense of the industry, with some offering to educate him and others crowing that the mere mentioning of bitcoin by a sitting president legitimizes the asset class and will accelerate its recent price climb.It would be easy to leave the conversation here and let the president and crypto industry continue along their respective paths. However, it is not quite so simple.In reviewing all of the commentary that surrounded the president’s tweets, I was left with a hypothetical. Imagine that there was an open and permissionless cryptocurrency that was scalable, private, and could magically be prevented from being used for illicit activities. Is there any chance that Donald Trump would sing its praises?Probably not.Why? Because for the president everything comes down to control, and he wants to have a full arsenal of tools at his fingertips. It is for the same reason that he is constantly criticizing the U.S. Federal Reserve, claiming that the U.S. economy would be performing even better if Chairman Jerome Powell “wouldn't have raised interest rates so much.”
Need another example? Take a look at U.S. sanctions policy, in particular the new measures being used to prevent Iranian leaders from accessing to key financial instruments. Economic sanctions have long been popular in the U.S. for a few reasons:Therefore, the pre-eminence of the dollar is not only a crucial accelerator of the U.S. economy, but an indispensable foreign policy tool.To acknowledge and accept the benefits of cryptocurrencies would require Donald Trump or any president to forego these essential policy instruments, which is something that few people would do voluntarily.Finally, the need to control all of the levers may be more important for this president than most. In fact, it was very telling that during the 2016 Republican National Convention, upon referring to the acrimonious political arena in Washington, D.C., then-candidate Trump boldly stated, “I alone can fix it”. This is a theme that was pervasive throughout his campaign regardless of whether he was discussed economic policy, corruption, or international relations.Be Careful What You Wish ForWith this context, entrepreneurs and advocates in the crypto space would be well-served to exercise caution and temper their enthusiasm following the industry’s latest 15 minutes of fame. The president’s modus operandi and strategic interests suggest that he would not hesitate to further castigate the industry, for instance in response to a major hack or ponzi scheme, if it is deemed to be beneficial to his 2020 re-election strategy.This could be problematic because this president has a large and loyal base that finds him extremely credible. Remember almost 63 million people voted for him in the 2016 election. It would be very difficult to successfully counter-message his followers, many of which may have heard about bitcoin and crypto for the first time on these tweets, based on quality of argument. Then adding in the fact that he can directly reach 62 million people on Twitter and over 25 million people on Facebook, the community would be going up against an unprecedentedly large megaphone to win the hearts and minds of potential customers.Therefore, the industry would best be served by continuing to build, engage with regulators (many of which are independent) and law enforcement, and identify use cases and products that intuitively fit the needs of customers. "

As Facebook continues to make headlines for its Libra blockchain project, fifty companies worth over a billion dollars are pioneering the current enterprise blockchain landscape.Interestingly, over half the companies listed on the Forbes 50 Enterprise Blockchain list are powered by Hyperledger, the open source collaborative effort hosted by the Linux Foundation. Yet while Hyperledger and Ethereum have become a standard for corporate blockchain projects, some enterprises are tapping into the Bitcoin blockchain to ensure unprecedented levels of trust, security and transparency.Bitcoin: More Than A CryptocurrencyWhile Bitcoin is best known for being a decentralized digital currency, the Bitfury Group recognized the potential in leveraging the Bitcoin blockchain when developing Exonum, their asset-management blockchain framework.Leveraging the Bitcoin blockchain was one of the core things we were thinking about when developing Exonum three years ago,” Gleb Palienko, head of Exonum, told me. “We saw that there were different market demands at that time, yet there were not many platforms in place, aside from Ethereum and Hyperledger. We first developed an enterprise government platform that was permissioned. However, we understood that governments and enterprises wouldn’t want to use a public blockchain, but they would still want the benefits of one, such as data immutability.”Understanding the potential that a public blockchain could bring to the enterprise in terms of security was a driving factor in the creation of Exonum.“When designing Exonum, we wanted to ensure the immutability level of a public blockchain, and bitcoin is the most secure public blockchain out there,” explained Palienko.Exonum was ultimately developed to guarantee the highest level of auditability of a permissioned blockchain, so that any user can verify information is actually stored on the blockchain, without relying on validators.Unlike other private blockchains with validators, Exonum uses specific data structures like Merkle trees to store everything and enforce auditability. We also offer an anchoring service, which periodically stores a snapshot of the Exonum network to the Bitcoin blockchain. This prevents node maintainers’ collusion with incentive to rewrite historical data. Finally, we have developed a light client available in four programming languages that allows any business or government to build trusted client applications. The light client can verify the cryptographic proof by Exonum that transactions are really stored inside the blockchain,” said Palienko.While the Exonum blockchain does have similarities to Ethereum (especially private installations) and Hyperledger (mainly IBM Fabric), the anchoring feature is what sets it apart from other enterprise blockchain frameworks.  We provide out of the box support of anchoring. Anchoring allows achieving immutability guarantees comparable to those of public blockchains, without disclosing any blockchain data. That's how we leverage the Bitcoin blockchain. Exonum uses it as a globally accessible and ultimately secure and immutable storage, while providing more flexibility and understandable governance,” said Palienko.The Bitcoin Blockchain For The EnterpriseHaving proof that data is stored inside a blockchain framework without having full access to that data is showing to be valuable for a number of enterprises, specifically for governments and healthcare companies.The entire reason we have a permissioned blockchain that anchors to Bitcoin is to give enterprises the best of both worlds. They aren’t putting everything out in the public, but still have the extra security of the public anchor, while having the ability to secure and look after their own data. This hybrid environment is much more attractive when you talk to enterprises,” Christopher Dickson, head of blockchain solutions at the Bitfury Group, told me.For example, The Republic of Georgia is currently in talks with the Bitfury Group to help with time stamping for blockchain-based land registry titles. Since April 2016, The National Agency of The Public Registry (NAPR) has been collaborating with Bitfury to use blockchain technology to restore public trust in institutions and government agencies.According to a detailed report, Bitfury created a blockchain-based timestamping layer on top of NAPR’s existing digital land registry system. This project has allowed land registry certificates to be timestamped and hashed on the bitcoin blockchain. In turn, this adds immutability and allows the owner of the document to prove to anyone that the receipt existed no later than the time of timestamping, and that it was authorized by NAPR.At NAPR we have an electronic placement of shareholders rights and we want to ensure that all this data on the business registry will be timestamped and placed on the blockchain. There are disputes between shareholders when changes occur and we want to cover all timestamping instruments to avoid future disputes,” Elene Grigolia, land administration specialist at NAPR and blockchain legal consultant told me.To guarantee this vision would be met, Bitfury has suggested that the Republic of Georgia use Exonum for timestamping due to the fact that it anchors data to the Bitcoin blockchain.In the report, Bitfury explains that, “anchoring removes the need to trust the administrator(s) of an Exonum Blockchain unconditionally; at the same time, it keeps sensitive data private.” Exonum is still being tested in the Republic of Georgia as of September 2018.In addition to government use cases, leveraging the Bitcoin blockchain has also proven to be useful for the trillion dollar global healthcare industry. For example, Nebula Genomics, a startup that operates a technology platform containing genome-sequencing data, uses the Exonum blockchain as a tamper proof device for medical record keeping.We use Exonom to record consent of our study participants. For example, if a pharmaceutical company wants to access our anonymized genomic data, they can send a request through the blockchain, which ensures transparency and creates trust. We don’t store the patient data itself on the blockchain network, but the permissions are stored and recorded here. We then timestamp all of these permissions. If a company or researcher has permission to use the data, they collect it and store it on the cloud and can then access it, but the beauty is that everything has been documented on the Exonum blockchain,” Dennis Grishin, Chief Scientific Officer of Nebula Genomics, told me.And Longenesis, a Riga, Latvia-based but Hong Kong-incorporated company, is also recording medical records on the blockchain. The company has a custom made Exonum blockchain data management solution for data transaction transparency and traceability, with a primary focus on medical-consent technologies.Using Longenesis’s platform, a patient agrees to specified care or participation in a study. The patient can withdraw that agreement, while the medical provider can offer to extend, modify or amend the agreement.According to the company, it will be providing its medical-consent platform-as-a-service to South Korea’s Hanshin Medipia Medical Center and Infinity Care.We built on Exonum because as a private blockchain framework, it prioritizes security and trust. This is critical for the life data economics systems Longenesis is building for medical institutions around the world. Our Exonum blockchains enable us to trace virtually every transaction that happens with clinical data, as well as record patient consent, and enable compliant, transparent data sharing between pharmaceutical companies, research organizations and hospitals. We expect that this model will open up medical data to support new drug development, disease research and more.” Garri Zmudze, CEO of Longenesis, told me.More Projects To ComeWhile Exonum’s users are primarily governments and large enterprises, Bitfury notes that many more projects are underway.We have more than thirty in house projects being developed and a number of countries are looking to use Exonum, including the UK, Ukraine, China and The U.S. Rather than viewing blockchain platforms as ‘science projects,’ we are taking the approach that blockchain is necessary and can be integrated into other platforms. Additionally, we leverage the Bitcoin blockchain, which other players in the market could do, but that would go against their models. For us, this is our vision and this is what differentiates us,” said Dickson, head of blockchain solutions at the Bitfury Group."

But nowadays, gold is beginning to lose its luster as a safe haven, due to the strong dollar and the high “carry” cost.Bitcoin in USD YTDUS Treasuries continue to serve as a safe haven, but they are at risk of a China sell-off. China is holding over one-trillion dollars of them, and it could crash the market should it decide to use it as a weapon in the on-going US-China trade war. That leaves major cryptocurrencies as a good alternative to gold and US Treasuries. Sort of, as the market risks and the exchange risks are enormous.Still, some experts think that major cryptocurrencies have gotten a boost from the trade war, which has magnified global risks and uncertainties.Nisa Amoils, a venture capitalist with New York Angels, is one of them.“While infrastructure build-out and Facebook's Libra have validated the space in recent months, this continues to be a macro story,” says Amoils. “The largest catalyst continues to be the deteriorating global macro backdrop, which continues to support digital assets, especially Bitcoin and to a lesser extent the innovative ‘decentralized finance’ movement occurring on top of the Ethereum protocol.”Amoils sees Bitcoin taking the place of gold as a safe haven.“With fears of the end of the equity bull market in the US, China and Europe currency manipulations, and banking problems in Europe, it appears that Bitcoin in real time has taken on safe haven characteristics of ""digital gold"" (in fact similar price patterns in both gold and bitcoin this week),” she says.  Not everyone agrees that Bitcoin is the new gold.  Deric Scott, Vice President of Metals.com, is one of those who demurs. “Gold is universally accepted as currency around the world and has been for nearly 6,000 years,” says Scott. “It's tangibility and anonymity make it very appealing for people looking to retain what little shred of privacy we as a collective society still have.”Besides, gold doesn’t rely on the Internet to change owners. “With gold increasing in dollar value approximately 450% since the year 2000 it's a nice way to store wealth that is still accessible even when the power or Wifi is out,” adds Scott. “You won't be accessing your digital currency wallet when you're taken off the grid.”At any rate, both Bitcoin and gold could get a further boost, as trade wars persist.Meanwhile, there’s easy money. Central banks are getting ready for another round of easing, and that could be positive for speculative assets, including major cryptocurrencies-- and push their prices to new highs, given their limited supply..

Carlson-Wee discussed the recent volatility in Bitcoin and whether or not the digital currency is experiencing a bubble. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg","Polychain, a crypto-focused investment firm based in San Francisco founded by Olaf Carlson-Wee, has led a $7 million seed financing round for Altonomy, a Singapore-based crypto market maker.As a certified liquidity provider for CME Group and Huobi’s bitcoin futures products, Altonomy has provided liquidity for some of the largest crypto exchanges and regulated futures markets in the global market.Since its launch in 2018, Altonomy has worked with more than 60 crypto exchanges, over-the-counter (OTC) partners, and stablecoins such as USD Coin, Tether, TrueUSD, and the Paxos Standard.In an interview, Ricky Li, the co-founder of Altonomy and a former manager of research and product at CME Group, said that the latest funding round would bolster the company’s institutional-grade trading services for investors, facilitating the firm’s international growth.Throughout the past 17 months, the crypto market has seen a noticeable increase in the inflow of capital from institutional investors, particularly in the U.S. market.Grayscale, an investment firm that oversees more than $2 billion in assets under management, said that 66 percent of investment into its crypto products such as the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) came from institutional investors in 2018.According to Li, Altonomy has seen an increase in the number of institutional investors entering the crypto market by purchasing bitcoin through strictly regulated investment vehicles and products.To facilitate the growing demand from institutions, Li noted that the firm will focus on serving institutional investors of all sizes by providing liquidity that is necessary to handle large orders.“We focus on institutional investors of all sizes that have a need for liquidity, either through OTC or exchange-based transactions, on a wide range of crypto assets with varying market cap sizes. Recently, we have started to witness flows from previously-exited funds and family offices that are now re-entering market. We have also seen a considerable uptick in the number of institutions starting to purchase BTC as their first entry of crypto market, having remained on the sidelines during the recent bear market period,” said Li.CME Group, one of the world’s largest futures markets alongside Cboe and NYME which works with Altonomy, has also seen record high daily volumes for its bitcoin futures contract in recent months.On May 13, CME bitcoin futures achieved an all-time high daily volume of more than $1 billion, demonstrating a spike in demand from both retail and institutional investors. Li emphasized that large exchanges in the crypto market such as BitMEX, OKEx, and Huobi have been attracting more retail investors in recent months, strengthening the infrastructure supporting the crypto exchange market.CME Group records all-time high daily volume for its bitcoin futures contract“CME is certainly leading the regulated bitcoin futures contract trading market, despite rising competition from ErisX, Bakkt, TrueDigital, etc. Its robust infrastructure, wide customer base and first mover advantage all attributes of its success. Other exchanges, like Bitmex, Okex and Huobi DM are attracting more retail investors for speculative investing. They have all rolled out market maker programs to attract institutional liquidity, with Altonomy contributing to those programs as well,” Li added.Currently, Altonomy is based in Singapore with a branch office in New York and plans to open a new branch office in Shenzhen.Although China has prohibited bitcoin exchanges from operating in the country in 2017, Li explained that China, specifically Shenzhen, still remains a leading hub for bitcoin miners and the firm plans to communicate closely with miners to potentially provide better services in the future.As the crypto market matures, large-scale financial institutions are set to operate crypto trading desks and OTC services for their clients.Fidelity established Fidelity Digital Assets with the intent of providing custodian services to its clients in the near future and several analysts have hinted at Goldman Sachs expanding its crypto services in the upcoming years.Although OTC trading services of Goldman Sachs and Fidelity may overlap with Altonomy, Li stated that the focus of the firm is to provide liquidity for its clients like CME, Huobi, and other exchanges.“Goldman Sachs and Fidelity are operating OTC trading services similar to Altonomy. We are not too concerned about competitors like these, as they are mainly focus on BTC and ETH trading. We are proud to provide liquidity for our clients in a much wider range of crypto assets, both on exchanges and OTC. Our network of partners includes crypto investment funds, crypto projects and crypto exchanges, enabling us to source liquidity from areas where others can't reach. This advantage is built upon our deep experience in, and broad presence across, the digital assets industry,” said Li.In an official statement, Carlson-Wee, the CEO of Polychain Capital, described the company’s investment into Altonomy as “an easy decision” when the opportunity to invest in the business emerged."

[+] neighbors sell renewable energy directly to each other. ","Shell Oil is continuing its exploration of blockchain with yet another investment in the technology first made popular by bitcoin.The fifth-largest oil and gas company in the world, valued at $262 billion, is investing an undisclosed amount in LO3, a New York startup using a modified version of the ethereum blockchain to make it easier for individuals to buy and sell locally produced energy using the existing network of power cables.While the bitcoin blockchain lets users track the flow of value without the need of banks to audit the system, LO3’s platform, called Exergy, is designed to track the flow of energy as it is added to a shared, local energy network, giving the neighbors who purchase the energy absolute certainty it really came from a windmill, a solar panel or a gerbil running on a treadmill.If successful, LO3 and its competitors in the nascent “transactive energy” market, could change the role of traditional electricity transmission and distribution companies like Con Edison in the United States and Western Power Distribution in England from mere installers of underground cables, to managers of more efficient, distributed local energy grids.“We see that it’s society’s ambition to live in a lower-carbon environment,” says Shell Ventures investment director Kirk Coburn. “LO3 is a platform that enables that.”The investment announced today is part of a larger bridge investment round also joined by Sumitomo Corporation Group based in Japan. Details of the investment are not being disclosed, though Coburn says he’ll be joining LO3 as a board observer as part of the round and could come on as a full board member pending possible future investments. Earlier plans to raise capital by selling tokens to be used on the platform via an initial coin offering (ICO) have been put on hold. However, the tokens, called XRG, are still expected to play a crucial role in the platform when it goes live in 2020. The tokens will be used to incentivize use of the platform and will be required to access the distributed energy grid. Shell has the option to convert its investment into XRG tokens at the time of launch. Another token, called anergy, is being designed to let consumers sell data about their energy usage to third-party companies at a later date. The company is currently building Exergy on the public ethereum blockchain and will likely issues its tokens accordingly. However, Exergy is being designed to allow easy integration with a competing blockchain, called EOS, which has its own cryptocurrency and also allows for the creation of new tokens, but is touted as supporting larger transaction volumes. “We are building a custom blockchain combining the best of what existing blockchain communities have already accomplished,” says LO3 director Ben Conte. LO3 now employs 35 people, with most of its engineers joining Conte in Portland, Oregon, and other staff in Australia and Tokyo. The company plans to spend the investment to prepare for its full launch next year. When the project emerges from its beta testing, users will be able to set preferences on a mobile app, choosing how and when to use the local energy resources and exactly which sources to purchase from. Because a blockchain is really just a shared, transparent ledger of transactions without the need of a middle man to audit it, users will have increased certainty the energy actually came from the source they selected.This is Shell’s fourth public investment in blockchain, with other portfolio companies including oil-trading platform Vakt, on which Shell began trading in 2018; Applied Blockchain, which built a derivatives platform Shell also began testing last year; and commodities platform Komgo, built on the public ethereum blockchain. Competitors using blockchain to track energy credits include Power Ledger, which uses the public ethereum blockchain, and Veridium, which uses the stellar blockchain with support from inaugural Forbes Blockchain 50 list member, IBM.ForbesCurrently, most energy consumers have very little choice in where their energy comes from and are limited to the companies that installed the actual power cables and other infrastructure in their area. When an individual seeks an environmentally friendly alternative, their best option is often to buy a renewable energy certificate (REC) that goes towards supporting environmentally friendly energy production. However, there’s little guarantee the energy consumed is sourced from local plants, which would result in a positive impact on the purchaser’s community.So in 2016, LO3 conducted one of the first experiments using its technology to let a neighbor on the sunnier side of a street in Brooklyn sell solar energy he generated to a neighbor on the opposite, shadier side of the street. While the demo has not yet been widely scaled, it showed how a blockchain-based accounting system could form the building block of a more nuanced, competitive and locally sourced energy economy.Since then, LO3 has raised capital from Braemar Energy Ventures in New York, Centrica energy in the United Kingdom and Munich-based Siemens (also a member of the Forbes Blockchain 50 list). Coburn joined Shell in 2017 and says he was impressed with LO3’s ability to gain support across different jurisdictions beholden to a wide range of regulatory oversight.“It’s more complicated than just trading from the neighbor on one side of the street to the other. How do those two neighbors work within a neighborhood? How do they work within a larger environment?” says Coburn. “From a Shell perspective, what we see is we want to be able to enable customers to take advantage of that.”When expanded to a larger scale, Coburn hopes the LO3 platform will generate a self-contained energy market where local energy producers can connect directly with their neighbors. These early stage markets, which are now also being tested in the U.K., Colombia, Japan and Australia, could then create new revenue for locals and incentivize more energy efficient purchases by giving consumers increased certainty that their hard-earned money is having a direct impact on the air they breathe.“If I’m buying a REC from a plant in Montana and I live in New York, I don’t breath air from Montana, I breathe air from New York,” says LO3 founder and CEO Lawrence Orsini.""“I’d much rather pay for the clean air in New York and not the clean air in Montana.”Between 2010 and 2016 renewable energy use increased by 67% in the United States, according to the Center for Global Climate & Energy Solutions. But as of last year, only 11% of U.S. energy came from renewable resources, according to the U.S. Energy Information Association. To accelerate that rate several U.S. companies, including Apple and Bank of America, have joined the RE100, an international group of 185 enterprises committed to moving to 100% renewable energy by 2050 at the latest.To meet that demand those enterprise consumers and others won’t be able to rely on energy provided from traditional power companies alone, for many reasons, according to Orsini. The most important reason is that the centralized nature of traditional coal and gas means the raw materials have to be transported over great distances, resulting in both extra cost to ship the raw materials and lost energy as electricity dissipates from cables used to transmit it.“You can’t buy green energy from the other side of the planet and expect to get green energy in your plant,” says Orsini. “So as this market evolves and develops, and as people start pushing more and more to renewables, they’re going to have to start buying closer to them to really start verifying that they’re consuming renewable energy. Otherwise, it’s all just a bit of accounting chicanery.”Stay informed and ahead of the crowd with Forbes Crypto Confidential, a free weekly e-letter. Sign up today."

Since bitcoin's inception ten years ago, a plethora of mainstream entities have investigated various ways to channel blockchain's potential. Automation giant Siemens is evaluating the technology for various enterprise use cases, including improving the carsharing market.Siemens is following the trend of mainstream giants looking to incorporate blockchain. ""We are in the space where we want to come up with industrial extensions of blockchain systems, [...] blockchain systems for enterprises,"" Siemens Corporate Technology head of cybersecurity and blockchain Andreas Kind said to me in an interview. Kind mentioned use cases pertaining to areas such as supply chain, mobility, manufacturing, etc.When entities are interested in making the move toward blockchain, they generally undergo periods of testing and discovery before choosing the most effective and applicable use cases, Kind explained. ""Siemens is exactly in this kind of phase,"" he added. The company just completed a period of exploration, Kind said, adding, ""Now we're at the point where we're really zoomed into a set of use cases that are related to Siemens' business."" Siemens is looking toward permissioned blockchain usage in particular, Kind noted.Blockchain In The Mobility ArenaThe cybersecurity and blockchain head mentioned the area of mobility as one of Siemens' particular blockchain application focuses. Siemens has a separate branch devoted to the mobility sector. Siemens Mobility, a daughter company of the German-based Siemens AG, works to provide ""transport solutions,"" relating to the movement of ""people and goods"" to various locations globally, according to its website.Carsharing As An OptionRather than dealing with some of the responsibilities associated with owning a car, such as parking, car payments and insurance, folks who live or work in larger urban areas may often rely on carsharing, Kind explained. Carsharing allows members of the service to use or rent a car for any period of time, even for as short as one hour, according to details on the Enterprise CarShare website. Zipcar is another example of a carsharing operation.Kind said,There's a big transformation happening. So in the future, there will be many more opportunities around mobility services, rather than simply selling a car, and you see it already in the context of carsharing for instance. People want to go from A to B rather than having a car and moving because it's just much more conveneient sometimes than having your own car.Carsharing does have its difficulties though, as Kind mentioned ""the fueling card"" in particular. Under a carsharing subscription, ""you don't have to worry about paying for the parking, you don't have to worry about fueling the car, so everything is included,"" Kind said.At times, however, customers might need to refill the vehicle with gas, Kind said. Locating a suitable gas station can be difficult as customers need to fill up their vehicles at specific gas stations that are in collaboration with the company the customer is carsharing through. When the customer finds a place to fill up, they then must use their fueling card with its associated personal identification number (PIN), Kind detailed.""It's not only inconvenient for the drivers, it's inconvenient for the companies because fueling cards get stolen [and] they get sold on the internet,"" Kind noted as one example of fraudulent play. ""That's an example where, in an industrial context, you need something, a technology, that brings together different participants that [don't] fully trust each other,"" he explained.

During a conference call, they indicated interest in receiving formal written testimony from me. Here it is. A pdf version, with citations, is available here.","*******************************************July 15, 2019Sen. Mike Crapo, ChairmanSen. Sherrod Brown, Ranking MemberUnited States SenateCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban AffairsWashington, D.C. 20510 Re: “Examining Facebook’s Proposed Digital Currency and Data Privacy Considerations”—July 16, 2019 Hearing Dear Chairman Crapo and Ranking Member Brown: I appreciate the opportunity to submit the following statement for your consideration, and would like to thank you and the members of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. My background spans both the traditional financial system and digital assets, as I spent 22 years on Wall Street (most recently as managing director and head of Morgan Stanley’s pension solutions business in New York until 2016) and have been involved with digital assets for nearly 7 years. Presently, I serve on the Wyoming Blockchain Task Force as a gubernatorial appointee and am co-founder of the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition, which is continuing to build a welcoming framework for the digital asset industry’s regulatory compliance. I am purely a volunteer in both roles. This testimony is my own and should not be construed to represent the views of either organization. The Libra project is shining light on outdated U.S. financial regulations that are (a) holding back the U.S. economy and (b) giving rise to the concept of digital currency “stablecoins” in the first place. Digital currencies are the first major innovation in payment systems in nearly five decades. It is imperative that the U.S. tread carefully on this matter, since the genie is out of the bottle—digital currencies cannot be uninvented, and they offer significantly more efficient payment systems relative to those of the status quo. If we fight this technological trend, the innovation will simply move offshore rather than die. Digital currencies, such as that of Libra, can fit within a regulatory compliant framework in the U.S. today. The State of Wyoming has created a comprehensive, regulatory compliant framework for digital assets by enacting 13 trailblazing laws, one of which may be particularly relevant for the Facebook discussion because it creates a special-purpose bank charter. This new type of bank is authorized to custody digital assets and is required to comply with all federal anti-money laundering and related laws, as discussed further below. Wyoming’s suite of laws clearly demonstrate to Congress that it is possible to create a common-sense regulatory framework that can keep blockchain innovation in the U.S., while also strengthening both legal certainty and consumer protection in this space. However, the Libra project also poses two major policy issues for Congress to consider: privacy and Federal Reserve interest payments. Congress should be concerned about potential abuse of consumer financial privacy by both businesses and governments. Additionally, the project raises the question whether the Federal Reserve’s interest on excess reserves (IOER) program should be available to Facebook’s project, whether directly or indirectly, especially since the Bank of England recently announced it will open its interest-bearing deposit program to technology companies (including the Libra project).Below I expand on these four main points: (1) how outdated financial regulations caused the creation of stablecoins, which brought us to this juncture; (2) that digital currencies are the first major innovation in the payment system in decades; (3) that a model for how to fix U.S. federal regulations exists, and it can be found in Wyoming’s new blockchain laws; and (4) that Congress should be concerned about two particular issues pertaining to Facebook’s project: privacy and Federal Reserve interest payments. Banks have largely shunned the digital currency industry, making it difficult (if not impossible) for investors to trade U.S. dollars and digital currencies back and forth. If they could, investors would use the traditional banking system to do this, just as they do when trading stocks or commodities back and forth with dollars, but the traditional banking system has almost entirely blocked them. So, out of necessity the digital currency industry responded by inventing a “stablecoin”—a digital currency backed by dollars held in trust, whose trades settle on payment rails that are far more efficient than those of the traditional banking system, but which is also inextricably linked to the traditional banking system.  So, if Congress wants to make stablecoins irrelevant (including Libra), it can easily do so—simply by allowing the banking system to consistently bank this new asset class.Stablecoins are one of many unintended consequences of Congressional policies that turned access to the financial system into a policy tool to solve certain problems—but, as an unintended side effect also created major barriers to lawful commerce. When you create barriers to commerce, you get less commerce. These barriers are one of the reasons why economic growth is sluggish in the United States. Why are we happy with 3% growth when we regularly hit 5% growth not so long ago?To address the conditions that gave rise to stablecoins in the first place, Congress should:No one should be surprised that a new, more efficient type of payment system has garnered serious interest, because we can mail packages around the world faster than we can send money around the world (!). The status quo payment system coddles inefficient incumbents while imposing costs on businesses to retain “comfort deposits” in their bank accounts to fund their unsettled payments. Such comfort deposits trap massive amounts of capital and are a drag on economic growth that I estimate amounts to hundreds of billions of dollars of GDP annually. It makes zero sense that companies with a high cost of capital must trap their expensive capital in bank accounts, simply because cross-border payments take so long to settle. Such businesses have strong economic incentives to use the most efficient payment system and, if necessary, these businesses will go offshore to find it. Congress should stop allowing the Federal Reserve to protect the incumbent payment system and instead open it to healthy competition.Many banks have tried to fix the slumbering payment system and some are attempting to create their own blockchain-based alternative systems, but regulatory barriers have slowed the progress of these projects to a crawl comparatively. One such example is “Fnality,” formerly known as “Utility Settlement Coin,” which is making progress but is already nearly four years old.How does Facebook Libra fit into this? The basic building blocks of Facebook’s project are not new, with only one exception. The project is functionally akin to a money market fund (the Libra Association) plus a payment network (Calibra wallet), except that its transactions settle on a new type of payment system. The money market fund (Libra Association) invests in a basket of global currencies, government bonds and bank deposits. The payment network (Calibra wallet) is akin to a global version of PayPal or Venmo. The only difference, again, is that transactions in Libra settle on a new type of payment system—one that is far more efficient than any status quo payment system. It should surprise no one that there’s demand for a more efficient payment system. Already, the U.S. has lost the Libra Association to Switzerland, which has a more welcoming regulatory regime for blockchain projects than the U.S. This, too, should surprise no one.Yet, regarding this payment innovation point, there is one aspect of the Libra project into which Congress should delve deeply. Facebook announced plans to keep Libra 100% backed by financial assets—therefore, it is not a source of hidden leverage in the financial system. This presumes, of course, that Libra retains 100% backing over time and does not succumb to the age-old temptation of most financial institutions, which is to start playing ‘musical chairs’ under the assumption that all customers would never want to withdraw funds at exactly the same time. Taking Facebook at its word that Libra will retain 100% backing, Libra would be “safer” (less leveraged) than traditional banks or money market funds because its risk of a run-on-the-bank is almost certainly very low. By contrast, both traditional banks and money market funds are exposed to such run-on-the-bank risk—for banks due to fractional-reserve banking, and for money market funds due to rehypothecation of securities, which creates multiple owners of the same asset (i.e., selling something you don’t already own, or pledging the same asset to different lenders). From a policy perspective, it may interest you to know that Wyoming law expressly prohibits rehypothecation of digital assets in a custodial setting, owing to a Wyoming Supreme Court case that upheld the felony fraud conviction of a person who pledged the same asset to two different lenders. While this practice is rampant in both traditional banking and securities markets today, it is a clear violation of property rights and should not happen. Ever. The practice is the main cause of periodic instability in the traditional financial system. Since Facebook’s project is in its infancy and could grow to enormous size, it is particularly important now to hold Facebook to its promise to keep Libra 100% backed, permanently. Regulatory fears regarding the Libra project are overblown, both because existing laws (including FinCEN’s May 9, 2019 guidance regarding digital currencies) and recently-enacted laws in Wyoming demonstrate that these projects can fit within a regulatory compliant framework that promotes innovation, provides legal certainty for all parties and protects consumers. Within the past two years, Wyoming has developed a world-class regulatory framework for digital currencies like Libra and other digital assets, with the help of some of America’s top law firms and law professors. Here’s what Wyoming has done:(a)  Legal Framework for Digital Assets.  Classified digital currencies and similar assets under existing property and commercial law, thereby defining the rights and obligations of parties to a transaction, providing legal remedies and enabling secured lending of digital assets. Wyoming law also establishes a road map for judges to follow in legal disputes and bankruptcy.(b)  Custody.  Resolved many of the legal uncertainties and transactional issues relating to digital assets that arise within custodial services and the SEC’s Custody Rule, by providing a legal framework for qualified custody of these assets by Wyoming banks, thereby promoting their financialization and adoption by institutional investors. (c)   Utility Tokens.  Created a new kind of digital asset—utility tokens—which have a genuine consumptive purpose (the inspiration for the first Token Taxonomy Act, H.R. 7356 (2018)). It should be noted that the heavily-revised second Token Taxonomy Act, H.R. 2144 (2019), no longer contains a “token taxonomy.” Without such taxonomy, the bill doesn’t provide regulatory clarity (and, in fact, that the SEC has already stated key digital currencies (bitcoin and ether) are not securities in ordinary use cases.) Moreover, the newly added federal preemption clause preempts meaningful State-level innovations and is likely to mire it in litigation with States for years. The second draft, H.R. 2144 (2019), needs to be revisited.(d)  Other Laws.  Established a financial technology sandbox and amended Wyoming’s business entity formation and taxation statutes to create a welcoming hub for    innovation.There appears to be a push in Washington, D.C. to require Facebook’s project to apply for a bank license. Were it not for the fact that Wyoming law authorizes a new type of bank charter, this would be the functional equivalent of killing Facebook’s project in the U.S. because the OCC and FDIC have not yet approved any banks to handle digital currencies. However, there is one type of bank charter—Wyoming’s new special-purpose depository institution (SPDI)—that would serve Facebook’s needs well, while allowing it to comply with any such requirement to have a bank license. By law, an SPDI (as a state-chartered bank) is authorized to custody digital assets pursuant to its trust powers. It would be required to comply with all federal anti-money laundering and related laws. It would also be required to hold 100% reserves and be prohibited from lending. The Federal Reserve will play an important role in ensuring the safety and soundness of Wyoming SPDIs through the Fed’s master account application process, and SPDIs are also likely to want to apply to become members of the Federal Reserve System. Wyoming SPDI charter applications open October 1, 2019.Privacy risks surrounding Facebook’s Calibra wallet are well-documented. Of course that is a major concern, but what concerns me even more is that governments around the world will view Calibra as a surveillance tool. Congress should prevent governmental abuse of Calibra’s data by prohibiting its admission as evidence in U.S. criminal cases, unless the government first obtained a valid warrant for the data. This would bolster the U.S. Supreme Court’s narrowing of the “third party doctrine” in last year’s Carpenter decision, which required the government to obtain a warrant before obtaining data that Americans had voluntarily disclosed to a third party (cell phone site location data, in that instance). Additionally, since Facebook is a U.S.-domiciled corporation, Congress also has the power to block Facebook from similarly sharing data with governments outside the U.S. for purposes of criminal prosecutions.Separately, Congress should also re-open discussions about the Federal Reserve’s interest on excess reserves (IOER) program—not just for Facebook, but also generally. The Fed is projected to pay $35 billion to banks this year under this program, without banks doing anything to earn that money. Incredibly, that amounts to almost half of the U.S. budget for food stamps! It is important for Congress to consider whether it is appropriate for Facebook’s project to share in such payments, whether directly or indirectly. In a related move, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney announced plans on June 20, 2019 to open the Bank of England’s overnight interest-bearing deposit program to payment technology providers (such as Libra, among others), rather than restricting the program only to banks. Since Facebook does not plan to pay interest to the holders of Libra, Facebook and its project partners would pocket these interest payments as profits, risk-free. Should Facebook benefit from central bank largesse in this way, at the cost of diluting every holder of U.S. dollars? Should banks benefit in this way too? As this practice becomes better understood by voters, calls of both “where’s my bailout?” on the one hand, and “end the Fed” on the other, will inevitably become louder.The Bank of England’s move to expand its interest-bearing deposit program to Facebook (and other tech companies) illustrates that the U.S. must tread carefully, as other countries will be courting Facebook to redomicile if U.S. regulation is too heavy-handed. To summarize, the Facebook Libra project is aimed at satisfying demand for a much more efficient payment system relative to the status quo. Congress should recognize that the U.S. is already playing catch-up. Our bad regulations caused the invention of stablecoins in the first place, which is what brought us here today. And Facebook already chose a non-U.S. location (Switzerland) for the Libra Association, in what should be recognized as a “shot across the bow” to the U.S. Rather than fight the first real innovation in payment systems in decades, the U.S. should embrace it. Wyoming’s suite of innovative blockchain laws shows that such an embrace can be done largely within the existing regulatory regime, in a manner that provides legal certainty, protects consumers and promotes innovation. I would be happy to answer questions as the Committee sees fit. "

inflation.","Jul 11, 2019,04:32pm EDT","The U.S. is facing a pivotal moment as the White House pressures the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to boost a lagging economy – a move that will inevitably increase inflation. Since 2008, $12 trillion has been injected into the U.S. economy through quantitative easing. It’s a staggering amount of money in such a short period of time. Inflation is a slow and quiet killer; much like a frog that’s slowly boiled to death, people adapt to inflation – until they can’t.","But the table is set much differently now than it was in 2008. The increase in cryptocurrency of all kinds, including the recent launch of Facebook’s Libra and a 200% rise in Bitcoin this year alone, supports the weight of cryptocurrency’s role in the global economy, especially as it affects inflation. As the founder of an international alternative assets firm, I believe that more corporate giants will follow Facebook with their own exclusive coin offerings; in 10 to 20 years, a company without its own token may be analogous to a company without a website today.Whenever the market is artificially propped up with a large influx of currency, there inevitably comes a breaking point when enough of that currency begins to circulate in the environment. We saw the beginning of this process during the “Crypto Boom” of 2017, when the initiation of an entirely new kind of currency made many people millionaires overnight. This is a form of inflation.When banks insert $10 trillion into the economy, that inflation has to surface eventually. As more of the Crypto Boom billions circulate in the environment, and as less of the $10 trillion influx is hidden in banks and on Wall Street, cryptocurrency has the potential to rapidly accelerate the consequences of inflation by forcing new currency into existence.However, past this initial inflation, cryptocurrency offers an opportunity to stabilize the global economy because, much like gold, there is a finite amount of it to be mined. Furthermore, it’s the first investment that anyone in the world can purchase at any time, as long as they have access to the internet. For example, if you’re living in Argentina, you can’t just buy U.S. dollars whenever you want. You need a broker. And while the New York Stock Exchange closes, cryptocurrency never does. It’s a 24/7 investment.Ultimately, the consequences of inflation won’t be nearly as devastating as the alternative – deflation. Inflation, at least, gives us a leg to stand on to stay in the game long enough to devise a better strategy. Much like one person can acquire a credit card and continue to live despite mounting debt, the global economy can utilize inflation as a way to extend the time frame we have to figure out a better solution.I believe that solution is cryptocurrency. Within the next 10 to 20 years, our monetary system will likely reach a point of inflation that’s so massive it will mandate some type of monetary reform. The potential collapse of the Euro or the U.S. dollar may even necessitate the development of national cryptocurrencies, the prelude to which we may be currently witnessing, with the introduction of corporate cryptocurrencies like Libra.Coupled with blockchain technology, national cryptocurrencies could increase transparency around government spending and make it difficult for dark money to infiltrate political campaign financing, illegal drug trade, and criminal activity. A cryptocurrency-based monetary shift would also be aligned with the exponential growth of technology and the cultural impetus to digitize as many facets of day-to-day life as possible. It’s not hard to imagine a day in the near future when people move through the world without carrying wallets or even mobile phones – at least not in their current iteration. I’m optimistic that cryptocurrency would naturally fall into that space."

Investors and traders in cryptocurrency, despite their boasts, will mostly be doing guesswork, and for those with institutional money behind them, it is still a long way off before entirely buying into this digital asset class.Starting with £10,000 in virtual money, players are tasked with building a portfolio of crypto. Those who end up with the most substantial returns are eligible to win cash prizes. Of Fidelity International’s 8,000 staff, 1,200 are already playing, it has been reported.Craig Terrington, the corporate communications associate director at Fidelity International, spoke to me about the Fidelity CryptoLeague.“Fidelity International, like many others in the industry, is actively assessing the wide-ranging potential for blockchain technology, but we do not have any current plans to launch any crypto initiatives,” Terrington stated.“The Fidelity Cryptoleague, an employee-led simulated trading game to have a bit of fun while understanding more about crypto tokens trading, and is part of our culture of learning and focus on innovation.”Furthermore, Fidelity CEO Anne Richards also outlined their game at a conference in June.“We have a bitcoin trading game that we use internally, as a way of teaching people about distributed ledger technology and digital tokenization, which ultimately will be an important part of the whole financial system going forward,” she said.While there are no tangible cryptocurrency offerings in the works, it still once again proves that many enterprises and financial institutions are viewing blockchain and cryptocurrencies as the possible next innovation.For a financial company on the scale of Fidelity International, they also certainly do not want to be left behind, or caught off guard, when the industry does become mainstream and integral to market leading innovation.Terrington also distinguishes between Fidelity International and its Boston-based parent company Fidelity Investments, which has been moving closer to a cryptocurrency product or service.“It’s been widely reported that Boston-based, Fidelity Investments, is active in this space. Fidelity Investments and Fidelity International are separate companies.”Almost readyFidelity Investments has been in the cryptocurrency news often in the past with its CEO, Abigail Johnson, speaking openly and excitedly about cryptocurrencies. Even more so, it has not only been Johnson playing lip service. The company is inching closer to launching a cryptocurrency trading service.It is widely reported just how involved major enterprises are with blockchain technology, as highlighted in the Forbes Blockchain 50 list, but more and more there is evidence of the institutional powerhouses learning about, and entering, the cryptocurrency space.Facebook and it's Libra project is a massive milestone for the adoption of cryptocurrency, but as Fidelity Investments works towards a cryptocurrency service, and even Fidelity International plays games with coins, it seems the question is not if, but when, cryptocurrency will become mainstream."

(AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti, File) photo credit: ASSOCIATED PRESS","Polyient Labs is a Phoenix-based, early-stage blockchain incubator. The incubator was formed in 2018 to help identify and foster blockchain innovations. Since that time, Polyient Labs has raised $5M to fund blockchain-based ideas that can build out the market. The lab currently works with about 10 blockchain startups.With the number of investments into blockchain expected to exceed $60B in the next five years, Brad Robertson, founder and CEO of Polyient Labs, believes that mass adoption of blockchain is already happening. ""A lot of brilliant people recognize blockchain’s value and its potential. I’m not saying there aren’t barriers [..], but that comes with the territory when new technology is introduced,"" said Robertson.On perception and the mediaRobertson believes that one of the most significant barriers for mass adoption is the ongoing perception that cryptocurrencies and blockchain are the same, and he blames the media for that misconception.""They are not the same, but the media treats them as two sides of the same coin and that misunderstanding fuels a lot of anxiety,"" said Robertson.""Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, and so people associate that volatility with blockchain. And I don’t just mean the average consumer. I’ve seen successful entrepreneurs with impressive track records get turned down for business loans because they mention “blockchain” in their business plans,"" adds Roberton. ""Some lenders get nervous because that morning they heard something about bitcoin volatility on the news.""On the topic of industry adoption, Robertson believes a wide variety of sectors and industries are already deeply invested in the technology including healthcare, supply chain management, transportation and financial services.""About 70 percent of the world’s financial services organizations are now exploring blockchain. This is [..] ironic because a few years ago people were wondering if blockchain was scalable and now Fortune 1000 companies are spearheading its adoption.""Robertson believes the next wave of adoption wave will be smaller organizations and nonprofits leveraging blockchain.On trustWhen it comes to the public's trust of blockchain, Robertson is bullish on the 'issues of why' which boils down as he says 'apples and oranges'.""As far as crypto, consumers are right to be a little wary of cryptocurrencies. Most are pretty volatile and - in some cases - flat out scams. Mistrust around some cryptocurrencies is understandable. In 2017, cryptocurrency scams cost investors more than $1.5 billion,"" said Robertson. ""As far as trusting the blockchain, consumers are always a little cautious about new technology, but one of the payoffs in blockchain is it promotes trust.""Robertson says that in the nonprofit sector, people want to see how their contributions are being used and that blockchain’s transparency enables donors to follow the money and see where their donations go. Hackernoon reported on May 6, 2019, that blockchain for non-profits could make positive change from preventing data tampering to better protection from cyberattacks to improved volunteer relations.But the mistrust around cryptocurrencies is still an issue says, Robertson.Facebook groups like Cryptocurrency Academy and Crypto Warriors claim to offer neutral and trustworthy information, but as the industry evolves, those groups are just that, groups on a social network.Robertson calls out CryptoCanary, a peer-to-peer resource where investors can read honest user reviews the same way tourists can turn to TripAdvisor. The app calls out ""If something smells like a scam, the crypto community will aggressively call it out,"" said Robertson. ""There are many dubious crypto projects out there now. Not only is it hard for the crypto-curious to know which projects are scams, but even sophisticated traders can also be taken in. And, as far as safe havens, it’s almost as hard to determine which ones are genuinely safe.""On expectations""I’ve been in the tech sector since the early 1990s. I saw how the internet changed everything. I see the same thing happening now with blockchain. A complete revolution"" added Robertson. ""Crypto is equally revolutionary, but right now, regulatory issues are muddying the waters and hamstringing progress. A clearly defined regulatory policy will give us a clearer picture of the future of crypto.""Robertson says that Polyient Labs is working with a variety of founders who are using blockchain in unique ways from leveraging blockchain to help smaller vendors meet the compliance requirements of their larger corporate customers to an organization that is utilizing blockchain to support smaller local nonprofits gain greater visibility.On climate changeCan blockchain really affect climate change if miners aren't using renewable energy? Robertson says that this is where a distinction needs to be made.""It’s crypto mining that is allegedly leaving behind a disastrous environmental footprint,"" said Robertson. ""I say allegedly because - so far - the facts don’t support the accusation. Last month, CoinShares completed its third annual report on the environmental impact of bitcoin mining, and they determined nearly 75 percent of the energy used in crypto mining comes from wind, solar and hydro-power.""Robertson says that as far as blockchain and its impact on the environment, the World Economic Forum released a report on 65 blockchain use-cases offering the potential to help save the planet.""The crypto industry relies on renewables four times more than other industries,"" said Robertson. On regulationRobertson believes that currently, the lack of clearcut regulations around crypto projects is a barrier.""One of our portfolio companies recently shut down because the direction it was given by regulatory counsel last year didn’t align with what the SEC said this year,"" said Robertson. ""The company didn’t do anything wrong; they just lacked clear regulatory guidance when they launched.""Robertson also believes that many innovative ideas are being stymied because the SEC isn’t providing concrete direction.On July 11, 2019, both Democratic and Republican representatives on the House Financial Services Committee grilled the Federal Reserve Chairman on Facebook's new cryptocurrency Libra, and how the central bank would respond. ""Meanwhile, most developed countries have regulatory guidance in place,"" said Robertson. ""Congressman Warren Davidson recently blasted the SEC for what he called a third-world approach in finalizing a crypto-regulatory policy. If we want to trust embedded in the system and encourage US entrepreneurs, let’s put concrete policies in place.""""It is important that our policymakers fully understand the potential benefits of blockchain, the pros, the cons, and then they can take steps to create an environment that encourages innovation,"" added Robertson."

[+] Bloomberg Technology television interview in San Francisco, California, on Monday, Dec. 19, 2016. The online lending company known as SoFi, which specializes in refinancing student loans, is pushing back plans for an initial public offering in order to focus on developing other business lines, said Cagney. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg","Mike Cagney, the co-founder and former CEO of fintech unicorn Social Finance (SoFi), knows that it is essential to focus on customer experience to build a loyal client base. Today, he is using that knowledge to create a platform aimed at driving mainstream adoption of blockchain technology in the financial sector.After Mike left SoFi in 2017, he launched Figure as a blockchain company that provides Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) of up to $150k to applicants in as little as five days. The team at Figure has long believed that HELOCs are underutilized as a financial tool due to burdensome paperwork and red tape that is sometimes akin to applying for a mortgage itself. The end result is that potential recipients of HELOCs have been forced to utilize credit cards or other lending products with significantly higher interest rates to gain control over their finances.
Since the streamlined HELOC formally launched in October last year, business has been booming, with the company lending an average of $85 million a month, on a blockchain.However, enthusiasts can be forgiven if these figures (pun intended) are surprising, because it is easier to locate the lost city of Atlantis than it is to find the words “blockchain”, “crypto”, or “bitcoin” on any of Figure’s marketing materials.A Bold Marketing DecisionIn direct contrast to the majority of leading blockchain platforms and initiatives today, many of which were recently profiled in the inaugural Forbes Blockchain 50 list, Figure is going out of its way to avoid marketing its HELOC offering as a blockchain-based product.This is a deliberate decision, so it naturally begs the question why.Fortunately , there is a simple explanation. According to Jennifer Mitrenga, Head of Investor Relations and Strategic Initiatives at Figure, the choice was made in order to avoid confusing their customer base, the homeowner, with what they felt was unnecessary and confusing jargon. Taking lessons from Mike’s time at SoFi, she told me that a customer “Doesn’t care whether [a product] is powered by data or blockchain or artificial intelligence. What they care about is that they are going to get a better product in a faster time period and at a cheaper rate.” She went on to say that  “We have specifically not integrated words into the Figure brand around data, AI, and blockchain because it is frankly confusing to the consumer and most consumers do not know the difference between blockchain and bitcoin.”The Tip of the IcebergWith all of that said, it would be a mistake to interpret the avoidance of blockchain nomenclature in marketing materials as a sign of hesitancy or tepidness when it comes to the technology. In fact in late 2018, Figure built a customized and permissioned Proof of Stake blockchain, called Provenance, which will act as a ledger, registry, and exchange for any asset or market. This new protocol, which originally was based on Hyperledger Fabric, has been augmented and customized to support the diverse needs of the financial sector, and it is designed to be nothing short of the dominant, universal, platform in the industry.Adding additional context, Ms. Mitrenga noted that Figure’s “Belief long term is that the global financial services ecosystem is not going to be operating on a handful or a number of protocols.” Rather than being built on top of a constellation of blockchains connected by various interoperability protocols, she thinks that “For the large financial service markets there will be a ubiquitous set of ledger registries and exchanges.”Building an Ecosystem to Drive AdoptionTherefore, upon returning to Figure’s HELOC offering, rather than it being the epicenter of the organizations’ activities, it is really just the first spoke on a wheel, with Provenance being the hub. The hope is that the Figure subsidiary is going to “lead by action” on Provenance. Ms. Mitrenga noted that this was of crucial importance because “The moat in this business isn’t the technology…it’s really the ecosystem component. We have been very intentional about architecting players and networks in the ecosystem today that are reflective of that larger, broader, global enterprise ecosystem that we want to be operating on Provenance.”Driving AheadAs we move into the second half of 2019, Provenance is continuing to moving forward. For instance, the company expects to be securitizing their loans in the third quarter of this year, which will provide additional liquidity and help with scaling. It is also looking into other products and use cases such as on chain assets (commercial paper, bond or debt issuance, and REITs). She also noted that the company has a very robust and engaged community in Asia focused on supply chain finance, and it has been in conversations with well-known firms such as Foxconn looking at to create more efficient financing marketplaces with an eye on small and medium-sized enterprises.Additionally, following the trend of most major players in the industry, Provenance expects to open-source its technology in the next four weeks, along with an SDK and a sandbox.Challenges RemainDespite all of this progress, like all other major enterprise blockchain players, Provenance faces hurdles to long-term success. For instance, while avoiding blockchain terminology in marketing materials can certainly drive consumer adoption, there is a chance that it could also also minimize the developer base that the platform could attract otherwise. A robust developer community is critical to the long-term success of the project as it looks to put more spokes on the wheel, so this will be an important issue to follow.Additionally, Figure has plans to have Provenance operate as an independent entity in the future, but today it is an affiliated company of Figure. For instance, Mike serves as interim Executive Director for Provenance Blockchain Inc. (a Delaware non-stock corporation) as well as CEO of Figure. Figure also holds 72% of the native Hash governance tokens that are utilized on Provenance. However, according to Ms. Mitrenga the intent is for the company to ""sell down their ownership of Hash to a minority position over the next few years, but continue to play a major role in business development and use case expansion over time.""This process will be of critical importance because the relationship between founding companies and ""open-sourced"" or ""independent"" blockchain platforms is not always clear-cut. Furthermore, this ambiguity can sometimes lead to difficult questions from regulators (i.e. Facebook and Libra) and potential private sector partners (i.e. IBM, Maersk, and TradeLens). That said, today, Provenance has 11 globally recognized and trusted financial institutions serving as node stakeholders, which is an auspicious start.A Welcome Addition to the Blockchain IndustryWith all of that said, Figure and Provenance make for an intriguing new player in the blockchain space. Additionally, their focus on consumer experience is a refreshing reminder to the rest of the community about blockchain’s true purpose in the financial sector, which in the words of Ms. Mitrenga are “financial empowerment, financial literacy, and financial access”. "

In her new book, Financially Forward, Alexa von Tobel is on a mission to demystify money in the digital age, breaking down the technologies impacting our wallets and sharing how to best tap into today’s digital tools.","Von Tobel has dedicated her career to ensuring that financial planning is accessible and achievable to all. In 2009, the personal finance guru launched LearnVest, the disruptive financial planning hub dedicated to solving for the industry’s lagging approach to millennials. She departed the company earlier this year to launch the venture firm Inspired Capital, embarking on her next chapter to empower financial growth for others. Alexa von Tobel From investing in tomorrow’s most innovative companies to imparting wisdom on money rules in the digital age, von Tobel continues identify the opportunities enabled by today’s surge of disruption. “Financial change is moving fast, and technology and access to technology helps democratize the current opportunities,” she says. Von Tobel shares here the tools you need to modernize your wallet, whether it’s hacks for automating your finances, her favorite money-saving apps, or how best to navigate new forces from bitcoin to blockchain.Financially Forward focuses on trends that are fundamentally reshaping and influencing our financial future. What are the most underestimated forces at play? There are a number of trends we underestimate — like the simple fact that we’re living longer. It may seem fundamental, but as our life expectancy extends, we need to adjust our financial plans accordingly and identify how we’re going to pay for that time. For many older adults, this has meant leaning into the gig economy for supplemental income well into their “golden years.” The stats show that nearly one in five Americans over the age of 65 still works (at least part-time) and the Bureau of Labor predicts that by 2024, more than one-third of 65-69 year olds will be working. The trend I’m most fascinated by is the gig economy and I think our concept of work has fundamentally shifted. We can now monetize every hour of our lives, if we so choose, and our career paths are far more fluid. One in five employers offers a formal sabbatical program, and “adult gap year” yields over 122 million Google search results. I’m excited by the flexibility we have around work, but financial plans will need to catch up quickly.Against this ever-changing landscape from bitcoin to blockchain, how do people gain a comfort level with this new financial world and decipher hype versus reality? Because financial services has always been full of jargon, so much of the work is breaking through the noise to understand what’s really going on—that’s why I include a plain-english blockchain glossary in Financially Forward and I why talk about cryptocurrency after the financial planning basics. It’s important for people to have a level of familiarity with cryptocurrencies, but I’m not one to recommend running out to buy Bitcoin as your first or even second financial priority. It’s still very volatile, and there is a lot of hype.That said, I’m incredibly optimistic about blockchain more broadly and its potential to transform how we as consumers transact and interact with our money. From eliminating middle men, to creating smarter contracts and enabling more security, there’s no doubt blockchain-driven disruptions could radically change the way we think about value.How can the unique realities of this new financial world help to close the investing gap for women specifically?Women have massive purchasing power and are often the ones controlling household spending, so there is a tremendous opportunity for women to adopt all of these new financial technologies and leverage these market trends to our advantage. It’s crazy to think about, but a single woman couldn’t even get a credit card on her own until the Equal Credit Opportunity Act in 1974 (less than fifty years ago!). Now we’re talking about digital currency. Financial change is moving fast and I think technology, and access to technology, helps democratize the current opportunities.Financially Forward by Alexa von TobelFinancially Forward offers practical advice to optimize financial planning. What’s one easy-to-adopt life hack that can have major ROI in taking control of your finances?I always tell people to use calendar alerts to help manage their finances and check in on their financial plan throughout that year. I have a separate Google calendar just for key moments where action is required on my family’s finances. For example, I have a calendar reminder each January to do a financial refresh with my husband and prep our taxes and each quarter, I have a reminder to check my credit for free on a site like CreditKarma.com. It’s a simple tool but it allows you to avoid missing important deadlines and stay on track to meet your financial goals.You recommend putting your savings and spending on “autopilot.” How do you avoid an out of sight, out of mind mentality? Automating is all about saving you time. When you do it effectively, you can rest assured that you’ve put tons of brain power into figuring out where those dollars should go — not wasting energy on transferring money each month. As it relates to savings, we all know how tempting it can be to spend money if you see it every day in your checking account. If you automate things like retirement and savings contributions, you’re usually less likely to make excuses and use that money for something else. While I do recommend auto-payments for credit cards as well, there’s definitely a caveat - you must check your transactions before paying! You can either set calendar reminders before your bill is due to read through your transactions, or commit to doing this daily. I’m personally a big fan of the daily money minute and suggest putting your financial tracker app right next to Instagram to help build that regular habit.Financially Forward shares simple tools on your phone that can help put more money back into/keep more money in your wallet. What are your can’t-live-without money apps?There are so many and new ones everyday! A few I love:"

Photo credit: ASSOCIATED PRESS","President Donald Trump will sign a bill by the end of the year to fix the troubled pension plans of over one million of union workers who typically work at several employers during a year such as truckers and bakers, House Ways & Means Committee Chair Massachusetts Democrat Richard Neal predicted this morning.But the lead Republican on the committee, Texan Kevin Brady isn’t so sure.Ways & Means passed a Neal-crafted bill this afternoon on a party-line vote to help secure the retirement benefits for millions of union workers covered by multiemployer plans.He said he expects the legislation will pass the full House by the end of July.However, Brady called the bill “dead on arrival” in the Senate.“It has a lot of flaws,” said Brady who chaired Ways & Means when the Republicans held the House the last time.He added the bill is probably too extreme to be a starting point for a bipartisan solution.A special Senate committee charged with finding a solution to the multiemployer pension problem last year failed to agree on a cure.Neal’s legislation would establish the Pension Rehabilitation Administration under the Treasury Department which would be able to make loans to troubled plans.If the pension plans were unable to pay back the debt, the agency could forgive a portion of the principal.The Ways & Means Chair said he has spoken to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin twice about the issue.“He acknowledged the depth of the problem. I am not going to say he endorsed my bill,” said Neal.The Congressman added two weeks ago he met with Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation chief Gordon Hartogensis.“He applauded our efforts,” said the legislator.Neal called his bill the only game in town.Neal’s legislation became a target board for Republicans during an hours-long Ways & Means session,South Carolina’s Tom Rice attacked it as a bill of goods that won’t protect future workers.Ohio Republican Brad Wenstrup faulted the bill for not ensuring long term stability for the Teamsters’ Central States Pension plans and other union pension vehicles.Texan Jodey Arlington called the loans toxic, like the exotic loans that led to the financial crisis.Wisconsin Democrat Ron Kind warned without a fix, Central States will be insolvent in five years.Countering the claims of Republican the bill will not be passed in the upper chamber, Kind said it will force the Senate’s hand.The legislation has the support of the AFL-CIO.""This fix is urgently needed. Hundreds of thousands of working people spent a lifetime earning a secure retirement, only to see that future hang by a thread. Pensions are a promise—it's time for Congress to take action and keep that promise."" said AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler, the second-ranking national officer.Almost 10 million workers are in multiemployer plans with roughly1.3 million in plans  in danger of running out of money."

On average, firms emerge from bankruptcy with over one-quarter fewer employees than they had prior to filing for bankruptcy.While noting there is too little data to determine the impact of M&As and bankruptcies generally on pensions, the study said a restructuring can harm the financial well-being of workers and retirees by cutting or eliminating benefits.There were about 121 million participants in retirement plans sponsored by individual employers in 2016, including about 25.6 million participants in defined benefit plans, and about 95.5 million participants in 401(K)s, according to the Department of Labor.To see the full report, click on: http://bit.ly/2Y2EKQc "

With customers in mind, Amazon Web Services (AWS) decided to cater to both sides in its blockchain endeavors.Customers And A Centralized ApproachFor some individuals, the aspect of decentralization may not be as vital as it is to other parties. AWS discovered that some ""customers wanted an immutable verifiable record of every change that had taken place, but they were okay with centralized trust,"" AWS blockchain GM Rahul Pathak told me in an interview.Catering to this type of customer, AWS created Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB). ""The idea is that you have a cryptographically verifiable, immutable, tamper-proof ledger that you can query and interact with, but that is owned by a single entity,"" Pathak said. This type of solution is effective for ""cases where you'd want to audit trails, but don't care about distributed trust,"" Pathak explained.Customers And DecentralizationAddressing a crowd seeking a more decentralized approach, however, AWS also built the Amazon Managed Blockchain. This group of customers desired the ""ledger"", without one single player owning the operation, Pathak explained. ""They did want a decentralized trust model,"" Pathak said. ""There we saw the need to offer Managed Blockchain, and we really focus on the enterprise blockchain use cases for private and permissioned blockchains.""AWS announced the preview for both of these models, centralized and decentralized, in late November of 2018, according to a press release. At the time of the July 3, 2019 interview with me, Pathak noted, ""Quantum Ledger Database, QLDB, is still in preview,"" while ""Amazon Managed Blockchain went into General Availability at the end of April."" While in preview, customers can gain free access to these projects by filling out a form and signing up, an AWS representative clarified via email. When released for General Availability, anyone can use them.""Our Managed Blockchain service supports Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum,"" Pathak added.  Amazon Managed Blockchain launched usage with the Hyperledger Fabric framework in late April 2019 with Ethereum availability coming up, he noted.Customer Usage TrendsBased on customers' applications of the blockchain services from AWS, the cloud service provider has picked up on a few use case trends, Pathak noted. Telecom giant AT&T and food industry powerhouse Nestle are examining the tech for their respective supply chains to enhance elements such as ""traceability and transparency,"" Pathak mentioned.Investment holding company Singapore Exchange (SGX) is utilizing Amazon Managed Blockchain and Hyperledger Fabric to improve settlement and financial asset clearing times, Pathak said.Additionally, ""Sony Music in Japan just announced that they'll be using the service for their digital and music rights management platform,"" Pathak detailed.AWS blockchain customers also include the likes of Guardian Life Insurance evaluating using the tech in the payments category, as well as Legal & General's use of Amazon's Managed Blockchain with Hyperledger Fabric in the area of ""pension deals and annuities,"" Pathak said.Introducing Forbes Blockchain 50: Learn about the companies investing in the tech that will speed up business processes, increase transparency and potentially save billions of dollars. "

Sun, is also the CEO of BitTorrent, acquiring the platform May last year for $140 million.I thought it would be interesting to find out more information about the specifics of the meeting. So, I reached out to Sun with some questions, here’s what he had to say.Why did you want to meet with Warren Buffett?Justin Sun: First of all, meeting Warren Buffett is one of the best opportunities to introduce a large group of people to cryptocurrency and blockchain. People who hear about the lunch or will hear about it may want to know more about the industry. I also want to build a bridge between the blockchain community and institutional investors. Knowledge transfer between the two groups can help both sides. What do you hope to accomplish from the meeting?Justin Sun: I get to sit down with one of the most accomplished American businessmen in history, I get to talk to him about his long term value investment strategy, and I get to discuss the great potential of blockchain. I think the lunch will be a great moment for pretty much everyone there. I don’t think we can convince him that all crypto and blockchain is good, but I hope he walks away knowing more about the industry and its potential. Do you have any set discussion topics for the meeting?Justin Sun: I think we’ll see where the conversation goes. Obviously, we’ll talk about blockchain, talk about TRON and BitTorrent and talk about where Mr. Buffett sees the global economy going. Everything else will come naturally, I hope. Will you try to persuade Warren Buffett to invest in crypto?Justin Sun: I’m not sure how much I can persuade him in three hours or less. I will point him to the recent moves by other big companies to embrace crypto. J.P. Morgan, IBM and now Facebook are all jumping into the market based on its promise of borderless commerce and decentralized finance. If Warren Buffett invested in crypto ...Justin Sun: I think it would be another proof point and shot in the arm for the industry. Ultimately, whether we go through boom or bust over the long term depends on what kind of use cases we can create that resonate with large audiences. Are there any new interesting developments underway at TRON?Justin Sun:  I try to tell the community very often (some people say too often!) what we’re up to. We are rolling out BitTorrent Speed. We’re still working on a great experience for BitTorrent Live and on creating a stronger, faster and more reliable TRON blockchain platform. There’s a number of partnerships we hope to announce soon. Stay tuned!"

[+] for consumers.","Remitly, a Seattle startup that helps immigrants in developed countries send money home to family and friends in developing nations, is raising new funding to tackle the $700 billion money-transfer market. It secured $135 million in equity financing and $85 million in debt at a valuation just shy of $1 billion, according to a person familiar with the deal. Generation, a sustainability-focused investment firm cofounded by Al Gore, is leading the equity round. Additional investors include Swiss asset manager Schroders, Naspers’ PayU and Stripes Group, among others. To date, Remitly has raised $312 million in equity investment.Matt Oppenheimer, 37, started Remitly in 2011 after running internet and mobile banking at Barclays in Kenya. He recruited engineer Shivaas Gulati and Josh Hug, an entrepreneur who had recently sold a startup to Amazon, as cofounders. Initially, they focused on one market, letting immigrants living in America send money to the Philippines. Today they let consumers ship cash from 16 developed nations like the U.S., the U.K. and Australia to 44 developing countries including Mexico, El Salvador and Rwanda. Like most other fintech companies, Remitly leans on technology to lower costs. It owns no retail outlets. Customers can only initiate a transfer digitally, although on the receiving end in developing countries, Remitly partners with cash-pickup locations. It makes money by charging transaction fees and marking up foreign exchange rates. Fees vary widely by country, but on average, Remitly charges about 1.5% for a transfer, Forbes estimates. Western Union, which owns many brick-and-mortar locations and brought in $852 million in profit last year, charges roughly 5%. Remitly has grown revenue nearly 100% annually over the past three years, reaching an estimated $80 million in 2018 and recently earning a spot on Forbes’ Fintech 50 list. Oppenheimer will use his new $85 million in debt to help speed up money transfers. Remitly can pre-fund some transfers with this line of credit, letting customers in developing countries receive cash minutes after someone in another nation presses send on her smartphone or computer. For the $135 million in equity financing, Oppenheimer has two targets: international expansion and new financial services products. In 2018 and 2019, Remitly entered 34 new countries, and he doesn’t expect to slow down. He won’t say what Remitly’s second product will be, but he aims to solve other pain points for immigrants and hints at possibilities. “Think about being a migrant in a developed country,” he says. “Without a credit history, how do you get loans? How do you get a bank account? Insurance? How do you manage your wealth? Those are the kind of areas we hear about from customers.”"

off a ...","Jul 16, 2019,02:29am EDT",How long would you wait in reception for a meeting?,"Here’s a question most of us have faced in our careers: how long would you be prepared to wait in reception if you arrive to find that your meeting is starting late? 10 minutes? 30 minutes? An hour, even? Little problems always point to big problems. Chronic lateness can point to a lack of discipline in a culture or an ability to prioritize. Worse, it can signify an unhealthy desire to exert passive-aggressive control over others. Worse still, a deliberate lack of punctuality suggests disrespect and an underlying belief that someone’s time is not important. A business where meetings routinely run late is undermining its ability to be responsive, resilient and innovative.Are your meetings prompt, priority-focused and productive? They need to be. According to the HBR, meetings now swallow up nearly 23 hours a week for the average executive. (To put it another way: halve your total salary bill and that’s the approximate cost of your meetings.) The debate about meeting productivity often misses the point that all businesses need to talk to each other. But whether a business is talking to itself in the right way is a question that doesn’t get asked well enough, often enough.The use and abuse of meetings tell you a lot about how well a business is being run. Here are the 10 signs of bad meetings. 1. Carrying dead weight. Do your meetings carry lots of people whose contribution might be charitably described as ""minimal?"" Imagine you were paying for everyone to attend your meeting, in real time, in cash. If the honest answer is that your money might be better spent elsewhere, your business might lack an ability to prioritize.2. Presentation not conversation. The currency of contemporary business is PowerPoint. Like bitcoin, this currency can seesaw wildly in value. In general, problem-solving relies on open, honest discussion. Reading bullet points off a chart rarely provides this. An over-reliance on presentation can point to decision-making paralysis.3. Giving introverts no voice. Introverts are often the most creative thinkers in any group–but keeping their thoughts and ideas to themselves helps no-one. If your meetings don't bring introverts out of their shell, your business may be failing to capitalize on the productive capacity of some of its most valuable assets.4. Failing to understand that silence is golden.  Silence is often the sound of thought happening and it isn’t awkward–unless you are creating a context in which it is. Another way of putting it: good conversations don’t need to be relentless ones. Fear of silence points to fear of conflict and fear of the unknown. Both are significant performance inhibitors.5. Tolerating showboating or pointless contrariness. Arguments can be constructive. In fact, getting good at disagreement is a major enabler of organizational performance. But showboating is not disagreement, it’s an exercise for the ego. An organization that fails to get showboaters walking the plank is undermining its ability to perceive problems clearly.6. Allowing meetings to go on for too long. Short is good: people are not psychologically programmed for marathon conversations. Clearly, not all decisions are immediate but rather than a 60-minute meeting about eight things, might it be better to think about holding eight micro-meetings that last six minutes, with short breaks in between? Failure to think laterally about how time is used predicts failure to create the conditions for high performance.7. Operating to no agenda, or a bad one. The agenda is one of the most misunderstood items in business. A list of topics will not get you that far, for the simple reason that they lack context. What are your objectives? How is this meeting contributing to them? Equally importantly, what could go wrong in the room? Negotiating the agenda while in the meeting suggests an inability to think clearly about which problems need solving.8. Agreeing no action points, failing to document them or follow them up. File this under ""basic survival threat.""9. Failing to think about different meeting modes. What applies in a brainstorm doesn’t apply in a sales presentation. But how often are you imposing the same meeting structure, or expecting the same results from different meeting modes? Failure to segment meetings predicts failure to operate efficiently.10. Playing the same old roles. A bit like families at Christmas, people in meetings cleave to type. There’s the patriarch, the jester, the down-to-earth questioner and so on. If you can describe your role in meetings in three words or fewer, you are limiting your ability to contribute. “I’m Mr Common Sense” is all very well and ego-nourishing, but slipping into these roles is often counterproductive. It predicts an inability to think differently. If any of the above apply, your meetings aren’t working as well as they could be. The question is, what are you going to do about it? And if you’re on the outside, what will be your response the next time you get left waiting in reception? (For those wondering, the correct answer is: leave after 10 minutes, then send them this article.)"

Anyone presenting a unit of specified foreign exchange will get a proportional unit of Libra. For example, one dollar might get one Libra, one euro 1.1 Libras, 66 Indian rupees one Libra, and so on, based on the price Libra advertises in various global currencies. In the archetypical monetary arrangement of the colonial period, in the hundred years prior to the second World War, colonial currencies were available at a set rate to anyone presenting the British pound sterling.","These two are emulating the major elements of the monetary system of yore, as if we need it again.... [+] Photocredit: GettyThis practice came to be known as a ""currency board."" It fits the Libra proposal to a T. The idea under colonialism was that an independent local currency might not have very wide purchase, even in its own area. It might be overprinted, unrecognizable to many economic agents, and preferred less than more major currencies. The way to guarantee the local currency was to make handing over the pound (or in places, the dollar, the French franc, or gold) the only way of getting it. The currency board accepted the pound in exchange for the local currency unit, and vice versa. Internally, that unit was accepted as the pound would be. Externally, one returned the local unit to the currency board and got the globally accepted pound, on demand and automatically.It was precisely the high degree of ""automaticity"" of the currency boards that won over the public. Under a currency board, a local currency was automatically equivalent to the dominant global currency, the pound. Furthermore, no central bank at the local currency level was called for. All monetary production proceeded from the presentation of foreign exchange at the currency board.The main effect came in terms of investment. Investors piled into currency-board areas on the understanding that returns would come in the world's top currency. The economic results were increases in opportunities and prosperity.There was a devil in the details. A currency board necessarily collected a large amount of pound sterling. A pile of the best currency has its temptations—namely for the local potentate to abscond with it, whatever the effects on the local issue from that point forward. With every success of a currency board came a greater temptation to abrogate the whole thing and pocket the foreign exchange.The colonial context was, therefore, essential to the functioning of currency boards. If ever a local currency board made off with British pounds, Britain itself could mete out punishments. These might include applying British law to the offending party, denying the convertibility of local notes, freezing out the area from imperial trade preferences, and pressing British power and prerogatives at the expense of local authorities. Such potential sanctions were enough to keep the currency-board reserves intact and untouched. Indeed, they were often held in Britain itself. This drove the point home: no touching these things.Modern currency boards, those that persisted or arose after 1945, lacked the oversight that faded with decolonization. The guarantees of the high-quality foreign-exchange stashes of currency boards had to come, if at all, in different forms.The most successful modern currency-board area is Hong Kong, which has maintained a U.S. dollar currency board for decades. Hong Kong has a fantastic incentive not to raid its dollar stash. Hong Kong is one of the very richest and freest places in the world and a shining example of what its immense neighbor China might aspire to be. Raiding its currency-board reserves would amount to self-mutilation on heroic scale.Other examples, though, follow a different course. Argentina has operated with a dollar-based currency board. After periods of success, though, the temptation has proven too great for certain challenged Argentine leaders not to liquidate the reserves. Inevitably the reserve raids fund vote-buying schemes suggestive of Juan Perón's diminution of the country's immense gold stock of the World War II era for just that purpose.Argentina is not part of a colonial structure, because such things now belong to the ages, so it nominally gets away with this sort of behavior. The pale shadow of colonial watchfulness is the International Monetary Fund, created as it was in 1944 on the expectation of decolonization. Argentina has no problem taking on an international-organization paper tiger on the order of the IMF. The British Empire at its apogee, the IMF certainly is not.Currency boards really worked under colonialism. In modern times, they work according to the widely varying local levels of determination that they work. Facebook's Libra consortium aspires to be a currency board accepting all sorts of high-level foreign exchange. The requirements and problems that come with currency boards are still there in this case.Obviously, there is no imperial structure mandating that the Libra currency board work. This is no small matter, given that this was the secret to the superior functioning of currency boards during their high season. Conceivably there is a substitute in the rule of law. Libra is based in Geneva, Switzerland, and promises to warehouse its reserves across important places in the developed world. This confers a strong sense that any attempt to make off with reserves, on the part of the Libra partnership, would face the brunt of the developed world's contract and larceny laws.Yet if Libra succeeds, its owners should be paid, and perhaps getting paid will be misconstrued as larceny. If Libra really succeeds, its reserves will be phenomenally large, perhaps much larger than any other corporate or personal fortune ever seen. There is no extant legal structure, even in the leading members of the advanced world, that has had to deal with that kind of scale of monetary ownership. Governments might get jealous; they are supposed to be the ones, they tell themselves, with the final claim on financial resources.This knotty problem might be seen as introducing the reverse of the classical currency board problem. The major nations might want to get their hands on the Libra reserve. Central banks are prepared to act along these lines as a matter of course. If, say, Libra were required to keep a fraction of its reserves with the Federal Reserve—and the current hearings are giving this impression—by that institution's authority it could up reserve requirements tantamount to confiscating Libra's holdings.This would represent a warping of the colonial precedent. Here major countries would prevent peripheral organizations from taking advantage of the global acceptability of their currencies. Colonial currency boards sought to do the opposite, to guarantee peripheral issues by making them equivalents of things like the pound and the dollar. Libra runs a clear risk of having the sovereigns of its reserve-asset issues raid those issues. In the face of such a prospect, we could do with a dash of colonialism again, of noblesse oblige, of letting people do good things with the dollar, the euro, etc. if they are able.Libra amounts to a major-currency exchange-traded fund. Like Bitcoin before it, which emulates gold, Libra is emulating currency boards. It is uncanny how the paradigmatic industries of the twenty-first century in technology and computer science are marking out the nature of the currency systems of the past, against official bewilderment that there is any need for such a thing."
