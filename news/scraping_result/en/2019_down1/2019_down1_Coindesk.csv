prospects of a renewed push toward recent highs above $13,000.","Jul 12, 2019 at 11:01 UTC",View,"Bitcoin has bounced up from historically strong price support, raising the prospects of a renewed push toward recent highs above $13,000.The cryptocurrency market leader had been on the defensive in the Asian trading hours today, looking set for a drop below $11,000 after a failure to capitalize on a falling wedge breakout seen yesterday.The move below $11,000, however, remained elusive with the cryptocurrency finding takers around the three-day chart 10-candle moving average (MA) support – then located at $11,150 – and rose to a high of $11,797 soon before the press time.The $600 bounce from the 10-candle MA could be a sign the pullback from the weekly high of $13,200 has ended.The 10-candle MA has consistently acted as strong support, reversing corrections throughout the rally from February lows near $3,500 to June highs near $13,800, according to Bitstamp data.So, if history is a guide, BTC could rise all the way back to the July 10 high of $13,200 in the next few days.As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $11,673 on Bitstamp, representing a 1.3 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. The 10-candle MA on the three-day chart is now located at $11,167.This year, BTC first found acceptance above the 10-candle MA on Feb. 9 and the technical line has acted as strong support ever since.For instance, the cryptocurrency traded in a sideways manner
along the average line for almost a month before witnessing a 21 percent rise
to levels above $5,000 in early April.The 10-candle MA also fueled strong price gains in early May and June (marked by arrows). What's more, the sell-off from the June 26 high of $13,880 ran out of steam near the key average on July 2 and prices rose back to $13,200.All-in-all, there is a strong reason to believe that the latest bounce from the 10-candle MA will be extended further toward recent highs.BTC closed below $11,550 yesterday, confirming buyer exhaustion signaled by the previous day's bearish outside day candle.

Even so, the cryptocurrency is better bid at press time, as mentioned above.The focus would shift back to the bearish outside reversal if prices fall back below the 10-candle MA, currently at $11,167. In that case, the support at $10,769 (July 5 low) could come into play.The outlook would turn bearish only if prices print a UTC close below $9,615 (July 2 low), invalidating the bullish higher lows pattern.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading ViewThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The price of ...","Jul 15, 2019 at 11:40 UTC",Bitcoin has come under pressure ahead of the U.S. governmental hearings on Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency on July 16 and 17.,"The price of a single bitcoin, which stood near $13,000 five days ago, fell below $10,000 earlier today and tested the 50-day moving average at $9,900 for the first time since February 18.Facebook’s head of Calibra – one of the entities set up to govern and develop the crypto project – David Marcus is scheduled testify to lawmakers on the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday.The upcoming scrutiny of Libra may be weighing over bitcoin. After all, past data shows BTC tends to drop ahead of congressional hearings related to cryptocurrencies and rise on favorable outcomes.Last year, for instance, BTC fell from $6,820 to $6,070 in five days to July 12, before rallying to $7,400 on July 18 when the House Committee on Financial Services gathered for a hearing on “crypto as a new form of money”.More importantly, the cryptocurrency remained bid in the following days and rose to a high of $8,500 on July 24 (according to Bitstamp data) because the hearing didn’t take an overly negative tone.On similar lines, BTC dropped from $12,000 to $6,000 in the 10 days leading up to a congressional hearing on Feb. 6, 2018, where the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman and the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission testified before the Senate Banking Committee. That hearing was also surprisingly positive and BTC rose back to levels above $11,700 by Feb. 20.Going further back, the price action seen ahead of bitcoin’s first congressional hearing on Nov. 18, 2013, was slightly different in the sense that the cryptocurrency was solidly bid, rising from $85 to $650 in six weeks leading up to the event.Again the hearing on the growing popularity of virtual currencies wasn’t anti-crypto, allowing BTC to extend the rally to highs above $1,150 on Nov. 30.Facebook’s fiat and government bond backed cryptocurrency Libra is widely considered a net positive for bitcoin, an anti-establishment asset.This is evident from the fact that BTC rallied from $9,000 to $13,800 in the eight days following Facebook’s unveiling of Libra’s white paper on June 18.So, it is hardly surprising that the leading cryptocurrency is feeling the pull of gravity ahead of the congressional hearings on Libra and will likely take a hit if the U.S. lawmakers throw a spanner in the works for Facebook.It is worth noting that the likes of the Federal Reserve President Jerome Powell have already called for a halt to Facebook’s project until concerns from privacy to money laundering are addressed. President Trump also criticized the project in tweets last week.BTC, however, may rise well past $13,800 and possibly hit record highs before the end of the third quarter if the hearings are more optimistic.A far as the technical charts are concerned, the short-term outlook will remain bullish as long as prices hold above $9,614 (July 2 low).As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $10,300 on Bitstamp, representing 4.86 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.A UTC close below $9,614 would invalidate the bullish higher-lows pattern and confirm a bullish-to-bearish trend change.That looks likely with the three-day chart reporting a bearish divergence of the relative strength index (RSI). The indicator has also dived out of the ascending trendline, signaling the end of the rally from December lows.Further, the previous three-candle closed well below the 10-candle moving average, a level which acted as strong support throughout the rise from $3,500 to $13,880, as discussed on Friday.The long upper wicks attached to two out of the last three candles indicates bullish exhaustion and so does the bearish divergence of the RSI.All-in-all, the charts are biased for a drop to $9,097 (May 30 high), unless the congressional hearings are more positive than expected. In that case, prices may rise above $13,800, signaling a continuation of the rally.BTC has recovered from lows near $9,850 to $10,300. The bearish lower-highs pattern, however, is still intact. Prices may rise to $11,200 in the next 24 hours if the cryptocurrency invalidates the bearish lower highs pattern with a move above $10,732.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.U.S. Capitol image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

CoinDesk reported on a golden cross for bitcoin’s daily chart back in April.Seasoned traders often refer to that long-term bull market signal as a lagging indicator. After all, the MA studies are based on historical data and tend to lag prices, which also means they have limited predictive abilities at best.While that is true for most crossovers, the one that is about to happen on the three-day chart has proved its mettle as a reliable bull market indicator in the past.The 50- and 200-candle MAs produced a bullish crossover in three days to Feb. 3, 2016, following which bitcoin’s price charted its way to a record high of $20,000 by December 2017.A closer look at the chart reveals that the low of $360 printed a few weeks before the golden crossover was never put to test again. In fact, the 50-candle MA consistently reversed pullbacks (marked by arrows) throughout the rise from $360 (February 2016 low) to the record high of $20,000.What’s more, the bullish crossover happened five months ahead of the mining reward halving of July 2016 and 13 months after bitcoin bottomed out near $150.This time the MAs are about to produce a bull cross at least three quarters ahead of the reward halving, due sometime in May 2020, and seven months after the bear market ran out of steam near $3,100.As of writing, the upward sloping (bullish) 50-candle MA is located at $6,566 and the 200-candle MA is flatlined at $7,438.The golden crossover will likely happen before the month end, unless prices drop all the way back to $5,000, dragging the 50-candle MA lower. That, however, is unlikely to happen anytime soon.If history is a guide, then the confirmation of the golden crossover could be followed by a rally to record highs above $20,000. Further, throughout the rally, the 50-candle MA will likely serve as strong support.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bull’s eye image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

Trump tweeted Thursday that he is “not a fan” of cryptocurrencies, saying they were “not money” and referencing their price volatility relative to the dollar in his first public comments on crypto since becoming president of the United States.","Trump also criticized Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency project in subsequent tweets, saying it “will have little standing or dependability” and suggesting U.S. regulators would subject the social media giant to regulation:“If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new Banking Charter and become subject to all Banking Regulations, just like other Banks, both National […] and International.”(Facebook subsidiary Calibra, which is supposed to develop an open-source wallet for the cryptocurrency, has registered as a money services business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.)Trump has criticized Facebook in the past for its actions in banning right-wing figureheads, alongside other social media outlets. To date, however, he has not discussed Facebook’s cryptocurrency plans. The company first publicly released its white paper and supporting documentation for Libra last month.The 45th president held a “social media summit” earlier on Thursday, addressing these concerns.Regulators and lawmakers across the U.S. have taken notice of Libra, with both the U.S. Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee scheduling hearings next week with Facebook’s blockchain lead David Marcus.The Senate committee in particular has previously expressed concerns about Facebook’s track record with user data and privacy, writing an open letter to the company in May. Marcus responded to the letter earlier this week, telling the lawmakers that Facebook would not itself collect any personal financial credentials.On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell also said that Libra should not be allowed to move forward unless and until the company addresses anti-money laundering and know-your-customer concerns, among other issues.Financial stability is also a factor that Powell addressed, with lawmakers in both houses questioning the fact that Facebook has set up an entity in Switzerland affiliated with the project.Facebook declined to comment on Trump’s comments.In his tweets Thursday, Trump took aim at the potential for using cryptocurrencies in illegal activities, citing drug trafficking in particular.“Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity,” he said.In a final tweet, he added:“We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever, both dependable and reliable. It is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the World, and it will always stay that way. It is called the United States Dollar!”While Trump himself had yet to weigh in on cryptocurrencies prior to Thursday, his Treasury Secretary has been a strong proponent of greater cryptocurrency regulations.Steven Mnuchin has been calling for greater crypto regulation since the beginning of 2018, calling on the G20 to take up the issue during an (at the time) upcoming meeting in March.This year, the Financial Action Task Force published guidance for central banks, calling for stringent know-your-customer information collection practices. The U.S. Treasury Department held the FATF presidency until the end of June.“We will not allow cryptocurrency to become the equivalent of secret numbered accounts [and] we will allow for proper use, but we will not tolerate the continued use for illicit activities,” Mnuchin said in remarks prior to the rules’ publication.In contrast, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney has previously called for a more lenient regulatory framework, saying, “if we over-regulate and discourage people from entering the marketplace, that has bad consequences.”Donald Trump image via Shutterstock"

After sending funds to the ATMs using exchanges, the group would then insert cash in the machines to receive a QR code to claim cryptocurrency from those exchanges. They would then give those funds to drug traffickers in Colombia.Now, Spanish officials must prove the link between the Bitcoin ATMs and the confiscated digital funds during the operation — a difficult feat without the aid of crypto-specific regulation or European law guidelines regarding this type of crime.Nonetheless, the regulatory picture in Spain is beginning to take firmer shape, especially in light of a recent court determination.This week the Supreme Court of Spain dictated that bitcoin is not money. The legal precedent was set in a fraud case where claimants demanded to have their bitcoins reimbursed, having the initial value of their investment returned in euros instead.The ruling was based in regulations from 2011, which state that digital money is “the monetary value stored in electronic or magnetic means that represent a credit over the issuer”.According to the entity, bitcoin lacks the legal consideration of money, being classified as a ” patrimonial immaterial asset” subjected to supply and market demand.Bitcoin ATM in Los Angeles image via Shutterstock"

This eliminates the risk of cryptocurrency volatility for merchants, while expanding pool of potential clients who would prefer to transact in bitcoin.The protocol integrates with existing payments systems in a merchant’s POS, dealing “directly with prepaid access programs like gift cards, store credit, rails or other options merchants are used to accepting,” said Will Reeves, CEO of Fold.To be clear there is no direct connection between Fold and any of these big merchants. Transactions show up in fiat on a company’s balance sheet as either gift card purchases or store credit, depending on how Fold integrates with a particular POS. This integration requires “no effort on the merchant’s side,” and does not require the installation of new hardware or software.Fold began working on this P2P feature last year, according to Reeves, who saw lightning network transactions as a way to onboard consumers to use cryptocurrency not just as a store of value, but a payment route.“Customers navigate to the Fold app, where they are presented with a list of available merchants. They then select the denomination and how much they want to spend,” said Reeves. Fold is non-custodial and allows clients to operate any wallet of their choosing. Once an invoice is populated, it “immediately displays a barcode or other payment method” generated via the merchant’s own gift card API.The process allegedly takes 30 seconds.We’re thrilled to announce Lightning payments within Fold.

To this end, we build products that make spending bitcoin a no-brainer, making it as easy to use, rewarding and widely accepted as a credit card,” Reeves wrote in a company statement.Fold will not charge fees for the service, but expects to receive a margin of the transaction from merchants for bringing in new customers. The company “generates revenue,” ands is “not venture reliant,” Reeves said.The startup is currently being incubated by thesis.co, a venture production studio, and has “thousands of users, with tens of thousands in transaction volume across the globe,” said Reeves. Though he said the majority of users are based in the United States.The firm previously unveiled “Lightning Pizza,” a service to order Domino’s pizza through the lightning network in February.Going forward, the company will introduce a product update that will provide ways for Fold clients to earn bitcoin by using the app.Online shopping image via CoinDesk archives"

As such, technologists have long tried to chip away at this problem with technology that ranges from privacy browser Tor to the walkie-talkie messaging app Zello, the latter of which Venezuelans used to read information that’s uncontrolled by the government and to organize protests a few years back.A more recent effort is being waged by a small but global group of developers who are sending messages using satellites paired with software from the bitcoin technology startup Blockstream, initially deployed with the grand goal of allowing people worldwide access to bitcoin even if they didn’t have internet.Passionate hobbyists around the world have re-purposed this technology to send out news that — theoretically — can’t be censored by corporations or governments.Bitcoin plays a crucial role in this scenario because the messages themselves need to be paid for. That’s because users can’t send as many messages as they want, given the space limitations for such content. And using bitcoin, which by design is censorship-resistant, makes more sense than a paying with other digital payment systems, which could hypothetically be shut down by the same parties that are trying to censor the messages.One pseudonymous bitcoiner going by the moniker SafetyFirst has broadcasted dozens bundles of news, a package he dubs “BlockSat.” They’re calling it a test for “proof of news,” a play on the phrase “proof of work.”The idea is that once the messages are aired, the messages are distributed across the globe. Anyone, as long as they have a satellite receiver that costs approximately $100, can receive them.As SafetyFirst argued in a tweet:“The future of open access to information is happening right in-front of our eyes.”In a message to CoinDesk, he elaborated on the idea: “It seemed like info you can receive without any third party interference would be of value to parts of the world where information controls (by the government or anyone) try to stifle […] access to news, information, or anything in between.”Using satellites to stop censorship is actually far from a new idea.For example, in 2012, hacker activist Nick Farr put out a call to action that led to the creation of the Hackerspace Global Grid (HGG), an effort to fuel research of uncensorable communications via satellite. Hobbyists then deployed miniature satellites, called CubeSats, into space.“Since the founding of the Chaos Computer Club, we stand for the human right of free (at least) worldwide communication. [Glass] fiber located on federal territories could become a problem for unhampered communication. People in charge could shut them down to produce a congestion. The task of the Hackerscene is to establish communication ways, that do not stop at borders. The creation of earth near networks, where governments cannot interact with, is one big role for free communication,” the original call to action explained.Let’s go back to how they work. As CoinDesk explained in an earlier article about such transmissions, users are mostly using the simple website spacebit.live to send the messages by satellite with just a small fee paid in BTC.“The news is immutable in the fact that anyone worldwide with a basic satellite dish, some software, and a little knowledge can receive it. No controls on internet, cellular data, or state control can stifle it. There are numerous oppressive countries that censor everything from whole sites to certain keywords. In a world of companies kneeling to these demands, it seems only right to provide people with all the available information,” SafetyFirst contends.That said, since Blockstream is in control of the satellites, there’s a degree to which they and the companies it’s leasing satellites from are in control. But SafetyFirst argues that, at the very least, the satellites offers a worldwide alternative.Countries often shutdown the internet in times of turmoil (in fact, the dictator of Chad has shut down the internet for over a year). When this happens, people still have satellites as an option for retrieving information these entities might be trying to hide.To this end, SafetyFirst notes that he’s been trying to help users send their messages anonymously. “This is the […] reason I created a hidden service (darkweb) .onion link so they can broadcast over the satellites without fear,” SafetyFirst explains. This website can only be accessed on special privacy-minded browsers, such as Tor or Brave.Again, bitcoin factors into this arrangement because the messages need to be paid for, explains Grubles, community manager for Blockstream.The number of messages that can be sent are limited by available bandwidth, according to Grubles.The fees have generally been very low thus far. It costs just a few cents to send a message to space right now, since the system is not hitting this limit. But in the event that more people start trying to broadcast messages at the same time, there’s a bidding feature. If there are too many messages trying to be sent at once – the one that pays the most bitcoin wins.“The bandwidth is limited so we let users choose to expedite their data in the event there is more demand than available bandwidth,” Grubles said.And when paying to send controversial or politically charged message, bitcoin makes more sense than, say, PayPal, which generally has an identity tightly linked to it and could face sanction or funds freeze.Philosophically, the leaderless online money seems almost like a natural fit as it’s a currency that is worldwide, not being limited to a particular country, and unable to be censored by any particular company. If you need a currency to pay for the messages, one can see why it’s a natural link.Farr noted this, arguing: “I think tying bitcoin to it is one of the best use cases for the original vision of bitcoin: A way to unify a global effort.”It’s also important that the satellite system runs on a particular new type of bitcoin: lightning.Lightning allows users to send “micropayments,” small payments, which current financial apps just can’t handle, because processing fees are too high.“Lightning is great for this since you can pay and quickly broadcast a message if needed, and also pay very small amounts of bitcoin if your data, or message, is small,” Grubles added.That said, just because the pairing bitcoin and satellites to send out messages that are harder to censor is possible doesn’t mean people use it.Farr was quick to note this. While he called a decentralized network of satellites — like the one he helped to start at HGG — is the “holy grail of censorship resistance,” he also stressed that: “[L]ike the search for the holy grail, it’s an incredibly complex set of problems to solve that really elude even very well coordinated hobbyist efforts.”While it’s “technically viable,” he said, there are other problems.“I think we’re at the point where the obstacle is coordination. I see this piece as a part of the way to get there,” he told CoinDesk, noting that people have been working on this type of satellite technology for “a decade now.”That said, he noted that the open-source operating system Linux started off feeling like a very unrealistic effort as well.“Before Linux proved it could be done, we never would have thought a global worldwide effort of folks could come together and create an operating system, for free. Now that operating system runs the world. Once all of those disparate groups get coordinated, once there are so many cube sats in orbit, interoperability standards and pieces liking together existing old tech (like Linux drivers for old devices), we’re basically there. Once launch capabilities are no more difficult to put together than a data center, you’ll see this plan come into place,” Farr added.Now Linux is by far the most popular operating system in the world.  That kind of success that, perhaps, is why bitcoiners are still so optimistic about the technology.“I really believe all in all the satellites can be a new age of information sharing. Just look at this guy posting about his worries for Hungary today,” SafetyFirst said, pointing to an article broadcast over Blockstream Satellite where a blogger outlined some political concerns in the country.SafetyFirst added:“I have no idea if his concerns are valid, but I do think it’s a great thing he has an outlet to post where it can be seen and cataloged.”Satellite dish image via Shutterstock"

classically trained software engineer.” Following the backlash, Wright ...","Jul 15, 2019 at 20:30 UTC",,"“Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth,” said boxing superstar Mike Tyson.This year, the so-called father of bitcoin, Craig Wright, tasted first blood.Wright has long been adamant about his position as the creator of bitcoin. Much to a skeptical crypto ecosystem’s chagrin, he has done everything except prove he was Satoshi Nakamoto, from registering the Bitcoin White Paper as his own to showing private keys that anyone could have accessed. In fact, the month of May brought many seeming triumphs and his currency – BTCSV – rose to $226 before a tumble of 100 points. The end of June brought more trouble with Wright sitting in a courtroom seemingly cowed before a judge.The reason for his swift fall? Wright had to answer hard questions about his real involvement in a multi-billion dollar fund that he formed with his deceased business partner, Dave Kleiman. And those hard questions could, in the end, unmask the real Satoshi.Wright is being sued by Ira Kleiman on behalf of the estate of his late brother for scheming to, according to the filing, “seize Dave’s bitcoins and his rights to certain intellectual property associated with the bitcoin technology.”Kleiman’s attorney’s are attempting to prove that Wright transferred Kleiman’s assets to his personal or companies’ accounts, hid the evidence by backdating legal contracts, and forged a series of contracts and Dave’s signature on them.At the heart of the lawsuit is a 1.1 million bitcoin Tulip Trust, which Kleiman alleges is comprised of coins collectively mined by his brother with Wright. The nChain chief scientist wholeheartedly denies this claim. In June, a redacted declaration surfaced that outlined Wright’s purported ownership of the trust fund. In the document Wright claimed he had mined or purchased the entire lot between 2009 and 2011.Elsewhere, Wright has put forward that Kleiman’s involvement in the trust was limited to drafting the legal prose as well as assisting in the development of the complicated Shamir’s Secret Sharing Algorithm used to shield the multi-billion dollar holding. What’s more, according to Wright, the private keys needed to decrypt the fund were distributed amongst corporate entities and mutual friends, including companies that have been liquidated as well as a former associate that he “has not been in touch with… since 2016,” making the Tulip Trust inaccessible.Though the initial complaint did not seek to ascertain whether Wright’s alias is truthfully Nakamoto, the lawsuit can be seen as an outgrowth of that controversy.Three and a half years ago, Wired and Gizmodo published reports that pointed to Wright as the likely inventor of bitcoin. Though far from conclusive, the evidence stoked a media frenzy, which was exacerbated by a mysterious “trust.”Adding fuel to the fire was an ongoing investigation by Australian tax authorities into Wright’s bitcoin holdings, which, after a police raid of Wright’s home, drove the academic to England.It was there that Wright held demonstrations for the BBC, The Economist and GQ where he presented control of some of first mined blocks on the bitcoin blockchain. He also published a “digital signature” used by Nakamoto in his blog. While these actions convinced some prominent bitcoin personalities, many remained skeptical, including bitcoin code contributor Jeff Garzik, who said:“My personal theory is that it’s [Satoshi Nakamoto] Floridian Dave Kleiman. It matches his coding style, this gentleman was self taught. And the Bitcoin coder was someone who was very, very smart, but not a classically trained software engineer.”Following the backlash, Wright said he would not publish additional information tying him to Nakamoto. He blogged at the time:“I believed that I could do this. I believed that I could put the years of anonymity and hiding behind me. But, as the events of this week unfolded and I prepared to publish the proof of access to the earliest keys, I broke. I do not have the courage. I cannot.”Yet, in May, Wright filed registrations with the U.S. Copyright Office over the original bitcoin code and white paper. In itself, a copyright does not prove the holder invented the technology. However, some saw the move as preparation for Wright’s coming libel suits against Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin.com, and podcaster Peter McCormack. Over the past year Wright has become increasingly hostile towards his detractors, which also includes Ethereum inventor Vitalki Buterin and technologist John McAfee.As stated previously, Kleiman’s attorneys had no intention of ascertaining Nakamoto’s identity. They wrote in the initial court filings, “it is unclear whether Craig, Dave and/or both created Bitcoin,” adding, “it is undeniable, however, that Craig and Dave were involved in Bitcoin from its inception and that they both accumulated a vast wealth of bitcoins from 2009 through 2013.”On April 16, Wright – who is being represented in the suit by Miami law firm Rivero Mestre LLP – moved to dismiss the complaint. In the motion, Weight argued that Ira Kleiman’s claims are without merit and that the plaintiff lacks any standing to file suit, calling the effort an “attempted shakedown” based on “a thin soup of supposition, speculation, conflicting allegations, hearsay and innuendo.”As of a June 18 mediation session, the two parties were at an impasse, meaning the trial may progress to court.A June 28 evidentiary hearing, a transcript of which was published shortly afterwards reveals much about how the rest of Wright’s legal odyssey may play out.A forthcoming decision in this hearing does not only have implications for the ongoing Kleiman v Wright suit, but also for aforementioned libel cases Wright has lobbed against Roger Ver and Peter McCormack, who both accused Wright of fraudulently representing himself as Satoshi Nakamoto.The last series of questions directed towards Wright on June 28 concerned his presentation at the Transform Africa summit in May 2018. At the time Wright noted the Rwandan GDP was around $8 billion, only to claim that he had more money than the entire country.In court, however, he changed his tune.“I was angry at the time,” he said. “It didn’t mean I could access or control it, and nor have I.”This is part of Wright’s pattern of staking claims and then reversing them.During the hearing, Wright gave testimony explaining why his $10 billion in bitcoin holdings – established in the Tulip Trust – are both legally and technologically inaccessible. This is the same stockpile Ira Kleiman, brother of Wright’s former business partner, Dave Kleiman, is suing for.Ira’s representative at Boies Schiller Flexner, Velvel Freedman, claimed in the day-long hearing that Wright had embezzled funds from the Kleiman estate by forging documents and emails pertaining to the Trust, which allegedly contain 1.1 million bitcoin conjointly mined by Dave and Wright.Despite multiple court orders, and threats of either a civil or criminal contempt charge, Wright had only published the first 70 addresses, which he also claims link him to his alter-ego, Satoshi Nakamoto. These listings allegedly correspond to the first 70 bitcoin blocks mined, before an unknown party joined the network at block 74.“I’m very focused on ensuring things fall within the rules, and if I’m ordered to do something by a valid court, and I can do it, I will do whatever I have to do it,” Wright said, after claiming his invention “of Bitcoin was to create a system, not where code is law, but where code and law work together.”He said he stopped mining in August 2010, after noticing bitcoin’s use for illegal activities on deep web markets such as the Silk Road and Hydra. At that point, he brought in forensic expert Dave Kleiman to “wipe” his involvement with Bitcoin from the public record and set up an encryption scheme and bonded courier service that would keep the tainted wealth out of his hands until at least 2020.Wright also claimed that Dave prevented him from “destroying [bitcoin] utterly,” and that if he ever regains access to the trust, “every one of [the bitcoins] will go to funding educational charities for the poorest 1 billion people on Earth.”However, despite Wright’s alleged efforts to provide a full inventory of his bitcoin addresses, including employing the chief technology officer of nChain Steve Shadders to develop software to dig for possible addresses, the funds remain elusive.Freedman, during his cross-examination, had a tough time swallowing that Craig could lose access what amounts to about $10 billion in bitcoin.For his part, Freedman’s strategy during his cross-examination of Wright was to tease out purported inconsistencies between Wright’s testimony and documents submitted to the court as evidence, ultimately attempting to show a willful disregard for the court’s orders.“It looks like the modus operandi of the defendant is to take emails, you know, from Dave or from other people that were around the relevant time period and alter data,” Freedman said while addressing the bench after the cross-examination.Freedman brought up an email allegedly sent to Wright from Kleiman in 2011, which elaborated on the creation of the Tulip Trust at the heart of the case.When examining the metadata of the document, Freedman alleged it had been badly altered in 2014 “to try and create evidence that Dave transferred Bitcoin into a trust under [Wright’s] control.”The email was apparently received on Thursday, the 24th of June, 2011, which Freedman showed to actually be a Friday. Furthermore, the document contained a Calibri font copyrighted by Microsoft in 2015.Wright’s defense first involved an arcane explanation of “create” dates and “modify” dates. When pressed, he stated bluntly, “This is a PDF of an email, not the email… You are committing perjury by falsely putting in a document. That is not real evidence. You have created something,” and threw the print out.Wright also claimed the document came from corrupted servers of a company that was being forced into liquidation at the time.“When someone has modified a file on a compromised server that was hacked, and is known to be hacked, then all sorts of funny things happen,” he said.Freedman then pointed out the email was sent via Craig@panopticrypt on PCCSW01 – CSW being Wright’s initials. Wright countered that both the email address and computer were not in his possession by that time.Ultimately, Wright’s defense against a contempt charge hinges on his ability to prove that the keys to decryption are beyond his control.Freedman, for his part, put forward evidence that Wright may be lying about how many different keys are necessary for this task, or that Wright may in fact be in possession of them already.Wright’s other strategy is seemingly to deflect ownership or custodianship of some of the bitcoin that would presumably be part of his holdings. He accused Freedman of “conflating” bitcoin held in the Tulip Trust with bitcoin held in the Liberty Reserve, a defunct cryptocurrency exchange.Likewise, Wright later claimed that 821,000 bitcoin were unaccounted for because they were legally represented by a company called Wright International Investments through a convoluted ownership structure that Judge Bruce Reinhardt needed to clarify.“Is it your position that if you were technologically capable of accessing the necessary information about these Bitcoin, you would still not, under my order, produce that information?… that you don’t have to produce anything having to do with these 821,000 Bitcoin because they’re not your Bitcoin?,” Reinhardt asked.It was later shown, at one point at least, that Wright was the sole shareholder of this company.Image via Youtube."

If so, it should be checked whether the app allows only peer-to-peer transactions, or also transactions with crypto-related businesses.The deck was leaked on Twitter this week by a certified public accountant (CPA) named Laura Walter. The IRS confirmed to CoinDesk that the slides were genuine.Justin Cole, director of communication and education at IRS’ criminal investigation unit, said the materials were presented to agency staff at an event at the World Bank in Washington, D.C., on June 5-7.“The training material has been used around the world to various law enforcement partner audiences and was again given at this forum in a room that included partners from dozens of countries around the world as well as various press members,” Cole wrote in an email.He would not say whether the IRS will definitely implement the suggested measures. “I can’t discuss specific investigative actions that the agency may or may not take in the future,” Cole said.Daniels’ presentation also suggested that the IRS request information from “those who know the financial habits of the Subject, including, but not limited to, bank tellers, family and friends of the Subject (if feasible), and establishments the Subject frequents that may accept bitcoins.”Social media accounts, such as Facebook and Twitter, also should be searched for public mentions of crypto-related information, as well as vendors that accept bitcoin, the deck says.“A Grand Jury Subpoena should also be considered for (and may already have been obtained during the normal course of the investigation) the Subject’s financial accounts, including, but not limited to, the Subject’s bank, credit card, and PayPal records,” the document goes on, for the further analysis of transactions.If it becomes clear that the subject of an investigation owns bitcoin, all wallet addresses and balances should be identified, Daniels wrote.If they use an exchange or online wallet service these companies can be subpoenaed for the user’s balance, addresses, and “any identifying information,” including “any linked financial accounts, login times and information, correspondence, and transaction details,” the slide deck says.However, the reliability of this approach “has yet to be extensively tested,” Daniels acknowledged. “As such, it may not be advised to send a Subpoena for records if not critically necessary.”The taxpayers under investigation themselves shouldn’t be sent subpoenas, as this “may be detrimental to the seizure of any bitcoin balance.”The IRS’s subpoena power applies in civil cases as well as criminal ones, noted Lisa Zarlenga, a partner at the law firm of Steptoe & Johnson. “While this presentation was given by the criminal investigation unit and clearly indicates that criminal investigation will use that tool, there is nothing preventing the civil side from using it as well,” she said.However, Zarlenga pointed out, the IRS is required to notify taxpayers before it subpoenas third parties, so people will likely know if the tax agency is looking for their bitcoin.The IRS is getting ready to issue new guidance on reporting crypto for tax purposes, the first to come out since an initial notice published in 2014. A number of questions on how exactly crypto should be taxed have come up since then, often with multiple possible ways to tackle them.IRS slideshow by CoinDesk on ScribdIRS image via Shutterstock "

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Jul 15, 2019 at 16:00 UTC","The Takeaway

Congressional hearings on Facebook's Libra project are likely to focus more on the company's privacy failings than on unresolved policy questions for cryptocurrency.
Lawmakers will probably also grill Facebook blockchain lead David Marcus on the company's choice of Switzerland as the home for the Libra Association.
Though Facebook intends to launch Libra next year, regulatory and congressional scrutiny may throw that timeline into jeopardy.



Facebook is about to face the music on Capitol Hill.","In hearings Tuesday and Wednesday, the social media giant will defend its ambitious cryptocurrency project, Libra, which it revealed in June through a white paper and supporting documentation. While Facebook lined up major payments and VC firms to support the project, lawmakers expressed doubts almost immediately, with the U.S. Senate Banking and House Financial Services Committees calling for hearings soon after its unveiling.The Senate hearing will take place on Tuesday, while the House panel will hold its hearing the next day. David Marcus, Facebook’s blockchain lead, will testify at both. The House hearing, at least, will also call other expert witnesses.

Potentially at stake is the timing of Libra's launch. Facebook said last month that it was targeting a 2020 rollout, but whether the company will be able to meet that deadline is still in the air, and not just for technical development reasons.

For starters, if the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decides that Libra resembles an exchange-traded fund (ETF), then Facebook's ability to launch the cryptocurrency will be dependent on the regulator's approval.

Congress could also delay Libra's launch: If lawmakers decide they need to have greater oversight on the project, they can try writing and passing a bill (indeed, a draft bill circulating online suggests that some lawmakers are already considering this). Even President Donald J. Trump has criticized Libra, which may indicate that he would be willing to sign such a bill into law.

However, if lawmakers come away from the hearings satisfied with Marcus's statements, then Facebook will have passed a major hurdle on its road to launching Libra.

Indeed, in his prepared remarks for the Senate hearing, released Monday, Marcus indicated that Facebook would not follow its famous dictum to ""move fast and break things.""

""In fact, I expect that this will be the broadest, most extensive, and most careful pre-launch oversight by regulators and central banks in FinTech’s history,"" Marcus said. ""And I want to be clear: Facebook will not offer the Libra digital currency until we have fully addressed regulatory concerns and received appropriate approvals.""Libra, as outlined last month, is designed to be an open-source cryptocurrency that individuals – regardless of whether they’re Facebook users – can send each other for payments. Those who use Libra will be able to send funds using Facebook’s Messenger, WhatsApp or Instagram apps, or other third-party wallets.

The company is hoping to provide financial services to unbanked individuals worldwide (though it is not launching in India, the world’s largest market for WhatsApp, where crypto is highly restricted).Companies such as Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Coinbase have all agreed to act as launch partners for the Libra Association, the governing council which will be tasked with overseeing and guiding the project’s technical developments once it is live. However, these partners have signed nonbinding agreements, and do not appear to have paid the $10 million fee to join the association, according to the New York Times.The backlash to Facebook’s announcement was swift, bipartisan and extremely public. The Senate Banking Committee called a hearing the next day, while members of the House Financial Services Committee have repeatedly called for a moratorium on the cryptocurrency’s development.Past letters and comments by these officials provide hints at what the lawmakers might focus on during the hearings.The Senate Banking Committee has been looking into Libra since at least May, when chairman Michael Crapo (R.-ID) and ranking member Sherrod Brown (D.-OH) wrote an open letter to Facebook asking several questions about the project.While the letter overall was about the crypto project, many of the questions specifically focused on issues of consumer financial data collection and user privacy in Facebook's flagship business.Crapo also wrote an opinion piece in Fox News this month, emphasizing the importance of data privacy, and suggesting how lawmakers might be able to aid in securing this privacy as a legal right.Facebook responded to the committee’s questions last week, assuring lawmakers that the company would not hold any personal financial data, though its Calibra subsidiary would collect any and all know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) information that is required by law.Marcus, who wrote the response, also told lawmakers that because Libra’s code will be open-source, anyone could build their own wallets. These third-party developers would be responsible for any data that their wallets collect, as well as ensuring compliance with any relevant statutes.Kristin Smith, head of the Blockchain Association, a lobbying group, told CoinDesk that “given the recent turmoil surrounding Facebook and the general shift in perspective on Big Tech in D.C., it’s natural that Facebook itself would be getting the majority of the focus from lawmakers, rather than the specifics of the Libra project.”However, she believes this is “a missed opportunity.”“We … would rather see this moment used to answer long-standing questions about U.S. crypto policy, no matter what you think of Facebook’s recent history,” she said, adding:“With the announcement that it plans to create a cryptocurrency, Facebook is continuing its unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of users,” Waters said last month.

On the other hand, there is a wild card, in the form of House committee member Brad Sherman, who has repeatedly called for an outright ban on crypto activities in the U.S. and may take the opportunity to bash the asset class again on Wednesday.User data collection aside, another apparent cause for alarm seems to come from the fact that Facebook set up a subsidiary in Switzerland, ostensibly to develop hardware or software, as well as to provide financial and technology services.Lawmakers appear to believe that Facebook might have established a subsidiary in Switzerland to skirt U.S. regulations.Brown tweeted last month that “we cannot allow Facebook to run a risky new cryptocurrency out of a Swiss bank account without oversight.”Smith had another interpretation, however. She told CoinDesk that Facebook may have chosen to set up shop in Switzerland because of a lack of clarity around U.S. regulations.“It’s no secret that Switzerland is well-known as a crypto-friendly jurisdiction,” she said, adding:In that context, “it is striking that Facebook decided against basing this project in the U.S.,” she said.If the U.S. legal and regulatory structure is not clarified, she expects other projects might also follow suit in leaving the country for other jurisdictions.Companies based in the U.S. may even consider moving to another country in search of this clarity.“If regulators and lawmakers, who have to this point focused mainly on the risks associated with cryptocurrencies, instead supported the positive growth potential of the industry as other countries have done, the U.S. may be able to lead the growth of this economy for decades to come,” Smith said.

But Marcus' prepared remarks suggest he thinks the lawmakers are thinking defensively rather than offensively.

For example, he downplayed the potential threat to fiat currencies posed by Libra, reassuring the Senators:
""The Libra Association, which will manage the Reserve [of assets backing the coin], has no intention of competing with any sovereign currencies or entering the monetary policy arena. It will work with the Federal Reserve and other central banks to make sure Libra does not compete with sovereign currencies or interfere with monetary policy. Monetary policy is properly the province of central banks.""David Marcus image via CoinDesk archivesThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The firm booked $55 billion in revenue for 2018. Worldwide regulators have since then voiced concerns on how Facebook’s plan can remain compliant with financial regulations across the globe.Last week, the U.S. president Donald Trump made his first comments on cryptocurrencies via a series of tweets, in which he criticized Facebook’s Libra project had “little standing or dependability.”Libra image via Shutterstock"

Our prediction is in the next 24 months almost every FANG company will have a coin or be working on some sort of project.”Joining Libra might be a surprise move to some, considering the Winklevoss brothers’ legendary fight over control of Facebook with its CEO Mark Zuckerberg, their former Harvard classmate. But they now want to be “frenemies”with a mutual goal of promoting mainstream crypto adoption.Plus, the twins are aiming to diversify Gemini’s token offerings by 2020. They recently applied for a broker-dealer license through the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which would allow Gemini to list digital securities.The Libra white paper, unveiled last month, envisions “a competitive network of exchanges buying and selling Libra,” enabling holders to easily convert the coin, backed by a basket of stable government currencies, into local fiat.So far, only one crypto exchange, Coinbase, has joined the Libra Association, whose ranks also include traditional financial players such as PayPal, Visa and Mastercard and VC firms such as Union Square Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz. (Crypto custodian Xapo is also a member.)The Winklevoss are also personally invested in both Filecoin and Tezos. So those might offer examples of the types of “utility tokens” they’d like to eventually offer on the exchange with regulatory approval, Tyler said.“We ask [regulators] for permission, not forgiveness,” Cameron added.Although U.S. lawmakers have so far given Facebook’s global cryptocurrency project an icy reception, even urging the association to halt development, Libra’s vision of a global currency otherwise aligns with the twins’ goals for their own exchange. Cameron said they want to expand internationally, starting with Europe and Asia.“Our marketplace will be virtual commodities, virtual securities, and on and on,” Tyler said. “Pretty much anything that can come onto a blockchain.”From his perspective, “mainstream adoption” means higher cryptocurrency prices.“If bitcoin really is Gold 2.0, it has to have a market cap of $7 trillion,” he said. “I think that market cap is a good measure of adoption and how many people are actually in crypto.”Winklevoss image via Shutterstock"

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Jul 15, 2019 at 19:00 UTC","Set Labs, San Francisco-based investment platform, unveiled an Ethereum-based financial trading instrument that captures crypto’s volatile attributes for the investor’s benefit.","The “Trend Trading ETH 20 Day Simple Moving Average Crossover Set” uses a two year back-tested “moving average” to capture the momentum of price swings and limit losses in the market.The ETH Crossover Set uses the ERC20 token to represent user’s funds as either Ether or as Coinbase’s stable USDC. The Set employs two MakerDAO’s ETH/USD price oracle ts to track the daily price and moving average of Ether and is programmed to make trades “whenever the current price of ETH crosses the 20 Day Simple Moving Average indicator.”If the Set is currently in ETH and the price goes below the moving average, it rebalances ETH into USDC. Likewise, if the Set is currently in ETH and the price goes above the moving average, it rebalances USDC into ETH. “Essentially, you would be momentum investing or swing trading,” said company CEO Felix Feng.He said:“Typically, momentum trading is effective in markets that 1) do not have valuation models, 2) have large amounts of volatility, and 3) have frequent mispricings. Momentum investing is not typically used in US stocks, bonds, or options – as they have clear valuation models (e.g. discounted cash flow analysis for stocks and black Scholes for options). However, for commodities and assets like crypto – momentum trading can be an effective strategy that allows protection from losses in downtrends and capture subside on the uptrends. Based on historical data, this may be an extremely effective strategy – until a valuation model has been figured out.”As opposed to manually reviewing trend lines and executing trades on a centralized exchanges, or delegating these decisions to a manager of a hedge fund, Set applies technical indicators encoded in smart contracts to remove human decisions from quantitative trades.A six to twelve hour confirmation period prevents unnecessary trades. Additionally, the protocol is programmed with a minimum rebalance interval of four days.The moving average is calculated by recording daily prices in a DailyPriceFeed smart contract and taking the average of the past 20 days of price data. The underlying price data is sourced from MakerDAO’s price oracles.In that sense, the Set is similar to trading bots on exchanges – however, “instead of users setting up trading bot infrastructure, they subscribe to the strategy by acquiring an ERC20 token,” Feng said.The automated procedure also differentiates it from decentralized finance competitors Melonport and BeToken, which are “similar but operate more as decentralized hedge funds.”The company deployed the Set Protocol system to the Ethereum mainnet in April 2019 along with the launch of TokenSets, the dApp, and two trading strategies: Buy and Hold and Range Bound.Buy and Hold is similar to a traditional index fund, where one Set token is collateralized by multiple underlying assets, in this case BTC and ETH, which automatically rebalance back to a target allocation. Currently, users can invest in an equally weighted or 75/25-percent split strategy.Range Bound strategies are similar to holding a portfolio of cash and volatile assets represented as a token. It uses Dai as “cash” and either ETH or BTC as a volatile asset.TokenSets is non-custodial and has approximately 400 unique users representing $430,000 in collateralized assets. It currently does not charge fees.“Since Sets can be configured to rebalance on any on-chain indicator, we can also build trading strategies built on fundamental indicators and eventually combine multiple indicators to build complex algorithmic strategies,” said Feng. He cited exponential moving averages, relative strength indexes, and moving average convergence divergence.Set Labs, the company behind Set Protocol, was founded in 2017. It is not yet profitable, but has completed a series seed fundraising of $2 million dollars led by Craft Ventures and Vy Capital with participation from Kindred Ventures, DFJ, Haystack, Social Capital, and angel investor Scott Belsky.Business miniature image via Shutterstock"

Throughput constraints – or limitations on how much data can smoothly flow through a network – are seen as a major impediment to widespread blockchain adoption.Marlin Protocol aims to improve speeds across multiple chains by using what CEO Siddhartha Dutta calls a “bandwidth-sharing marketplace.”Dutta explained that significant improvements to bandwidth on a blockchain can be made by introducing a subset of new network actors called “relayers.”“Marlin is a leader in a new class of infrastructure startups in crypto that are blockchain-agnostic and will dramatically increase network performance,” Arrington XRP Capital partner Michael Arrington told CoinDesk. “We are happy to support them.”Certain blockchains, such as Algorand, already employ relayers, said Dutta. However, the number and comparative cost to attack these relayers are both low.“The number of relayers in Algorand is in single digits,” Dutta said. “If anyone is able to bribe just those single-digit relayers, you have brought down the network because they’re the ones responsible for all this communication. Now, if every blockchain tries to do this, every blockchain introduces these single points of failure.”As such, Marlin Protocol aims to introduce a large network of relayers able to secure virtually any blockchain. This would occur alongside more common node activities such as staking and mining.“Most of the ethereum miners, bitcoin miners or even those professional staking companies, they already have good bandwidth connections,” said Dutta. “All those nodes would be interested in merging mining along with Marlin so that they can also get paid for that bandwidth their spending anyways.”So far, Marlin says it has partnered with a number of different projects to run its services on private test networks. Partners include WandX, Murmur, Blockcloud, Matic and Holochain.In two to three months, however, Dutta envisions the launch of a public Marlin testnet. Beyond that, Dutta also mentioned a targeted mainnet launch for sometime in 2020.“Supercharging network performance solves a major problem across proof-of-work and proof-of-stake blockchains today,” Electric Capital Managing Partner Curtis Spencer told CoinDesk. “And their long-term vision around privacy-preserving packet delivery and decentralization is particularly exciting to us.”Explaining Marlin’s focus on boosting speeds, Dutta said:“The project itself is about high-performance networking infrastructure for the decentralized ecosystem. … The faster [nodes] can communicate, the faster you can get things done.”CEO Siddhartha Dutta image courtesy of Marlin Protocol"

That being for each branch:By pairing each committee with industry leaders steeped in regulatory knowledge, the VCA aims to develop “well-informed, sensible regulation.”Additionally, representatives from Navigant Consulting and Perkins Coie will work as advisors alongside each committee.“The VCA is grateful to the individuals and companies willing to commit their time towards these committees and advance the goals of the VCA in fostering consumer protection and market integrity for the virtual currency industry,” said Hailey Lennon, Secretary of the VCA, in a statement.“These committees directly address the concerns of regulators that are trying to figure out the crypto space,” Hussain said. He added that the VCA is “not a replacement for but a supplement to traditional regulatory bodies.”Modeled after FINRA, the VCA will collaborate with traditional financial operators to leverage their expertise when developing practices and standards to better oversee and surveil cryptocurrency markets as well as design appropriate consumer protections.Hussain said the relationship between traditional finance and crypto does not precisely map, adding that the “Federal government sees challenges in a fast paced, innovative environment.”“Regulation has to keep that same pace,” he said. Through its commingling of traditional and crypto firms, Hussain said the VCA in a position to “facilitate cross-market information sharing” and curb market manipulation and other fraudulent activities in real time.By demonstrating a commitment to progress as well as consumer protections, the VCA hopes to “enable crypto becoming mainstream” and entice more, and larger institutions into the field.In order to become a registered SRO, the VCA will require congressional approval. “Once a good set of standards is in place, we can take those to congress,” said Hussain.The VCA was founded in 2018 and is open to all U.S. digital asset platforms and custodians.Business miniatures image via Shutterstock"

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Jul 15, 2019 at 21:00 UTC","Huobi, one of the world’s oldest cryptocurrency exchanges, has taken steps to reduce the supply of the token that powers its global ecosystem, Huobi Token (HT), in a quarterly burning event.","According to a company statement, the exchange removed 14,011,700 tokens from a 310,318,300 market supply, at a rate that is 116 percent greater than it did last quarter. The company cited “improving market conditions” and sales growth for the decision.The move is intended to stabilize the currency’s price, as well as create an incentive for users to hold the token by curbing inflation. Every quarter since early 2018 when the Singapore-based exchange introduced Huobi Token, it has spent 20 percent of its quarterly revenues buying back outstanding tokens.Revenues fluctuate quarter to quarter, meaning Huobi does not always burn a consistent amount. This past quarter is no different. Driven by strong growth, the company’s revenues put towards its token burning plan represents an increase of 232 percent quarter-over-quarter. Beginning on April 15, Huobi held eight token burning events of a total 21,356,800 HT, more than the 6,474,800 HT it repurchased in the first quarter.The repurchased tokens are stored in a visible ethereum address, dubbed the Huobi Investor Protection Fund, and act as a reserve fund.Leon Li, CEO and Founder of Huobi Group said:“There are two big trends reflecting the size of this quarter’s buyback. The first is a rapidly strengthening market for digital assets and the other is the increasing popularity of our entire product line.”The company cited increasing membership to Huobi Prime and Huobi FastTrack programs – generators of fees – as well as a productive Spring for the $504 billion trading volume Huobi DM platform.“The rest of 2019 will see even more improvements and innovations coming from Huobi,” said Li, pointing to further developments to the recently launched Huobi Finance Chain, a decentralized finance public blockchain, and improvements to the high frequency algorithmic API.In a separate post, the company said this token burn cycle “will be the last time HT tokens will be destroyed using the traditional buyback method.”Going forward, the company looks to use revenues generated in the HT Tiered Fee deduction program to directly burn tokens. It has also proposed to start sourcing one-thirds of the burnable tokens from team holdings, and the rest from the open market. Additionally, the company is considering switching to monthly or daily burns, from quarterly.“No final decision has been made yet, however. We’ll be discussing this more with our community,” Li said.As of today, the total circulating supply of the ethereum ERC-20 token is 478,643,200. The native tokens are used to gain access to “premium coins” through Huobi Prime, as security deposits for merchants on its over the counter exchange, Huobi OTC merchants, and to vote.Huobi Group was established in 2013 in China, and now comprises 10 seperate businesses. It operates in more than 130 countries, and exceeds $1 trillion in accumulative turnover.Image via Shutterstock."

","Montrol, of Saginaw, Texas, also known as Ukyo, will serve 14 months in prison for defrauding investors of his “Ukyo.Loan” scheme, transferring funds without investor’s knowledge or consent, and lying to Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) agents during their investigation.In July 2018, Montrol pleaded guilty for such activities. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said:  “Jon Montroll lied to his investors and, after his lies caught the attention of the SEC, lied to them, too. The sentence he received serves as a reminder that this Office will not overlook those who violate their obligation to be honest with investors and the regulators working to protect them.”In July 2013, BitFunder’s software was said to be hacked, enabling the theft of 6,000 bitcoin from Montrol’s companion fiat-to-crypto platform, WeExchange. Per the DOJ's statement, Montrol allegedly failed to communicate the lost monies with investors or regulatory authorities. On one occasion, he promoted the operation as “commercially successful” instead of insolvent. Montrol repeated similar claims to the FBI and “provided the SEC with a falsified screenshot” of investor’s holdings as they began to investigate the exploit. Montrol’s deception continued on the stand where he provided “materially false and misleading answers” regarding his businesses and the hack. Additionally, during the investigation it was found Montrol used WeExchange as a personal bank. The attorney’s office wrote at the time:“Montrol exchanged numerous bitcoins taken from WeExchange into United States dollars, then spent those funds on personal expenses, such as travel and groceries.”Similarly, shortly before BitFunder shuttered, Montrol began offering a new product, Ukyo.Loan, described as a “round-about investment.” Attorneys also noted that Montrol referred to the investments as “a personal loan.” Despite his businesses’ insolvency, Montrol continued to advertise Ukyo.Loans netting him 978 bitcoin. Montrol was also ordered to three years of supervised release and to pay a $167,480 forfeiture.Justice statue image via ShutterstockThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Jul 10, 2019 at 13:00 UTC",Blockchain startups may be slowly recovering from the 2018 slump.,"Boston-based Nebulous, makers of the Sia network for decentralized data storage, recently closed a $3.5 million pre–Series A round led by Bain Capital Ventures, along with participants like Bessemer Venture Partners and Dragonfly Capital Partners.Salil Deshpande of Bain Capital told CoinDesk that distributed, permissionless storage options are the cornerstone of decentralized apps (dapps) and that Nebulous is the only investable startup with a live solution that lacks glaring technical issues.“If [dapps] use centralized storage, then they are not decentralized any more,” Deshpande said. “In the future, centralized apps will also be able to use decentralized storage.”Nebulous CEO David Vorick told CoinDesk the company has now raised a total of $6.3 million since launching in 2014.“Today we have about 450 terabytes of data that users are actively storing on the network,” Vorick said. “Our metrics suggest that’s between 500 and 1,000 people to date.”According to the third party site SiaStats.info, this includes roughly 332 node operators, many of which are IT professionals running nodes from data centers.Stepping back, Sia’s token model has set it apart since Siacoin launched in 2015. The network’s native Siacoin must be earned through mining. It wasn’t distributed as part of an initial coin offering. As such, Vorick said the Nebulous-owned hardware maker Obelisk sold $15 million worth of Sia miners, roughly 6,000 machines, before it ceased sales this month.Both host node operators and storage space “renters” lock a little Siacoin in a smart contract escrow, including the transaction fee, to ensure the operator gets paid for keeping data safe. If the host loses the encrypted data, he or she forfeits those tokens. Meanwhile, a small fraction of that transaction fees is automatically allocated to 10,000 Siafunds.These wallets are the startup’s sole monetization strategy for the network, charging roughly $1 per Terabyte monthly. Plus, Nebulous sells fractional ownership of some Siafund tokens to investors as an additional capital source beyond equity.“In the Sia protocol itself, in the blockchain code, there is a requirement that every time you make a file contract, 3.9 percent of the coins in that contract are distributed to the Siafund holders,” Vorick explained.This fresh round will give the company fodder to double its team size from 12 to 24 by this time next year, he added. In part, these employees will help Nebulous focus on services related to media streaming and storage this summer.People who have archival footage or indie films, plus a wide range of materials too niche for Hulu or Netflix, could store and stream the footage with Sia from anywhere in the world.“You don’t have to be a host [node] in order to put data onto the Sia network,” Vorick said. “It will be a comparable experience to using something like Hulu.”Plus, users could offer it to others through third-party Sia apps. One such independent app, Filebase, offers a portal for paid clients that want to use Sia without downloading software or buying cryptocurrency. When it comes to incumbent rivals like MaidSafe, the Filebase team said they chose the Sia network because it has fewer disruptions and less restructuring.“We’ll allow you to generate a public URL or link that you can share and it will allow you to stream or share a picture, any number of those things,” the Filebase team said, adding they have “several hundred” users so far. “Our goal is to grow Filebase into a subscription service.”Indeed, Bain Capital’s Deshpande referred to such streaming as one of the leading use cases for decentralized storage systems.“The idea is you hit ‘play’ and it starts streaming within a third of a second,” Deshpande said, speaking of Sia network updates on the horizon. “The question is always: Is the token necessary? I believe in this case that a token is actually necessary.”While competitors like Filecoin slowly develop similar storage models, and newcomers like the startup Fluree enter the game, Nebulous is betting on its first-mover advantage.Speaking to one perk the Sia model has over traditional data storage options, Nebulous CEO Vorick added:“It’s possible to have nothing more than your wallet seed and use that to recover all of your data. That’s really powerful. Now with just private keys users can have global access to both data and money.”Members of the Nebulous team – including CEO David Vorick (second from right) – at the Bitcoin 2019 conference in San Francisco.

bitcoin to save the company from having to go out and buy coins on the ...","Jul 10, 2019 at 09:00 UTC",The takeaway:,"Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is in talks to set up its own regulated insurance company with the help of insurance broker giant Aon, industry sources told CoinDesk.Establishing “captive” insurance subsidiaries, wholly owned by the firm being insured, is a time-honored way for corporations to reduce costs and improve access to reinsurance markets (a form of insurance purchased by insurance companies in order to mitigate risk). Nearly all Fortune 500 companies and thousands of midsize firms maintain captives, according to a December 2018 article in trade publication CPA Journal.Coinbase and Aon see this structure as potentially part of the answer to the shortage of insurance available to crypto exchanges, the sources said. While Coinbase has obtained more coverage than most, often exchanges just self-insure by setting aside a bunch of coins to cover losses in the event of a hack or disappearance of customer funds. The problem with that approach is its lack of a formal structure, creating the temptation to access the funds for other purposes and ambiguity about how much coverage a firm actually has.With a captive, on the other hand, the funds are segregated and held in a regulated, audited vehicle, which can help the firm go out and attain more cover from the reinsurance market. To be clear: the captive would insure only its parent company, not competitors.Neither Aon nor Coinbase would comment on the latter’s interest in captive insurance. However, Aon did say that it established the industry’s first crypto captive earlier this year for an unnamed client. This Caymans Islands-based captive will write “crime” policies covering hacks of hot (online) wallets and “specie” coverage for cryptocurrency kept offline in cold storage, the broker said. The two companies have worked together before: in April, Aon helped arrange about $255 million in coverage for Coinbase’s hot wallets. The exchange, which keeps only 2% of client funds in hot wallets, held $25 billion of crypto at the height of the 2017 bullrun. Aon said a handful of its crypto clients are considering the captive option, adding that Bermuda and some leading U.S. on-shore domiciles are expected to follow the Caymans soon. “There is a lack of capacity and some are uncomfortable with what is available in the marketplace and are looking to alternative solutions,” said Jacqueline Quintal, a managing director and the financial institutions practice leader at Aon. “I think the path for most will be to buy some amount of traditional insurance first and then to explore alternative structures, potentially including a captive — and we are having more and more of these conversations.”Stepping back, a captive is an insurance company created and completely owned by another company to provide coverage for itself. It’s a regulated alternative to self-insurance which can offer direct access to reinsurance markets and act as an investment vehicle.If pricing is too high in the commercial insurance markets or no underwriters are willing to cover a firm’s risk, captives are used to formalize self-insurance with reporting on capital and reserve requirements. Speaking to the advantages of using a captive rather than simple self-insurance, Quintal said: “If a firm is self-insuring, they’ve accepted responsibility for funding 100% of any loss. Captives, in comparison, provide a means through which firms can access insurance or reinsurance, while also pre-funding self-insured loss amounts in a more formal way than simply setting aside capital.”Taking this more formal and regulated approach, Quintal added, can help create more capacity in the market, and “by having more control over a firm’s insurance program, captives can bring the price of risk financing down over time.” Even for a crypto firm, a captive would have to keep most of its claims reserve in fiat, but crypto could potentially be used for the surplus (additional funds reserved in case of an unexpected amount of claims), according to Ward Ching, managing director, Aon Captive Insurance Managers. There have also been discussions about including crypto in the Caymans captive’s investment activities, said Ching. “It’s all about doing the math and showing the domicile regulatory leadership how the inclusion of cryptocurrency as an asset class both satisfies the regulatory mandate and provides financial flexibility in a constructive and safe manner,” he said.It’s no secret that many of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges simply self-insure against hacks and losses.The problem historically has been that crypto insurance is prohibitively expensive, way too limited and fiendishly tricky when it comes to actually making a claim. In response, crypto firms have resigned themselves to holding their own coins in cold storage (where the private keys are disconnected from the internet, in a hardware device or piece of paper locked in a safe) to deal with losses.  San Francisco-based exchange Kraken has been candid about having its own insurance fund. As Kraken CEO Jesse Powell told CoinDesk: “The balance sheet is basically also called the insurance fund.” Kraken has “well over $100 million” put aside, said Powell, much of it in bitcoin to save the company from having to go out and buy coins on the open market in the event clients’ coins need to be replaced. Similarly, in February 2018, Singapore-based Huobi put aside 20,000 bitcoin as its fallback protection mechanism in the event of a security breach, known as “the Huobi security reserve”. As a further measure, it has hoarded a “protection fund” by earmarking 20 percent of transaction fees per quarter to buy back its native tokens. “If you add our protection fund up with our reserve fund we are talking well over $400m of protection there,” Josh Goodbody, head of Europe and the Americas, Huobi global sales and institutional business told CoinDesk.Powell, an outspoken critic of the state of insurance provision offered to crypto firms, said over the years his firm has been quoted insurance many times at prices which were “ridiculous and obscene.”“There’s just not a good deal out there,” he said, “I’m sure you can get someone to write you a deal for like 10% a year of the balance and actually have real meaningful coverage. But I don’t think people are going to pay that.”Goodbody, likewise, explained that Huobi had been around the block looking at insurance. Indeed, he questioned how coverage in the hundreds of millions of dollars touted by some firms would apply to hot wallets, which he said would be “extremely confusing and full of caveats and fine print.”Exchanges tend to be loose in how they go about self-insuring, according to Powell.“I think everybody basically has these funds on their balance sheet and they are investing them or dipping into them for operations,” he explained. “Nobody, as far as I know, has provided some sort of audit or an explicit statement about how these funds are segregated and kept in a different entity as if it were really like third party insurance provider.”Nevertheless, Powell said he struggled to see what value it would add setting up a separate captive insurance company.“I just feel like it’s moving money between pockets of the same entity, and I don’t really see how this actually helps the consumer have more protection. It’s all the same basket of money anyway,” said Powell. “I don’t know why this would be able to get a better deal than we could get directly with an insurance broker.” Huobi’s Goodbody was more optimistic, calling Aon’s plans “extremely interesting and super positive for the market.”Some innovators in the insurance space, such as ethereum-based Nexus Mutual and also Etherisc (another partner of Aon), have suggested going further than setting up individual captive vehicles and rather pooling together groups of crypto disaster funds into a system of reinsurance.Powell agreed this idea seemed to have more potential value for the industry, but he questioned the practicalities. “You could conceivably do a group insurance deal among the exchanges, like a co-operative kind of thing. But then you have to have your competitors audit everything and I think everybody’s too smart for that – and too paranoid,” he said. Aon’s Ching agreed there was some “obvious logic” in getting a group of crypto self-insurers together and aggregating. The problem, he said, is these companies are very different once you get under the covers:“They have different risk tolerances, different capital structures and different security mechanisms. Until they harmonize that it’ll be hard to put a group captive together; not saying it’s impossible, just a bumpier ride.”Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong at Consensus 2019 image via CoinDesk archives"

In such a development, the invention would disrupt the traditional card system based on three intermediaries: the credit card company, a value-added network (VAN) service provider and a payment gateway.“We obtained the patent about a year and a half after we initiated a feasibility study including technology reviews.” the official said.The patent filing on the website of the Korea Intellectual Property Rights Information Service (Kipris) gves an overview of the invention as follows (via informal translation):“A blockchain generating unit for generating a blockchain including a virtual currency generated according to a credit limit of a consumer and updating the blockchain according to payment details, and a transaction generating unit for storing transaction conditions corresponding to each of the plurality of accounts and for making settlement using the blockchain according to the transaction conditions.”Shinhan Card is now seeking to expand the credit patent to Europe, the U.S., Japan, China, Vietnam and Indonesia, they added.Earlier this year, sister firm Shinhan Bank said it was using blockchain technology to speed up the approval process for loan products.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Jul 11, 2019 at 13:00 UTC","For a moment, it worked as planned. As CoinDesk reported last summer, a user in South Africa could pay their mom’s electricity bill in Uganda using a crypto-powered payments app called Wala.","But despite early traction in facilitating remittances and other small payments for Africa’s underbanked, Wala was effectively broke by early 2019, laying off its staff and closing access to the company’s flagship app in February.CEO Tricia Martinez published a blog post in June attributing the company’s hardships to Africa’s poor infrastructure. In a recent interview with Decrypt, Wala co-founder Samer Saab also claimed new Ugandan regulations and unreliable internet infrastructure sparked an exodus of users from the nascent platform.But three sources with knowledge of the company’s operations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, tell quite a different story.They told CoinDesk that Martinez spent funds from 2017’s $1.2 million initial coin offering (ICO) on expensive equipment and international travel, as well as posh accommodations like a spacious office in Cape Town.CoinDesk was able to confirm there were active user accounts at the time of the shutdown. However, since Wala lacked a revenue model, the company quickly burned through its resources, regardless of an earlier $1 million seed round raised from investors like Vinny Lingham’s Newtown Partners.Wala employed roughly eight staffers in South Africa, had a network of “ambassadors” and had struck partnerships with local payment processors across Africa so that customers could cash out in fiat if needed.In terms of hiring local and producing a live product for underbanked users through brands they already trusted, Wala checked all the boxes.“This is the story of average entrepreneurs,” one of the sources told CoinDesk. “Our path to revenue was too uncertain to convince any investors [of follow-on investment].”Llew Claasen of Newtown Partners told CoinDesk: “Crypto market conditions in 2018 didn’t help them and they ran out of money before they could close a new round.” He added: “Startups are brutal.”Further, CoinDesk’s reporting has confirmed that the user numbers previously promoted by the startup were exaggerated.While Martinez’s blog post claims Wala had “150,000 users,” one anonymous source estimated the number was closer to 2,000 individuals with numerous wallets. Every wallet was able to claim a small token reward during setup, so dozens of users created numerous accounts. Only several hundred people were actually using the Wala app for its intended purpose, the source said.The source estimated that roughly 300 users did not get their funds back, based on defunct wallets that still have tokens inside. One Ugandan user told CoinDesk that although she lost around $21 in the debacle because she was not warned about the startup’s closure, learning about cryptocurrency for the first time was a positive experience.Several sources contradicted Martinez’s narrative by saying that insolvency, not infrastructure or faulty partners, led to the company’s collapse.“I do not believe their behavior was from a place of malice,” one anonymous source said. “They just got way out of their depth and handled it poorly.Serving users with limited digital literacy and mobile access can be challenging, especially when a startup needs to communicate with users en masse.The grassroots growth strategy of relying on independent Ugandan ambassadors backfired when word-of-mouth education about the shutdown didn’t spread as far as the signup scheme.Another anonymous source said the startup claimed the difficulties were caused by “maintenance” even after the shutdown process was well under way. The Wala website is still online today and Martinez’s Twitter account highlights 2018 photos of the disbanded Wala team.Martinez tweeted on June 23 that Wala plans to raise money and relaunch with a more sustainable model. Martinez and her co-founder Saab did not respond to CoinDesk’s requests for comment.Chatter on the Wala Telegram group, with complaints from now non-responsive accounts, support the anonymous sources’ narrative. The Ugandan user also confirmed that she received no warning that the app was shutting down.“The majority of users have no Telegram, Twitter or WhatsApp. So for them to speak up is virtually impossible. Hence why no one has heard anything,” one anonymous source said. “People were trying to withdraw money, but they were unable to since we have not topped up our balance with the cash-out provider.”Regardless of what the future holds, the Wala case illustrates how token-centric startups are subject to the requirements of everyday businesses. Wala’s technical solution worked on a limited scale and quickly garnered modest traction, but it also required profits to grow.And even if they are eager to learn about cryptocurrency, marginalized users are rarely a source of quick revenue.“Wala has never been exploitive. I believe they have the interest of Ugandans at heart and we could have changed their lives,” one anonymous source said. “A model could have been worked out.”Wala image via Tricia Martinez/Twitter"

Although most employees are verbally and contractually promised they will soon have an opportunity to obtain ConsenSys shares, few receive it or are able to use it, said the sources, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity.Now, after a year of discontent, ConsenSys is imminently expected to announce an official policy regarding employee share options, according to one of the sources. ConsenSys declined to comment for this article. We will update if we hear back.“People would bring it up in town halls and Joe would say, ‘We’re working on it,’” one source said about Lubin’s repeated verbal assurances. “I didn’t know how important equity was or that I should fight for it. I definitely felt taken advantage of in that sense.”With regard to shares for ConsenSys proper, which slightly over 100 early employees have allegedly received but few have tried to sell, another source who did receive equity added:“If there’s no public offering and there’s no buyback program from the company, then that equity is not valuable.”According to one source with knowledge of the matter, Lubin owns more than half of the equity in ConsenSys proper, in addition to ownership stakes in the firm’s incubated startups. The source said Lubin is shopping a tenth of that ConsenSys equity around to potential investors such as Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.As such, few shareholders believe Lubin will be able to close this raise without diluting the value of employee shares or substituting ConsenSys equity for shares in the “spokes,” i.e. incubated projects. It remains to be seen how employee share options will be finalized in writing.“They’ll have to set up more shares in the company or set up different entities and give people shares in other entities,” one source told CoinDesk. “Promising people spoke equity for spokes that have never launched and don’t have the ability to raise capital, because of the way the cap table is structured, is not valuable.”As CoinDesk previously reported, some incubated projects have struggled to attract investors due to Lubin retaining the majority share in the nascent startups. (To be fair, one startup that recently managed to spin out despite the equity debacle, 3Box, raised $2.5 million from venture capital firms including Placeholder and CoinFund.)On the other hand, one current employee had a more optimistic view of the company “maturing” through this equity reconfiguration.“We get paid on time, when we have issues with bonuses we’re able to resolve them in a timely manner,” he said. “I think [employee share options] will be fair. I’m under no illusions. Given how much we’ve grown, that will result in dilution.”Out of the seven current and former ConsenSys employees CoinDesk interviewed for this article, six believed the disorganized compensation system is “highly political” and leads to unfair distribution.Some people work across various projects in “the mesh” and earn bonuses, equity, opportunities or tokens from each.“It’s chaos, there’s no clear line of authority or accountability,” one former employee told CoinDesk.Six sources said some ConsenSys executives took advantage of this system to siphon compensation from incubated projects without contributing significant value. The sole dissenter conceded this was happening with a few “short-term” incentives like extra bonuses, but didn’t believe this issue was widespread across the company.Another source said they weren’t disappointed by the lack of equity, although they added the younger and less experienced employees were “definitely” misled in their onboarding process.“Nobody is keeping track of these things,” the employee said, referring to who is owed what. “They’ve never gotten to the point where they could make good on that offer.”The company has seen three executive departures in recent months and rumors continue to swirl about current employees frustrated with disorganization.“What’s woefully incompetent is the continued promise of equity,” one source who did receive equity told CoinDesk. “Some folks have spoke equity in spokes they don’t even work for. It’s chaotic. There’s no reason to it.”ConsenSys office photo via CoinDesk archives"

The protocol differentiates itself from competitors like EOS or Tron by running parallel computations on sharded sections of the network to boost throughput.Additionally, “parallelism” could allow the network to linearly scale as more nodes join, eliminating network capacity limits. Meta transactions, contract-based accounts and gas fee rebates are also available at the protocol level.“We believe that Near’s developer-friendly proof-of-stake protocol will usher in a new wave of decentralized applications and give power back to end users,” said Ash Egan, who directs crypto investments at Accomplice.Near intends to use the funds to recruit more developers and build-out a mainnet of its platform, which is currently operating in beta. The beta protocol currently has fewer than 10 users, though, “we are in contact overall with 75 projects at the moment,” said CEO Alex Skidanov.Long term, Near’s aspirations run much deeper. Said Skidanov:“Assembling a world-class development team and creating the technology is really just the first step – the next is launching a global movement that puts blockchain technology in the hands of the developers and entrepreneurs who will carry it to consumers everywhere via the apps and businesses they create.”To get there, Near will focus on a fair token distribution, adoption by both validators and companies, and capturing a significant portion of the existing blockchain market.Other round participants include Electric Capital, Pantera Capital and Amplify Partners, as well as contributions from Coinbase Ventures and Ripple’s Xpring, among others.Said Pantera partner Paul Veradittakit:“The Near team is focused on building developer tools and creating an ecosystem that is inclusive of developers, designers, and business development backgrounds, which differentiates them from most other projects in the space.”Near co-founder Alex Skidanov (right) speaks with Tendermint’s Zaki Manian (left).

Such users can now contribute funds to packages of short-term loans that help businesses cover payroll, inventory and other unexpected costs.“Cadence is doing its part to help power the growth of small to medium-sized enterprises by providing them market-driven cost efficiencies,” Cadence founder and CEO Nelson Chu said in a statement. The loan packages are made transparent by the ethereum blockchain.In private beta with select investors, Cadence saw $5.67 million pass through its offerings since January.With the news, Cadence is also announcing the closure of a pre-seed round of venture funding. Led by Recharge Capital, a fintech-focused family office, the $2 million round also included Argo Ventures, the venture arm of Argo Group, a New York Stock Exchange-listed specialty insurance company; Coinbase Ventures, the investment arm of the unicorn cryptocurrency exchange; and InBlockchain, a leading crypto investor based in Asia.The round also included individual investors, many of whom serve as executives at banks that might buy debt on Cadence. With more investors than he had room for on his cap table, Chu explained how he picked partners:“The value is really in how much they can help us drive institutional adoption.”The market for private credit is growing rapidly. According to a report by BNY Mellon, it first hit $1 billion in 2017, and it has since grown to a market in the hundreds of billions of dollars. In a widely cited forecast, the Alternative Credit Council estimates it should reach $1 trillion by 2020.Cadence offers short-term loans paid to businesses to cover operational needs, targeting a 10 percent annual return. So a three-month loan term could return over 2 percent at maturity.For a hedge fund, this can be a nice, reliable place to stick some excess capital without holding it up for too long, in case something really amazing pops up.“We are by far the best ‘try before you buy’ model,” Chu said. “We’ve had hedge fund managers put in $500 to see if it works, and then it comes back with interest and they put in $25,000.”Once an investor has their identity checks run and is granted access to the system, they’ll see an array of loans on offer and how much space is left in each round. All these offerings are also viewable inside the Bloomberg Terminal as well, for traders who live inside that system.All the attributes of each pool – such as sector, risk profile, the originator and other details – are viewable on each loan. All the loans include multiple borrowers, to help spread out risk.One advantage of getting into a pool is that previous investors get first dibs if it rolls over. If an instrument cycles over again, existing investors get a few days to renew their allocation before it opens up to new investors.“If you go on any other private crowdfunding platform, the biggest complaint is you get locked out,” Chu said. “That first look, investors really appreciate.”Cadence CEO Nelson Chu speaks at World Blockchain Forum New York 2018.

The investment takes the form of a $1.5 million seed round in data startup Textile.","Launching on the surface as a decentralized answer to Flickr, Textile has a larger mission: to help users control their own data by using the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). IPFS is an open protocol built by Protocol Labs, the same company that created the Filecoin ICO.“IPFS’s story is under-shared, in my opinion,” Textile co-founder and CEO Andrew Hill told CoinDesk. “It’s one of the greatest inventions of the past decade and has already proven its value in countless real-world examples.”IPFS creates a new architecture for the web where data is stored by its content rather than its location, which means that multiple copies can be located around the world making the web more efficient. It also makes data less prone to disappearing when a link goes dead.BlueYard, which led Textile’s round, is already an investor in Protocol Labs and other applications that rely on IPFS.BlueYard co-founder Ciarán O’Leary told CoinDesk in an email:“We think the internet would be better if we were to re-think it away from the server-client model and create a web where apps would permission data from users, versus the other way around.”O’Leary noted that for as good as the underlying technology is, the web needs software like Textile’s to improve its user experience.Multicoin’s Kyle Samani told CoinDesk that his company believes in Web3 and sees that one of its first needs is for a data storage solution. He called Textile an “iCloud for Web3,” adding, “Textile is one of the most perfect examples of a Web3 developer tooling infrastructure play.”For both Multicoin and Collaborative Fund, this is their first IPFS-related investment. Collaborative’s Taylor Greene told CoinDesk in an email that his firm was already interested in investments that would return data control to internet users.“Textile is the most elegant solution that we’ve seen in that space,” Greene said.Interested users can join the waiting list now to use Textile’s own photos app, which demonstrates the fundamental functionality of the software. Hill told CoinDesk that Textile “makes it possible for users to own their data, and share (or revoke) that data with trusted applications – or anyone else for that matter.”He added:“It is not possible to imagine humanity becoming even more digital without a new and thoughtful approach to data ownership and our right to control our own digital data.”Textile at IPFS Camp 2019 image via Twitter"

That way, entrepreneurs and startups can quickly get the help they need when they need it, then go back to their home offices to keep building great companies, teams, and protocols.The studio programs on offer include an IDEO brand design workshop, an organization scaling workshop with Electric Capital, and a legal and regulatory workshop with law firm Perkins Coie.Longer term residencies, based in either San Francisco or Boston, will range from three to six months alongside IDEO CoLab’s approximately 20 person team.IDEO began working with startups in 2012, after 21 years of successful design for international corporations such as Apple, Walgreens, and 3M.It continued to support underdogs when tilting towards distributed web technologies in 2015. Since that time, IDEO has collaborated on over 30 blockchain protocols, co-created 12, and invested in 9 burgeoning startups, including IPFS, ZeppelinOS, Augur, Zcash, Handshake and Grin.Additionally, the company is looking to invest in approximately 12 new blockchain initiatives every year going forward. The accelerator’s success is seen by the reflexive investment from one of IDEO’s first early stage collaborations – Messari, which has joined Startup Studio.Lee said:“We believe we’ve found a sustainable model to support early-stage entrepreneurs, and that our approach and value will lead the best founders to deepen their relationship and align incentives with us.”Indeed, IDEO has had repeated collaborations with most of the companies in its portfolio, including some that began long before they invested, according to Lee.Startup Studio has received support from Atrium, Avanta Ventures, Blockchain at Berkeley, Brex, CoinList, CSAA Insurance Group, Electric, GS Group, Hanwha, NEAR Protocol, Oasis Labs, she256, Silicon Valley Bank and Tezos Foundation, in addition to the names listed above.Amazon image via Shutterstock"

LO3 Energy fits right in that space,” said Kirk Coburn, investment director at Shell Ventures.With LO3’s system, a mobile app enables users to choose from different local energy resources and further allows them to select a specific supplier.While the electricity passes through the power grid as normal, a “private, permissioned blockchain” tracks the details of the energy source and the purchase agreement.According to its white paper, LO3’s “Exergy” blockchain is aimed to “facilitate the optimal coupling of local electric generation to parties that can value, procure, store and utilize this generation most efficiently. The resulting transactions will clear within a participative market-driven environment operating as close to the grid edge as possible, with an increasing level of automation by using self-executing contracts on a distributed ledger.”The company said its product could power a range of business use cases, including “peer-to-peer energy trading, energy hedging for businesses, virtual power plants, dynamic electric vehicle charging and demand response.”The startup’s CEO Lawrence Orsini said:“Energy is going through a revolution with renewable distributed energy resources increasingly picking up market share – but to integrate them efficiently we need to re-invent our energy networks.”LO3 has previously garnered investments from Braemar Energy Ventures, Centrica, and tech giant Siemens.Shell image via Shutterstock"
