","Cashback rewards have been made popular by credit card companies seeking to attract new customers for their cards. Fortunately, for cryptocurrency users, there are also bitcoin cashback reward platforms that pay shoppers small rebates in bitcoin when making purchases with supported merchants. ","In this guide, you will discover the top five bitcoin cashback rewards apps that you can use to get free bitcoin when shopping online. Australia-based BitcoinRewards enables users across the globe to earn bitcoin rewards at some of the most popular online merchants. Users can receive bitcoin cashback rewards ranging from 0.8% to 40% of the purchase amount by shopping at vendors such as Booking.com, Coursera, Hotspot Shield, Nvidia, and Puma. To start receiving digital currency cashback rewards, you need to sign up using a name and email address and then browse the list of supported merchants to find the goods or services they are seeking. Once a merchant has been chosen, you click the “Go to shop” button at which point a new tap opens with the merchant’s website. There you shop as you normally would and after around 48 hours, your BitcoinRewards account will be credited with the bitcoin cashback amount available for this specific vendor. Aside from bitcoin, BitcoinRewards also provides cashback payments in bitcoin cash and binance coin. U.S.-based CoinRebates is an online cashback rewards platform that enables online shoppers to receive cash rebates in bitcoin. Currently, the platform has a merchant network of over 300 retailers, which includes the likes of AliExpress, BestBuy, Carhartt, Lego, New Balance, Target, and Udemy. To sign up, all you need is a bitcoin wallet address that is input on the website and then you can browse through the supported merchants to make your online purchases. Like on most bitcoin cashback platforms, rebates are usually credited after the purchased item’s return policy has run out (generally around 30 days). Lolli is perhaps the most popular bitcoin cashback app in the market today. The well-funded New York-based bitcoin startup enables crypto-savvy online shoppers to receive cashback rewards in bitcoin through its free Chrome extension. To get started, you need to visit Lolli.com, add the Chrome extension, and sign up to the platform. Once signed in, you can scroll through the list of supported online shops and get starting with making your purchases. Ensure that the extension is activated when making purchases and then enjoy “stacking sats” as you shop online. You will be informed of the amount of BTC you have earned after you have made a purchase. Currently, Lolli has a merchant network of over 500 retailers. Los Angeles-based bitcoin startup Pei provides a mobile application that enables users to receive automatic cash rebates in BTC or USD when making purchases at partner merchants using their linked debit or credit cards. Unlike other bitcoin cashback rewards apps, Pei also works with in-store payments as all rebates are linked to the user’s card purchases. Supported merchants include the likes Burger King, Dunkin Donuts, Papa Johns, Starbucks, and Zara, among many more. The newly launched Sats App with SatsBack by CasaHODL is the latest addition to the bitcoin cashback rewards landscape. Launched on July 3, the SatsApp aims to make using the Bitcoin Lightning Network as easy as possible by enabling users to connect to their Casa Node using their smartphone. In addition, it wants to play its part in boosting Lightning Network adoption by allowing users to receive satoshi cashback rewards. Hence, the name “SatsBack” for this feature.The SatsApp is available on Android and iOS and is currently only accessible to Casa Gold, Platinum and Diamond members. The emergence and growth of the bitcoin cashback ecosystem could help to boost bitcoin adoption as more and more online shoppers may want to earn “free bitcoin” when making purchases that they would make either way. The ease-of-use of Lolli’s Chrome extension or the Pei app’s card payment feature could attract a new user segment of thrifty shoppers to bitcoin. Whether these new users would then HODL their satoshi’s or spend them in the bitcoin economy would remain to be seen."

July 12, 2019
","Juan Villaverde is an econometrician and mathematician devoted to the analysis of cryptocurrencies since 2012. He leads the Weiss Ratings team of analysts and computer programmers who created Weiss cryptocurrency ratings.
","Bitcoin hit rock bottom on Dec. 15, 2018.According to CoinMarketCap, it traded as low as USD 3,191.Then it bounced back up.And BTC has been moving mostly higher ever since: It reached an intraday high of USD 13,769 on June 26. It held firmly above USD 10,000 even after a sharp correction. And it might be going parabolic once again.Most observers can plainly see the raw power of this new Bitcoin bull market. What they may not readily see, however, is the fact that …This is the strongest first phase of any bull market in the entire history of Bitcoin.Here’s how we reach this conclusion …First, our Bitcoin cycles model uses clearly defined rules to identify Major Bull-Bear Cycles, as follows:Bull: Jul. 2010 – Jun. 2011Bear: Jun. 2011 - Nov. 2011Bull: Nov. 2011 to Dec. 2013Bear: Dec. 2013 to Jan. 2015Bull: Jan. 2015 — Dec. 2017Bear: Dec. 2017 — Dec. 2018Bull: Dec 2018 —Second, within each major bull market, our model identifies a series of primary Trading Cycles, each ending in regular corrections of about 30% or more.Third, each trading day of the year, we ask the question: Where are we now? Here’s the answer for today, July 10, 2019:So now, the big question is …How does the first Trading Cycle of THIS bull market compare to the first Trading Cycle of prior bull markets?Specifically, we want to know two things about the first Trading Cycle of each Bitcoin bull:For the answers, let’s take a closer look at historic Bitcoin charts to see precisely how it recovered from bear markets of the past:First up, here's a weekly chart of Bitcoin in 2011-'12 …As you can see, after Bitcoin hit rock bottom, its first Trading Cycle (prior to its first 30%-type correction) carried it 263% higher.Pretty good.But it was still a distant 77% off its all-time high.Was the 2015 recovery any different? Yes, and no. See below …First up, notice the difference in the duration of the bear market. Bitcoin spent twice as much time going down in 2014 than it did in 2011.Second, as it recovered from that long bear market, its first Trading Cycle was a lot weaker. It only managed to rally 91% before selling off by more than 30% in August 2015.Third, here’s the similarity: Again, at the end of the first Trading Cycle, it was still 70% off its all-time high set in the prior bull market.Now look how strong Bitcoin has been so far in 2019:In its first bull-market Trading Cycle, Bitcoin rallied by a whopping 342% from its December low. That means it’s packing more than TRIPLE the power of the equivalent cycle in 2015.Moreover, at its peak in late June, Bitcoin was only about 30% off its all-time high of nearly 20,000.Never in the history of Bitcoin have we seen such strength coming right out of a bear market!And I repeat: Look how close Bitcoin is to breaching its all-time high! Both in 2011, and in 2014, it took years for Bitcoin to get this far and even more time to exceed its prior peaks.What happens if Bitcoin can maintain its 2019 momentum? It could even make new all-time highs by year-end or early 2020.That would be an unprecedented move for Bitcoin.It would fly in the face of all naysayers who were chanting “death of crypto” as recently as just a few months ago.What could be causing such strength in the crypto markets?We provided some of the key reasons in our landmark March report, Weiss Cryptocurrency Outlook: Dark Shadows with a Bright Future.Plus, we call on all investors to pay very close attention to four other powerful dynamics in the marketplace today:The demand for decentralized, censorship-resistant and fully digital stores of value has strengthened dramatically in recent years.For those who truly understand money, this should come as no surprise. We live in an age of endless money-printing by central banks and record-high levels of sovereign debt by the world's major superpowers.This fact alone makes Bitcoin — along with precious metals like gold — stand out as one of the best ways to store value in a secure way.In fact, the unconfiscatable, scarce and highly portable nature of Bitcoin makes it extremely attractive for those who prioritize long-term capital preservation and can ignore the short-term price volatility.The sheer passage of time has validated the technology behind Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work blockchain.At the dawn of prior bull markets — in 2015 and even more so in 2011 — Bitcoin was largely an experimental technology. You'd be forgiven for thinking that an unforeseen system-wide bug could bring the Bitcoin network down to its knees.But as time has passed, big financial players have gained confidence that Bitcoin is indeed as immutable and hack-proof as advertised nearly a decade ago when it was first conceived.We now see cryptocurrency technology (DLT) going mainstream. Big banks like JPMorgan Chase have jumped into the space, effectively embracing and endorsing the technology.Facebook's Libra project is many times bigger.And many more such projects are in the works.Back in 2009, anyone who predicted that the future of money could be closely tied to this kind of distributed consensus mechanism was considered a nutcase.But in 2019, after billions of R&D dollars have been poured into this technology, any giant tech or fintech company that ignores it does so at their own peril.Big institutional investors are starting to move into crypto.Until now, crypto investing was limited primarily to millennial tech-savvy speculators and a small minority of traditional stock investors.Large institutions were almost entirely absent from the market.And that’s still mostly the case today.Now, however, after watching major banks and tech companies jump on board, we're seeing big money starting to move in.And it’s mostly this influx of institutional money that best explains why Bitcoin has been so strong in 2019. The crypto markets are still small, and they've never received this much attention from big money.As more big players jump onto to the crypto space in the months and years to come, we can only speculate as to what the impact on crypto-asset valuations will be. But …Judging by what we've seen so far in 2019, you may never again see a better time to buy, especially if you focus on coins that merit the highest Weiss Crypto Ratings.Just be sure to invest prudently, waiting for corrections and using strictly funds you can afford to risk."

July 15, 2019
","The President of the United States, Donald Trump, can theoretically go after Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies but in reality, such a ban is highly unlikely, according to a recent discussion in the cryptoland. ","The discussion was sparked by the Trump’s tweetstorm where he expressed distaste for Bitcoin, Libra, and other competitors of the United States dollar. Besides, some members of the U.S. congress have already drafted a “Keep Big Tech Out of Finance” bill, which is intended to prevent the creation of Facebook’s new cryptocurrency.Meanwhile, according to economist and trader Alex Krüger, the United States Constitution protects Bitcoin code as it is a form of free speech which is protected by the First Amendment. As a result, making Bitcoin illegal is equal to banning free speech and thus is unconstitutional.However, the regulators have all the power to “protect” investors from dealing in bitcoin marketplaces by targeting and isolating fiat onramps for retail and institutional investors. It would serve to remove most liquidity out of the local bitcoin markets. Alternatively, Trump could issue an executive order banning U.S. citizens from dealing in bitcoin, much like he did with the Venezuelan Petro cryptocurrency. Such a ban could be motivated by an “attempt to circumvent U.S. sanctions and would be similar to the “hoarding of gold” executive order of 1933.Besides, Trump can go after fiat-to-crypto exchanges by simply forbidding banks to serve them. Moreover, some of the U.S. banks already do so.Thanks for reaching out to us. Unfortunately, Wells Fargo does not allow transactions involving cryptocurrency. -JoshIn sum, a full-blown ban on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in the U.S. is possible in theory but highly unlikely. Moreover, it might mean that Trump could lose millions of his supporters. However, if it does happen, Krüger predicts a rapid and immense bitcoin market crash.16/ TL;DR- A Bitcoin ban in the US is feasible- Ban could come via a Trump executive order- Ban could be over-turned- Probability of a ban is extremely low- Probability increased last week- Regulatory risk keeps many institutions away- A ban would see $BTC crash rapidly pic.twitter.com/VEz5y58arLKruger is not the only skeptic of the U.S. crypto ban. According to George McDonaugh, the CEO and co-founder of the investment firm KR1, Trump remarks on Bitcoin are simply wrong. ""Imagine giving Donald Trump a money printing machine and then asking him kindly not to use it. My thoughts exactly... This is why the U.S. economy is 22 trillion in debt and why the average lifespan of a government backed fiat currency is 27 years. There will be a reckoning, and when it comes it will be something like bitcoin that comes to the rescue."" Other Twitter users seem to share similar sentiments.A crypto ban would be a highly unpopular (and thus risky) move in the US and other Western countries right now. If we see a ban, then likely ""in response"" to a false flag attack that turned public opinion (""terrorists using bitcoin""). That's how most wars kick off historically.America banned Online Casino, despite that, online casinos, which are not decentralized, still make hundreds of millions targeting US customers. They can Ban Bitcoin, they can try. It will not stop Americans to buy it, sell it and use it. It will not stop Exchanges. It will grow!That’s exactly the pretext on how Telegram was officially banned in Russia. Ironically, the government cannot enforce the ban and Tg works just fine. The only thing they can report “We’re very successful in banning Telegram. If you use it, you know it’s somewhat slower now”The U.S. government and regulatory sanctions from other countries aren’t the only threats to Bitcoin, as there are other theoretical scenarios which could potentially kill Bitcoin.
Ever since Trump comments on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, the crypto market is experiencing a correction as bitcoin retested the USD 10,000 support level. However, majority of analysts agree that it has nothing to with Trump remarks. Moreover, bitcoin price increased right after the tweetstorm by the President."

July 15, 2019
","A new Ethereum scalability solution, which would include using the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain as the data layer, proposed by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, was met with a wave of criticism. ","Buterin finds that there exists a number of scalability solutions if techniques of a non-scalable computation layer, that is Ethereum chain suffices, plus a scalable data layer, are employed, which use interactive computation techniques to calculate the state on the Ethereum side. These rely on the data availability verification provided by the data layer, which is how fake submissions can be detected and punished. “One could use techniques like this to make a highly scalable general-purpose EVM [Ethereum Virtual Machine, or the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum.]-like system,” Buterin said. The scalable data layer is planned to be Ethereum 2.0 in the long run, “because its planned 10 MB/s data throughput is much higher than that of any existing blockchain”, but in the shorter run, as the data layer, Buterin proposes using existing blockchains, especially the ones with lower transaction fees per byte than Ethereum. He gave four reasons why Bitcoin Cash is ""the perfect fit"":The main weakness of the BCH chain, Vitalik says, is its 10-minute block time, but the BCH community is very interested in strengthening zero-confirmation payments with techniques that might become “robust for the use case of preventing double-spends” and Ethereum “could piggy back off of them to achieve shorter finality times”. However, some people voiced their dissatisfaction over this online. Andre Neves, editor of Komenco Blog and Lightwork, quotes Buterin saying that the main weakness of the BCH chain is its 10 minute block time, and asks “What about the low hashrate? Central controlling authorities? Extremely large blocks that lead to constant reorgs?” Erik Wall, privacy tech advisor at the Human Rights Foundation, who previously built blockchains and cryptocurrency exchange platforms at Cinnober, a global provider of financial technology, owned by stock-exchange operator Nasdaq, adds to this: “Uhh VitalikButerin what about the weakness that it can be 51% attacked single-handedly by most BTC pools?”Some even go as far as predicting doom for both Ethereum and BCH.Lovely, ETH and BCH helping each other to collapse fasterThe shitcoin $ETH has hit a three-year low versus Bitcoin. The founder has all but declared the project a failure today by proposing a humiliating bcash integration to delay the (yet unsolved) scalibility crisis. tHe fLiPpeNniNG iS nEaR pic.twitter.com/DzKxW4O6F4Buterin basically is saying that ETH 2.0 is not right around the corner, ETH 1.0 can't and won't scale, no one is using bcash, and he thinks its a good idea to use bcash as a temporary ETH landfill.I would be a little concerned at this point...At pixel time (10:19 UTC), ether trades at c. USD 227 and is down by almost 8% in the past 24 hours and by more than 26% in the past week."

Web 3.0 focuses on decentralized, peer-to-peer technologies.The added features are described as follows:Opera’s built-in Crypto Wallet had so far supported only Ethereum and ERC-tokens, but the browser is expanding in their effort to be more inclusive. “It’s now safe to say that our browsers are Web 3 ready and that this should be the new standard for all browsers,” according to Opera.This is another step in a row on Opera's blockchain and cryptocurrency path. As a reminder, the company launched Opera Touch for Android in December 2018. In April 2019, it released a desktop browser that boasts a built-in cryptocurrency wallet with support for Ethereum. Then just this June, Opera launched their blockchain-ready Opera Touch web browser with a crypto wallet for iOS."

","On July 11, hackers stole JPY 3.5 billion (USD 32 million) from the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange BITpoint, its parent company Remixpoint confirmed today, adding that victims of the hack will be compensated.","The exchange stopped all its services earlier today and promised to announce more details later. JPY 2.5 billion belong to the customers of the exchange, while the rest were stolen directly from the BITpoint Japan. BITpoint Japan Inc. is a Tokyo-based exchange, established in March 2016. Its major shareholder is the mentioned Remix Point Co., Ltd, a Japan-based company engaged, besides their crypto exchange, in software development, energy-related business, and automotive business. The exchange’s website cites the capital of JPY 4,430 billion (USD 41 million).  Its subsidiaries are BITpoint Hong Kong, BITPoint Korea, BITPoint Malaysia, BITpoint Panama, BITpoint Apec, BITpoint Taiwan, and Hangzhou Weitai Net Technology Co., Ltd. BITpoint Malaysia, however, has stopped providing services, as the notice on the website states, since the Security Commission Malaysia registered three Recognized Market Operators (RMOs) which are allowed to establish and operate digital asset exchanges in the country, while BITpoint found itself on the list of the digital asset exchanges not permitted to continue operating effective June 1, 2019.BITpoint’s site showcases no trading and account management fees, as well as its security measures, which makes this hack even more surprising. They also got an “A” from the information security rating company IS Rating, Inc. in October 2018. The security measures include segregation management, SSL support, two-step certification, customer notification, and multisig compatibility.As many experts have stressed previously, crypto users should keep their private keys to their coins offline, e.g. in hardware wallets such as Ledger, Trezor, KeepKey and others.In 2018, BITpoint was among other exchanges that were hit with business improvement orders by Japanese regulator the Financial Services Agency. Also, as reported, BITpoint has recently opened a branch in Peru."

July 10, 2019
","The Litecoin (LTC) halving, or reduction of the Litecoin block mining reward, should already be priced in by the market as everyone knows about it since the beginning, according to Charlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin, currently the 5th coin by market capitalization, and the Managing Director of the Litecoin Foundation.","The thing is, he notes, that people expect the price to go up, so many are buying in, and it ends up being “a kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy.” “I think we’re seeing a bit of that today,” Lee said in an interview published by Crypto Love YouTube channel on July 7th. However, while the price is estimated to go up in the long run, Lee says it’s anybody’s guess how it moves short term. At pixel time (13:07 UTC), litecoin trades at c. USD 108 and is down by around 10% in the past 24 hours, week and month, while it's still up by 47% in the past 12 months.Litecoin price chart:The second Litecoin's halving is estimated to happen on August 5 and will reduce the digital currency’s rate of new supply in half, to LTC 12.5 per mined Litecoin blockchain block. According to Lee, halving is always a shock to the system and some miners will not be profitable and “will shut off their machines”. But if a large percentage of network shuts their machines off, then it would slow down the network for some time. “For Litecoin, it’s two and a half days till next change, so possibly seven days”, explains Lee, adding that the mining difficulty will readjust and everything will be fine after that period.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin's next halving is expected in May 2020, and Lee doesn’t see Litecoin and Bitcoin following a similar pattern. The two coins are different, Lee says. “It depends on the macroeconomics of crypto at the time.” In the interview, Lee has also discussed bitcoin price forecasts. At the end of last year, co-founder of the first Chinese cryptocurrency exchange BTCC, and Charlie Lee’s brother, Bobby Lee, famously predicted USD 333,000 per bitcoin by 2021, asking his followers on Twitter if they thought this would happen, which most did not. The creator of Litecoin says he doesn’t agree with that prediction, and that it’s not good to try and predict prices because no one actually knows what will happen. When jokingly asked by the host about USD 333,000 per LTC, Lee also jokingly replied: “That’s definitely gonna happen.”Watch the whole interview below:"

","Major Asian cryptocurrency exchanges are intensifying competition for the huge and highly regulated U.S. market. As Binance is preparing to launch its American branch in the coming months and Huobi is already strengthening its presence here, OKGroup, the owner of the major crypto-to-crypto exchange OKEx, is also taking new steps in the U.S. via its fiat-to-crypto exchange OKCoin.","OKCoin already offers its services in more than 110 countries and is ranked 87th by trading volume (USD 26 million in the past 24 hours, as of July 11, according to Coinpaprika.com). It’s been a year since OKCoin US came to San Francisco and “we see a tremendous positive pickup,” Tim Byun, a former regulator, now CEO of OKCoin, told Cryptonews.com, without providing any numbers. “OKEx is not in the U.S. but we are definitely expanding on the OKCoin fiat side,” he added.Now, the company is seeking additional state licenses given that “in the U.S., it's not only regulated on a federal level but on a state level as a money service business.”Founded in 2013, the exchange currently offers trading in more than 20 digital tokens, including bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum, ethereum classic, and litecoin. In the U.S., they need to be careful to not offer security tokens, since the trading of securities requires at least Alternative Trading System broker dealer authority, Byun said, and added: “I'm not ready to share any definitive trends but we will definitely take a look at all those because we basically want to serve the customers as best as we can.” However, Byun said that security tokens “continue to gain steam as companies start to lay out the foundation to be able to facilitate trading of security tokens in a compliant manner abiding by local regulations that are in the security side.” Furthermore, there is a U.S. regulation called “the Travel Rule”, which concerns all financial institutions. OKCoin is a money service business as defined by the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), so when they send bitcoins worth over USD 3,000 dollars to another financial institution, such as Coinbase in the U.S., OKCoin must send certain personal information of the sender to Coinbase. For blockchain that’s difficult, so it’s a problem that must be solved, finds Byun.“It's almost like applying U.S. postal mail rules to email for U.S. communication roles"", Byun explains, ""like pushing a square peg into a round hole for us, the blockchain ecosystem.”The FinCEN has introduced the Travel rule to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which then made it a recommendation for other countries to pass. “My guess is that some will. Some will not,” according to the CEO.Besides the U.S., OKCoin plans to expand into other countries, particularly those with a regulatory framework “because we think that if governments are open to recognizing digital assets, that's a good environment for us to plant our seeds of for the next decade.” However, according to the CEO, other countries that do not have such a framework yet but are looking into it, e.g. Brazil, might be of interest also.""We will obviously first study [Brazilian] framework. And then we’ll visit them <...> and we'll probably see what type of investments we could make in terms of people, offices and a local presence,” the CEO said.Trading volume on OKCoin:"

","The major crypto exchange Binance launched margin trading on an upgraded version of its trading platform, dubbed Binance 2.0, today. According to the company, the new feature will allow traders to take on leveraged positions both short and long in a number of trading pairs.","Maximum leverage with Binance is set to 1:3, which means that for every 1 BTC (or other cryptocurrency) deposited as collateral, 2 more can be borrowed from the exchange. Funds used as collateral for margin trading must first be moved to a dedicated Margin Wallet, which the company says can be done free of any transaction fees.In addition to a slightly upgraded user interface that allows access to both the regular exchange and the new margin feature, the upgraded trading platform reportedly also comes with a new trading engine for better order matching.Binance first started talking about the introduction of margin trading on its platform back in May this year, after CEO Changpeng Zhao posted screenshots of the companyâ€™s upgraded trading platform to Twitter.However, the new feature has attracted a fair share of warnings from experienced traders, saying new traders should be extremely cautious when trading with leverage. Without a solid trading strategy and proper risk management, an entire trading account can quickly be wiped out by a leverage trade moving in the wrong direction. For now, margin trading with Binance is not available to residents of the USA, Canada, Japan, South Korea, and some other jurisdictions.Several other crypto exchanges already offer margin trading on their platforms, including Coinbase Pro, Kraken, and Bitfinex.Speaking at the Asia Blockchain Summit 2019 in Taipei recently, the CEO also revealed that Binance plans to introduce futures trading soon, similar to what crypto futures exchange BitMEX is already doing. According to the CEO, futures trading on their platform will come with up to 20 times leverage.

","Ad and fee-free crypto research platform, Coinpaprika, is building their business model on the mobile-only COINS product and will be looking to raise more capital to support faster growth, CEO Mike Grzybkowski tells Cryptonews.com. ","While “Coinpaprika is and will remain completely free with all its functionalities” explains Grzybkowski, “COINS will have features that are going to earn us some money.” The business model for this new product will be disclosed soon, he adds.The CEO says that they’re aiming at casual investors for COINS, those who discover interesting projects and invest in them directly. “Having only a mobile experience also secures our future development for eventual improvements”, he adds, noting that it will not be available for desktop users.“The most important thing we discovered through our one year of existence”, explains Grzybkowski “is the fact that cryptocurrencies are a mobile-driven industry.”
The unspecified internal financing round to launch the COINS and present it to the world is closed. “In the future we definitely will be looking for investors in further rounds to scale up and set up global strategic development,” the CEO said without specifying.Grzybkowski emphasizes that COINS is not simply a Coinpaprika mobile version, but a separate, much bigger product in which “Coinpaprika will make up only about 1/4 of all the functionalities.” The app will connect four pillars, as the CEO explains:This crypto research platform is aimed at both professionals and beginners, says Grzybkowski, but it’s not a finished product yet, as it requires more data. “Right now, I would say it is ready at about 75%”, he says.

","Recent steps by Singaporean authorities prove their plan to make this island city-state “a global hub for both cryptocurrency trading and blockchain innovation,” David Kao, Head of Binance Singapore, told Cryptonews.com, as the third trading platform of major crypto exchange Binance publicly launched on Tuesday. ","“We believe the recent initiative by the IRAS [the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore] to exempt digital payment tokens (DPTs) from GST [goods and services tax] is a move in the right direction. Along with the new licensing regime in the Payments Services Bill (PSB), these initiatives demonstrate the government's dedication to making Singapore a global hub for both cryptocurrency trading and blockchain innovation,” Kao said.As reported on Monday, in a recently published e-Tax draft guide, the IRAS proposed the exemption of certain cryptocurrency transactions from GST and is now asking for feedback from businesses dealing in crypto. Also, the Ministry of Finance is conducting a Public Consultation on the legislative amendments for cryptocurrencies in July.Meanwhile, after the soft launch in April, Binance Singapore announced the public launch of this  fiat-to-crypto platform yesterday. Their users can buy bitcoin, ethereum and binance coin with Singapore dollars (SGD). “In the future, there will be other cryptocurrencies added to the platform as the team focuses on growing market share and providing a differentiated product while also ensuring continued security and compliance,” according to the company. Since April, the platform has seen user growth of about 20% per week, Binance Singapore said without providing any further numbers.Also, the company said that Binance has additional, unspecified plans “to grow the Singapore blockchain ecosystem” with investment partners Vertex Ventures China as well as Vertex Ventures Southeast Asia and India. Vertex Ventures is a global network of operator-investors who manage portfolios in the U.S., China, Israel, India and Southeast Asia.  Binance Singapore is one of the three operating compliant fiat-to-cryptocurrency platforms in the Binance ecosystem. The other two are Binance Uganda and Binance Jersey. The major exchange also aims to launch its American branch in the coming months."

","Singapore-based blockchain company Pundi X claims it has made another step towards cryptocurrency adoption by integrating its technology into traditional point-of-sale (PoS) terminals, released by a major provider of such devices, U.S.-based Verifone.","According to Pundi X, its XPOS (their point of service device that accepts cryptocurrencies) module has been integrated on Verifone’s X990, the latest Android-based point of sale terminal produced by the PoS company. Now, these devices can process cryptocurrency payments along with traditional transactions, the blockchain company said, adding that this will allow “a wider network of retailers to accept payments in cryptocurrencies.”Thanks to the XPOS, the Verifone X990 will be able to accept a number of cryptocurrencies as payment options, such as BTC, ETH, BNB, KCS, KNC, XEM , and NPXS at any retailer that has the Pundi X Verifone X990 installed.""The XPOS integration is an essential step to link the Pundi X payment ecosystem with one of the most extensive payment networks in the world”, the company said in a press release. The point of this integration is that, with the the XPOS module installed, the Verifone X990 will function like the XPOS, “as all of its features will be installed in the traditional terminals”. This means that customers who have Pundi XPASS cards or the XWallet app can do transactions with the retailers who are using the X990 in the same way they do with XPOS partner merchants. Furthermore, the XPOS will provide an exchange rate between fiat and cryptocurrencies automatically during the transaction.To have XPOS module in X990 and other upcoming Android-based PoS models, merchants will be required to contact their local VeriFone or Pundi X distributors for installation, according to the announcement. Verifone is considered as one of the historical pioneers in credit card terminals. Established in 1981, it was acquired by Francisco Partners for USD 3.4 billion in 2018. The POS company claims it has shipped over 30 million products, which range from integrated POS systems to countertop and PIN pad devices, to more than 150 countries.Yiannos Papadopoulos, Asia Pacific President at Verifone, said: ""Having blockchain technology in the X990 will revolutionize how our partner retailers transact with a new generation of customers carrying cryptocurrencies.""Meanwhile, In October 2018, Pundi X unveiled the XPhone, the first fully-functional blockchain phone with a unique Operating System called f(x), making the first blockchain call ever. At the end of April this year, however, Pundi X blamed the bear market and long certification process for missing their expansion targets, not being able to ship as many XPOS's as planned and postponing their XPhone launch, but claimed that their long-term goals remained unchanged. At pixel time (11:13 UTC), NPXS trades at c. USD 0.000622 and is down by almost 8% in the past 24 hours, by 23% in the past week and by 29% in the past month."
