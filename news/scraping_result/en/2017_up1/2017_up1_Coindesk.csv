At press time, bitcoin’s market capitalization (the value of all bitcoins in existence) was $31bn.Still, the move comes amid a broader boost in the cryptocurrency market, which broke the $60bn barrier today.The increase has taken place amid strong surges from Ripple’s XRP, which seeks to lower costs in enterprise cross-border payments, and ethereum’s ether token, a cryptographic asset that powers its decentralized app network.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.Big and little screws image via Shutterstock"

By rising above $2,000, bitcoin’s price has surged more than 100% this year and nearly 125% since hitting an annual low of $891.51 in late March.Now that the the digital currency has surpassed this key, psychological level of $2,000, it could experience some significant tailwinds, according to several analysts who spoke with CoinDesk.Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged digital currency platform BitMEX, told CoinDesk that should bitcoin prices “convincingly” surpass $2,000, “the rate of price appreciation will accelerate dramatically”.Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of CryptoCompare, also weighed in on the importance of this price level, stating:“As a psychological level, bitcoin hitting $2,000 is an important milestone and will generate further interest that could boost the price further.”Speaking of interest, analysts generally agreed that bitcoin’s rise above $2,000 could spur significant attention from the media. Hayes offered similar sentiment, stating that a sustained rise above $2,000 would prompt every major financial media outlet to cover bitcoin.In spite of all this visibility, Hayter cautioned that sometimes, the “lack of sophistication” that goes along with mainstream media coverage “can be dangerous as it snowballs momentum.”Interestingly enough, Google Trends data has thus far shown that online searches for the word “bitcoin” have still not recovered to the all-time high they set in December 2013, but they are getting closer. While a figure of 100 represents the highest point for these searches, the metric stood at 85 at the time of report.While many agreed that bitcoin’s rise above $2,000 would spur greater media coverage, the factors that drove the currency’s price above this level seemed a bit more complex.One development that has coincided with bitcoin’s sharp price gains over the last several months is the rising interest of traders, as measured by trading volume at major exchanges. Earlier this month, both Kraken and Poloniex announced that they were experiencing surging transaction activity.Kraken indicated that on 5th May, trading volume across all digital assets surpassed $178m, setting an all-time high and beating the prior record by 25%.Poloniex expressed similar sentiment, saying in a statement that:“We have never seen such enthusiasm for trading blockchain tokens as we have in the past few months. Since January, we’ve seen an increase of more than 600% active traders online and regularly process 640% more transactions than we did merely [four] months ago.”Another factor that has helped drive bitcoin prices is the rising influence of Japan in the bitcoin markets, where the technology is now regulated. The Japanese yen is the single largest currency being exchanged for bitcoin, accounting for more than 45% of the money flow into bitcoin at the time of report, according to CryptoCompare data.The US dollar came in a relatively distant second, making up approximately 30% of the money flowing into bitcoin, according to additional CryptoCompare figures.This increase in the use of the Japanese yen comes after Japan moved to formally recognize bitcoin as a legal method of payment starting 1st April. The country’s lawmakers enacted legislation that both classified the cryptocurrency as a type of prepaid payment instrument and also caused it to fall under anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules.Bitcoin prices have even been rising sharply in spite of the cryptocurrency’s ongoing scaling dilemma, an ongoing issue with its transaction capacity that members of the bitcoin community have been trying to resolve.Developers could address this problem by increasing block size, increasing the number of transactions that can fit into an individual block through Segregated Witness, or both. Thus far, the bitcoin network has failed to rally the support needed to bring about any such changes.Still, bitcoin markets seem unhindered by the scaling dilemma, and Hayes spoke to this development:“It appears the scaling issue is forgotten. The positive momentum and publicity continues to attract new capital into bitcoin.”Rocket icon via Shutterstock"

Ver is noted as both an outspoken evangelist for the technology and one of the first ‘bitcoin millionaires’.","In the first entry in CoinDesk’s “Bitcoin Milestones” series, Ver discusses his initial brush with the technology and recounts the watershed moment when a single bitcoin became more valuable than the US dollar.I first heard the word ‘bitcoin’ in November or December 2010 thanks to a mention of it on the FreeTalkLive.com podcast.It sounded interesting enough. I maybe spent a few moments Googling it. At the time one bitcoin was worth about $0.10. I thought to myself, “This is interesting, but if no one is using it, it isn’t worth anything.”I moved on with my life after only about five minutes of research…***In February 2011, I heard bitcoin mentioned again, so I decided to Google it once again. The price was now around $0.40, and this time I started to see the bigger picture.I began to understand that:That’s when the dots (helped by years of studying Marx and Mises) connected in my mind.I realized that people were going to start using bitcoin as money and that I needed to buy some, but that was easier said than done in those days.There was no Coinbase, Xapo or Blockchain. In fact, the only wallet was the Bitcoin-QT full client that still had the option of CPU mining in it. The only option for buying bitcoin was a website with a strange domain called Mt. Gox.I contacted the website and received a personalized response rather quickly from the site’s owner, Jed McCaleb (he hadn’t yet sold the business to Mark Karpeles). After an email exchange or two, I decided to send $25,000 to what I recall was a personal bank account in New York.I waited for him to credit my account at Mt. Gox… and the price of bitcoin rose… and then it rose some more…***Several days went by, but Gox still hadn’t credited my wire transfer.I began to grow impatient… The price was rising ever closer to $1.As the price rose, so did my frustration at not having had my wire credited… but I wasn’t deterred. My excitement for the future potential of bitcoin was rising as well – and I was openly telling friends about bitcoin.One of them was less than convinced.When I explained bitcoin to him, and how I had just initiated a purchase of $25,000 worth because they were so amazing, he sarcastically replied, “If you think bitcoins are so great, why don’t you buy more of them?”As soon as he said that to me, I knew he was right, and that I should buy more of them! That very same day I initiated a second wire to Mt Gox.Somewhere in between, bitcoin passed $1…***As anyone who has owned bitcoin before knows, the moment you have some yourself, you feel much more connected with the cause and the people in the ecosystem.I couldn’t help but tell anyone who would listen to me about all the wonderful ways in which bitcoin was about to change the world for the better.I would literally tell anyone who would listen.From strangers in a restaurant, to cashiers at convenience stores, to everyone at family gatherings or weddings, whether they wanted to hear about bitcoin or not. (Many of them did not!)I paid for the world’s first bitcoin billboard and national radio ads. I set up the first major store to accept bitcoin as payment. I was involved with many other projects. The more bitcoin companies I invested in and the more bitcoins I bought, the more fun the whole experience became.I knew that we were all working on a fundamentally world-changing technology, but the rest of the world still had no idea.But, the real turning point for me though was owning my first bitcoin, and watching the price cross the $1 barrier for the first time.I still remember the naysayers claiming that a bitcoin could never be worth a whole dollar each. They claimed that bitcoin was just a bubble, a Ponzi scheme, or no different than digital Beanie Babies.They were all wrong, and I gladly told them so.Today, many people still dismiss bitcoin. Bitcoin isn’t guaranteed to be the winning cryptocurrency in the end. But its invention is guaranteed to have changed the world forever.Bitcoin and US dollar image via Shutterstock"

Addressing an audience of 700 senior executives, technologists and more, at the Exponential Finance event hosted by Singularity University, which he co-founded, Kurzweil explained his doubts.While he described “assumptions” about bitcoin’s ability to scale as “quite accurate” he said that people won’t be looking at algorithms to make their spending decisions.Instead he argued that it was the historic stability of a currency that makes it valuable, stability he said has been lacking in bitcoin.Kurzweil said:“Ultimately, people need to have confidence in their currency and bitcoin in particular has not really demonstrated that. It’s had a good year, but a very rocky life before that.”In the past year bitcoin’s price has increased from about $580 to almost $3,000. In February, the cryptocurrency surpassed a three-year old record of $1,165, only to regularly experience drops in price in excess of $100 in an hour and hundreds of dollars in a day.According to Kurzweil, who has developed a reputation as a “futurist” for his uncanny predictions, such inconsistency undermines the cryptocurrency’s value as a currency.“I wouldn’t put my money into it,” he said.In spite of Kurzweil’s skepticism of bitcoin as a currency, he also expressed interest in the possibility that the blockchain technology that powers bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could eventually be adopted by national governments.He called the “theory” behind blockchain “sound” but said that “people don’t yet have confidence in it.”While bitcoin’s ability to store value and facilitate transactions across borders has developed a loyal following among a relatively small group of people, Kurzweil said that wider adoption won’t rely on the power of its algorithm, but its historic reliability.“There’s no reason why currencies should be associated with particular national boundaries and governments,” he said. “However, currencies like the dollar have provided reasonable stability, bitcoin has not.”However, even as Kurzweil expressed his doubts about cryptocurrency as it currently exists, he argued that the promise of “greater transparency” and control over the creation process behind cryptocurrency could eventually lead a re-imagining of the way countries mint their native currencies.He concluded:“Providing greater transparency, and blockchain does provide that, could be something adopted by leading currencies like the existing national currencies.”Image of Ray Kurzweil on a robot via Michael del Castillo"

It also comes as prices in ether markets (the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network) rose to new all-time highs as well this morning.After spiking to new highs in January, the cryptocurrency’s price languished for several weeks in March after the SEC rejected the bitcoin exchange-traded fund proposed by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

5,www.coindesk.com,"Mar 27, 2017",A Short Guide to Bitcoin Forks,https://www.coindesk.com/short-guide-bitcoin-forks-explained,"A Short Guide to Bitcoin Forks. Mar 27, 2017 at 13:00 UTC Updated May 16, 
2017 at 20:05 UTC. https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/colorful- ...","Mar 27, 2017 at 13:00 UTC","If you have been paying attention to bitcoin at all lately, you may have noticed a lot of talk going on about ‘forks’.","Not like the kind you would find on a table, on a blockchain, a fork is a technical event that occurs because diverse participants need to agree on common rules.At its most basic, a fork is what happens when a blockchain diverges into two potential paths forward — either with regard to a network’s transaction history or a new rule in deciding what makes a transaction valid.As a result, those who use the blockchain have to show support for one choice over the other.Yet, there are many different types of forks, and the science of studying them is still new. So far, we know some forks resolve on their own, but others, fueled by deep rifts in a community, can cause a network to permanently split, creating two blockchain histories — and two separate currencies.Along with that, there has also been confusion about the various types of forks, how they get activated and the risks they pose.To clarify, we’ve assembled quick rundown on how different forks work.Before we get into the classifications, it’s worth noting that bitcoin forks already occur quite regularly.A byproduct of distributed consensus, forks happen anytime two miners find a block at nearly the same time. The ambiguity is resolved when subsequent blocks are added to one, making it the longest chain, while the other block gets “orphaned” (or abandoned) by the network.But forks also can be willingly introduced to the network. This occurs when developers seek to change the rules the software uses to decide whether a transaction is valid or not.When a block contains invalid transactions, that block is ignored by the network, and the miner who found that block loses out on a block reward. As such, miners generally want to mine only valid blocks and build on the longest chain.Following are some of the more common forks and their traits.What is it? A hard fork is a software upgrade that introduces a new rule to the network that isn’t compatible with the older software. You can think of a hard fork as an expansion of the rules. (A new rule that allows block size to be 2MB instead of 1MB would require a hard fork).What happens? Nodes that continue running the old version of the software will see the new transactions as invalid. So, to switch over to the new chain and to continue to mine valid blocks, all of the nodes in the network need to upgrade to the new rules.What can go wrong? The problem comes when some sort of political impasse arises, and a portion of the community decides to stick by the old rules no matter what. The hash rate, or network computing power, behind the old chain is irrelevant. What matters is that its data (and ruleset) is still perceived to have value, meaning miners still want to mine a chain and developers still want to support it.The ethereum DAO hard fork was a perfect case study of how a community can split over rules. Now, we have two blockchains using a variant of the software – ethereum and ethereum classic, both of which boast a different ethos and a different currency.What is it? A soft fork, by contrast, is any change that’s backward compatible. Say, instead of 1MB blocks, a new rule might only allow 500K blocks.What happens? Non-upgraded nodes will still see the new transactions as valid (500k is less than 1MB in this example). However, if non-upgraded nodes continue to mine blocks, the blocks they mine will be rejected by the upgraded nodes. This is why soft forks need a majority of hash power in the network.What can go wrong? When a soft fork is supported by only a minority of hash power in the network, it could become the shortest chain and get orphaned by the network. Or, it can act like a hard fork, and one chain can splinter off.Soft forks have been the most commonly used option to upgrade the bitcoin blockchain so far because it’s argued they present a lower risk of splitting the network. Past examples of successful soft forks include software upgrades like BIP 66 (which dealt with signature validation) and P2SH (which altered bitcoin’s address formatting).What is it? A user-activated soft fork (UASF) is a controversial idea that explores how a blockchain might add an upgrade that is not directly supported by those who provide the network’s hashing power.The idea with UASF is that instead of waiting for a threshold of support from mining pools, the power to activate a soft fork goes to the exchanges, wallets and businesses who are running full nodes. (In bitcoin, a full node, even if it is not a mining node, is still responsible for validating blocks.)What happens? The majority of major exchanges would need to publicly support the change before it could be written into a new version of code. After that, the new software (which has an activation point in the future) gets installed on nodes that want to participate in the soft fork.What can go wrong? This method requires a much longer lead time to work than a hash-power-triggered soft fork. In fact, it’s believed it may take as long as a year or more to write the code and get everyone ready.Further, if the majority of miners end up not ‘falling in line’ and activating the new rules, they could use their overwhelming hash power to split the network.Currently this idea is theoretical and has not been implemented.Table setting via Shutterstock"

cryptocurrency market share, though this figure has been higher than 90 ...","Jun 13, 2017 at 00:15 UTC","No stranger to strange milestones, the cryptocurrency sector may soon see a historic first, one that could upend long-held perceptions of its market.","Branded ‘The Flippening’ by market observers, this new hypothetical is defined loosely as the point at which a competing blockchain network could replace bitcoin as the largest and best capitalized blockchain. Sparked by increasing inflows in cryptographic assets, the concept has already seen a dedicated hashtag and website.Given that bitcoin invented and popularized blockchain systems, the development could herald a time of new diversity and experimentation for the nascent sector that, until recently, was largely defined in context of bitcoin.At earlier points in 2017, bitcoin accounted for more than 80% of the total cryptocurrency market share, though this figure has been higher than 90% at times.However, so-called alternative cryptocurrencies have drawn robust inflows this year, causing their total market cap to reach a record high of roughly $117bn today, a more than 500% year-to-date increase, according to CoinMarketCap.So, will the event come to pass? And if so, what will it mean?Analysts queried by CoinDesk largely believe ethereum’s ether token is most likely to spur the change, given it has increased 3,000% this year with no signs of slowing.Indeed, ether’s market cap has been drawing steadily close to bitcoin’s amid a broader uptick in interest for so-called ‘tokens’ based on the platform, with the two cryptocurrencies worth $35.9bn and $43.7bn at the time of report.Still, while some analysts focused on the promise of the ethereum network, others emphasized the perceived difficulties bitcoin has encountered of late as the reason this development could be likely.Developers and entrepreneurs building on bitcoin are still trying to figure out the best way to resolve its ongoing scaling dilemma, a matter which some allege is limiting the cryptocurrency’s use as a medium of exchange. (Though, perhaps benefitting its use as a store of value).Currently, blocks in bitcoin’s blockchain can only include up to 1 MB of transaction date, meaning that they can only process a fixed number of exchanges. Thus far, proposals to increase the block size have failed, and efforts to implement Segregated Witness – a solution that would reduce the total size of each individual transaction and allow more of these to fit into blocks – have failed to gain the needed support.Other proposals have largely proved short-lived or polarizing.“Bitcoin is still stuck at [the] scaling dilemma,” said Marius Rupsys, cryptocurrency trader and co-founder of fintech startup InvoicePool. “If some kind of agreement were achieved, [bitcoin] could regain much of its dominance.”However, the bitcoin community has not yet found a solution, so ether is benefiting from the situation, he said. As markets respond to these developments, Rupsys expects ether’s market capitalization, or the total value of its available token supply, to surpass bitcoin’s.Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency to scale, has to an extent become “a victim of its own success,” said Tim Enneking, managing director of the cryptocurrency hedge fund Crypto Asset Fund.He also noted that ether has benefited from coming into existence after bitcoin, telling CoinDesk:“Ether has learned and has fewer problems – as well as a comprehensive, coherent (more or less) roadmap going forward. It also has leadership. Bitcoin has none of that. And first-mover advantages dissipate if one doesn’t continue to innovate.”Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange service CryptoCompare, was also optimistic that ethereum could become the dominant blockchain.“Ether has a strong chance of surpassing bitcoin due to its strong network effect and ability to negate the governance issues that bitcoin has been subject to,” he said.Some market observers emphasized the key role played by token sales (or ICOs) when explaining why ether’s market cap might surpass that of bitcoin’s.As these offerings allow participants to exchange bitcoin and ether for digital ‘tokens’ that grant exposure to new ventures, investors purchasing these tokens (contracts on the ethereum network) frequently use ether because they don’t want to miss out.Further, the concentration of ether in the hands of a smaller set of startups is creating new economic pressures on the network.“This keeps many ethers locked up in new projects and [fewer] ethers are available for trading,” Rupsys noted.Bitcoin entrepreneur Charlie Shrem offered a similar sentiment, noting: “Right now, an immense supply of ETH gets locked up due to [ICOs].” This “severely reduces supply,” and with each offering, more tokens are “locked up”, he explained.Still, projects using this method of fundraising are going to sell some of the ether tokens they raise to pay for development, he said, meaning sell pressure could increase should this begin in earnest.While many analysts provided optimistic assessments of ether’s future, some expressed concerns that the cryptocurrency is in bubble territory.Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged cryptocurrency platform Whaleclub, asserted that ether’s price is tied heavily to the ICOs that use the alternative asset protocol.“I personally think ether price is incredibly overpriced, and that many of the ICOs funded will not deliver on all their promises. When that unravels, it’s likely to cause a substantial crash in the ether price,” he said.However, he did leave open the possibility that ether’s market cap could surpass bitcoin’s, depending on how much success ether-based ICOs produce.Still, analysts also emphasized the influence both networks could have on the world.While bitcoin could revolutionize the world of currency, ether could have more a wide-ranging influence through its use of smart contracts.Mati Greenspan, senior markets analyst at asset trading platform eToro, spoke to this potential.He added that, given its expansive goals, it might be likely for ether to surpass bitcoin in terms of market cap, though it may not have the largest network effect by other means.Greenspan concluded:“The development of both bitcoin and ethereum have far-reaching implications for our future world. Respectively, bitcoin and ethereum represent the future of money and the future of the internet.”Markets image via Shutterstock"

store of value, bitcoin is actually superior in many regards.” Inflation 
vs ...","Apr 1, 2017 at 13:15 UTC","Imagine that you have $100,000 at your disposal. You must spend all of it on either bitcoin or gold – no mixing and matching – and the assets will then be stored in a trust that cannot be accessed again for 50 years.","Which option would you choose?With the two commodities now in roughly the same price range, it’s worth putting aside some of bitcoin’s short-term volatility and liquidity concerns to compare them as long-term stores of value side by side.Sure, you might argue bitcoin is newer and flashier, and that it has arguably more utility in the digital era than gold. But, gold has the indisputable track record, having been a cherished store of value for thousands of years across human civilizations.However, bitcoin’s traits have led to those backing the cryptocurrency to believe it could potentially unseat gold over the long haul.Spencer Bogart, an analyst with Blockchain Capital and formerly of Needham & Company, told CoinDesk:“If we think about the qualities that make gold a respected ‘money’ or store of value, bitcoin is actually superior in many regards.”Another key advantage bitcoin has over gold is that its supply level is fixed and transparent – eliminating fears of the typical inflationary pressures associated with overproduction that could diminish the value of the asset.“A well-known characteristic about bitcoin is that it’s on a disinflationary supply schedule. While many people think of gold as being the same, gold is actually a sneakily inflationary asset,” said Chris Burniske, blockchain products lead with ARK Investment Management.Burniske added that the global supply of gold has clandestinely increased by 1–2% annually over the last century.He continued:“If you were to ask people what gold’s supply schedule looks like over time, they probably wouldn’t draw you something that looks like an exponential curve. With gold being sneakily inflationary, it’s not set up to preserve value in the way that bitcoin is.”Such characteristics, in theory, serve to increase bitcoin’s future utility as a means of account, exchange and storing value.They also suggest that bitcoin’s value, usefulness and importance to society will only continue to grow as commerce becomes more digitized.“As more infrastructure is built around [bitcoin], we think that demand will rise relative to its mathematically metered supply, increasing its price support,” Burniske wrote in a recent white paper.The clear advantages that gold has over bitcoin are trust and reliability, according to those surveyed for this article. However, a change in consumer preferences, new technological disruption or a crackdown by a government could easily kick bitcoin to the end of the bench.“Gold has something very important that bitcoin lacks: a more than 1,000-year history of being a decent store of value. This is very important for trust and people’s willingness to store value in that particular asset,” said Bogart.Gold has also proven itself to be of value even when governments attempt to restrict its usage or outlaw it completely.This happened in 1933, when President Franklin D Roosevelt implemented measures to prohibit and criminalize its possession in the US.“For more than 5,000 years gold and silver have been tried-and-true money. They’ve lasted basically the duration of organized civilization,” said Dave Kranzler of Investment Research Dynamics.In this light, Kranzler was keen to highlight bitcoin’s ‘counterparty risk’.Gold’s advantage over bitcoin is that it’s not dependent on the operation of the internet, thus affording it a degree of protection from heavy-handed regimes, he said.“There’s nothing to stop any government from shutting down the internet in their country under the guise of national security purposes or what not,” he said, adding:“We’ve seen democracies come and go, but totalitarianism always seems to creep back in. And when that happens, the government controls everything.”Gold has also proven itself immune to technological disruption.According to Burniske, while bitcoin has generated significant cultural cachet, it remains at the bleeding edge and could still be dethroned relatively easily.“That position is not necessarily going to remain the case if bitcoin is not able to attract new users and provide a happy medium in terms of user experience,” he said.Yet, as asset classes like Dutch tulips, Japanese real estate, dot-com companies and the US housing market have boomed and busted, gold has consistently plodded ahead, withstanding the test of time.“I don’t think anyone can say with any certainty that any man-made system is going to be valuable 50 years from now,” said Josh Crumb, co-founder of GoldMoney and a former commodities strategist at Goldman Sachs.He continued:“People forget that gold is not a pet rock or a speculative asset, it’s an element. Gold is a very low-risk store of value. Fifty years from now it’s going to still be valuable.”While investors like Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have suggested that technological developments as far fetched as asteroid mining could eventually put upward pressure on the total supply of gold (and reduce its scarcity), Crumb reckons that technological creative destruction poses a much greater threat to bitcoin.“People have been trying to crack gold for 600 years. I think it’s much more likely that we’re going to have quantum computing that can change cryptography than asteroid mining that’s going to bring back loads of gold,” he said.Perhaps asking whether bitcoin will ever unseat gold as the universal store of value isn’t quite appropriate, as it’s plausible that the two can, and will, co-exist as complementary assets.“I like bitcoin, particularly in the short-term, so it’s kind of like saying ‘Do you like gold or do you like investing in Facebook in 2011?'” said Crumb. “To me, it’s two totally different things.”As is standard practice across other realms of investing, the correct answer to the bitcoin versus gold question will ultimately be determined by the risk profile of each particular investor.“In terms of proper portfolio construction, you want to diversify. You want to have different types of assets that don’t necessarily move together,” said Burniske, concluding:“There’s always room for collaboration. It’s sensational to pit [bitcoin versus gold] as a fight to the death.”Bitcoin image via Shutterstock"

","In this “Bitcoin Milestones” entry, Elitzer and Rubin recall their efforts as MIT students to boost bitcoin, using a mock interview with CoinDesk to tell the story of how they once distributed $500,000 in BTC to MIT’s entire undergraduate population.CoinDesk: Where did the idea for the MIT Bitcoin Project come from?Jeremy: I started following bitcoin in late 2011. My sophomore fall, I did a hackathon project called Tidbit with some friends. Tidbit aimed to use browser-based bitcoin mining to replace online ad monetization, but that’s a different story.About six weeks into the spring term, laying in bed one night, I was brainstorming project ideas for a class. I wanted to study the social implications of bitcoin. It just kind of came to me all at once: “I should give $100 in bitcoin to every computer science student at MIT and see what happens.”I started shooting off exploratory emails immediately, and I sent one to Dan.Dan: I got into bitcoin in the summer of 2013, right before starting at MIT Sloan. I thought bitcoin had potential to boost financial inclusion in the developing world. When I read Jeremy’s email, I’d just started the MIT Bitcoin Club, where I had put on a couple events.After a few exchanges, I decided I was all-in to make this happen.I pushed us early on to go bigger and give bitcoin to all the undergrads, not just CS students, because I thought it would make for a more compelling experiment.CoinDesk: What was the bitcoin scene like when you started the project?Dan: In 2014, bitcoin wasn’t seen as legitimate yet, even at MIT. Most considered it at best a fad, at worst a Ponzi scheme. My classmates thought I was nuts for starting the Bitcoin Club.One problem was that there wasn’t any traditional community in the world where bitcoin was used and understood. Initiating network effects is really hard. Our goal was to create the first such community at the world’s premier technical university. If there was anywhere bitcoin could take off, it was at MIT.Jeremy: When we started the project, campus involvement with bitcoin was pretty minimal. A number of students knew about it and could half-explain it, but there weren’t very many projects happening.Dan: The Bitcoin Club’s first event was a talk by Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire. We closed the doors 10 minutes before the talk was scheduled to start because people had already filled all 200 seats, not including the stairs and the floor. The free dinner was long gone well before the event, so we knew students weren’t just there for a free meal.Jeremy: Before we launched the project, for a class project, I sent out a bitcoin survey. The survey showed mixed awareness among students, with some purporting to be bitcoin experts and others knowing nothing at all about the cryptocurrency. It also showed that my peers were optimistic about the potential of the tech and wanted to learn more. I was jazzed.Dan: From then on, we saw the MIT Bitcoin Project as an opportunity to catalyze this excitement and jumpstart the creation of a campus ecosystem of both users and developers. We also figured it would be a good headline for bitcoin. Like, ‘Hey, if those MIT kids are using it, maybe it really is the future!’CoinDesk: Were there any major obstacles you faced while doing the project?Jeremy: I was super worried at the onset of the project about potential controversy. While I was figuring out how to give students bitcoin, I was in the middle of a protracted fight with the State of New Jersey over Tidbit. It would have been awful if a student experimenting with the technology because of the MIT Bitcoin Project found themselves in similar hot water.Dan: That’s why we did the project as an IRB-approved research study, rather than just an activity of the Bitcoin Club. If something went wrong, at least it was MIT-approved. We were fine with that, because we certainly didn’t want to hand out half a million bucks to a bunch of students and not learn anything.Jeremy: Even though funding was so critical to the project, it was probably the least challenging part. The intersection of MIT alumni and bitcoin enthusiasts were incredibly generous with their financial contributions, especially Alex Morcos, who contributed the most substantially.CoinDesk: What was your experience like on the big day?Dan: The coin drop was the main event. We knew it would get attention, but I don’t think we realized quite how much. The level of excitement was unreal.We’d announced the first MIT Bitcoin Expo a week before we announced the coin drop. The announcement drove attendance to around 400 people. The whole event came together in just over a month and we couldn’t have done it without last minute support from HackMIT and the Society of Women Engineers.The Expo was probably the most technical bitcoin conference to have ever occurred. One of MIT’s largest and most historic lecture halls, 26-100, was packed with students and bitcoiners. I remember the Armory guys had a bitcoin-script puzzle, and the future MIT Bitcoin Club president solved it first.Jeremy: My fraternity brother, Richard Ni, helped us coordinate a summer-long lecture series and hackathon called BitComp after that. It was like a mini-incubator. BitComp brought nascent bitcoin startups to MIT (like Chain, Coinbase, Circle, Kraken and Blockchain) to advise participants.An early form of Enigma was one of the winning projects.CoinDesk: What was your relationship like with the MIT admins?Dan: They couldn’t have been more supportive of the project. We involved them early on. They were careful to make clear that MIT was not endorsing bitcoin directly, but made it equally clear that our student-driven initiative with emerging technology, entrepreneurship and experimentation was MIT’s bread and butter.Jeremy: That’s how I roped in Joi Ito, director of the MIT Media Lab, to ensure that the project would push the envelope, but not so far as to cause a problem for the administration.Dan: We also worked with two of my professors from MIT Sloan. Christian Catalini and Catherine Tucker were invaluable collaborators in formalizing our experiment as an IRB-approved study. This ensured the project had a shot at producing high-quality findings, that have been turned into multiple published papers.CoinDesk: What did the actual distribution of the bitcoin feel like?Dan: Super exhausting – but exhilarating too.Jeremy: Definitely nerve-wracking for me. During the sign-up phase, I had to run a database migration to correct a small non-critical bug. It should have been a quick fix, but due to lack of sleep, I managed to mess it up. I had to restore from the back-up database. It ended up taking me four hours or so to correct things.Dan: Our sign-up was so complicated because we were doing a number of randomized experiments. Students could sign up and provide an address to receive their bitcoin into any wallet of their choice, optionally encrypting the address they sent us. This meant that a lot of work had to go into making sure they had properly set up their wallet and were not going to lose funds.We also sent the bitcoin out in waves over a span of multiple weeks which layered in more complexity.Jeremy: The actual distribution of the coins, once we had completed sign-up, was really smooth, though.CoinDesk: How did students react initially?Jeremy: At first, a lot of people had no clue they’d received the coins. In the following few days, I got a lot of thank yous in the Infinite, MITs main corridor, and heard a few non-repeatable stories.Dan: We also saw some interesting behavior with peer interaction during the distribution. Certain dorms held office hours on how to use bitcoin. Some enterprising students offered to fill out the survey on behalf of others for a cut of their coins.CoinDesk: What were the results of the experiment? Was there anything that surprised you in particular?Dan: We expected to see more traction on retail and peer-to-peer payments during the experiment. We ended up seeing limited use of bitcoin for both, despite a handful of local merchants accepting the cryptocurrency.Jeremy: I bought a mango smoothie from a ‘bitcoin-ready’ burrito joint, but the cashier was confused on how to do it correctly. Despite my protests, they undercharged me.Dan: I purchased a hat at the Coop, MIT and Harvard’s student store. Not only did it take them five minutes to track down the only iPad in the store set up to take bitcoin, but I had to leave the store to send the transaction because my phone wasn’t getting any signal at the register.Jeremy: Our experience wasn’t common though – many students just held onto their coins! I think that retail usability hasn’t improved much since, so we’ll see what the coming years bring.CoinDesk: What’s the lasting legacy of the project?Dan: Christian Catalini and Catherine Tucker published multiple papers on how a nascent network platform can flourish (or languish) depending on how early adopters are segmented, and the ways in which users of the system who claim to value privacy are susceptible to relatively small incentives and tweaks in messaging.Jeremy: I’m most proud of how well the community at MIT is doing, especially the DCI, the MIT Digital Currency Initiative – currently led by Neha Narula – which was founded as an outgrowth of the MIT Bitcoin Project.Dan: The MIT Bitcoin Club is still very active, having just hosted the fourth annual MIT Bitcoin Expo. I’m really pleased to see the community at MIT in such a strong position.Jeremy: What’s most amazing to both of us is that, through the last three years, we have both still been so captivated by bitcoin. And to see our captivation with bitcoin shared across MIT a year after we’ve both graduated is really cool!Images via Dan Elitzer, Jeremy Rubin and Christopher A Maynor"

blocks, and users can pay to have their transactions included, a fee ...","Jun 8, 2017 at 14:15 UTC","This article highlights findings from CoinDesk Research‘s new Q1 2017 State of Blockchain report, focusing on data around the growth of bitcoin’s blockchain.","Click here to view the slides in your browser.Born from math, bitcoin is a game of numbers.Transactions have a size of ~500 bytes, blocks are limited to 1 MB and blocks can only be published after a puzzle is solved, a process that occurs via algorithm once every ~10 minutes.The facts that underlie the current bitcoin protocol, set years before transactions could ever be called ‘expensive’, set the stage for the ‘scaling debate‘ we’ve watched unfold ever since. Proposals have since developed to decrease transaction sizes, remove the block size limit and move transactions off of the main bitcoin blockchain, all in the name of boosting capacity.Amid this indecision, the network itself has adapted.As bitcoin miners can control the transactions they include in proposed blocks, and users can pay to have their transactions included, a fee market has developed to incentivize the inclusion of transactions into blocks.Still, opinions on scaling solutions and alternate cryptocurrencies aside, objective data from the Q1 2017 tells a different story. Transaction numbers, block sizes and transaction fees on the bitcoin blockchain each reached all-time highs in the first quarter of 2017, proving the demand to use the network is now larger than ever.Here’s a closer look at the situation in three charts:Transactions on the bitcoin network have grown consistently since inception, and over 40% since a year ago.Future growth however is limited due to bitcoin’s current block size maximum and transaction size minimum, leading to a ceiling on the number of new transactions that can be added to its blockchain per day, one that bitcoin has now nearly reached.Blocks have logically followed transactions to within bytes of their maximum capacity.The pace has continued to increase as the year has progressed, and last month the daily average block size did not drop below 0.95 MB, leaving little to no room for transactions without considerable fees for miners.One of the aspects of the current state of bitcoin most dear to the community and the experience of any future user is transaction fees.Not too many years ago, transactions on the bitcoin network were called ‘free’ or ‘near free’ and paying a fee was truly seen as optional. In the first quarter of 2017, however, average transaction fees grew 155% to $0.62, and began to rise at an increasing pace at quarter end.On 7th June, fees averaged over $5.00.Without a doubt, the bitcoin network is now more congested than ever.Transaction numbers and block sizes are up against their limits and fees have reached unprecedented levels. As such, some of the major proposals are making an effort to mitigate user cost. Others argue that this is a sign of health and interest in the network.While it’s too soon to know which vision for the network will play out, the support, execution and timing of any action will markedly effect the future of transaction numbers, fees, decentralization, user growth, alternative blockchains and the entire industry.View CoinDesk Research‘s full Q1 2017 State of Blockchain for more analysis on the bitcoin network as well as the results of our bitcoin and ethereum sentiment survey.Clogged sink image via Shutterstock"

The spreads were also very similar between the exchange and its US counterparts GDAX and Gemini.But while spreads were similar on the aforementioned exchanges, they varied quite a bit on other marketplaces. The price of bitcoin was very similar on Bitfinex and Poloniex, but it was roughly $30 lower on Kraken.In a few instances, spreads were far higher, reaching approximately $80 on OKCoin and surpassing $100 on BTC-e.Jacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager, spoke to the situation, affirming that it’s largely due to continued withdrawal limitations at China-based exchanges, though he noted others like BTC-e are still lower due to banking issues.He said:“Until I hear otherwise, I presume it’s because they still haven’t re-enabled crypto withdrawals. That problem, and spread, is pretty much unchanged since [February].”Still, compared to other exchanges, Bitfinex is showing signs its easing former concerns about its stability and solvency.Bitfinex has been working to overcome its difficulties in this area for the last several months. The exchange announced in April that it was having problems involving outbound USD wires and incoming wire transfers.Further, it continued to struggle with additional setbacks, announcing 20th April that it was encountering delays affecting its wire transfers.But Bitfinex appears to be taking a proactive approach to addressing these challenges, announcing 12th May that “other channels have been slowly ramping up” in an effort to provide customers with greater ability to make deposits and withdrawals.Nuts and bolts image via Shutterstock"

Waters would go on to start several bitcoin ventures, and was at the forefront of efforts to boost its regulatory compliance.","In the second entry in CoinDesk’s ‘Bitcoin Milestones‘ series, Waters discusses the early escalation in what would become an arms race to mine bitcoin, reminiscing on what was lost along the way.I didn’t take the bitcoin white paper seriously when I first read it in late 2009.It wasn’t until a few months later that I thought, ‘Wow, this is starting to catch on’. I saw someone trade bitcoin for some pizza on the forums. It was awesome, but I didn’t really grasp what was happening.At that point, my commitment level was very casual. I remember thinking that if I got some bitcoins, they could maybe pay for a new computer in a couple of years…But bitcoin wasn’t like anything I’d seen before. It captured my imagination and I was hopeful that someday it would be discussed outside of forums and IRC chats.***Soon, that started happening. I put on my hat, met the locals at the saloon and began working on the blockchain.I started panning for bitcoin gold via the default client. At the time, most people generated bitcoins by letting the v0.3 bitcoin client run in the background on their computers (a quaint notion by today’s standards).I earned some coins and I loved it. I liked it so much that I spent huge amounts of time researching the mechanics of bitcoin. I immersed myself in understanding the computer science. (This served me better in the long run than any of the mining.)I get asked occasionally if I’m a ‘bitcoin millionaire’ because I was an early miner, but the answer is no. The early miners I knew traded thousands of coins for the value of a new video game.Most people I spoke with on IRC were mining, but few of the discussions were about the value of a bitcoin. Gavin Andresen, the project’s first maintainer, went so far as to give tons of bitcoins away for free to spur the movement.***Soon, the parameters of mining would change, though.Mining proved to be a dynamic system, with larger unknown actors who had the tools and resources to outpace me. Even after realizing this, I decided that I would keep mining. Mostly because mining was fun. I enjoyed the process of learning and improving — but knew that I couldn’t compete.The history of bitcoin mining would go on to progress through several phases.CPU mining took off in 2010 when bitcoin was Slashdotted and a small crowd began mining with the Bitcoin Core client. Then, there was pooled mining.But the big change was the emergence of GPU miners in late 2010 and their total dominance — decimating the CPU mining contingent. (GPU mining would eventually be rendered useless, too, when the first ASICs began to ship).Throughout these movements, there have been a group of people within the bitcoin community called miners. I like to think that I’m part of that group, along with others who have a passion for bitcoin.Although, it’s probably more appropriate to label that group ‘local miners’.I say local miners because we were a bunch of hobbyist, mom-and-pop operations. We were displaced by large corporate industrial mining.Similar to other markets, economies of scale bore down upon us…***Looking back, it’s easy to say this was just capitalism at work, and it could be argued that it was better for the network as a whole.But I take exception with this idea. Bitcoin mining for me wasn’t just about making money (I didn’t make much anyway). It was about being part of the bitcoin ecosystem as a contributor, as a voice among many, a sort of crypto-democracy.Mining bitcoins made me feel like I was part of the movement, more than anything else. I was at every step, and was captivated from CPU through ASIC.Somehow I even inherited one of the first two ASICs (shout-out to Yifu Guo, Jeff Garzik, and Charlie Shrem). It stares at me while collecting dust, and reminds me of how I came to where I am today.By creating bitcoins, miners are useful as a bulwark against malfeasance: if bitcoin was a government, the miners made up a branch that prevented others from gaining too much power.For me, one of the biggest moments in bitcoin history was the advent of GPU mining and excitement within the bitcoin community that mining created. It’s what kept me fascinated with bitcoin. From working with the core development to working with various bitcoin companies, it all started with mining.GPU mining was when the beat dropped for the bitcoin universe…***But I still loved that moment when CPU mining was the essence of bitcoin — as Satoshi and many of us saw it. Over time, it was revealed that the system tended toward oligarchy when we moved to GPU. Maybe it was inevitable.I still believe something can be done to take crypto-democracy back.We’re mostly a group of people on the internet trying to find and create value together. We know what bitcoin looks like with the current state of centralized mining, and I think we can improve it.Sure the economics of mining have changed. The jump to GPU ensured that. But there’s more to mining than money.Be a local miner, bitcoin still needs you.This article is dedicated to my friend and brother in bitcoin, Jake Dienelt. You will be missed.Row of bitcoin miners via Shutterstock"

The new framework affected many different facets of the financial services industry, including financial institutions involved in trading.Under the new rules, investors frequently need to deposit cash (known as ‘margin’) when making trades. This margin is often left at clearinghouses, which act as intermediaries and help ensure that trades still take place even if one party gets cold feet.These clearinghouses then take this cash and lend it out for safe assets, such as German bunds or US Treasury bonds, through the repurchase agreement or ‘repo’ market, which enables them to make short-term loans.This entire process has had the effect of making certain safe assets – specifically high-quality government bonds – increasingly scarce.And this situation could potentially grow more severe, Yves Mersch, member of the European Central Bank’s Executive Board, warned recently.He stated during a January speech:“The requirements for trades to be centrally cleared are still being introduced, so the demand from market infrastructure to exchange cash for collateral will rise.”While clearinghouses have been snapping up safe assets, they are certainly not alone in this respect. Central banks around the world have been acting similarly, purchasing trillions of dollars worth of bonds following the financial crisis.One major objective of this quantitative easing (QE) was placing downward pressure on interest rates in an attempt to bolster lending and stimulate economic growth.These efforts have been largely successful, as interest rates have stayed very low for several years.While QE has helped create an environment of low interest rates (and therefore modest borrowing costs), it has had an unintended consequence of placing downward pressure on yields.The current environment has caused many investors to embark upon a search for yield, which in turn has drawn investors to bitcoin, according to several analysts who spoke with CoinDesk.Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management, spoke to this aspect of the digital currency, saying, “It’s not so much a shortage of safe haven assets, so much as low yields in all asset classes” that makes bitcoin appealing.The low-yield environment is “driving the appetite for crypto currencies across the board”, he added.Jacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager, also spoke to the key need created by the current lack of high-yielding investment opportunities, as well as how he believes the situation is fueling demand for bitcoin:“The search for yield has no such obvious answers and I expect that is driving some of the interest.”Bitcoin prices have frequently enjoyed tailwinds during times of geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. As a result, the capital markets have come to understand bitcoin’s value as a “disaster hedge,” ARK Invest analyst Chris Burniske told CoinDesk.Should the economy fall into recession, or the stock market decline, bitcoin prices could benefit significantly. While investors tend to seek out safer securities during times of economic turmoil, the general lack of such assets could prompt them to flock to bitcoin instead.Harry Yeh, managing partner of investment manager Binary Financial, has been preparing for such an event, recently telling CoinDesk: “Our new fund specifically targets high net worth clients and institutions so they can park their money in an alternative asset.”He continued:“Cryptocurrencies are seen as a safe haven asset now from global macroeconomic events such as currency devaluation or even events like the ‘Brexit’.”Other analysts offered a more complicated assessment, with Eliosoff emphasizing that, while a downturn would “likely” provide bitcoin with tailwinds, it might depend on what factors caused the downturn to materialize in the first place.Michael Moro, CEO of Genesis Global Trading, added further detail to the situation, emphasizing that “safe” is a relative term. He also noted that geography can play a key role in investors’ decisions.Moro stated:“If I am a US investor, I am sure that there are plenty of other assets that would be viewed as safe before getting to bitcoin. But if I am located elsewhere with more economic instability, bitcoin may very well be one of the first options.”Historically, bitcoin prices have not correlated with those of other assets – a point raised by Moro.Should a recession or financial crisis take place, this is another aspect that could make the digital currency very attractive. During times of crisis, investors frequently panic, selling off many different assets and causing several different kinds of securities to lose value simultaneously.Should such panic selling take place, investors may find that bitcoin, with its status as as a unique and uncorrelated asset class, is even more appealing than it would be otherwise.Disclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which owns Genesis Trading.Cup trick image via Shutterstock"

But the technology being developed is part of an even bigger push to make the UN’s services so resilient that they could survive even the destruction of the UN itself.The secret to such a design, according to WFP financial officer Houman Haddad, could be to remove the dinar altogether as a means of distributing funds – along with any other state-issued currency.“At the moment we’re paying out in normal currencies, so-called fiat currencies,” said Haddad, who also works with both the WFP’s treasury and financial risk management divisions. “That is mainly because a lot of the places in which we work don’t accept either bitcoin or ether.”He told CoinDesk:“However, the ideal would be that if they do, then we could just transfer the cryptocurrencies. It gets rid of the post-payment altogether.”Called ‘Building Blocks’, the first successful test of the ethereum-based solution was conducted in January in the Sindh province of Pakistan. There, 100 people received 3,000 rupees and the equivalent value in food via transactions authenticated on the ethereum testnet.Created over a 40-day period, the proof-of-concept is the latest effort designed to show that a blockchain could be used to distribute humanitarian aid to those in need.Beneficiaries of the project were assigned random one-time passwords that displayed on their mobile devices, which were then shown to supermarket proprietors who helped disperse both the funds and food.At the end of the test, the transaction records on the public ethereum testnet were reconciled with the actual funds distributed.The procedure flips on its head the idea of cutting out the middleman.Instead of paying the funds directly to the recipients, the UN sends the money to the shops, cutting out both banks and even the actual recipients.In one example cited by Haddad, money meant for 100,000 beneficiaries could instead be paid directly to the 400 merchants that might be available in that area.“The cost will be lower because there will be fewer transactions, no admin fees and all of that,” said Haddad. “The risk will be lower because we don’t have to advance money to anyone because we would only pay for actual purchases.”A second pilot planned for August will see the test expand beyond the borders of Jordan to other nations, with the possibility of reaching tens of millions of recipients served by the WFP in the future.Yet, both the proof-of-concept and upcoming pilot are part of a larger push within the UN to rethink what the organization calls cash-based transfers (CBT).Instead of turning over perishable resources such as food and medicine, the UN directly injects money into the local economy in the form of vouchers, prepaid cards, mobile money and more.In 2015, the program transferred $680m in aid to recipients, a number Haddad said the WFP hopes to increase to $2bn per year. In the first six years of the program, 9.6 million people were given assistance through cash-based transfers.Though the advantages of CBT include increased efficiency and stimulated trade, there’s still plenty room to improve, according to Haddad.Specifically, he believes the current system still suffers from fees, a lack of privacy for the recipient, risks associated with relying on startup mobile money companies and lengthy contracting processes to ensure payment is still completed in the case these startups fail.All of these issues, Haddad said, could be reduced by moving the transactions to a blockchain.As such, the pilot is set to continue over the course of May, and will be conducted on a private version of the ethereum blockchain, with the goal of eventually conducting 1 million transactions per month.“If we reach the $2bn mark that we are set to achieve in terms of total spending on cash-based transfer,” he said, “we estimate conservatively we could save $20m a year.”While consortia models have become increasingly popular for financial institutions looking to leverage the network effect of blockchain, the WFP went in a decidedly different direction.Developed in partnership with the Field Innovation Exchange offered by exponential technology think tank, Singularity University, the pilot is designed as the next step towards increasing internal cooperation between agencies at the UN.Initially, the project, developed at WFP’s Innovation Accelerator, is being built to give store keepers a reliable way to know how much money and food each of their customers can afford.But project manager Alexandra Alden said she’d eventually like to see applications open up in divisions across the UN, with efforts aimed at cryptographically securing identity, tracking supply chain logistics and leveraging Internet of Things-enabled devices.Importantly, Alden and Haddad hope that future incarnations of the technology could be built on the public ethereum blockchain, should it grow to be able to handle the necessary transaction volumes.“The ideal world would be where beneficiaries have smartphones,” said Alden. “They can store their own private key so they can see the transaction history, their entitlements, where the shops are that are selling the goods they want, price analysis of where rice is cheaper.”To help ensure that the WFP is working closely with government agencies, she added:“Our goal is to ideally deal with this in a way that even if the WFP did not exist in 10 years time the beneficiaries could still benefit from the system.”Haddad breaks down the benefits of blockchain into three categories: empowering beneficiaries, lowering costs and reducing redundancy in the system of UN services.Unlike previous attempts to collaborate that he said were stunted by internal competitive interests, he believes the blockchain solutions being developed across the UN will someday be able to interoperate because of the common source of data.Already, UN Women has partnered with Innovation Norway to make it easier for women and girls to explore blockchain, and it is currently hiring a blockchain consultant. In October, the UN publicized its interest in using blockchain for sustainability projects, and in November, the United Nations Children’s Fund invested in its first startup working in the sector.Should the United Nations ever integrate these blockchain efforts and more, Haddad said the potential benefits of reducing a number of redundancies will be limited unless the organization also starts accepting ethereum and other cryptocurrencies as a form of payment from donors.“A lot of our people have offered to donate ether,” he said. “We can’t accept it at the moment, but being in finance and treasury I’m actually looking at how we can start accepting it.”Haddad concluded:“Then, if we can pay out as well we can offer end-to-end tracking of the money coming in and going out, where it was spent, what it was spent on in a manner that does not intrude on the privacy of the beneficiary.”Image via the United Nations"

Cryptocurrencies have repeatedly entered periods where several have moved in tandem.For example, alternative protocol assets rallied following the SEC’s 10th March rejection of a proposed bitcoin ETF, after suffering widespread losses roughly one month earlier.Yet in other instances, bitcoin’s losses have resulted in gains for alternative cryptographic assets.One key factor analysts have cited as influencing these price relationships is major events in the cryptocurrency space, like the rise and fall of distributed organization The DAO or the SEC’s ETF rejection.Leading up to this event, bitcoin prices surpassed $1,300, reaching an all-time high, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Following the ruling, bitcoin prices plunged nearly 30%, while other digital currencies experienced a rally that pushed some to fresh, all-time highs.Ether, for example, surged more than 200% in the week or so after the SEC shot down the proposed fund, according to CoinMarketCap. Likewise, the price of monero rose more than 100% since the ruling at points, while ether classic also saw notable gains.But how do they compare on a longer timeline? Let’s review the findings from our data:The most objective way to examine the price relationship that exists between bitcoin and other digital currencies is to examine the available data. Using this information, market observers can get a far better sense of exactly what these relationships look like.For some currency pairs, looking at quarterly data is sufficient, as doing helps convey a strong sense of the relationship between the two digital assets in question.BTC/LTC (litecoin) is a great example, as price data reaching back to the final quarter of 2013 shows six quarters where the pair’s correlation surpassed 0.7, and three quarters where it exceeded 0.8.This strong, positive relationship makes sense, as litecoin is to some extent a ‘spin-off’ of bitcoin, using similar technologies and designs.It’s important to keep in mind that bitcoin and litecoin prices have not always had a strong relationship, as their correlation has at times broken down. ARK Invest’s Chris Burniske has noted that leading up to the SEC’s decision on the proposed Winklevoss ETF, the two digital currencies moved in different directions.Another example of a currency pair with a relatively straightforward relationship is BTC/XRP, whose correlation remained below 0.2 during every quarter in 2015 and 2016.When averaging all available price data, the currency pair’s correlation falls to 0.02.The two currencies are quite distinct, a situation noted by cryptocurrency fund manager Jacob Eliosoff, and this situation might help explain their weak price relationship. Bitcoin and litecoin have differing value propositions and target separate audiences from XRP.Miguel Vias, head of XRP markets at Ripple, offered a different take on BTC and XRP’s price relationship.“I think that markets view XRP as a very stable digital asset, so they feel safe parking funds in XRP when they exit other assets. If someone wants to get out of BTC, but doesn’t want to necessarily move into fiat, he or she moves the value into XRP,” he said.For other digital currencies, a deeper dive is needed to understand the situation.While quarterly price data for BTC/ETH (ether) shows some modest correlations as high as 0.57, looking at seven-day averages paints a more vivid picture.When viewed through this more short-term lens, correlations have reached as much as 0.98 during some periods. In the seven-day period 1st–7th August, 2016, the BTC/ETH price relationship remained above 0.90.However, the correlation between these digital currencies fell sharply at times, reaching as little as 0.04 during seven-day periods in August and October 2015.Ether classic is another cryptocurrency that has had a varied relationship with bitcoin. The correlation between the two has fallen to as little as 0.004 and risen to as much as 0.96, according to CryptoCompare data ranging back to July 2016.The BTC/ETC pair displayed a particularly strong relationship early this year, surpassing 0.90 during several seven-day periods in January. However, their correlation has repeatedly fallen to very low levels, declining below 0.1 on many occasions and reaching as little as 0.004 in January 2017.The BTC/XMR pair has had a similar story to that of BTC/ETH and BTC/ETC, as its seven-day price correlation has approached zero and surpassed 0.9 repeatedly.This weekly relationship became particularly strong earlier this year, surging to 0.94 in January. In contrast, the pair hit a patch in February 2016 where five straight seven-day sessions produced an average below 0.2.These two digital currencies have largely different situations. While bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to scale, monero has focused far more on ensuring the privacy of its users. While bitcoin was originally designed to offer users privacy in their transactions, its pseudonymous nature has made its users vulnerable to identification.Monero, on the other hand, has done a far more effective job of providing user anonymity through ring signatures and stealth addresses.As a result, this digital currency is building widespread adoption on the darknet.The digital currencies examined in this article have highly dynamic price relationships. Sometimes they move in tandem, while other times they move in opposite directions. In certain cases, their correlation is very low.In certain instances, the markets develop clear trends where many cryptocurrencies move either higher or lower over specific periods of time. During others, these digital currencies may display little or no price correlation.As the cryptocurrency space becomes more mature, however, the individual digital assets that compose this market may very well progress in terms of carving out their own individual niches, a development that could cause their price determinants to change over time.Should these digital currencies successfully differentiate themselves in the eyes of traders, their correlations could deteriorate further.Follow the leader image via Shutterstock"

fundamental analysis may be the most integral for figuring out its true ...","Apr 29, 2017 at 12:40 UTC","While there are many different methods for evaluating the price of bitcoin, fundamental analysis may be the most integral for figuring out its true value.","Fundamental analysis is the evaluation of economic, financial and other key variables, known as fundamentals, to determine a security’s true value. This differs from technical analysis (the counterpart to fundamental analysis) in that the former is more interested in looking at a security’s price movements to make better-informed decisions.When evaluating bitcoin, though, investors are keen to evaluate key aspects of the cryptocurrency’s underlying technology, for example, how its scaling challenges might affect the digital currency’s value.After all, if the digital currency’s transactions grow costly and time-consuming on account of block size limitations, this could reduce demand, in turn lowering the price.While investors use fundamental analysis to evaluate different asset classes, such as equities and fiat currencies, several analysts assert that using this approach to evaluate bitcoin is more complex.For instance, investors can evaluate a company’s stock by looking at certain items on its balance sheet, but bitcoin does not produce revenue or earnings numbers.Jacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager, spoke to this situation, telling CoinDesk: “It’s hard to derive an even remotely precise valuation for bitcoin from future cashflows”, the way you can for other assets such as General Motors stock.As a result, traders interested in conducting fundamental analysis on bitcoin have developed “a whole new set of metrics,” according to Charles Hayter, founder and CEO of CryptoCompare.However, even though bitcoin has been described as a new asset class, the same rules that apply to fiat currencies also apply to cryptocurrencies, said Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management. “All the laws of economics apply – in full – to cryptocurrencies,” he said.As a result, he emphasized that the starting point for all fundamental analysis should be the supply and demand that drives prices.Several variables affect bitcoin demand, including user adoption, transaction activity and trading.Many analysts noted the importance of user adoption, which is crucial to a cryptocurrency’s long-term viability. As for what drives user adoption, the analysts said money can have many uses. At its most basic level, money is a store of value, a medium of exchange and a unit of account.Outside of small circles, bitcoin has never really been used as a unit of account, said Enneking.But bitcoin has managed to gain significant traction as a medium of exchange. Hundreds of companies – including eBay and PayPal – have agreed to accept the digital currency since its inception in 2009.In addition, the number of confirmed transactions per day has generally followed a steady, upward trend, according to data from Blockchain. Transactions started surging in early 2012, rising from more than 7,000 per day at the start of April 2012 to more than 300,000 per day now.While this data is informative, Eliosoff asserted that it’s not the best indicator, because many blockchain transactions are “generated by automated systems and don’t represent economic activity, [especially] on scalable chains with low fees.”Instead, traders must figure out which transactions are an actual person sending to or accepting from another person.But as bitcoin obtains more widespread adoption and retailers aren’t seeing increasing sales via bitcoin, there’s been a major shift in focusing on the cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange and to a store of value, concluded Enneking.Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform BitMEX, said similar things, telling CoinDesk that the extent to which bitcoin is perceived as a store of value is a major driver of the digital currency’s price.While demand for bitcoin can be a complex study, supply is a bit more straightforward.The bitcoin protocol limits the total number of units at 21 million, and 16.3m bitcoins were in circulation at the time of reporting. Further, the rate of new supply is also determined by the bitcoin protocol. This contrasts sharply with the traditional monetary system, in which central banks have the ability to print money whenever they want.However, there are some caveats that affect bitcoin’s supply.For starters, Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, supposedly holds roughly 1.1m bitcoins which have not moved since they were mined. And many people in the bitcoin community think they won’t ever be, seeing these coins as “dead bitcoins.” Past that, it is impossible to know just how many “dead bitcoins” there really are, noted Enneking.That’s because for the first several years of bitcoin’s existence, units of the digital currency didn’t have much monetary value. When the price began moving upward, stories of people throwing away hard drives that held the private keys for their bitcoins were commonplace.Analysts also noted the key role major events play in determining the price of bitcoin. These incidents are sometimes directly related to bitcoin, such as the hack of a major exchange, or a setback in the community’s push to solve the scaling dilemma.However, Enneking told CoinDesk:“The events that impacted bitcoin prices the most were non-bitcoin events like Cyprus and Greece.”BitMEX’s Hayes also spoke to the importance of macroeconomic events, emphasizing that ones fueling instability usually bolster alternative assets like bitcoin.ARK Invest’s Chris Burniske agreed. During times of economic turmoil, bitcoin can act as a “disaster hedge,” he said.By leveraging fundamental analysis, bitcoin traders can get a better sense of the cryptocurrency’s true value and get a better sense of whether it’s a good time to buy or sell.However, some analysts criticize fundamental analysis because it reflects more what a security should be worth than what its actual market price is. Relying too much on fundamental analysis, without also using technical analysis, could cause a trader to buy or sell at a less-than-ideal time, they said.To manage this risk, bitcoin traders can combine fundamental analysis with technical analysis. For example, a fundamental analyst might look at several indicators of demand, concluding that bitcoin is underbought, and then leverage technical analysis by reading charts to find the best entry point.Alternatively, a trader might use technical analysis to determine that it’s a good time to sell, and then leverage fundamental analysis to confirm this view by looking at key drivers of demand.Chart analysis image via ShutterstockDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

Yes, most of its wares exceeded my risk tolerance. Still, the Silk Road era was a rarified moment in history, and I was too busy warning people about money transmission to even buy a pair of alpaca socks.In fairness to myself, it was still the early days – the summer of 2013. A bitcoin could be had for about a hundred US dollars. Things were simpler then. Ethereum didn’t exist. Nobody was talking about the legality of token sales.I had just returned from a trip to Washington, DC, where, together with other members of the Bitcoin Foundation, we had the first multilateral meetings with the federal government on cryptocurrency.It had been quite a party. FinCEN, IRS, FBI, DEA, SEC, CFPB, CFTC… just about any agency with a potential interest in magical internet money was there to hear us explain it to them. None were believers. In fact, the vibe in the room was clear: bitcoin is for criminals, and these apologists think they’re going to change our minds.This ‘bitcoin is for criminals’ narrative may not have started with the Silk Road, but it was certainly buoyed by it.The marketplace was accessible only via the so-called ‘dark web’, an anonymous network that required specialized software to use. Once accessed, you could buy anything. Drugs, porn, fake driver’s licenses… so long as you paid in bitcoin.It was the first, and, at the time, the only one of its kind. As the Silk Road grew in popularity, so did recognition that bitcoin could be used for illicit activity, and so did the government’s interest in it.So, the government shut Silk Road down.It happened in October of 2013, just a couple of months after our grand defense of bitcoin to the very federal agencies that gave the order.I can’t say just where I heard the news first, but the reports hit almost at once: posts on social media, emails from clients, calls for comment from the press, communications from the Bitcoin Foundation’s PR team.In many of their voices, I heard an unmistakable tinge of panic – the kind of panic usually endemic to tense depositions or bet-the-company litigations – but the only bitcoiner arrested was Ross Ulbricht, the dark market’s alleged (and convicted) operator.The rest of the bitcoin citizenry was panicked because they were stakeholders in all of it.Bitcoin was the lifeblood of the Silk Road.At the Bitcoin Foundation, we scrambled to develop messaging. At my law practice, we worked to gauge client exposure and risk. Was crypto prohibition on the horizon? Would bitcoin be deemed contraband?Would the government classify our clients – bitcoin businesses – as entities of primary money laundering concern? If so, an entire industry would be blacklisted from the global financial system…Once news broke, the media speculated widely that bitcoin transaction volumes would drop to near zero, and that bitcoin prices would do the same. After all, bitcoin was for criminals, the narrative went, and now that the greatest criminal use for bitcoins was gone, what was bitcoin good for?At the time, we could only speculate. A systemic limitation of a permissionless, pseudonymous network is a lack of data on the intent of its users. We could only guess how much of bitcoin was tied to Silk Road.Many of us, even if privately, guessed that it was a lot.We were wrong. When we finally looked back on the numbers, volume didn’t drop. It soared. Price did fall, but almost immediately recovered and blew past its pre-Silk Road heights. It was astounding.One of our public messaging points at the Bitcoin Foundation was the story that bitcoin was a currency with a heart of gold, now freed from unjust association with dark markets.Its value and its volume were now demonstrably independent from its greatest suspected criminal use, we said. From the beginning, the ‘bitcoin is for criminals’ narrative had to be fiction.And we were right. Still, this wasn’t the whole story. The whole story was a great deal more complex because, almost immediately, dozens of Silk Road copycats begun to spring up.Within a year, there were plenty of dark markets using bitcoin. Some were even using new, more privacy-focused digital currencies that were opaque to forensics and post-hoc analysis.Yet, we also started to see transaction volumes in developing countries start to climb significantly for the first time. People were using bitcoin to improve their lives. Word was getting out that there was an alternative to runaway inflation and fiscal mismanagement inherent in some government money.It just so happened to get out to criminals quicker than it did to most everyone else.Still, Silk Road showed us that bitcoin could be used for criminal transactions just as well as legitimate transactions.Its shuttering showed us the criminal uses of bitcoin were probably much more limited than anyone – even most bitcoiners – suspected. Silk Road changed the way we thought about money. It changed the way we thought about anonymity. It was a rarified moment in history, the effects of which transformed an industry.It changed so much about my government outreach work and my practice of law. But at the time, I couldn’t even work up the courage to log on and buy some alpaca socks.I still kick myself.For more of Santori’s writing, read his seminal series on Bitcoin Law, Parts 1, 2 and 3, which provide a basic primer on the state of US law as it relates to cryptocurrencies.Silk road image via Shutterstock"
17,www.coindesk.com,"Jun 17, 2017",Coinbase to White Hat Hacker: We Don't Want Your Bitcoin,https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-white-hat-hacker-dont-want-bitcoin,"Coinbase wanted to know how Troia was using bitcoin and his account. “I 
told them I run a security firm. I pay for ransoms and buy documents ...","Jun 17, 2017 at 10:45 UTC","White hat hackers, it seems, are being stripped of their accounts on Coinbase. ","Less than a year ago, Vinny Troia, CEO and principal security consultant of Night Lion Security and a certified white hat hacker, was sent a compliance form by US bitcoin exchange Coinbase, where he had an account.Coinbase wanted to know how Troia was using bitcoin and his account.“I told them I run a security firm. I pay for ransoms and buy documents on the dark web when clients request it,” Troia told CoinDesk.The ransoms Troia helps his clients pay are those stemming from ransomware attacks, which have surged in number over the past few years. Many, like the well-publicized WannaCry attack, are asking for bitcoin. And the documents?Troia said:“We do breach investigations a lot of times. If a fraudster is saying they’re selling my client’s stolen documents, the only way to make sure they have what they say they have is to buy those documents.”According to Troia, Coinbase “did not like that at all”.Coinbase then asked the IT expert whether he had a letter from the Department of Justice giving him permission to do those things. No, Troia said. Upon further research, Troia has not found that any such permission exists.But, “I have my clients authorizing me to do this,” he said.Coinbase sent Troia back an email explaining that those actions were against the exchange’s rules and shut down his account. Troia then tried setting up an account with his wife’s information, but that too was shut down. Then he tried his brother. Shut down. Then his mother. Shut down.“My entire family is blocked from Coinbase,” he said.The problem is ransomware attacks are on the rise, and the prevalence of those attackers requesting bitcoin over bags of cash (or even wired fiat funds) is also up.Black hat hackers love bitcoin, primarily because its wallets don’t have to be registered with a central intermediary, and with the use of anonymizing mixers and tumblers, the movement of that money can be hard to track.Last month, several publications reported companies stockpiling bitcoin in preparation for future ransomware attacks. According to Citrix Systems, in 2016, about one-third of British companies were hoarding a store of “digital monies” to recover critical data in the event of an attack.Sometimes, it’s the only option.Troia, who is based in St Louis, worked with a vendor last year who was hit with a ransomware attack performing full disk encryption. In this case, full disk encryption meant the hackers had encrypted all the data held on the company’s hard drive storage. And according to Troia, almost no companies, including the one he was called to help at 2:00 am on a Sunday morning, keep full disk backups.Troia scrambled around looking for ways to purchase bitcoin quickly and get the attackers paid. His solution:  purchasing bitcoin through a bitcoin ATM at a mall in  St Louis.While the process took nearly 24 hours, without the bitcoin ATM, it would have taken even longer with waiting periods for bitcoin account onboarding and purchasing and withdrawal limits, Troia said. He even tried the Craigslist-like LocalBitcoins service, but since it was Sunday, a bank wire transfer wouldn’t be initiated till the next week.“When someone has to pay a ransom, they need to pay it right away, not wait four days or so,” he said. “The consequences [of waiting] are more on the business side, reputational risk, with customers trying to get access to the system and not being able to. And there can be significant financial impacts of customers’ inability to access the system.”It seems almost antithetical that it’s becoming harder for the ‘good guys’ to use bitcoin, when companies like Coinbase that operate with the digital currency have an uphill battle convincing individuals, businesses and government agencies that cryptocurrency should not be faulted for the bad actors’ use of it.But, according to Juan Llanos, a cryptocurrency compliance expert and the fintech and regtech lead at blockchain startup ConsenSys, it’s all part of the same battle.“Coinbase is meeting the expectations and standards of any highly regulated and scrutinized financial institution,” Llanos told CoinDesk. “They are a systemically important player and are backed by big-name investors. They all are, as they need to be, cognizant of the reputational and regulatory risks of associating themselves with negative news and potentially bad actors.”He continued:“This is a very controversial topic.”Seems so. The non-profit advocacy group Coin Center, for example, voiced strong opinions last month about a court filing which suggested helping someone exchange fiat for bitcoin to pay a ransomware attack might be unlawful. The policy-focused non-profit declined to comment for this story, though Neeraj Agrawal, Coin Center’s director of communications, did say: “The decisions that Coinbase or any other company make about who can and cannot use their platforms are private matters internal to those companies.”Brought against Coin.mx, the court filing stated that the exchange violated anti-money laundering law in that it “knowingly processed and profited from numerous bitcoin transactions conducted on behalf of victims of ransomware schemes”.Judicial actions such as this obviously make others wary.“I don’t blame them,” said Llanos.Although, while federal law enforcement agencies typically caution US businesses against paying digital ransoms, in October 2015, FBI agent Joseph Bonavolonta told C-level business executives they might be better served succumbing to attackers requests for ransom in return for data.Coinbase offered little comment on the situation.“We work with a number of third-party vendors and need to make sure we comply with the types of businesses and activity they are comfortable with us servicing,” said David Farmer, director of business operations at Coinbase.Farmer also sent a link to the exchange’s publicly available terms and conditions and prohibited business activity list. While neither document states anything specifically about white hat hacking or ransomware, the prohibited business activity list does note that it’s “representative, but not exhaustive.”This gives Coinbase sole discretion to remove an account that increases any risk to its business.Troia isn’t the only security consultant doing this kind of work at the behest of legitimate and paying clients. Although, he doesn’t know exactly why his account was flagged for suspicious activity in the first place. In this light, he wonders whether the accounts he sent ransom payments to might have already been flagged as problematic.“I could never figure it out,” he said. “I had, maybe traded an entire bitcoin, literally one. I didn’t have a high volume of trading.”Troia recently tried reaching out to Coinbase executives, including CEO Brian Armstrong, explaining the situation, and that theoretically he could have lied and kept his account, hoping the truth angle could win him some points.Via email, Armstrong said he would look into it, and forwarded Troia’s email to the support team.The next day, though, Troia got a message back from support, saying upon further inspection, he was still unable to open an account, whether it be business or personal. And that looks unlikely to change.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase.Empty cash drawer image via Shutterstock"

Its first-mover status and widespread adoption has (so far) given bitcoin the dual advantage of network effect and steep barriers to entry, keeping alternatives at bay.But there’s evidence that this longstanding narrative could be changing.Recent infighting in bitcoin’s development community has provided a rare chance for alternatives to stress their value propositions and even assert new ones (like being a hedge in times where bitcoin’s future seems uncertain).This has led to an interesting, observable trend. While the total pie of the cryptocurrency market keeps growing larger, bitcoin’s slice is becoming smaller.The clearest illustration of bitcoin’s network effect is the ratio of bitcoin’s market compared to the market cap of all other digital currencies.The most authoritative source for this data is CoinMarketCap.com, which publishes its ‘Bitcoin Dominance Index’. Its current value of 72% illustrates that bitcoin has its lowest percentage of market share since it started publishing statistics in April 2013.This analysis is by no means concrete, as bitcoin’s share has dipped in times of stress before. The question now, however, is what make of the downtrend.As the chart above shows, bitcoin has seen a number of sharp periods of decline followed by reversions to the mean. But the data illustrates that the market may be trending against ‘bitcoin maximalism’, or the idea bitcoin will be the only dominant blockchain in the future.Yet, it may not be fair to suggest that bitcoin’s declining market share represents competition against its value proposition.The digital currency space is inherently risky, but bitcoin it is still the most liquid and well-known player in the space. As the chart above shows, however, alternative cryptocurrency markets are now providing better returns for investors (at least in the short term)For an investor, bitcoin’s ROI is being overshadowed by upstart cryptos who valuations are increasing at rocket pace. The question for traders might now be, ‘Why risk capital in the bitcoin market, when other assets are much more rewarding to hold?’Yet, a major difference between previous declines and now is the relative strength of other alternative protocols.None may be more notable than ethereum, and its blockchain asset, ether, which has been setting new all-time highs in recent trading sessions. This surge followed the news in late February of a 30-firm partnership called the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, and nearly two years of open-source development.Unlike many other protocols, ethereum has a clearer value proposition in that it is designed not to be a digital currency, but a platform for decentralized applications based on blockchain.With a market cap nearing $4bn, the ethereum is gaining a more liquid market that is better better suited for trading, and institutional firms are starting to notice.Also notable is the rise of dash. Though analysts have cautioned that they are skeptical about the asset’s increase in value, it has nonetheless gained  200% in less than a month, cementing itself as a solid number three in the list of digital currencies by market value.It is unclear whether this recent bull run is a speculative price bubble or a revaluation based on strong fundamentals, but it could signal the market’s favorable view of a strong governance protocol and a payment protocol which features anonymous transactions.Though the possibility exists of a future not dominated by bitcoin, this shouldn’t be taken as a negative connotation.Due to the fact that new bitcoins are produced daily, the total value of all bitcoin’s has never been higher. While certainly some coins have been lost, burned or otherwise removed from the market, this means that more money has never been invested in bitcoin.But if one thing is for certain, the uncertainty in the market is having an effect, and creating opportunities for change.Chart image via Shutterstock"

When I became ...","Apr 30, 2017 at 12:25 UTC","Catheryne Nicholson is the CEO and founder of BlockCypher, a blockchain web services startup.","In this opinion piece, Nicholson speaks out about the dysfunctional state of bitcoin’s community and why she believes new tech called MimbleWimble could help save it.The state of bitcoin today is highly discouraging. Watching grown men hurl insults at each other on Reddit and Twitter is just sad.When I became involved in 2013, bitcoin’s potential seemed endless. It was heralded as a possible solution for micropayments, remittances, microfinance, parking meters, email spam and so on. Many women, myself included, believed in bitcoin as a means to address world problems of poverty by providing access to capital for the remaining three-quarters of the world.As time passed, I became discouraged that many needed use cases did not come to fruition. Startups attempting to build companies with those business models have died. Anything involving small payments in bitcoin has been mostly eliminated due to high fees.The most popular use case is as a store of value. It’s not to say that isn’t useful: in the growing number of countries with devaluating currencies, bitcoin is an attractive alternative. Bitcoin has had an indelible impact as a groundbreaking technology. But it’s disheartening that it has stalled in doing more.There are fundamental issues that will likely never be solved, as evidenced by the two-year debate on how to scale bitcoin. The community is more divisive than ever. I can’t help but think part of the reason it’s so dysfunctional is because it’s devoid of women.Women (or any rational person) do not want to participate in this dystopian community: it’s juvenile and filled with vitriol. Bitcoin desperately needs a Patronus Charm, “a pure, protective magical concentration of happiness and hope.” [1]My disappointment in bitcoin caused me to look at the blossoming landscape of alternate blockchains: eg litecoin, zcash, monero, ethereum and dash have all grown in market size and popularity.It’s clear that more alternative coins (altcoins) will develop innovative solutions and come to market. This is why MimbleWimble caught my interest.As a brief background, the original MimbleWimble white paper was placed by someone called Tom Elvis Jedusor (Voldemort’s French name in JK Rowling’s Harry Potter book series) on a bitcoin research channel in July 2016.Tom’s white paper “Mimblewimble” (a tongue-tying curse used in “The Deathly Hallows”) was a blockchain proposal that could theoretically increase privacy, scalability and fungibility. It remained theoretical until recently.At the end of 2016, someone named Ignotus Peverell (the original owner of the invisibility cloak, if you know your Harry Potter characters) started a Github project called Grin, and began turning the MimbleWimble paper into something real.Andrew Poelstra, a mathematician at Blockstream, presented on this work in January 2017 at Stanford University’s Blockchain Protocol Analysis and Security Engineering 2017 conference. More recently, Ignotus posted a technical introduction to MimbleWimble and Grin.It took me a while to wrap my head around MimbleWimble. The more I internalized it, the more hopeful I became that something more magical than bitcoin could appear. I will attempt to explain MimbleWimble and why what it proposes – privacy, freedom of choice, equal access, fungibility, and sustainable growth over time – are so important.Privacy matters, a lot. One of the most important rights we have is the right to privacy. It’s our right to “keep a domain around us, which includes all those things that are part of us, such as our body, home, property, thoughts, feelings, secrets and identity.” [2]I consider privacy extremely important.It’s very apparent how valuable it is when you lose it or when someone violates it. In my 20s, I was stalked. A person whom I had met in passing on a military base waited for me after work and surreptitiously followed me home.He did this for several weeks – all unbeknownst to me – until one day he knocked on my door and told me he had been following me and professed his undying love. I immediately slammed the door and called the local and military police. I lived alone in the woods and was so freaked out that I moved.Only someone who has been stalked can understand how frightening this experience was. To this day, it affects many of my behaviors to guard my privacy.Physical trespass of privacy is often preceded by online privacy violations. Recent events, such as Congress granting ISPs (internet service providers) the right to sell your personal information – browsing habits, app usage history, purchasing habits, location data – are very concerning.As Luke Mulks from Brave elegantly wrote, “[Y]our digital data trail is the evidence of your human presence online. Your data is valuable, private, and most important, it’s yours.”If we cannot rely on our legislature to protect our constitutional rights (can we rely on them for anything anymore?), technology needs to intercede to make it harder for greedy capitalists to put your privacy up for sale.Privacy extends to what to share publicly about what we buy or whom we donate to. These transactions should not be open for all to see.Women, especially those trying to escape repressive social or economic conditions, have a dire need to stay anonymous. That’s a fundamental flaw in bitcoin: every transaction and address balance is available for the world to watch and track.There are some things you can do to hide your transaction, such as tumbling, but you need to go out of your way to use them and they are breakable. Privacy oriented cryptocurrencies like monero and zcash improve privacy significantly.In monero, the transaction is not natively private, but relies on ring signatures to mask exchanges. Zcash leverages a technology called zk-snarks to build private transactions, which is a huge improvement.However, it still requires a lot of extra resources to build a confidential transaction, so most users still issue their transactions “in the clear” (clear vs shielded counts).MimbleWimble is natively private.There are no ring signatures or zero-knowledge proofs on top of a transparent bitcoin-like transaction. In a MimbleWimble transaction, all values are fully obscured. There are no reusable or identifiable addresses. Every transaction looks the same to an outside party.The two properties verified in a MimbleWimble transaction are:To verify no new money has been created, you must demonstrate that the sum of outputs minus the inputs equals zero. To verify key ownership, the transacting parties must legitimately prove their public and private keys exist to authorize the transaction.MimbleWimble uses a blinding element to obscure all values – transaction amounts and keys – while holding true basic mathematical facts. The blinding element relies on multiplying and adding secret factors to obscure real values.For example, let’s say I have a transaction with these amounts:(1) 17 + 12 = 29
The balanced equation shows no new money was created, complying with property 1) above. The equation remains true if I apply a secret blinding number (eg 11) to all terms.(2) 17*11 + 12*11 = 29*11
Without knowing my secret number 11, you would have a hard time guessing what the original transaction values are in this equation.(3) 187 + 132 = 319
In equation (3), I’ve managed to keep both the values and blinding number private while still allowing others to verify I have not created new money in my transaction.Still don’t think this is a big deal? MimbleWimble offers other extensive benefits that indicate it could form the foundation of the kind of network bitcoin was meant to be.By obscuring all values, MimbleWimble provides full privacy and gives you the choice of what to reveal. It’s similar to donor levels in various non-profits. You’ll see the range a donation was made for, but you don’t necessarily know the exact donation.Both the donor and the non-profit know exactly how much was donated, but no one else needs to know.This “right to privacy gives us the ability to choose which parts in this domain can be accessed by others, and to control the extent, manner and timing of the use of those parts we choose to disclose.” [2]Another aspect of bitcoin that disturbs me greatly is there is little opportunity left for an average person to participate in securing the network. The requirement of a highly specialized and expensive chip for bitcoin mining – the ASIC – has almost eliminated anyone from becoming a bitcoin miner, whose primary responsibility is validating transactions and placing them into blocks.The mining community is now heavily centralized and this has greatly contributed to bitcoin’s woes.The ability to grow over time while still providing equal opportunity to participate are key tenets of Ignotus’ Grin implementation of MimbleWimble. Grin is designed to be ASIC resistant, so that anyone who wants to try mining can buy a widely available GPU chip at a local Best Buys or online for a reasonable price.Making MimbleWimble ASIC resistant democratizes access. I’ve even toyed with the idea of building a GPU miner with my kids to see what it can do.Another way to safeguard equal access over time is to ensure the blockchain network doesn’t get dragged to a standstill when transaction volume increases.This is the core issue in the bitcoin block-size debate: there are more transactions than can fit into a 1Mb block. As long as there’s a restrictive size limit, there will be a capacity issue. A dirty little secret is that to get around scalability issues, almost all payment processors and exchanges do off-chain transactions. Which begs the question: why bother using a cryptocurrency with blockchain?Increasing usage will increase transaction volume. So how do you ensure that a block size can continue to accommodate volume increases? By streamlining each block.The principle is similar to simplifying equations. If there are terms that are identical on both sides of an equation, you can cut them:(8) 2+y = x+2
(9) 7+3+5+4+2+y = x+7+3+5+4+2Both equations (8) and (9) simplify to:(10) y = xMimbleWimble maintains that if an output spends an input, you no longer have to keep them because they cancel each other out. This greatly cuts down the amount of data you have to store and process.The only data that nodes keep is unspent outputs and block headers. Instead of thinking of blockchain capacity in terms of number of transactions, MimbleWimble is designed to grow with the number of users. The streamlined blocks make growth sustainable over time as the transaction data set does not continue to get bigger.This increases privacy since transaction data gets removed and it also enables fungibility.Fungibility is the ability for equal units to be interchangeable.Let’s say I give you a dollar – either as a coin or a paper note. The Federal Reserve prints the paper dollar and the US Mint produces the coin dollar, but both are equal. Neither is lesser or greater than the other and you can chose to use a dollar coin or bill interchangeably.This is a key characteristic of currency: equal units must be interchangeable, or fungible. The US dollar is fungible. Bitcoin is not.The bitcoin blockchain keeps every single input and output forever and so each coin carries a legacy. It’s similar to equation (9) above.Another dirty little secret is that when picking which transactions to process – in addition to the fee – payment processors, miners, and exchanges will look at the inputs (ie 7+3+5+4+2) to assess the quality of the transaction. The consequence is one bitcoin is not fungible with another.The most valued bitcoins are called ‘coinbase transactions’, which are the ones created when a block is found. They are newly minted and ‘clean’ and some parties pay a premium to buy them. A hierarchy in coin quality develops. The consequence is, if you receive bitcoins that have inputs that are tainted (eg they have been used in a dark market), spending them may become increasingly difficult.In MimbleWimble, because the (7+3+5+4+2) inputs and outputs are all discarded when spent, each coin is exactly equal to the other. In other words, MimbleWimble coins are interchangeable and fungible.I’m very hopeful seeing the accelerating pace of research and innovation in public blockchains.If privacy and scalability are solved, MimbleWimble could be the Patronus Charm for bitcoin, perhaps as a complementary sidechain. Imagine what a universal fungible digital coin could enable with access for everyone.One hesitation I have, however, is that many people developing it have taken on Harry Potter-themed pseudonyms. It’s understandable given the personal attacks rampant in the community, but it does conjure a mystical aura. I’m glad Andrew Poelstra, a highly qualified real figure, is actively involved with MimbleWimble.I hope I can add my voice to the mix, also as a real person. I realize that by not using a pseudonym, I’m opening myself to the troll armies. I’ve attempted to explain why MimbleWimble is interesting to me.I hope it intrigues enough people and inspires both men AND women to engage early; it would be great if this community doesn’t wind up as a testosterone-filled boys club.Apparently, Merope Riddle (Lord Voldemort’s mother) is already very involved in MimbleWimble’s development. I believe it’s worth learning, participating in its genesis, and helping to develop a healthy community around it.Hogwarts/Harry Potter image via Shutterstock"

That’s when the idea came up: ‘What about our bistro downstairs?'”With this lightbulb lit, Deloitte teamed up with Benchmark Hospitality (which operates Bistro 1858 inside Deloitte’s Toronto complex) and bitcoin processor BitPay to kick off the concept.The idea was that users could download a wallet, purchase bitcoin from the ATM and then buy a meal from the bistro – with the end result being that they could see the changes to their balance reflected immediately.Benchmark initially viewed the opportunity as a chance to cut costs and test out a new technology, but the appeal has expanded much more widely.“We’ve had a positive reaction from the bistro staff,” said Oris Valiente. “They’ve just said: ‘This is flat out cool.'”For Deloitte, the initiative has served as a means to inform even more people about bitcoin and blockchain, while generating more organic interest in the subject internally.“We have a lot of our internal employees who are excited to get their first bitcoin wallet, buy their first fraction of a bitcoin and perhaps invite their clients in and have a conversation about what this technology means,” she said.But Deloitte is quick to concede that rolling out such an endeavor – as straightforward as it may seem – is far from an easy task.There were a plethora of financial and technological hurdles to overcome.These included determining how Bistro 1858 would handle end-of-shift reconciliations, calculating the implementation costs and deciding which payment provider would be the best fit.At the end of the day, Oris Valiente explained that introducing the new payments system was ultimately a change management exercise.While simple in aim, it involved retraining management and front-line staff, along with communicating to all stakeholders why the exercise was being undertaken in the first place.“I think those conversations, and trying to understand what motivates all of the parties and how we address all of their needs, that was probably the most time-consuming aspect,” she said.However, she argued that the exercise has been useful in helping to explain that blockchain solutions are similar to other types of enterprise applications: While the nuts and bolts get fundamentally reworked, the experience for the end-user oftentimes remains unchanged.“The user experience is pretty straightforward; what’s changed is the complex back-end. That story is actually in parallel to what we often see when we develop enterprise applications,” she said.Oris Valiente also emphasized that the exercise has been instrumental in helping to facilitate the flow of creative juices internally.“A lot of the use cases that we’re working on today could not have been possible if it were a small group of people sitting in a board room talking to one another,” she said, adding:“For me, the more people we can expose to this technology, the more smart people you have looking at it, the more creative ideas you’ll come up with.”Bistro 1858 image via Deloitte"

Add into the mix rumors, innuendo and disinformation and one really has their work cut out for them.In certain cases, personalities might transcend the murk and become quasi-official figures, as evident in the proselytizing of Andreas Antonopoulos, the ‘let the code speak for itself’ quietism of Pieter Wuille, or the informed whimsy of Samson Mow.However, it is not always the case that important figures within the cryptocurrency ecosystem are visible at all, even when their actions have significant impact on the network. This is especially true with the case of Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) where, in contrast to the well-known developers associated with Bitcoin Classic (Gavin Andresen) and Bitcoin XT (Mike Hearn), the key developers of BU are not familiar names.A little bit of history, then, would not be remiss in such an atmosphere  – if for nothing more than to make clear that, in the end, the two sides of the debate are populated by pretty normal folk who are just happy to disagree on a pretty arcane set of ideas, albeit ideas with expensive repercussions.Like most open-source projects, Bitcoin Unlimited is broadly a virtual community consisting of a motley crew of developers, writers, generalists and onlookers.They are invariably people already involved with bitcoin for many years, and BU arose primarily from a single thread on Bitcoin Talk known as “Gold Collapsing Bitcoin Up“. Like numerous such threads, debates were often heated, quite personalized, and partisan.There are certain key figures at the time who seemed to have had a real impact on giving this new community a degree of confidence to expand beyond Core.Dr Peter Rizun was clearly a significant voice and looks to have provided much of the intellectual weight behind BU’s theoretical commitments, such as how transaction fees would occur within a network without a block size limit.Rizun’s ideas are effectively a response to the possibility of removing the current limit of 1MB as expressed in BIP 101 (an improvement proposal authored by Gavin Andresen) that proposed raising the block size limit to 8MB and implementing a biannual doubling thereafter in order to deal with the problem of full blocks and expensive transaction fees.BIP 101 was never adopted, and has its own history within earlier scaling debates. However, it did inspire participants in the “Gold Collapsing Bitcoin Up” thread to seek out new solutions.The BU operation played out on that thread through the summer of 2015, gathering pace as the bitcoin blockchain began to feature ever higher fees.According to Rizun, the four-week transactional average recorded on June 2015 had grown 376 times greater than was seen in September 2010. Bitcoin Magazine reported tens of thousands of unconfirmed transactions as the block size strained to accommodate network usage.A little later, a post by Rizun in July 2015 noticed the average block size had bloated to 70% capacity and was continuing to surge. Discussion on Bitcoin Talk escalated, but the thread was soon locked in what the BU community read as a form of censorship.The perceived villain of the piece here was Bitcoin Talk administrator Theymos and the same accusation from BU members would carry over to r/bitcoin, another online platform also administrated by Theymos.Unlimited supporters turned to r/btc that, of course, Core supporters have tended to consider heavily censored, resulting in a kind of intellectual split that, whatever the technical details, is riven with what can appear to the outsider as quasi-conspiratorial paranoia.The takeaway is that, once untethered from the perceived pro-Core climate of Theymos-dominated media, Bitcoin Unlimited set out on its own path, allowing for a period of off-grid development that would quietly emerge just as Core supporters assumed Segregated Witness (SegWit) would be implemented.This essentially meant that when a form of competition did emerge, Bitcoin Core was blindsided and broadly unprepared.This does not mean they were technically not ready, but rather they had overlooked two subtle developments: miners were not entirely convinced by SegWit, and not everybody completely accepted that it was the obvious solution.This set up the scene for an ideological confrontation.On the BU forums, the idea of a new bitcoin software did not occur immediately. Such a task requires a dedicated developer or development team, but it is not until Andrew Stone (theZerg) began to posit the idea an alternative client that there was real movement.Here it is actually BIP 100 (authored by Jeff Garzik and others) that is most influential, since it explicitly puts the decision about removing the block size limit into the hands of the miners through a voting process.Those who have been following the debate will know that a large amount of the current discussion centers on the role of miners, most often a core of Chinese pools, and to what extent that should be influencing the future direction of bitcoin.Figures involved with these pools, such as Jihan Wu, have taken on almost a shadowy status, maligned agents looking to stall the adoption of SegWit in order to maintain their stranglehold on transaction fees.No doubt there is some truth to the claims of self-interest; nobody is surely naive enough to think otherwise. However, the salient aspect for Bitcoin Unlimited is that having the miners on-side meant having a voice.If bitcoin can be read, and no doubt many will have other interpretations, as a set of influential blocs, not always in competition, then the two most influential voices are surely those of the Core development team (technical credentials) and the large Chinese mining pools (hash rate credentials).The current scaling debate only really kicks off when it becomes clear that, not only are many of the major pools not supporting SegWit, but they are actually signaling for Bitcoin Unlimited. This is thought by many as risking a hard fork of the network into rival blockchains, given how serious the divisions between Core and Unlimited are.The undercurrent to all this are the socio-economic arguments underlying Bitcoin Unlimited. In Peter Rizun’s original BU white paper, we first encounter a now semi-familiar concept in emergent consensus (EC). EC maintains that, given the economic incentive of remaining on the same chain, miners will reconfigure their block size to match the majority of the network.Notably, the white paper includes a section that is explicitly about values, not just technical themes, and they can be summarized as focused on speedy transactions (bitcoin as cash, not gold), on ensuring low fees and being censorship-resistant.It is perhaps this approach that first caught the attention of noted bitcoin investor Roger Ver, who told us:“I actually don’t recall where I first came across BU, but I suspect it was Reddit.”Ver almost certainly must have come across it browsing those subreddits sympathetic to Classic and XT, but one can easily see why he found BU appealing.An outspoken investor, he has been consistently vocal about his vision of bitcoin as principally a payment system, and one that is, as he told us, “useful as money”.This economically minded vision, in the sense of insisting on bitcoin’s core function as facilitating quick-and-easy transactions, is also evident with Bitcoin Unlimited’s lead developer, Andrew Stone.He said:“BU was conceived through discussions in the ‘Gold Collapsing Bitcoin Up’ thread on this forum. Someone (I forget who) observed that the block size should be a network layer, not a consensus layer constraint and I conceived of the emergent consensus mechanics to realize that thought. I then wrote the Articles of Federation with lots of help, drawing a lot of the first sections from a philosophy statement written by Peter Rizun, and other forum writings. I then released the first software version (with EC, although we didn’t call it that then) around Christmas 2015, held elections and transitioned the project from a benevolent dictatorship :) to the framework described in the Articles in early 2016.”In the current climate, it is almost impossible to simply relay the motivations behind such projects by retroactively viewing them through current debates.However, even a cursory glance at the early inception of Bitcoin Unlimited mostly appears to be a sincere attempt to halt what that community views as a deviation from bitcoin’s original vision, quite often expressed as ‘Satoshi’s vision’.For BU, this can be broadly summarized as the primacy of wide-scale adoption, facilitated by transaction speed and the necessity for consensus rule across the network. If Emergent Consensus functions as anticipated, we will witness a synchronized adaptation of the network towards increased block size, in a movement that has been compared to a flock of birds working in harmony.While criticism from Core suggests that this would further centralize the network, Andrew Stone anticipates that, if large mining pools choose to dominate the network with high difficulty blocks, smaller pools will simply switch to an alternate chain, effectively facilitating two economic niches.The ideological split between what it means to be decentralized currency at the level of practice pivots around differing conceptions of control.For BU, the block size limit is locus of an ideological game, where the system can only remain decentralized if this is distributed across nodes and miners. For them, the actions of Core enforce a hierarchical structure that contradict the promise of a decentralized cryptocurrency based entirely on technical adeptness.Whatever happens next will almost certainly confirm the suspicions of one side about the other.If SegWit is adopted, adding a hitherto unforeseen degree of technical complexity to the network, then we enter a phase that confirms wide trust across the entire bitcoin community in the vision of the Core team.If, however, the miners hold out and Unlimited results in a fork, whether now or later (once again possibly blindsiding Core), then we will have to face an ideological schism that asks us to speculate on what precisely we believe bitcoin to be.What Bitcoin Unlimited has brought to light is precisely two competing conceptions over the essence of this entire project, and our worry is precisely this: because the debate has become so polarized, it has become increasingly difficult to communicate across the divide.If bitcoin can be partially understood as a consensus protocol, we might soon have to get better at doing just that.Hidden safe image via Shutterstock"

address format. Wuille told CoinDesk: â€œGiven that we're forced to define 
a ...","May 12, 2017 at 12:00 UTC",One of bitcoin’s most prolific developers is attempting to help with one of the payment network’s longest-running issues.,"Today, bitcoin is known for the new digital control of money it provides to users, not for it’s usability and convenience. And if you haven’t experienced it yourself, you’ve probably at least heard stories about users losing their private keys, accidentally sending bitcoin to the wrong address due to a typo, or some other gaffe.To date, ideas to get around the direct use of public and private keys – long strings of characters that control bitcoin accounts – look like they’re some years away. One fuzzy idea, for example, is to somehow bury them completely so that users don’t even realize they’re using bitcoin.For now, though, cryptocurrencies are stuck with confusing addresses.This is where Bitcoin Core developer Pieter Wuille’s latest project Bech32 (which he is co-developing with Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell) aims to at least steer addresses in a more user-friendly direction, if in a less revolutionary way.The end game is a new kind of bitcoin address with capabilities baked in to help users detect when they type the wrong address.The opportunity to make the improvement arose when bitcoin developers realized that they would need to invent an entirely new addressing scheme anyway with the possible future integration of SegWit – a controversial change proposed for bitcoin’s code.The tech upgrade, if ever implemented, works best with a new bitcoin address format.Wuille told CoinDesk:“Given that we’re forced to define a new standard anyway for native SegWit addresses, why not take the opportunity to introduce something better?”He added that SegWit can also be used with existing addresses, but with “slightly lower efficiency and security.”It’s important to note, though, that the new format won’t replace the old one. Rather, it’s an alternative that would be used for SegWit transactions, should they be deployed on bitcoin.“The old-style addresses will remain in use for all purposes they were used for before. Only native SegWit outputs will use Bech32 addresses,” Wuille explained.To recap, a bitcoin address is a version of a user’s public key to which users can send value. Its unique identifying information is similar to a credit card number, and you can post this string on a public page or send it to a person in order to receive funds.Right now, bitcoin addresses are encoded in the format Base58, meaning the unique ID is displayed as a string of letters and numbers.This format already builds in a form of user protection because it cuts out six characters that look similar to each other. The subtle difference between ‘0’ and ‘O’ might unintentionally trick users copying their bitcoin address from a computer screen, for instance. Rather than risk a mixup, both letters are removed completely.Base32, a part of Bech32, takes the ‘human-readable’ element even further. Letters in the new addressing format are either all lower case or all upper case (not a combination).Here’s an example of the old format: And, here’s an example of an address in the new format: Next, the new format builds in a form of error detection.Wuille has put together a demo that actually flags key entry mistakes. If you mistype the address – say you write an incorrect letter – it knows, sometimes even highlighting the erroneous letter in red.The bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) describing the new scheme also highlights other technical details that are more likely to interest wallet developers aiming to implement the format.For example, Bech32 requires less space for QR codes, a barcode that you can scan with a smartphone (or other device) to retrieve a bitcoin address. Further, decoding the new format is faster than with Base58.Today, this scheme is tailored toward bitcoin addresses, those which users can make public to receive bitcoin. Yet, Wuille said at a recent meetup that the same technique could also one day be used for private keys.A number of developers, such as the teams behind some capacity boosting Lightning Network implementations and bitcoin wallet Electrum, are looking into using the new format. Litecoin developers are, too, as the lesser-known cryptocurrency adopted the SegWit update on Wednesday.On the other hand, while this new format was created for bitcoin, Wuille emphasized it isn’t just for the cryptocurrency world, and could have applications where similar formats are used.Base64, for example, a widely used format that doesn’t necessarily have human-readability in mind, is used for encoding all kinds of data.If the address scheme is ever implemented, Wuille added, he expects that it will take time for users to pick up and use the new technology, since both senders and receivers need to support it to make a successful transaction.This has been the case for pay-to-script hash (P2SH) addresses, which are addresses for more advanced (and less used) bitcoin transactions types, such as those that require two out of three participants to sign off on sending money.Wuille concluded:“The point is just that if we ever want to be able to use native SegWit, a standard for its addresses needs to be defined and available for a long time beforehand.”Correction: An earlier version misstated that SegWit “requires” a new format. This has been corrected.Pieter Wuille image via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk"

To date, Boost VC has backed more than bitcoin 50 companies at the seed level or above.","In this entry in CoinDesk’s “Bitcoin Milestones” series, Draper gives an overview of 1st July, 2014, the day his father Tim Draper purchased nearly 30,000 bitcoins in the US government’s first-ever bitcoin auction.“So, should I do it?”It’s 1st July, 2014, and I’m driving to work. I was turning onto El Camino when I got the call from my dad.“I’m about to press the button to send in my bid,” he said.The week would prove an interesting one in history. Justin Trudeau was sworn in as Canada’s prime minister, Chris Stapleton raked in CMAs and it also happened to be the week the US Marshals Service auctioned off 30,000 bitcoins.***Up to that point our industry had a torrid history of scandal and skepticism.The general masses had only heard that large sums of money had been stolen from bitcoin exchanges or that everyone buys illegal drugs with bitcoin. In fact, the reason that the US Marshals office had the bitcoin was because Ross Ulbricht (aka ‘Dread Pirate Roberts’) had been captured and proclaimed the leader of the Silk Road, a startup focused on the illegal sale of goods online.For a while, it was the eBay of buying drugs, guns and hitmen, and the currency used in this anonymous marketplace was the ever-reliable bitcoin.That’s the stigma that stuck to the technology (and that still sticks to this day), and it was everywhere at the time.I remember being on a panel with my dad [Tim Draper] and grandpa [Bill Draper] in early 2015, in front of hundreds of people. It was the first time we had done a panel where we each talked about our lives as venture capitalists.When it was my turn to speak, the only thing I said was “bitcoin”, and as I started to explain why, my grandpa turned and cracked a joke:“Well Adam, don’t be the first Draper to go to jail.”Even my grandfather, the most prescient man I have ever known, had a tilted perspective of the bitcoin world. (He also obviously didn’t know about my trip to Tijuana, Mexico, in college either).***The sale of the US Marshal bitcoin had the potential to be a major shift in public sentiment depending on the outcome.This was a government-funded institution that had confiscated digital currency and was auctioning it off in return for cash. This was the government recognizing the validity of bitcoin and using it to generate its own revenue.If it was only used, or had value for illegal goods, the US Marshals Service wouldn’t touch it, no government agency would take a stack of confiscated cocaine and publicly auction it off to the highest bidder.“So, should I do it? I’m about to press the button.”I took a breath and responded:“If I had the money, I would. This technology is changing the world.”He said “OK”, and hung up.***Looking back, I probably should have hesitated.I didn’t know it at the time, but he was bidding millions to win the whole amount. I assumed he was only bidding for a portion…The next day I walked into my office, and my co-founder Brayton Williams said, “Did you hear? All the bitcoin in the auction went to a single person.”I thought to myself, “Dad… what did you do?!”I went upstairs (we work in the same building in San Mateo) and I walked in on an incredible moment. The Vaurum team was in the room, Avish Bhama and Sean Lavine, my dad and my brother were all there. I sat down on the couch looking out to my dad’s desk and the open window, he was on the phone with someone.“Hey you made it just in time! We are transferring the bitcoin into my wallet!” he said, my dad’s infinite enthusiasm even more palpable than normal.I remember looking around and having a feeling of history come over me. I had been working in the digital currency world for 18 months at this point, and I knew that when the history of bitcoin was written, this moment was going to be one of those moments that was spoken about and potentially debated.That’s why what happened next is comical…***So, my dad was on the phone with the US Marshals, who were going to send this super advanced new type of currency over the internet to my dad’s wallet. But because it was millions of dollars at stake, they were verbally confirming and reconfirming the wallet addresses.“Lowercase Z, seven, capital X, four, five….”“Wait… Lowercase C? or Z?”“Z as in Zebra.”“OK, continue.”It was analogous to the ‘easy’ user experience that bitcoin has always had a problem with. They repeated this process four times before they decided that they were sure the address was correct.“OK confirmed,” my dad said. You could hear the voice on the other end say, “OK, sent.”And nothing happened. Everyone justified this. They said, ‘Well it takes 10 minutes for a confirmation on the blockchain to happen…’ Ten minutes went by… nothing.There were 30,000 bitcoin going somewhere, but it didn’t feel like they were going to the wallet address it was supposed to go to.Twenty minutes pass. Nothing.Everyone was getting nervous.Thirty minutes pass. Nothing.I left the room just as everyone started to get a little worried.Sure, it was a historic moment, but I was already a half hour late for my next meeting…***Flash forward, and it took an hour to confirm. AN HOUR!!! (It turns out that the US Marshal didn’t give the miners a fee for the transaction, so it wasn’t a priority on the network).But the transaction did go through, and my dad and the US Marshals Service successfully completed a bitcoin transaction that got put into the record books.And the headlines read: “Venture Capitalist Steve Draper Wins Bitcoin Auction.” The first article I read called my dad ‘Steve’. Hilarious.“Tim Draper Wins Silk Road Auction” was the common title used.Now, think about what just happened. The US government successfully sold 30,000 bitcoins. Not only that, but a professional investor had won all of them, and not a random professional investor, but a third-generation venture capitalist who had earned respect by being one of the best VCs ever for backing startups like Skype, Baidu and Hotmail.That is what the world read that day in The Wall Street Journal, Forbes and The New York Times.The bitcoin community needed a catalyst to change perception, and I believe my dad created it.Images via Adam Draper "

In addition, those exchanges will also be required to conduct employee training programs and submit to annual audits.Yet there may be more work to come in this area.For example, Nomura Research Institute’s Yasutake Okano indicated in a May 2016 report that other Japanese laws may need to change to account for the tech, including the Banking Act and Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.Reports indicate that other groups in Japan are moving to plug some of those gaps as well.According to a report from Nikkei, the Accounting Standards Board of Japan decided earlier this week to begin developing standards for digital currencies like bitcoin. Its work mirrors other efforts being undertaken elsewhere, including Australia, which began pushing for such standards late last year.Image via Shutterstock"

In a new ...","Apr 4, 2017 at 02:32 UTC",,"Bitcoin startup Purse is spearheading work on a new solution it believes could break the network’s long-simmering scaling gridlock.In a new blog post issued today, Purse has released a specification that includes demo functionality and code for upgrading its bitcoin software implementation, Bcoin, to support “extension blocks”. The technical update seeks to enable the network to optionally support different kinds of blocks in addition to the default 1 MB blocks that today make up the main bitcoin blockchain (and that have long been a source of community tension).The move to develop the technology finds Purse pitching its implementation – one that is today an alternative to versions by Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Unlimited – as a third option in the scaling debate that would bring about a block size increase and malleability fix via soft fork, or a change that doesn’t risk splitting the bitcoin blockchain.Founded in 2014 as a startup that enables bitcoin users to get discounts when shopping at Amazon, Purse has been increasingly interested in network development, launching Bcoin in September of last year.Developer Joseph Poon and BitPay CEO Stephen Pair contributed to the release.So far, the idea is said to have support from bitcoin’s mining community, though miners did not have any preferred access to the code, a source said.Industry firms also appear to be anticipating the release, with BitPay reporting it is eager to test the idea as an alternative to a contentious hard fork. In remarks, CEO Stephen Pair said the bitcoin payments processing startup was afraid of needing to shut down in the face of such an event, and that it is open to all alternative ideas.Pair noted that he recently broached the topic in a blog post, which he credited as helping to spark new development on the idea.Pair said:“With ‘Extension Blocks’, you can implement something and maybe only a small portion of the network even cares about it, but it can be enforced by the miners and included in blocks. It can work or not work and it won’t impact the rest of the network.”As shown by the comments, the idea comes at a time when interest among network users in exploratory ways to reach consensus on changes to the network rules remains high.As such, Purse CEO Andrew Lee framed the solution as one that seeks to jumpstart momentum for bitcoin through effective compromise, writing:“We are proposing the best of both worlds through a safe, non-contentious upgrade.”As for how the idea would progress, those close to the project expressed that they want the announcement to be viewed as the start of a conversation on the idea.So far, it seems there is enthusiasm among some network stakeholders, with mining pool F2Pool even citing the software last week, embedding a message in the bitcoin blockchain that referenced the proposal.Mining firm ViaBTC, an outspoken supporter of the Bitcoin Unlimited software, also tweeted its approval for the concept, and Bitmain is said to be supportive as well.An effort was also made to heavily publicize the effort with major media outlets as a potentially “momentous” development for the network.As detailed in the post, the idea is to now garner miner support for the technical fix.“Once a supermajority of miners have flagged for this change, users can begin using these features enabling entirely new use cases for bitcoin,” the post reads.Purse went on to state that it would like for the resulting conversation to involve “users, miners and industry”, remarking that any eventual upgrade is still months away.If introduced, this would not be the first time work on a proposal for extension blocks would see public discussion.Commentary on the proposal surfaced on the bitcoin development mailing list as far back as 2015, when Blockstream CEO Adam Back discussed how the network might adopt extension blocks.“The interesting thing is this makes block sizes changes opt-in and gives users choice. Choice is good,” Back wrote.A more extended history of discussion on the concept can be found in the mailing list archives as well.As recently as this January, the subject was advanced again, though some developers offered concerns about the change.Bitcoin Core developers indicated that they are aware of the proposal, responding with concerns about the complexity of the code, as well as the precedent that could occur should the proposal be aggressively adopted by one constituency of the network or without sufficient review.Worries were also raised about how this would affect access to the network, and whether technicality increases brought about by more custom blocks would only be accessible to a minority stakeholders and users.Blocks image via Shutterstock"

Miners expend energy and manpower in exchange for newly minted bitcoins.Yet, the ever-rising difficulty of mining can mean ever-encroaching costs for for miners.With the mining derivative, “a miner can lock in a projected growth rate of the difficulty factor”, the patent filing reads.The application goes on to explain:“If the network hash rate grows faster than anticipated, the income from mining may fall, but the variation and settlement of the futures or the funds received by exercising a cash-settled call option contract would cover the loss. On the other hand, if the difficulty factor grows more slowly than anticipated or falls, the contract would lose value or the call option premium would expire as worthless, but a miner would make more money than expected on mining operations.”Per the application, CME envisions the bitcoin mining derivative as a way to position against the depreciation of mining hardware as well.“…as the difficulty factor rises, mining computers may become less marketable, so taking a long position in the generated contract, or being long a call option on the generated contract, would allow manufacturers to lock in a projected growth rate of the difficulty factor and hedge against the risk of falling hardware prices,” CME continues.CME first applied for the patent on 13th October, 2015.

over time. It's a log graph that shows exponential growth as straight ...","Mar 24, 2017 at 18:35 UTC","Willy Woo is an entrepreneur, investor, trader and cryptocurrency enthusiast.","In this guest piece, Woo weighs in on the block size, analyzing the charts to offer a novel take on bitcoin’s big debate. Ultimately, he finds that there’s little evidence to suggest current network congestion is a fatal flaw.Bitcoin has been operating for eight years, from the early days when we only saw a few transactions in each block, through to today, where blocks are crammed packed and congestion is the norm.One benefit of seeing congestion this early in bitcoin’s life is we get a great set of data of the network under load. In this study, we’ll take a look at bitcoin’s transactional data to see if it points to an ideal block size (if there even is such a thing).The chart above shows the transactions per second on the bitcoin network over time.It’s a log graph that shows exponential growth as straight lines, where the bubbles denote the size of bitcoin’s mempool (think of it as a kind of storage tank that temporarily holds transactions before they are processed).Despite users complaining that the blocks are now crammed full, and that the network overloading, this graph tells a surprising story. While we see by Q4 of 2016, the mempool swelling to take up peak loads, the network catches up off-peak.The network is keeping up with exponential demand.Yes, we are seeing congestion, but no, we are not yet turning away any significant transaction volume due to this congestion. If this was true, we’d see this as a downwards arc on our log graph instead of our straight line.But that’s not to say we aren’t very close to the limits soon and our arc away from a straight line will likely happen in the weeks and months ahead.We can use this chart to project future transactional demand.Say, by the next block reward halving in 2020, we can expect around 20 transactions per second on the network. Having predicted 20 transactions per second by 2020, I’ll now explain why this probably won’t be true.The bitcoin network is mainly used as a store of value, but by 2020, bitcoin’s price volatility should be stable enough for it to be used as a currency. I suspect then we’ll see a step change upwards as merchants start using it for general commerce.Something like the Lightning Network (which allows for nearly unlimited transactions for the cost of four normal transactions) would open new use cases such as microtransactions for the IoT.The two takeaways are that we can use this chart for predictions, but they will only be valid as long as bitcoin’s use case remains the same.For now it’s store of value, in future it could expand greatly.Users of the bitcoin network, and in particular businesses, tell us that fees have increased to the point where paying for coffee and other even smaller use cases (such as ad network payments) are not viable anymore.The argument is that bitcoin is losing utility for general commerce, therefore the bitcoin network is at risk of declining as payments move to cheaper, competing alternative cryptocurrencies.Clearly, we see that the exponential growth of transactions per second hasn’t skipped a beat. This tells us the ‘paying for your coffee with bitcoin’ use case, though much talked about, was essentially a negligible aspect of the network transactions.Otherwise we would see a declining curve. The network is keeping up. It’s core use case has always been transmitting and securing high values securely.As mentioned earlier this will change as bitcoin volatility becomes stable enough to be used as an everyday currency.We are currently in the phase of bitcoin as a store of value. Bitcoin used as a currency is a few years away, so we have time to work out how to cater for the orders of magnitude increase that would come.This does not discount the fact businesses are experiencing pain from high fees and slow confirm times, which we’ll look into further.Maybe a year ago, there was debate among miners whether big blocks or small blocks would yield them higher profits.Some were even saying big blocks would allow more transactions to be carried, and therefore more fees would be generated. However by Q4 2016, we saw the impact of momentary peak hour congestion hit the network.It’s been clear that a demand driven market has emerged, resulting in much higher revenues.Here’s a graph plotting the fees impact of congestion on the network.As average block size hits 95% of maximum, the mempool starts ballooning, users start leapfrogging one another with their fees in to get into the next block without delay. As a result the fees start to hockey stick… just a pure vertical climb in fees.If you were a miner, solely motivated for short-term profit, you would want the maximum block size to be small enough to always keep those blocks 95% filled.You’d want to limit the supply of transaction space so the fees competition gets rabid. The optimal block size for miners is “small enough to drive congestion”Question: What would 8MB blocks have produced in fees?Lets run a hypothetical scenario… say Bitcoin XT was approved and we have 8 MB blocks today, what would miners be earning from fees?Obviously, supply overwhelms demand and dynamic fee algorithms in wallets will set lower fees according to network conditions.We can use our graph to estimate the new earnings.Today’s transactional load is using 0.95 MB of space per block on average, you can read this from the bubbles at the right of the chart (you can see this more clearly at Blockchain.info).This would be a 12% fill rate with 8 MB blocks. At 12%, the graph shows miners earning 0.1 BTC per block from fees. Today, miners earn 1-2 BTC in fees with 1 MB blocks, so 8 MB blocks would serve to reduce this by a factor of 10-20x.Okay, let’s move on to the what users want – fast confirmation times, reasonable fees and good security.We’ve seen the speed of the network grind to snails pace at peak times. The graph below shows how long we are waiting for a confirmation as the blocks reach their maximum.The bubble sizes denoting the number of transactions in the mempool just goes crazy whenever blocks are 95% or more filled, and confirm times just go vertical.Even before things get crazy at around 80%, the median confirm times start to deviate upwards significantly.It’s important to note that the higher the fees we pay as users on the system, the more security we get as miners can afford to compete with higher hash power with more revenues. This becomes super important in due time as the block reward subsidy drops with each halving event.Currently, fees make an important part of miners revenue – 1.5 BTC fees vs 12.5 BTC in reward subsidy. At the next halving when the subsidy drops to 6.25 BTC the fees component will become critical to the security of the network.Thus, there is a “goldilocks zone” for fees, not too cheap for better security and not too expensive.My conclusion here is the ideal block size to keep confirm times from ballooning while keeping fees and security reasonable is around 80% of blocks being filled.So we have three results so far.The optimal network, based solely on the economic game theory, will need to balance security and miners revenue, speed, and low cost of transactions.**Given these constraints, I think the best block size would have to be dynamic, adjusting to network transactional demand to keep it inside the sweet spot as much as possible. The goal would be to keep the blocks at around 80% filled.At this setting, the median confirm times will be unaffected, yet will keep the demand driven fees market high enough to be significant for miners and therefore the security of the network in years to come. But, it would be still 4x cheaper than today’s congestion driven price.In this light, monero’s approach to dynamic blocksizing where the adjustment is algorithmic according to network load seems ideal.It would constantly be adjusting to keep the best balance between miners revenue, security and reasonable fees for users.** These considerations completely ignore technical aspects of the network which others have covered at great length such as block propagation times and Great Wall of China impacts.Data units image via Shutterstock"

The one known for temporarily shutting down a number of the world’s largest websites last autumn?,"Well, a newer version has been detected, but as well as being able to issue DDoS attacks and the like, it’s equipped to mine bitcoin.In the digital age, it’s possible for hackers to infect and take control of insecure Internet of Things (IoT) devices, say, toasters, cameras or other web-connected devices. They can then bundle them together into a botnet, using their combined capacity to shoot spam at websites or internet structures, slowing them down or sending them offline.That’s what happened in a series of attacks in the fall, using the malware dubbed Mirai.The software was open-sourced soon after – much to the dismay of security engineers – and, since then, different strains iterating on the first version of the botnet have cropped up with added abilities.One strain, known as ELF Linux/Mirai, has now been detected mining bitcoin for a few days, according to research from IBM X-Force, the Big Blue’s cybersecurity research wing. It seems some unknown hacker (or hackers) is experimenting with using the power accumulated from IoT devices to mine the digital currency and possibly make some cash.This could be an omen for future IoT botnet use cases, argued Dave McMillen, IBM Managed Security Services senior threat researcher and author of the report.McMillen told CoinDesk:“This ELF/Mirai variant could be appealing to others in the future due to the potentially large volume of devices that could be involved.”The researcher noted, however, that, the botnet didn’t appear to successfully mine any bitcoin. The security team see it more like a peek at a down-the-road possibility.So, what happened, and how did IBM spot the mining component of the botnet?McMillen explained, saying:“We detected a spike in command injection activity in our IBM X-Force monitored client environment data that prompted deeper investigation.”The security team saw traffic related to an ELF 64-bit binary file., which the report describes as beginning as a “blip”, which grew in volume by 50%, but had fizzled out by day eight.The team “dissected” the binary to discover that the Linux version of the malware is similar to the more typical Windows version.“It was detected as a slave miner by multiple tools, however we are still investigating other properties of the variant,” McMillen added.While there are now many variants of the botnet, ELF Linux/Mirai has extra abilities in that it can execute ‘SQL injection’ (a notorious way to take control of databases) and execute so called ‘brute force’ attacks.But, the Linux version has an extra add-on – the bitcoin miner component (which you can see online here).IBM speculates in the report that the botnet creators may be looking for a way to make bitcoin mining with compromised IoT devices a lucrative venture.“Realizing the power of Mirai to infect thousands of machines at a time, there is a possibility that the bitcoin miners could work together in tandem as one large miner consortium. We haven’t yet determined that capability, but found it to be an interesting yet concerning possibility,” a blog post explains, adding:“One scenario could be that while the Mirai bots are idle and awaiting further instructions, they could be leveraged to go into mining mode.”Although this idea is admittedly speculative, the report points to the fact that bitcoin has been used for other cybercrimes – such with ransomware, which encrypts all of a user’s computer data with a demand for payment – because it’s decentralized and is perceived as a more privacy-enhancing currency.The tech can have more beneficial uses cases, though. For example, one company recently revealed aims to build a bitcoin botnet to help secure IoT devices, combining the cryptocurrency with technology also has the potential for less beneficial online activities.So, how can users protect their internet-connected toasters from being enlisted as a bitcoin mining slave?The Mirai malware exploits a surprisingly simple attack vector.The problem is that many IoT devices come with pre-installed passwords. And, since many users never change them, all an attacker needs to do is find the default password to ‘hack’ into the devices.McMillen’s advice is for users to change those passwords. Though, he said that he hopes that IoT companies are beginning to tackle the problem, too.He concluded:“Manufacturers could be looking for ways to manage these credentials more securely, perhaps by prompting a forced change or randomizing the default logins.”Army computer via Shutterstock"

Holders of IRAs can deduct contributions from their income tax every year until the commencement of disbursements, currently at 59.5 years old in the US.However, while there is no legal difference in an IRA account’s status based on the investment, most popular IRA providers only allow pre-approved investments, not more unusual options like cryptocurrencies or private equity and property.According to data from Greene IRA, 38% of Americans use IRAs as a type of retirement savings.Currently, the firm BitcoinIRA is the only option for investors who wish to hold cryptocurrencies in their IRAs directly, using Kingdom Trust and Palo Alto-based BitGo for storage. BitcoinIRA took its first accounts in June 2016, and just recently began offering ethereum IRAs as well. (The firm even boasts former US Mint director Ed Moy as an advisor).Investors with 401ks through their employers can transfer those funds into such IRAs under certain circumstances.Damon Smedley, a BitcoinIRA investor, who lives in Portland, Oregon, opened an account with BitcoinIRA last year. A former manufacturing engineer for a major technology company, Smedley bought his first bitcoins in 2013 and has monitored the price since.That’s a typical profile for early BitcoinIRA investors, said Chris Kline, chief operating officer of BitcoinIRA. But increasingly, Kline said, he has seen inquires from people who were less interested in the technology and were instead motivated by the uptrends in digital currency prices.Kline told CoinDesk:“We’ve had experts and novices, 25–75 age range, an even mix of gender and a blend of reasons for looking at bitcoin.”BitcoinIRA charges a one-time upfront fee of 15% on deposits of $15,000–$100,000; 13% on $100,000–$200,000 placements and 11% on those $200,000 and above.Kingdom Trust, a self-directed IRA provider and BitcoinIRA partner, also charges a custodian fee for holding bitcoins in a multi-signature wallet, enabling investors to verify funds in real-time.Kline said BitcoinIRA has seen a surge in interest as bitcoin prices have skyrocketed. To date, the price of bitcoin has almost doubled this year: from just under $1,000 at the end of 2016 to nearly $2,000 today.Considering this growth, Kline expects cryptocurrencies to one day be as commonly held in IRAs as stocks or bonds. Indeed, if there is one asset class well suited for retirement savings products like IRAs, it might be deflationary cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, which increase in value over time. (It’s important to note, however, not all cryptocurrencies are deflationary by design).Notably, too, ethereum has climbed 900% since the beginning of the year, and the combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies has spiked 80% over the last month alone.Another option for some IRA investors, who would like to benefit from the price increases without holding cryptocurrencies, is private placement with products offered by Grayscale Investments, a digital currency startup providing products for high net-worth investors and that works with IRA administrator The Entrust Group.For its products, investors must be accredited, which means a net worth of over $1m or income over $200,000 in each of the last two years.Both BitcoinIRA and The Entrust Group administer ‘self-directed’ IRAs, which means the account owner is responsible for their investments, including understanding the tax consequences.That’s why the Government Accountability Office issued a report in January calling for more clarity on the tax consequences of less-common IRA investments so that investors are aware of the risk.For example, the IRS classifies virtual currencies as property today.Officials with the IRS have started compiling data on alternative investments in IRAs, including cryptocurrencies, and said in statements they plan to release findings sometime this year.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Grayscale Investments.Bitcoin and money image via Shutterstock"

So far, they have racked up almost $80,000 in bitcoins. But their next step may be more difficult – they still have to figure out how to move that money, without giving themselves away to authorities.","The well-publicized cyber-attack, which began in Asia, has locked up hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries. Once a computer gets infected, a tab pops up demanding a $300 payment in bitcoin to unfreeze the data.Shockingly, despite no clear evidence that anyone who pays the ransom actually receives the promised decryption keys to unlock their encrypted files, some people have been putting up the funds, sending their bitcoin off to one of the hacker’s three bitcoin wallet addresses.But now, with the world’s cybercrime teams watching those bitcoin addresses, the question is: Will the hackers be able to launder that money and spend it? Or, is the money tainted, traceable, and therefore worthless to the thieves?Originally bitcoin was touted as an anonymous payment vehicle. But over the years it has become clear that bitcoin is pseudonymous rather than truly anonymous.Bitcoin addresses, payments and transactions are all visible on the blockchain. And by analyzing transaction patterns, it is possible to trace money and find the actual parties behind the public keys – strings of numbers bitcoin uses to identify its participants.
As WannaCry is the most widespread bitcoin ransomware attack in history, the criminals behind it have garnered a lot of attention. So, if they want to actually spend their funds, they will have to find a clever way to remove all links from the original bitcoin addresses.As of right now, though, the bitcoins are still sitting untouched, and the trail is cold.So what are the options for the bad actor(s) behind the ransomware attack?Laundering bitcoin is a little different from laundering fiat money, but is just a matter of applying the right tools, according to Emin Gün Sirer, a professor at Cornell University. According to him, technologies already exist for shedding so called ‘tainted’ bitcoins – they just require a little technical know-how.One of the simplest processes is ‘chain hopping’, where bitcoins are converted into other digital currencies, usually at offshore exchanges. “Following the trail gets quite difficult as the coins cross jurisdictions and change shape,” Sirer told CoinDesk.Another technique known as ‘tumbling’ would allow the hackers to pool their ill-begotten bitcoins with other people’s coins.In a bitcoin tumbling service, coins from different sources are mixed together and then re-disbursed. Conceivably, the hackers could repeatedly mix their coins until the coins were diluted enough to throw law officials off their path.But Ethan Heilman, the Boston University researcher behind TumbleBit, a proposed bitcoin tumbler, indicated that mixing bitcoin is risky business, especially when dealing with larger sums of money. As he pointed out, one of the problems the hackers may run into is finding a large enough number of bitcoins to adequately mix with.“Even if they mix the coins such that they will be hard to follow, if the WannaCry hackers make a mistake and join the coins back together, those coins could become vulnerable to clustering and other blockchain analysis techniques,” he said.Further, it is unclear how effective most mixers actually are, Heilman added.Notably, the fact that the hackers used only three bitcoin addresses to collect their money suggests they don’t know much about bitcoin privacy. Had they used a unique bitcoin address for each computer WannaCry infected, the money would have been a lot more difficult to trace.In a LinkedIn post, Neil Walsh, the UN’s head of global cybercrime, pointed to that and other shortcomings in the ransomware to suggest the hackers are likely in over their heads.He wrote:“We estimate that the attackers are relatively unskilled, and are probably unprepared for the impact their malware turned out to have. It is quite possible that they are unsure how to launder the bitcoin funds safely.”However, as Sirer pointed out, hacking is a rich, stratified ecosystem, and the people who put together the exploit may now be looking for an expert at laundering coins. Or, they may simply be biding their time before attempting to retrieve the funds.He concluded:“The authorities are revved up right now, and time will help dilute their focus. The hackers can probably afford to wait, potentially for a long time.”Hacker image via Shutterstock"

Previously, she was founder and CEO of Particle Code, a cross-platform development technology for mobile and social games acquired by Appcelerator.","In this opinion piece, Benartzi discusses why she believes the ability of blockchain technologies to create many currencies could create a ‘long tail’ of new commerce opportunities.Money, when it comes down to it, is a tool for collaboration.Money moves human energy, skills and time between us, in different ‘containers’, or stores of value. National stores of value, like the US dollar, have historically been controlled by governments and distributed by banks.This, of course, happens with limited transparency, a combined domestic and international monetary policy agenda, and political considerations throughout.Naturally, this model is far more inflexible and inaccessible than newer cryptocurrency solutions, made possible by blockchain database technology that can theoretically enable anyone to issue and distribute a digital store of value.In fact, we’re just beginning to see the blockchain ecosystem give rise to these new forms of money that can be issued at little to no cost.Because cryptocurrencies allow us to account and transfer value securely between one another without the need for an intermediary, such as a bank, we can finally join and create local and group value networks that operate reliably, with little overhead or tedious monitoring.Communities of any flavor can now be empowered to agree on credit-issuing policies and governance structures, and enjoy internal marketplaces from which to buy and sell goods or services, without relying on access to national money.Today’s first use cases are produced by early adopters, and already we see hundreds, nearing thousands, of cryptocurrencies on the market and counting.But as technical barriers to entry are removed, we are on the precipice of millions of user-generated currencies, of all shapes and sizes. This is similar to inflection points in user-generated content we saw with the rise of WordPress for blogs and YouTube for video.Similarly, the long tail of value creation will produce a large variety of monetary diversity and abundance from greatly enhanced collaboration between people.In business, the ‘long tail’ describes content and products in low demand or with low sales or view volume that, collectively, make up a market share exceeding that of current top performers combined.Internet history shows us that with the digital long tail, the accumulation of all niche contributions is actually two to three orders of magnitude greater than the hits. Think of all the Instagram accounts after the 1,000 most followed, or all the status updates beyond the most viral.In cryptocurrency, the long tail points to hundreds of billions in potential value when combining all small and niche currencies beyond the few largest.It’s an idea that’s been tried before.For example, my founding team previously built technology for local currency initiatives. One of our most successful projects became the largest alternative currency in Israel where it was used.There, a community of new mothers issued a currency called ‘Hearts’ that allowed thousands of active moms to buy and sell from each other in a mobile app which combined a currency wallet and trusted peer-to-peer marketplace.The community generated hundreds of transactions every day for years, with millions of dollars-worth of value changing hands, including jewelry, apparel, household and children’s goods and lifestyle services.Over time, as other currencies were issued in neighboring communities, it became clear that being able to exchange these stores of value for each other would give them even greater usage, as new products and services would be available in other networks beyond yours.Many local businesses were eager to offer their products for their customers’ community currencies, which would further enhance product selection, but their inability to liquidate these back to national money was a barrier.Even though these currencies were creating value for users, they were too small to achieve the trade volume needed for liquidity.This is the main reason we haven’t yet seen the user-generated-currency inflection point. Combined with the technical difficulty still involved in the creation of a cryptocurrency, what you see today are early adopters limited to crypto startups with deep development expertise and a business strategy for liquidity.When technical barriers are lowered and the liquidity problem is solved, the emergence of the user-generated-currency long tail may end up being the greatest long tail in internet history.Its combined volume won’t represent the profit or traffic of its enabler (such as YouTube’s ownership of the video long-tail) but rather the collective abundance, as measured by the velocities and market caps of these currencies, accruing directly to their users.This access to diverse capital may usher in a more even distribution curve of wealth in society. And we will measure that wealth not only in dollars or euros, or even bitcoins, but in the transfer of goods and services within each network and community, unconstrained by structural monetary inefficiencies.Sugar candy image via Shutterstock"

various times, he now looks back at what he could have made if only he ...","May 11, 2017 at 10:00 UTC",It’s been a long road for Dave Carlson.,"One of the world’s more recognizable bitcoin miners, Carlson gained global attention for his multimillion-dollar mining venture MegaBigPower during the bitcoin boom of 2014 only to almost lose the business when would-be franchise partners failed to come through on hardware purchases.Despite professing to own tens of thousands of bitcoins and litecoins at various times, he now looks back at what he could have made if only he waited to sell.“I worked for free for a year,” Carlson said. “Sometimes, that’s what you have to do to survive. People appealed to me to trust them and you get taken advantage of.”But Carlson now sees new opportunity in the booming market for initial coin offerings (ICOs), the process by which technologists are creating cryptographically unique data sets, linking them to a blockchain and selling them to investors as a fundraising tool.In this seemingly ever-expanding market, Carlson is launching a new venture. Called Giga Watt, the startup aims to fulfill Carlson’s long-time goal of democratizing access to bitcoin mining, this time by enabling investors to buy a stake in his company’s services.At a high level, the idea is that Giga Watt is tokenizing the power infrastructure that supports the facilities that host and operate equipment.“We’re building and reselling crypto-mines. If you want a big mine, you buy a lot of tokens. If don’t want to buy miners, then you let us put somebody else’s miners in your spot and get paid. You don’t have to concern yourself with how blockchains work,” Carlson explained.He told CoinDesk:“You can look at it as you’re acting as a power landlord, and people will pay to rent your power infrastructure.”In this way, the idea is the latest and perhaps one of the more ambitious attempts to capitalize on the access to capital provided by the ICO mechanism. Though, it’s important to note similar ventures so far have produced varying results for their initiators.For example, when bitcoin pioneer Charlie Shrem sought to tokenize shares in companies this year, the ICO was eventually scrapped after months of promotion. Others have fared better with the model, with startup Gnosis raising over $12m in just under 15 minutes by selling 5% of the tokens that will power its in-development prediction market.According to Carlson, Giga Watt has raised over $1m from undisclosed investors to build out the facilities that would be used as part of the initiative.Scheduled to open to the public on 2nd June, Carlson said that Giga Watt is already exploring a pre-sale (and a pre-pre-sale) of its token while building up his team to offer support.For Carlson, the idea is aimed at solving a long-standing conceptual issue for the bitcoin network – namely, that the economics that make bitcoins valuable have created economies of scale that made it impossible for smaller miners to compete for the rewards produced by the protocol.At the heart of the issue is that, many enthusiasts believe decentralized access to the network is the key differentiator of bitcoin when compared to the centralized online money services it was designed to compete against.In this way, Carlson sees Giga Watt as a managed services provider selling its professional abilities and the cheap power resources that make Washington state one of the more profitable areas of the world to operate equipment.Those who participate in the sale, Carlson said, will have funds placed in escrow until Giga Watt delivers on supplying the power infrastructure. Giga Watt will, in turn, invest the funds it makes into its own mining capabilities.“We would have facilities that are occupied for token holders, then we have facilities that are wholly owned by Giga Watt,” Carlson explained.For now, even Carlson is a bit unclear on how the economics of the model will play out.While the idea is to sell the tokens for $1 at launch, he conceded that it’s possible the market could drive up the price of the asset in such a way that the value could conflict with their utility. Already platforms like ethereum, designed itself to enable the launch of ICOs and other tokenized assets, are facing challenges related to this difficult dynamic.Still, Carlson said that this is simply a factor that the market will need to take into account as it participates in the offer.“People need to understand that our token is something that works best when it’s combined with mining or its buying into a co-location facility or a landlord of power,” he said.He further said that investors shouldn’t conceive of the token as an asset with boundless utility, or that the token would necessarily provide outsized returns directly.“I don’t want people to buy the token thinking it’s going to do the moon,” he said. “People are going to be willing to pay more than what we’re selling for, but it’s not a share ownership of a company.”Another factor to keep in mind is that token owners will be served with mining power in a first-come, first-serve manner, meaning those who buy earlier will have access to the token’s real-world utility, and the potential earnings from the mining operations.Carlson also stressed the legal work underpinning the offering, which is being issued by Giga Watt’s Singaporean entity. (It worked with US law firm Perkins Coie on the structure to ensure that the token wouldn’t be deemed a security.)Carlson said Giga Watt plans to sell 30 million tokens as part of the sale, and he remains confident that potential buyers will capitalize on the opportunity.“We can offer this to anyone. You can buy one token if that’s meaningful to you. A household could buy a few hundred dollars of tokens and buy more tokens later,” he said.For now, Carlson is launching a website to support Giga Watt, which lists its available plans and the costs associated with the purchase. (In a bid for transparency, the firm lets buyers schedule an open house to see the facilities).On display also are its planned ‘Giga Pod’ units: mining warehouses that Carlson said have been optimized for efficiency with the years of expertise gleaned in the operation of MegaBigPower, his former operation.Until the launch, though, he acknowledged that the market needs to now digest the deal and understand how it works. But he believes, if successful, it could be beneficial for the bitcoin network and investors at large.Carlson concluded:“I firmly feel that every household in America could have a small mining operation. It’s a vision and it’s possible. But, if the non-miner doesn’t understand what the opportunity is, that’s the hurdle.”Bitcoin mining image via Giga Watt"

This initiative was started in the 1990s as a way to attract overseas investor capital to projects in ostensibly needy areas.Yet the EB-5 program has come under fire in recent months amid accusations that it has become a vehicle for wealthy investors to effectively buy their way into the US and invest in projects – namely, luxury real estate – that are completely unrelated to the program’s intended goal. The program has even been targeted by members of Congress for elimination given the criticism.Family members of Trump administrator advisor Jared Kushner, who is President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, sparked controversy earlier this month after appearing to encourage Chinese citizens to invest in their developments via the EB-5 program – and curry favor with Trump in the process.The bitcoin connection: Recent statements from the head of the Immigrant Investor Visa Program office, Lori MacKenzie, suggest that investors may, in fact, be able to pay their obligations under the EB-5 guidelines using bitcoin.MacKenzie, who spoke on 3rd March during an EB-5 event in Washington, DC, said that Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS) is “considering issues involving virtual currency such as bitcoin” related to “the use of bitcoin to transfer investment funds to the new commercial enterprise”.She went on to say:“USCIS cannot provide blanket assurances regarding any particular form of transfer, but we will continue to evaluate evidence provided by petitioners to determine whether the relevant statutory and regulatory requirements have been met, including evidence that the funds invested belong to the petitioner, and were acquired, directly and indirectly, by lawful means.”Bottom line: So, what does this mean?For starters, blockchain is a topic that is on the US government’s radar, but whether it will result in a concrete policy shift or statement remains to be seen. A representative for CIS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Indeed, it’s a subject – at least somewhat – that has come in the past, led by questions of whether income derived from bitcoin-related activities can be used to satisfy the EB-5 requirements. The consensus appears to be that the government shouldn’t take issue with it, though as several experts remarked last year, the source of the funds would be a paramount issue.Then again, this could all be rendered moot should the EB-5 be abolished. At the same time, it’s not clear whether the Trump administration will move to axe the program.Green card image via Shutterstock"

During that time, trading of the BFX token was halted and all margin positions were liquidated.The move follows the August 2016 hack of the exchange, in which investors were given a 36% haircut to compensate for a hack that drained 120,000 BTC from the exchange’s reserves. The BFX tokens thus represented an equity obligation to return the 36% back to platform users sometime in the future.Notably, this isn’t the first internal BFX buyback orchestrated by Bitfinex, as the exchange purchased 1% of the tokens in September 2016.The $1 face value tokens had traded between $0.49 and $0.65 for most of 2016, surrounded by doubts that the exchange would never be able to recoup the nearly $72m in value lost following the security breach. That price increased to $0.89 by 1 March 2017 following a strong period of heavy trading volume in the cryptocurrency markets.The announcement posted on the company’s webpage expressed gratitude for the patience of the community and continued support.Bitfinex wrote:“We are tremendously grateful to all of our customers and new shareholders for helping us get to this point.”As of 21:00:00 UTC, CoinDesk has confirmed BFX tokens are being redeemed at the stated $1 face value.Image via Shutterstock"

Even this CoinDesk article is stored on a server controlled by a company that charges to hold this data should it be called upon.This setup has a number of conveniences, as these companies deploy teams of specialists to help store and secure this data, and remove the costs that come with hosting and uptime.But with this convenience, there is also vulnerability. As we’ve learned, a hacker or a government can gain unwelcome access to your files without your knowledge, by influencing or attacking a third-party service – meaning they can steal, leak or change important information.Brian Behlendorf, creator of the Apache Web Server, has gone so far as to label this centralized design the “original sin” of the Internet. Some like Behlendorf argue the Internet was always meant to be decentralized, and a splintered movement has sprung up around using new tools, including blockchain technology, to help achieve this goal.Ethereum is one of the newest technologies to join this movement.While bitcoin aims to disrupt PayPal and online banking, ethereum has the goal of using a blockchain to replace internet third parties — those that store data, transfer mortgages and keep track of complex financial instruments.In short, ethereum wants to be a ‘World Computer’ that would decentralize – and some would argue, democratize – the existing client-server model.With ethereum, servers and clouds are replaced by thousands of so-called “nodes” run by volunteers from across the globe (thus forming a “world computer”).The vision is that ethereum would enable this same functionality to people anywhere around the world, enabling them to compete to offer services on top of this infrastructure.Scrolling through a typical app store, for example, you’ll see a variety of colorful squares representing everything from banking to fitness to messaging apps. These apps rely on the company (or another third-party service) to store your credit card information, purchasing history and other personal data – somewhere, generally in servers controlled by third-parties.Your choice of apps is of course also governed by third parties, as Apple and Google maintain and curate (or in some cases, censor) the specific apps you’re able to download.Take the example of an online document service like Evernote or Google Docs.Ethereum, if all goes according to plan, would return control of the data in these types of services to its owner and the creative rights to its author.The idea is that one entity will no longer have control over your notes and that no one could suddenly ban the app itself, temporarily taking all of your notebooks offline. Only the user can make changes, not any other entity.In theory, it combines the control that people had over their information in the past with the easy-to-access information that we’re used to in the digital age. Each time you save edits, or add or delete notes, every node on the network makes the change.It’s worth noting that the idea has been met with skepticism.Although the apps appear to be possible, it’s unclear which blockchain applications will actually prove useful, secure, or scalable, and if they will ever be as convenient to use as the apps we use today.Authored by Alyssa Hertig; Images by Maria Kuznetsov"

codes, trade on exchanges or buy and sell their bitcoins via bitcoin ...","Apr 28, 2017 at 11:30 UTC","Andrew ‘Drew’ Hinkes is counsel at Berger Singerman LLP, a business law firm in Florida. Hinkes represents companies and entrepreneurs in state and federal commercial litigation matters, representation of court-appointed fiduciaries and electronic discovery issues.","In this opinion piece, Hinkes looks at the potential impact of the recent court decision in Florida that centered in part on the definitions of both bitcoin and money transmission.
Florida’s legislature is considering a bill that would add “virtual currency” to the definition of “monetary instruments” covered within its anti-money laundering (AML) statute.This proposed revision seems to be a direct reaction to the dismissal order in State vs Espinoza (which remains on appeal), and that would close a loophole in Florida’s money transfer statute.But, however ominous it may sound, this change would only impact a fraction of virtual currency activities, so the new definition is likely to have a minor impact on its use in Florida.One of the key innovations of bitcoin and other virtual currencies is the ability to transact pseudonymously. Most virtual currency transactions do not require the transacting parties to know each other, meet face-to-face or directly interact to exchange value. Most often, virtual currency users transact across the internet, through QR codes, trade on exchanges or buy and sell their bitcoins via bitcoin ATMs.For the purposes of this law, the lack of direct communication between parties is critical, and demonstrates the narrow impact of the proposed legislation.Florida’s Money Laundering Statute, based upon a similar federal statute (18 U.S.C. §1956 1998) covers nine different behaviors.First, it punishes “transactions” wherein a person, “knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity,” conducts or attempts to conduct such a “financial transaction” which in fact involves the proceeds of “specified unlawful activity” either:Florida’s statute also covers “transportation” type of infractions including where any person transports or attempts to transport a monetary instrument or funds:Florida’s statute also covers financial transactions which “involve property or proceeds which an investigative or law enforcement officer, or someone acting under such officer’s direction, represents as being derived from, or as being used to conduct or facilitate, specified unlawful activity,” when the person’s conduct or attempted conduct is undertaken with the intent:Any charge brought under this statute requires that the party charged with its violation have intent and/or actual knowledge.Espinoza was charged with violating §896.101(3)(c), Fla. Stat., (relating to law enforcement officers), and (5)(a) and (b) (discussing the appropriate punishment for the violation based upon the amount of value at issue).The court dismissed that charge against Espinoza based upon three separate defects:Although the bill may clarify that virtual currency now qualifies as a monetary instrument, the other two issues identified by Judge Pooler in the Espinoza opinion remain unaddressed by this bill.Because money laundering charges under ch. 896, require that at least one of the two parties to the transaction have knowledge and or intent, and a charge must be supported by evidence of that intent and or knowledge, most virtual currency transactions will still not factually qualify for prosecution under this law.While there may be greater risk to users of virtual currency who actually interact personally with others, or have actual knowledge of the motives to exchange value, the proposed statutory change will probably not affect most virtual currency users.Florida state image via Shutterstock"

Meanwhile, smart contracts platform ethereum is drawing increasingly more attention.","But what if you could combine those two networks and come up with the best of both worlds? That is what blockchain startup RSK Labs has long sought to do.The company’s blockchain solution, RSK (or Rootstock), aims to draw on the strengths of the bitcoin network, while bringing new options, like flexible smart contracts, into the picture.A little more than a year ago, the Buenos Aires-based company received $1m in seed funding to create a functioning testnet. But, to move forward with its technical plans, more cash was needed.To that end, RSK Labs announced today at Consensus 2017, that it has received an additional $3.5m in pre-Series A funding.This latest round comes in the form of contributions from a long list of supporters, including, Anthony Di Iorio, CEO of Decentral and Jaxx, and bitcoin mining firms such as Bitfury and Bitmain.According to RSK executives, the company plans to put that money toward R&D, increasing the network’s security and deploying a mainnet in a few months. Also during Consensus, the company announced that it will be opening its production testnet (called Ginger) to the public, so that more users can begin building and testing out their own smart contracts on the platform.Gabriel Kurman, co-founder of RSK, told CoinDesk:“More than 40 companies are currently testing Ginger, including banks, corporations and startups from all around the world. But once we open the code to the world, we expect hundreds of companies – and partners – to start testing the platform, which, until now, was closed.”At this point, you’re probably wondering how the platform works.Put simply, RSK is a two-way pegged sidechain that grafts smart contract functionality onto the bitcoin network. It also introduces an off-chain protocol for claimed “near-instant” payments.As an idea, sidechains were originally put forth in a proposal by cryptographer and Blockstream CEO Adam Back and others in 2014 as a bid to extend the functions of bitcoin.That proposal came at a time when many were frustrated with bitcoin’s inability to keep up with newer innovations.So, as a sidechain, RSK is an independent blockchain. However, it does not have its own token, relying instead on bitcoin for its currency.RSK does this by pegging, or matching, its smart token to bitcoin, so that the value of an RSK token is exactly that of a bitcoin. Also, users (and this is the ‘two-way’ part) can freely move their tokens back and forth between the two chains.Essentially, a user’s bitcoin goes into a type of reserve where it is locked up, and then used to back the RSK token, known as smartBTC. You can think of it as putting your bitcoin into a checking account, and then using the RSK network to spend that money.But RSK goes further than simply giving users a new set of tokens to spend – it also adds smart contract capabilities to bitcoin.Bitcoin already allows users to create simple smart contracts, like multisig, which requires two or more users to sign off on a payment before it can be released. But RSK takes that to another level, with Turing-complete smart contract capabilities that go head-to-head with ethereum’s offerings.RSK also addresses another short coming of the bitcoin network: its ability to scale.According to the company’s website, RSK currently achieves 400 payment transactions per second, compared to bitcoin, which only handles only around seven.However, the goal is to eventually push that to 2,000 transactions per second using a second layer technology, which the company calls Lumino. Outlined in this white paper, the Lumino Network is an off-chain payment system that relies a protocol known as the Lumino Transaction Compression Protocol (LTCP).Lumino is touted as being similar to the Lightning Network, a popular scaling solution originally designed for bitcoin, currently being tested on litecoin.Moving forward, the company faces two main challenges.One is how it will peg its token to the bitcoin blockchain. Tether, another sidechain company, made news earlier this year when it lost its peg to the US dollar, creating a large price spread between exchanges that quote actual dollars and those that quote tether tokens.So, RSK will need to prove to the community that it can hold onto its peg and not undermine the value of its token.Securing the network is another issue.In order for the RSK chain to be secure, a majority of bitcoin miners need to ‘merge mine’ the chain. And that requires the permission and active assistance of 50% of all the bitcoin mining pools.Merge mining is a technology that allows a miner to mine more than one blockchain at a time. The miner’s computing power contributes to the total hashrate of both cryptocurrencies, and the miner gains block rewards for both networks.According to RSK, its network is currently supported by bitcoin miners representing more than 55% of bitcoin’s total hashing power. In addition, the company claims that more miners, accounting for 30% of the hashrate, have expressed their support for RSK and will start merge mining within the next few months.If RSK can overcome those challenges, it stands to introduce some much-needed features to bitcoin, as well as help build a worthy alternative to the ethereum virtual machine.Disclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in RSK Labs.RSK image via YouTube"

Still in its ...","May 17, 2017 at 12:40 UTC",A think tank that advises several US government agencies is now exploring the potential threats bitcoin poses to national security.,"Still in its earliest phases, the research is being headed by the director of analysis at the Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance in Washington, DC, and crafted to gather data on how state actors might currently use bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions.Contrary to some inflammatory calls to ban bitcoin, however, the research, being conducted by Yaya J Fanusie of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, is looking as much at how blockchain can help prevent illicit activity as how it can enable it.After spending seven years as both an economic and counter-terrorism analyst in the CIA, Fanusie told CoinDesk:“What is needed is a more informed discussion about what the implications may be, because there’s so much defensiveness – there’s defensiveness on both sides, and I think we should come a little bit to the center, point out potential threats, but also point out benefits it has.”The Foundation for the Defense of Democracies is a non-profit organization founded in 2001 to advise members of Congress, federal agencies, the US Treasury Department and other agencies about how to prevent terrorism around the world.Fanusie was hired in 2015, at which point he first began looking into the potential national security threats resulting from bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. At the time, he was skeptical that the mostly unverifiable claims were true. But when he discovered a known terrorist organization using Twitter to raise money for weapons, he intensified his research.Then last month, CoinDesk reported that the Swedish government had incorporated a venture capital firm that would begin investing in Iran using the payment method.By using bitcoin to incorporate in Sweden which, along with the rest of Europe, has a more relaxed policy on sanctions against Iran, the startup, Brave New World Investments, is helping pave the way for what could end up being a legal way for some to circumvent US sanctions.But, according to Fanusie, the potential threat should not be exaggerated. “Bitcoin by itself is not going to compensate for all the outlets that are cut off,” he said, adding:“It’s not going to be the big loophole that is going to allow billions of dollars to be funneled to the Iranian regime.”Similarly, Fanusie sought to temper the escalating concerns being circulated in the media about bitcoin being used as part of the ‘WannaCry’ ransomware attacks, in which an estimated 200,000 victims were asked to pay bitcoin to regain access to encrypted computer files.Instead of focusing on the potential threat that bitcoin might pose, Fanusie said the hacks are more evidence of how bitcoin enables “transactions which financial authorities can’t interdict”.“This is not illicit in itself,” said Fanusie. “It’s just a more recent and increasingly more common way of transacting that serves anyone looking for alternative payment methods.”In the future, he said that cyber forensics investigations into more traditional online crime will likely need to happen “in tandem” with investigations of blockchain itself.Fanusie said:“The lesson here is that those concerned about illicit finance need to be familiar with these cryptocurrencies, not to fear this technology, but to work in what is an increasingly digital and cyber world.”In its infancy, blockchain technology, which makes middlemen less necessary (or not necessary at all), was developed out of “desire for freedom” according to Fanusie. “A desire for more of a democratic way of transacting or interacting.”While potential threats to national security – such as the raising of funds for terrorism, the circumventing of sanctions and the ransoming of vital infrastructure – remain worth researching, Fanusie also emphasized the need to learn more about its benefits as well.He mentioned the growing prevalence of cryptocurrency exchanges conducting know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) due diligence as evidence of how products built with blockchain can help remove the need for middlemen while still adhereing to international protections.He also cited the increased exploration of blockchain by supply-chain infrastructure providers as a possible way to prevent trade-based money laundering, where the price of imported goods is increased or lowered to effectively send money or charge fees for illicit activities.“It should be more difficult to traffic in weapons, or in drugs or doing money laundering, to funnel more money to a cause which could be used for a terrorist group,” said Fanusie.In the fallout surrounding the WannaCry ransom attacks, a number of formal studies have been revealed.Just this week, an effort by the US Congress to better understand potential links between cryptocurrencies and terrorism, and a new partnership between the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, have both been announced.As for Fanusie, in addition to better understanding what it might mean if cryptocurrency usage were to spike in Iran, he says he wants to learn more about other usage patterns – for example, in China and in other nations and cities around the world – and how central banks might implement various blockchain solutions.He concluded:“We should be really thinking, from a US perspective, what it means if the US is behind? If policy makers don’t understand it. What does it mean for strategic national security interests? I’m not even answering the question. I’m posing the question.”Pentagon image via Shutterstock"

Markets. May 23, 2017 at 14:07 UTC Updated May 24, 2017 at 18:22 UTC.","May 23, 2017 at 14:07 UTC",The CEO of one of the largest private companies in the US is in love.,"At Consensus 2017 today, Abigail Johnson, chair and CEO of Fidelity Investments, went public with her enthusiasm for blockchain technology, bitcoin, ethereum and what the future holds for both open-source, public blockchains and more private alternatives.In her talk, Johnson discussed the “future scenario” where blockchain technologies have thrived, remarking that she thinks this has a “reasonable chance” of coming to pass despite the relative newness of the technology.Elsewhere, she argued how collaboration is needed to overcome this unfamiliarity with the technology and help it reach its “full potential”.“This transformation could complement lots of other innovative areas that we see emerging – including the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. These platforms shouldn’t develop in a vacuum,” she said.Johnson went on to tell attendees:“Part of the reason I am here is to ask this community to help us address some of the hurdles that we see. And there are several that are holding back the adoption of this technology. We want to get after these hurdles – but we can’t do this alone – we need to work together.”Johnson also revealed information about her company’s partners on its journey, naming blockchain startup Axoni, investment firm Boost VC and university initiatives based out of MIT, University College London and Cornell.To date, Johnson explained that Fidelity Labs, its internal R&D division has also set up experiments for bitcoin micropayments and even run bitcoin and ethereum mining operations in the spirit of learning more about the technology.Further, she revealed that Fidelity will be taking some conservative steps to expose Fidelity’s customers more to the industry, announcing that customers will soon be able to see Coinbase holdings on Fidelity.com. Already, she said, this feature is available to employees who own digital currencies available through the startup’s services.Speaking to this coming together of both existing finance and startups, Johnson said:“The internet wasn’t just a more efficient way to send letters – it spawned new industries. Blockchain technology isn’t just a more efficient way to settle securities – it will fundamentally change market structures – and maybe even the architecture of the internet itself.”Johnson further detailed Fidelity’s research strategy for blockchain, noting the education difficulties that have thus far made adoption difficult.She said that, at this stage, most potential users attempt to compare it to older technologies, or they simply never adopt due to the time and patience it takes to master new concepts such as having passwords for money.“Some users treated the recovery phrase like a password. They also expected to be able to click a ‘Forgot My Password’ button if they ever lost it – definitely not the ideal mental model,” she said.Johnson also spoke to the larger ideological changes that have happened as the world has begun to better understand open, public blockchain technology, and how that is reshaping how industries are seeking to apply it to business models.“If you are looking for bitcoin to beat Visa at the point-of-sale today, you are going to be disappointed,” she remarked.Johnson’s talk also covered other problems in how blockchain technology is being applied in the enterprise – specifically, regulation, scalability and privacy.“Regulators will go through the same growing pains. And, in order for this technology to reach its true potential, we need solutions that protect customer interests,” she said.Notably, Johnson also addressed that her passion for open-source blockchain technologies is also hitting governance roadblocks that limit their utility for enterprises.“Companies that build products on these platforms don’t have clarity about the future path they might take – or how to influence these communities,” she said.Still, she cautioned that the traditional financial world – despite its consortiums – hasn’t quite figured it out either, remarking:“Control is also an issue for private networks. The financial services industry will need to work to understand the risks associated with who controls key features of these systems.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase and Axoni. Image via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk"

Minutes before press time, bitcoin’s new all-time high on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index was $1,710.96.As reported by CoinDesk, the uptick comes at a time when broader interest in the crypto markets appears to be increasing and winning new investors. While bitcoin is up 70%, alternative cryptocurrencies are up 600% since March.The recent price rise, however, puts bitcoin at a level that analysts have suggested could prove a key resistance.CoinDesk contributor Willy Woo, for instance, projected late last week that bitcoin was likely to hit so-called ‘channel resistance’ at $1,717. Should it break this level, Woo projected a bubble could form in the market, whereby the price had increased meaningfully beyond annual average user growth.The development could place the wider cryptocurrency markets on uncertain ground, as analysts are already expressing concerns crypto assets have entered bubble territory.Still, others pushed back that this applies to bitcoin, an asset seen as having more long-term utility and value.Andrea Medri, founder and CFO of bitcoin exchange The Rock Trading, said:“I’m not worried about bitcoin … most likely we will see a correction, but the long-term trend has been and will be always up.”Skateboarding image via Shutterstock"

2011 recalls. Lombrozo was not alone in that thinking. Andresen's ...","May 19, 2017 at 11:00 UTC",You could almost see a baffled ‘WTF’ come across Eric Lombrozo’s face as he watched Gavin Andresen at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2016 conference.,"The man many people saw as the leader of the bitcoin community, or at least a kind of elder statesman, Andresen had just affirmed that he was standing behind Craig Wright’s claim that he was the cryptocurrency’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto.“It was a very bizarre moment,” Lombrozo, a Bitcoin Core developer since 2011 recalls. Lombrozo was not alone in that thinking. Andresen’s announcement onstage was a bombshell that caused a commotion for the rest of the event with both community members and reporters, most of whom had dreamt about uncovering that story for years.But that confirmation would never come. Namely, because the overwhelming consensus from the technical community was, as Lombrozo put it: “There is absolutely no way he’s Satoshi.”For Andresen – a man so well-liked, so looked-up to, yet so resistant to his leadership role within the bitcoin community – to make this rash assumption in public with everyone watching, seemed curious, if not embarrassing.As interviews reveal, however, it had deeper effects.What might seem like a harmless comment to some would do much to shake perceptions of Andresen among the very group of people he was supposedly leading.Just like the cryptocurrency itself, Andresen found himself in the spotlight nearly overnight, at least as it relates to any mainstream celebrity status.Graduating from Princeton with a computer science degree in 1988, he developed software for a number of companies before landing on a full-time role working on bitcoin alongside Satoshi Nakamoto in December 2010. Before this, though, he focused his career on 3D graphics and virtual reality modeling.From there, he dedicated his life to advancing public perception of bitcoin (at various points explaining it to the CIA and giving out by today’s value thousands of dollars in bitcoin via a public website).Andresen proved effective in enlisting other developers in working on the open-source software protocol. Then, around early October 2013, the price per bitcoin started rising pretty quickly, from $133 on the first to more than $1,200 two months later.There were glowing articles about his involvement, and as the industry grew from a swelling of investment in 2013 and 2014, he took positions as an advisor at key companies and a full-time position at the Bitcoin Foundation, the nascent industry’s once-prominent advocacy group.Andresen as the face – at least the unmasked face – of bitcoin became a minor celebrity. And everyone wanted to know the backstory.The persistent narrative that came from these inquiries was that, when Satoshi Nakamoto left the project, he happily handed the work over to Andresen.But Lombrozo, and other developers, think the tale is a bit embellished. Sure, he said, Andresen deserves credit for bringing cryptographers and developers together to build the project, but Satoshi didn’t really hand over the reins, he/she/they/it simply disappeared, they say.The more romantic version of the story gave Andresen even more clout.As more developers began working on the code and more venture-backed startups began building applications for the protocol emerged, Andresen still had a significant amount of influence over the path of the world’s first decentralized cryptocurrency.In an article titled, “The Man Who Really Built Bitcoin” from August 2014, MIT Technology Review conceded that, although there was infighting about the best way to scale the bitcoin protocol to handle more than seven transactions a second, “One way or another, whatever Andresen decides on will probably get done.”Yet, as a decentralized, open-source project, many developers who joined bitcoin perhaps weren’t predisposed to such notions of hierarchy.As it may be, one of the most misunderstood aspects of bitcoin is what a massive technical project it is, one that involves collaboration from a large group of interested parties and near-constant mundane tasks like code de-bugging. And as an outgrowth of the scaling debate, bitcoin has even come to encompass differing developer groups, working on competing implementations of the code.A developer like Peter Todd may specialize in asking hard questions about other developers’ ideas (trolling for the sake of improving ideas), while others like Matt Corallo specialize in training new developers. (Although these are far from something like traditional formal jobs.)Further, Bitcoin Unlimited, a rival group of developers, is able to work on wholly different fixes that aim to make changes to the network.As the lead maintainer for the project, Andresen played a key role in facilitating this work in bitcoin’s early days. Today, development is overseen by Wladimir van der Laan (employed by MIT), but startups Chaincode Labs is the largest single supporter of Bitcoin Core development. MIT employs two full-time developers, while Blockstream supports Pieter Wuille and Greg Maxwell.Some members of Core don’t have any relationship to a startup or company, others do. Yet, they’re all united by an active, and public, mailing list that serves as the basis for formal discussion on project ideas.It’s perhaps a clash of cultures then that came to a head the day Andresen took the stage at the Marriott Marquis in New York and vouched for Wright. Not a week later, Andresen’s ability to make changes to code had been revoked.Behind the scenes, Andresen and the other developers had also started butting heads about other things.Wladimir van der Laan, Bitcoin Core’s lead developer and maintainer, told CoinDesk, that even before Andresen turned the position over to him, he had been doing most of the “maintainer tasks”.His statements, and those of others, paint a portrait of someone increasingly divorced from the day-to-day efforts that kept the project up and running 24/7.“Not only was [Andresen] not writing code, he wasn’t discussing on the developer IRC nor on GitHub, nor reviewing code,” Van der Laan said. While internally, Andresen had passed his leadership role onto Van der Laan, externally, Lombrozo said: “[H]e still paraded himself around as the leader, as someone that had control.”And this is where things really went sour.How Andresen saw his influence within the Core developer community was evident during a 2015 CoinScrum event in London, where Mike Hearn, a former Core contributor, and Andresen spoke about the continuing block size contention.“A lot of people are pushing me to be more of a dictator,” Andresen said, as Hearn took a swig of a beer and pointed at himself. There was discussion then from an audience member about calling his role something other than “dictator”, such as “traffic cop” or “decision maker”. Andresen suggested “ice breaker”.Then Andresen continued:“That may be what has to happen with the block size, frankly. I may just have to throw my weight around and say, ‘This is the way it’s going to be. And if you don’t like it, find another project.'”This authoritarian statement seemed strange to participants in a community building a decentralized protocol that’s always touted its imperviousness to control by any one person, group of people or state.According to Lombrozo, this event was only a month before Andresen started pushing for bigger blocks on his blog. And shortly after, when Corallo saw the posts, he brought it to the attention of the Core mailing list.After Corallo’s post, Pieter Wuille, a Core developer since 2011 and co-founder of Blockstream, penned a response in support of increasing the block size, but wary about using Andresen’s proposed method and hard forks.According to Lombrozo, Andresen was talking to bitcoin companies such as Coinbase, BitPay, Blockchain and Xapo, selling them a solution to the block size limitation that hadn’t gone through any peer review. Yet, to those participating in bitcoin development, there were channels of communication where such fixes were supposed to be brought up.Bryan Bishop, a Core developer since 2014, said the Core team had sent Andresen multiple requests “asking him to voluntarily step down from (mis)representing Bitcoin Core to the wider community”.“The fact that he went around the whole system, and people thought he was trying to circumvent peer review; that upset everyone,” Lombrozo said. “It wasn’t the block size thing really.”Although, it also kind of was. Because Andresen’s plan for increasing the block size was met with resistance by the other Bitcoin Core developers.According to Lombrozo, that’s because there were technical concerns with his proposal, but Andresen was not willing to listen. Instead, Andresen went back to those companies he had spoken with and told them the fix was simple but Core wasn’t interested in helping.“The problem was that he was misrepresenting himself as having some sort of special privilege in bitcoin development – but really anybody can show up and propose anything,” Bishop said.Obviously, this caused tension. Not only that, but also there’s the perception, which still remains a point of contention today, that the Core development team is stubborn and uninterested in helping bitcoin businesses and in turn extending bitcoin to more and more consumers around the world. (It’s even perhaps an outgrowth of the feud that bitcoin developers are even bundled into differing groups – Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Classic – at all.)Andresen created this “expectation that a quick fix was there and that’s been a huge point of frustration,” Lombrozo said.According to Lombrozo, no one knew how pervasive Andresen’s involvement was with advising startups and at least he thought most bitcoin companies had executives following Core communication channels for updates.“To be honest, it caught me a little by surprise,” he said. “Although, in hindsight it’s obvious, there were tons of flags everywhere.”Bishop seconded that:“Alarm bells were already ringing by the time Andresen began to use blog posts and social media to bypass peer review.”The blog Bishop mentioned was Andresen’s own, where he sometimes conveniently skirted issues the Bitcoin Core mailing list was discussing. This, something most people would find aggravating, though, Bishop analyzed more pragmatically.“Security work requires very careful review and analysis,” he said. “When you bypass peer review, you’re going to miss a lot of bugs and incompatibilities.”Could money have been involved as some in the community have suggested? Andresen was getting paid by the Bitcoin Foundation and held advisory roles at startups.“I don’t know [Andresen’s] main motivation but he was trying to make a career out of advising companies in the bitcoin space,” said Lombrozo. “And he was sort of telling them what they wanted to hear, that scaling was possible and easy, because why tell them it was going to take a long time and be complicated, right?”He continued: “And that came back to bite him pretty hard.”According to Lombrozo, though, some Core developers and the group’s supporters took unpopular stances that the block size should never be raised, but that wasn’t the pervasive sentiment. Core had trouble abating that idea, though, since Andresen who had been the frontman for the corporates and public for some time had already passed the torch to a much less public Van der Laan.Not to mention, Lombrozo went on, explaining the issues was difficult in that it required an in-depth knowledge of the protocol to understand the trade-offs. Plus, he said, the way some Core developers and its supporters reacted was less than ideal, many times brash, if not stooping to the level of personal attacks. Especially on the Core team’s communication channels, which didn’t scale well as the community expanded rapidly.So off Andresen went, joining forces with Hearn, who’s now a developer at bank-focused blockchain consortium, R3, to push an alternative implementation called Bitcoin XT.“That was the beginning of the politicization,” lamented Lombrozo.Bishop agrees, saying, the narrative that ‘Core doesn’t listen’ is easily discounted by the fact that anyone can send any of the Core developers an email at any time.“The reason for the ‘Core doesn’t listen’ idea is because lots of people were too busy talking in secret with Andresen,” Bishop said. “And he didn’t really bridge the communication gap with the developers.”Although, Lombrozo doesn’t think Andresen intended for that politicization to turn into the big mess that it has today (Lombrozo is still cordial with Andresen), there’s no doubt the issue is one of the biggest on the table for the now eight-year-old digital currency protocol.While Andresen’s moves seem to have caused an unstoppable rift in the bitcoin community, some Core developers have reached out “to extend an olive branch”.“I would prefer him to be more aligned in working together with people,” said a Core developer that wanted to remain anonymous. “But realistically that’s probably not going to happen.”Andresen, the developer said, is still friendly, but there’s an awkwardness now and many Core developers hold grudges because of the perception that he betrayed, if not completely sold out, the team.And everything seemed to implode that summer day on the stage at Consensus.“I don’t know,” said Lombrozo, in response to inquiries about Andresen’s belief in Wright. “From what I’ve heard, Wright is a very charming, magician sort of guy. I haven’t met him myself, but I know others who have and they say he’s a really good con man.”According to folks in the bitcoin community, Wright invited Andresen, likely because Andresen had influence over the community, to London and convinced him he was Satoshi.For someone that’s spent years working on the bitcoin protocol, even interacting with a masked Satoshi during the early years, it seems odd that Andresen would fall for a scam. But Lombrozo suspects Andresen wasn’t complicit in any scam, but instead just got tricked.Van der Laan agrees, saying it was a “confidence scam” Andresen fell for.“That can happen, but even confronted with evidence he kept saying Wright was Satoshi,” he said. “For that reason we decided to remove him from the development team.”Van der Laan concluded:“He had become more of a risk to the project than a boon.”Since the Wright debacle, Andresen has been weirdly absent from bitcoin news.Via email, Andresen himself said, “I’ve been avoiding getting myself into any press lately, and that’s been going well so I’m going to keep doing that.”Although, in recent months he’s been tweeting more than usual about the block size debate. He’s also a co-signer of a still unreleased bitcoin scaling proposal being put forward by Digital Currency Group founder Barry Silbert.“He keeps repeating the ‘block size must increase’ line without being involved in any innovations that are happening,” said Van der Laan.In a follow-up email, Andresen did offer some confirmation on the blockchain-focused jobs he was last known to be working. He resigned, not only from the Bitcoin Foundation, but also MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative early in the year.R3’s Hearn said in an email, “The last time I talked to Gavin, he wanted to disconnect from the blockchain/cryptocurrency space and spend more time working with his local community.”Other than keeping an interested eye on the block size debate, though, Andresen was advising some cryptocurrency projects and involved in zcash to a certain extent, all while working on a stealth project.This stealth project people referenced might be the Random Sanity Project Andresen tweeted about at the beginning of this month. The project, perhaps owing to the continued debate about Andresen himself, was met with both praise and skepticism on Twitter and Reddit.Correction: An early version of this article stated that Blockstream was the largest supporter of core development.

In 12 short hours, the press embargo would lift, the news would jolt the financial world and GoCoin would be cemented in history alongside BitPay and Coinbase as the startups that ushered one of the world’s largest payment companies into cryptocurrencies.Yet, on the eve of that very announcement, our inclusion was far from certain.***When I founded GoCoin along with Brock Pierce in mid-2013, we discussed that we may be too late.BitPay had been offering payment services to online merchants for well over a year, touting they had signed up 10,000 merchants. Coinbase announced they had signed up the first major retailer, Overstock, to accept bitcoin.GoCoin had raised a modest seed round and was “heads down” in development while BitPay and Coinbase continued to one up each other with increasingly impressive announcements – Gyft, CheapAir, Virgin Galactic and Dell.It felt like every day GoCoin wasn’t live would mark another major merchant lost to BitPay or Coinbase.In response, I was putting intense pressure on the development team to compress the Go Live schedule. My system architect, Margot Ritcher, and lead developer, my nephew Kevin Beauregard, agreed we could cut a month out of the schedule if we compromised on the multi-blockchain, multi-coin design. The downside of taking the shortcut, would be a major software rewrite.As you will see later in the story, taking the extra time to keep the multi-blockchain design proved to be the right decision.***Finally, in December 2013, GoCoin announced that it was taking donations for the Boys and Girls Club of Santa Monica. We were finally in the race, and I ramped up my Series A fundraising efforts. With the price of bitcoin having gone from the $100 to over $1,000 in the previous months, booking VC meetings on Sand Hill Road was never easier.In early 2014, GoCoin firmly planted a flag on the cryptocurrency moon by announcing support for litecoin and dogecoin payments. The bitcoin purists lost their minds: “You are ruining bitcoin, altcoins are a joke!” On Reddit, people decreed: “You are scammers taking these scam coins!”Those were the nicest comments I can publish here.***While the GoCoin team learned to operate the business, I already had $2.5m committed of our $5m Series A funding with about $1m already in the bank.But our fundraising efforts came to a screeching halt when news broke that Mt Gox, the largest bitcoin exchange, had been the victim of a major heist where about 25% of all bitcoin in circulation had been stolen.The entire industry was in a state of shock and chaos, funding options instantly dried up and even those that had committed to our round never funded. My board decided, rather than fight the market, to just close our Series A, which together with the seed capital came to a skinny $1.5m.Despite the modest raise, GoCoin was still the best funded LA bitcoin startup at the time. We had negotiated a very favorable top floor lease overlooking Santa Monica’s Third Street Promenade.GoCoin also sublet space to fellow blockchain startups, developers, lawyers, accountants and provided space for meetups and the first bitcoin ATM in LA.We named the space ‘Bitropolis’.***In the months that followed, GoCoin gained steady traction with our strategy of supplementing bitcoin payments with other alternative digital currencies.In many cases, we convinced early adopters like CheapAir, KnCMiner and eGifter to add GoCoin so as to not “limit their customer to only bitcoin”. We also continued to shake things up by announcing Larry Flint’s Hustler brand as a high-profile merchant.By 22nd September, 2014, the GoCoin directors assembled in offices of embedded Bitropolis attorney Adam Ettinger. Perhaps more importantly than the impact the big announcement would have on financial institutions, we were  finally getting validation that our naysayers were wrong.Bitcoin is not “only used by drug dealers”, “a Ponzi scheme” or a “joke”!Why the emergency meeting? On the eve of the announcement, an email with the heart-stopping subject line “GoCoin AML Compliance” hit my inbox.At the 11th hour, they are requesting a “full assessment” from our attorney and we had to decide how to respond.***The questions were flying around the room, did one of our competitor’s investors pull some strings to knock us out? By “full assessment”, did they want a legal opinion? Were they looking for an excuse to dismiss us? Was this simply a routine checklist and a box remained unchecked?In the previous months, GoCoin had stealthily worked with engineers, business development, marketing, PR and, of course, the legal department of PayPal. The technical hoops to integrate GoCoin’s payment platform into PayPal’s PaymentHub were trivial compared to the due diligence process.We had a full legal opinion from a top Isle of Man law firm. They reviewed our compliance program extensively, requesting we tighten up aspects of our on-boarding procedures and add payment monitoring features. Most importantly, we had to satisfy their legal team that our compliance program was not only solid, but that we were continuing to improve it.Even with that, BitPay had raised $30m from Index Ventures and Coinbase $25m from A16z. It would not have been surprising for PayPal to toss out our small scrappy undercapitalized startup.At 9pm, our attorney sent a carefully worded “assessment”, but certainly well short of a legal opinion. The response came back from PayPal: “Thanks. That’s all we needed.”On the morning of 23rd September, PayPal announced it would begin accepting bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin payments via GoCoin, and bitcoin payments via Coinbase and BitPay. Within minutes, the price of all three coins spiked.Reddit was buzzing, and thanks to the superb strategy of my PR goddess Amanda Coolong, my phone was ringing off the hook with reporters asking about the GoCoin deal with PayPal.History was made.***Yet, soon after signing this milestone agreement, parent company eBay announced they were spinning off PayPal. As a result, PayPal’s blockchain ambitions were pushed to the back-burner.As I reflect on it, in terms of mainstream merchant adoption for online payments, I would have to say late 2014 to early 2015 was the first big peak. At the time, GoCoin was signing up about 750 merchants per month, including top brands like MovieTickets.com, Lionsgate Films and Re/MAX.Even though many of the merchants didn’t get the volume of transactions they had hoped for, their brands were now regarded as innovators.Bitcoin exchanges and merchant processors were the bitcoin 1.0 trailblazers that brought bitcoin out of the shadows of the dark web and started to lift the reputational stain left by Silk Road.After four years at the helm, I have stepped down as CEO of GoCoin, yet I remain on the board of the parent company. GoCoin has been profitable for nearly two years now, and I still believe there is a bright future for the company and blockchain merchant payments. That said, the industry needs to mature in order to see the kind of growth we envisioned back in 2014, and I feel I can affect more change outside of GoCoin than I can from within.Recently, I join the Bloq team founded by Matt Roszak and former Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik. I’ve always had tremendous respect for both, and I’m thrilled they have welcomed me in as a partner.My thesis for merchant payments is that the largest and most successful companies will likely implement their own payment systems.PayPal image via Shutterstock"

One of the largest makers of ASIC chips specialized for mining, the firm’s diversification follows competitor Bitfury’s transition into software services and pursuits centered on enterprise blockchain offerings.For Canaan, however, the funding will serve as a means to facilitate the exploration of computing chips for use in artificial intelligence (AI) applications, and potentially, into hardware solutions for alternative cryptocurrencies that require different chips to optimize the mining process.Spokesperson Steven Mosher told CoinDesk:“We are also looking at other currencies and other places where we can apply that capital. We can apply it to big data, we can apply it in AI or in IoT.”According to Mosher, the company believes AI will provide the most fertile ground for the Canaan’s expansion, and he projected that the returns could be “as good as” the company’s earnings from mining chip sales. Further, he suggested that given the interest in intersections between the two industries there could be “synergy down the road”.Mosher also hinted at other products aimed at alternative cryptocurrencies.“We have new products in the pipeline both on the proof-of-work side of things, and also around the whole blockchain ecosystem,” he said.Such diversification is not uncommon these days, as many mining pools, for example, offer software that enables mining computers to coordinate in the race to secure various blockchains and compete for their rewards.However, it’s notable that the shift comes during a time when the alternative cryptocurrency markets have emerged as one of the more active areas of ecosystem growth.So far in 2017, the combined value of all public cryptocurrencies, bitcoin included, has swelled 180%, rising to $51bn from roughly $18bn at the start of the year, according to data provider Coinmarketcap. If that sounds high, however, the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies excluding bitcoin has seen even more robust growth.The value of these assets, including popular alternatives like litecoin and ether has risen to $22bn, up from just over $2bn at the end of 2016.Mosher, however, stopped short of characterizing the strategy as one that means the company is diversifying away from bitcoin. In part, Mosher said this is because there is a natural upward bound on how much mining firms can make in the bitcoin ecosystem alone.As an example, he cited the fact that mining chip producers have to strike a tricky balance between hardware sales and deploying those chips themselves in data centers for the purposes of securing the bitcoin blockchain.“If you create more hashing power, you’re competing against the other side of your business,” he explained. “You’re making money from your customers, but you’re hurting [your] mining operation [by raising bitcoin’s difficulty calculations].”Canaan, for its part, only makes chips and doesn’t use them in mining data centers, as do competitors Bitfury and Bitmain.Mosher said he expects more bitcoin miners to follow this path due to the fact that the business is lucrative enough to fund other efforts. (A study by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, for instance, projected that more than $2bn has been earned from mining since the network began running in 2008).“We’re all making money on the main chain and the question is, what are we doing with that money?” Mosher said. “Blockchain has been so good, such a great opportunity, and it throws off a good amount of cash, it’s about staying strong and robust.”The funding also follows a time of transition for the company, which was nearly acquired by electrical equipment maker Shandong Luyitong Intelligent Electric in 2016 in what would have been the industry’s largest-ever acquisition if completed.At the time, Shandong Luyitong was said to have offered ¥3.06bn to acquire 100% ownership of the firm in a move that would have made the combined entity a publicly traded company. The sale was ultimately blocked in September of that year by the Shenzhen Stock Exchange due to “uncertainties”, though not ones that reportedly stemmed from its bitcoin activities.In statements, Mosher still described the Series A as a “pre-IPO” round, though he stopped short of providing any further details.If pursued, Canaan would be one of the first bitcoin startups to IPO in the traditional market, a strategy that was also put forward by Bitfury CEO Valery Vavilov in 2014.Image courtesy of Canaan"

For banks, often the associated risks are deemed higher than the potential rewards when considering new clients that operate in the bitcoin space – an often-cited stumbling block in the industry.“The banks that are working with bitcoin companies really don’t have much visibility into how effective they are at handling the risk associated with bitcoin transactions,” said James Smith, Elliptic’s CEO.Smith told CoinDesk:“Until now, they pretty much have had to rely on the word of the exchange or whoever [processed the transaction] to say ‘We’re doing the best we can.'”Elliptic’s software allows financial institutions to take a more robust approach in vetting bitcoin businesses and complying with know-your-customer (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML) and Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requirements.The platform will help banks find suspicious bitcoin activity, allowing them to reduce risk assessment costs for current and potential customers, while demonstrating to regulators that there are internal safeguards in place to weed out bad actors.“We see this as a great step forward in terms of raising the industry standard, in terms of compliance, improving the level of risk mitigation and, ultimately, allowing Silvergate to work with more businesses who are handling bitcoin,” said Smith.While beneficial in this regard, Silvergate is already one of the exceptions to the rule in the banking world when it comes to bitcoin. The bank currently provides services to more than 30 bitcoin-related companies, including digital currency exchanges, institutional investors, miners and software developers.Still, those involved in the project argue better visibility will in turn aid banks as the regulatory environment moves to one where banks are now responsible for their customer’s customers as well.Plus, Silvergate and Elliptic argue that the platform will allow financial institutions to better assess when their customers’ internal controls may be suspect.“What we’re looking for is to see how a client is performing over time as an indication of whether their internal control environment is getting stronger,” said Ben Reynolds, vice president of business development and digital banking at Silvergate.Similar to Elliptic’s other anti-money laundering products, the platform screens each blockchain transaction for potential linkages to suspicious activity and then issues each with a risk score.While efforts to separate the allegedly ‘good’ bitcoin users from the ‘bad’ ones have been met with pushback from certain factions of the bitcoin community, Elliptic and Silvergate emphasize that the goal is not to micromanage clients, but rather to understand holistically what clients are doing to filter out eyebrow-raising activity.“What they want to know is – at a high level – what percentage of transactions going through this business are suspicious? How has that changed over time? Does it look like they are improving their controls?” said Smith.The bottom line, Reynolds said, is that the software will soften Silvergate’s overall risk management overhead. “For us, each client that we take on initially is a pretty large investment in terms of the due diligence process that we go through,” he said.Reynolds went on to explain that while Silvergate has no regulatory obligation to enact such a program, it’s being proactive to advance the legitimacy, credibility and sustainability of the bitcoin industry and pushback on negative stereotypes.Smith concluded:“With this extra visibility, they’re able to understand how effective these companies are at handling risk and therefore get more comfortable with the idea of banking them.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Elliptic.Silvergate Bank image via La Jolla Center"

And this only seems to have gotten worse.In the US, at the center of financial and political power, the populace has been trapped by a corporate sponsored political charade, with a rigged presidential primary and the election of what many felt was the lesser of two evils. More and more, people are beginning to wake up to the broken promises and failed policies of their leaders, creating conflicts and instability in regions around the world.Media echo chamber lies of “weapons of mass destruction” that led to the Iraq War are now being repeated with the recent US cruise-missile strike on Syria.Meanwhile, the global economy stagnates with skyrocketing unemployment and debts that are piling up. While solutions provided in the electoral arena have repeatedly shown to be ineffective, bitcoin presents an alternative – a departure from this system of politics.So what is politics? What are the characteristics of governance designed by it?The Oxford Dictionary defines politics as “activities associated with the governance of a country or area, especially the debate between parties having power.”Politics is inherently associated with power and is a means to organize society through leaders gaining control over the majority. Western liberal democracy is politically engineered governance. Its fundamental feature is centralization. Rules made from the top are enforced, and changes in the system require permission from those who are in positions of authority.Historian Howard Zinn (1970) noted:“In modern times, when social control rests on ‘the consent of the governed’, force is kept in abeyance for emergencies, and everyday control is exercised by a set of rules, a fabric of values passed on from one generation to another by the priests and teachers of the society.”This command-control style of governance works in hierarchies and is antithetical to democratic values. The integrity of the system depends on the success of rulers to foster obedience of those in the network and prevent people from dissenting.For this, managing perception and public opinion through mass media becomes necessary and the system operates under the appearance of democracy, making force of control covert and invisible.In “Democracy INC: The Press and Law in the Corporate Rationalization of the Public Sphere”, professor of journalism David S. Allen (2005) described the role of professionals in facilitating this managed democracy. He noted how the creation of expert knowledge is essential in this machination. Science has become a methodology to back professional legitimacy, as “individuals began to regard professional judgments, often supported by scientific data as unquestionable.”Professionals with expert knowledge perform the role of trusted third parties who are supposed to represent the interests of citizens and make decisions on their behalf. Here, the knowledge produced in social science, such as economics, political science and psychology are often used to maintain the status quo of power structures.From Alan Greenspan to Ben Bernanke and now Janet Yellen, economists who are appointed by the US President as chair of the Federal Reserve get to decide monetary policy for the country and exercise influence through central banks around the world.What validates their expert knowledge is an epistemological foundation called the “creed of objectivity”.Social science has incorporated empirical and positivist methodology of natural science and claimed the ability to form knowledge in a similar way as physical science. With this, researchers assert neutrality as if he or she transcends race, class or any personal bias.Yet, they are embedded within cultural values and their purported value-free objectivity is not actually possible. One’s subjective agendas and personal views do not magically disappear by simply claiming it to be so.Without transparency that ensures disclosure of researchers’ bias, this creed of objectivity becomes a cloak that hides their motivations, closing off any feedback and ensuring assertions that are not tested are promoted as universally applicable truth.Money in this representative democracy becomes political money, legitimatised by state authority and tied to monetary policies of investment banks and corporations that run government behind the scenes. A small number of powerful and rich can enact the ideology of neoliberalism and hijack a whole economy. Under the banner of ‘free market’, they justify their plunder as a crusade for progress.Now, a breakthrough of computer science has found a way to crack this closed logic of control.Bitcoin opens a path for changing the world without taking power. The white paper published under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto put forward a vision of a “peer-to-peer version of electronic cash”, based on cryptographic proof, rather than relying on a trusted third party.The underpinnings of this innovation was the science of asymmetrical security that provides a strong armory against violence, exploitation and extreme selfishness through a mechanism of consensus.Richard Feynman, a theoretical physicist once said that scientific integrity is learning to not fool ourselves. He noted: “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself – and you are the easiest person to fool.”In natural science, researchers are given honest feedback from the real world and nature through observation, repeated testing and experiments. On the other hand, social scientists explore dimensions more divorced from physical reality, and in their claim of neutrality, they can become blind to their own bias.This creed of objectivity in social science has shown itself to be vulnerable to tendencies toward deception, while math is a property that is impervious to manipulation. Math cannot be fooled, as it does not respond to lies and threats. Computer science relies on solid data, rigorous testing and peer-review.This gives each person an opportunity to engage in honest work to overcome self-deception and build strong security, even as strong as the laws in the physical world.In the existing model of governance, inherent weakness in the creed of objectivity made the system vulnerable to the tyranny of the few.Economic incentives set up by a professional class made the right to free speech exclusive for the beneficiaries of this managed democracy, suppressing any views that challenge this authority. Those privileged in the system call these perspectives subjective, relegating them to mere opinion.This doctrine of false objectivity that has been predominant in academia has conditioned researchers to remain impartial. This turned the populace into passive observers, preventing them from fully connecting with their passions and values.In the foundation of bitcoin development, there lies a particular philosophy that revolts against this restriction of free speech imposed by central authority.In the paper “The Moral Character of Cryptographic Work” published in 2015, eminent computer scientist, Phillip Rogaway brought forward the moral obligation of cryptographers and their importance, especially in the post-Snowden era.In this, he described a group that emerged in the late 1980s who saw the potential of cryptography in shifting power relations between the individual and the state. These are the cypherpunks who held a belief that “cryptography can be a key tool for protecting individual autonomy threatened by power”.In an interview with Trace Mayer, applied cryptographer and inventor of Hashcash, Adam Back, talked about the “positive social implications arising from cryptography”. He described the ethos of cypherpunks as writing code to bring the rights we enjoy offline into the online world.The idea is that lobbying politicians and promoting issues through the press would be a slow uphill battle. So, instead of engaging in legal and political systems, Back noted that they could simply “deploy technology and help people do what they consider to be their legal right” and society would later adjust itself to reflect these values.The cypherpunks, with their adamant claim of subjective domains, apply real objective knowledge that comes from math to bring change.As the forced network effect of petrodollar hegemony begins to loosen, the empire fuels aggression with more wars and sanctions.While this system of representation weakens, the logic of control from the old world is beginning to infiltrate the bitcoin ecosystem. Regulators try to reach cryptocurrency through exchanges and by enforcing know-your-customer rules, creating a fertile soil for government surveillance and privacy erosion.Centralization creeps in through industrial mining and patents on hardware, creating a trend toward state and corporate backed monopolies. All the while, the established media keep writing obituaries on bitcoin, wishing to declare the death of this new money they can’t understand.Politics that spread through the crypto-community have been hijacking discussions on technical development.With PR, name-calling and smear campaigns, people engage in social engineering, distracting developers who are engineering security. This drama that some perceive as bitcoin’s existential threat brings a crisis, yet at the same time is giving us all an opportunity to solidify our commitment to this technology’s fundamentals.Bitcoin as a premise of stateless money has brought many people together.These are free market enthusiasts, traders, libertarians, engineers, venture capitalists, anarchists and artists. Bitcoin is a disruptive technology that has large political implications.Yet, for it to manifest its true potential, we must not forget its roots in its apolitical nature – solid science. This apolitical nature is not a bug, but a feature. This is what makes bitcoin stateless money, censorship resistant, unseizable and permissionless.Our commitment to decentralization keeps this consensus algorithm running across the global network and allows all to participate in this scientific endeavor of proof-of-work – to show the world that the ideas of equality, fraternity and freedom are not just ideals  but universal truths.So, let us call a ceasefire in this political battle and engage in the honest, collaborative work of writing code.By moving from a system of power to a consensus of equal peers, together we can find solutions to overcome challenges.Where politicians and leaders have failed, bitcoin succeeds. Our surrender to this scientific process opens a door for development of protocol and gives innovation a chance for humanity to save itself from the mess we have created.Protest image via Shutterstock"

off bitcoin mining machines was revealed yesterday – with a fix from ...","Apr 27, 2017 at 16:00 UTC",,"A mining chip vulnerability that could potentially be used to remotely shut off bitcoin mining machines was revealed yesterday – with a fix from the manufacturer following shortly after.Involving controversial mining chip manufacturer Bitmain, the issue is what some are calling a “backdoor” in the code that controls its hardware, offering the company a way to remotely shut off the miners. Since the code, released anonymously last evening, is vulnerable to attackers, the main concern is whether, in a worst-case scenario, it could be misused.The fear is that bad actors could exploit the vulnerability to switch off bitcoin mining equipment in bulk, and with Bitmain supplying such a large number of machines to the market, the impact could have catastrophic implications for the bitcoin ecosystem.Known as Antbleed (a title bestowed by the website that dramatized its release), the vulnerability is open-source, making it easy to verify. Leading up to the reveal, a group was told about the code feature, with some developers, such as Satoshi Labs CEO Marek Palatinus independently verifying that the backdoor exists and that it can be used to stop Bitmain miners on trigger.Bitmain quickly responded with a fix that erases this part of its mining firmware. Further, its team claimed that the feature was never finished, and that it was intended to help customers recover stolen miners, a past problem for industry firms.The statement reads:“We never intended to use this feature on any Antminer without authorization from its owner. This is similar to the remote erase or shutdown feature provided by most famous smartphone manufacturers.”Much of the recent buzz in the community is around whether the so-described “backdoor” could have been used for malicious purposes, for example, to shut off a miner if it wasn’t complying with rules set by Bitmain.Adding to the confusion is that bitcoin developments have been highly politicized lately, with Bitmain often sitting at the center of bitcoin’s long-standing scaling debate, opposing proposals authored by members of the Bitcoin Core community. For example, the vulnerability reveal follows allegations that the manufacturer was using a secret mining advantage to boost its profits.In conversation with CoinDesk, Bitcoin Unlimited chief scientist Peter Rizun might have summed up the issue and surrounding atmosphere the best:“The drama in social media today surrounds the question of whether there exists a security hole that would allow this remote-control feature to be exploited for nefarious purposes.”Still, it seems that there are other reasons to be concerned about the backdoor.Since it can be exploited by bad actors from outside the company, the mining chips are now viewed as a security risk to the network. Every one to 11 minutes, according to the open-source patch introduced on July 12th, 2016, the machines send calls back to a Bitmain server.The idea is that the mining manufacturer can scan for identifying information about the mining chip, including its serial number and IP address.But, arguably the biggest concern is that the code isn’t limited to use by certain people or companies, so it can be exploited by any man-in-the-middle or attacks coming from the same DNS server.“Even without Bitmain being malicious, the API is unauthenticated and would allow any MITM, DNS or domain hijack to shut down Antminers globally,” the Antbleed website reads, further outlining concerns about the potential for technical or political misuse.Whether or not it was intended to be malicious seems to make up the bulk of the surrounding debate, and so far, it seems that sentiment has broken along the lines of the scaling debate.Still, some broke away from so-called party lines.“This was reckless of them to leave the unfinished feature in the code since this represents a major security issue,” said Henry Brade, CEO of bitcoin service provider Prasos, a past defender of Bitcoin Core’s scaling proposals.“However, based on the statement it is not accurate to call ‘Antbleed’ malicious in nature. It’s simply a serious security issue.”F2pool operator Wang Chun further noted that, he isn’t particularly worried about miners within his pool falling victim to manipulation by Bitmain. He noted in conversation with CoinDesk that it doesn’t seem like the company ever used it to shut down miners.“They have been able to do that for a long time, but they didn’t,” he said.Guy Corem, former CEO of Israeli mining chip maker Spondoolies-Tech, chalked up the controversy to “incompetence” and “negligence”, rather than malicious intent.“It make sense they wanted to develop such feature and it also make sense they didn’t complete it and abandon it,” he added. Further, he cited Spondoolies-Tech’s own past issues with stolen mining equipment.Still, some in the community are skeptical of Bitmain’s response.“Denial of many people is unbelievable. ‘Antbleed’ is not bug or mistake. The purpose of the code is clear; shut down miner on remote flag,” Palatinus tweeted.Others have raised concerns about this vulnerability being made public, since outsiders can then take advantage of the attack vector.Bitcoin Core contributor Matt Corallo argued that owners of these bitcoin miners needed to know about the potential vulnerability in order to fix it.“The issue is it’s already integrated in a ton of deployed hardware,” he said, adding:“It was reported to Bitmain via that bug report months ago, and their customers need to know to protect their operations from potential [man-in-the-middle attacks].”The issue was first reported to Bitmain on Github in September 2016.One question is how prevalent the practice is in bitcoin. Secret backdoors seem to be par for the course in the technology world, often drawing security-minded critics as they’re uncovered. Do other hardware manufacturers have the same vulnerability? Two mining manufacturers, at least, claim that they don’t.“Our hardware doesn’t [have] such issues, we [don’t] offer remote update for firmware – it’s the customer’s decision update them or not,” said blockchain startup Bitfury Group CIO Alex Petrov.“My miner has no ASICBoost or backdoor,” Jack Liao, CEO of mining LightningAsic, told CoinDesk.Along with the details about the backdoor, those who detected it released a patch that closes it up with a single line of code.Still, there are lingering worries that the vulnerability betrays a weakness in the bitcoin network – namely, it’s lack of mining chip makers.No clear data is available about how many miners are running this software, but Bitmain is one the largest chip manufacturers in the space, with bolder estimates suggesting it produces 70% of all mining chips.That the backdoor could be used to impact any of those chips is unsurprisingly alarming to advocates that the network be “decentralized” and open to competition that enables different actors to engage on it.For now, the impact seems to be that Bitmain will take action to look at the rest of its codebase in order to spot other vulnerabilities.“The controversy around this code has brought our attention to improve the design in order to address vulnerabilities that were pointed out by the community recently,” its statement reads.Still, others are lamenting the state of the drama and conversation around the issue, noting how quickly it became politicized.Rizun concluded:“All-in-all just another day in bitcoin.”Image via AntBleed website"

Expanding on an old technique used to hide ...","Apr 3, 2017 at 13:59 UTC",Bitcoin startup Blockstream has unveiled new technology for shielding data on a blockchain.,"Expanding on an old technique used to hide transaction amounts, the company has developed a new scheme dubbed ‘confidential assets’ to conceal the types of assets in a transaction. Revealing just how the tech works, the startup has released a new paper today, co-authored by Blockstream developers Andrew Poelstra, Adam Back, Mark Friedenbach, Greg Maxwell and Pieter Wuille.Using confidential assets, viewers of a blockchain would be able to see a transaction’s senders and receivers, but not what kind of asset is traded – whether bitcoin, stocks, gold, or something else.So why is hiding asset types important?Banks have made it known that they aren’t thrilled that blockchains make certain information public, and have been increasingly exploring various ways of making their holdings private while still taking advantage of the ability to share the database of transactions with others.Against that backdrop, Blockstream CEO Adam Back framed confidential assets as a technology to help enterprises overcome what he called this “awkward tradeoff”.Tokyo-based marketing company Digital Garage has been revealed as the first partner to use the new tech, as a part of Blockstream’s Elements sidechains initiative, with plans to use it to shield loyalty points.Blockstream core tech engineer Greg Sanders described confidentiality as a “key requirement” for Digital Garage, as well as other companies using blockchain tech.He told CoinDesk:“The companies care a lot about their privacy. You don’t want that [transaction data] out in the open because it’s basically showing your books to everyone. Confidential assets allows companies to move these assets on a publicly verifiable blockchain, but hide the amounts and the types of assets being moved around at the same time.”However, the tech is not yet being used in a production setting.Blockstream has been exploring the enterprise blockchain world over the past couple of years, including joining the Hyperledger consortium and deploying private blockchains on top of bitcoin.It’s also been testing privacy features on Elements sidechains, including using ‘confidential transactions’ – a technique first proposed by Back – to shield transaction amounts from non-participants in the system.In a nutshell, the system uses cryptography to prove that people are getting their money, even while the details aren’t revealed to everyone. Yet anyone, including nodes, can verify that the transaction is valid.Confidential assets extends this concept to shield multiple assets.However, there is a downside of both confidential transactions and confidential assets – they require much more space on the blockchain than standard transactions.Confidential assets is currently being tested on a Blockstream Elements sidechain, though it can potentially be ported elsewhere.According to Back, though, while the system works on a sidechain, it’s is not suitable for bitcoin proper, since the digital currency’s code doesn’t support other asset types.However, some other projects now use confidential transactions, including MimbleWimble and the privacy project ValueShuffle. And if developers of such projects chose to, they could effectively upgrade to support confidential assets instead.In conclusion, Back described the new technology as a part of a larger push for adoption of bitcoin and blockchain technology, saying:“And to the extent that confidentiality would be an impediment to companies adopting the technology, and just user privacy rights as well, it’s important that we be able to provide confidentiality so that the industry can adopt blockchain technology and start deploying the advantages without being held back by confidentiality concerns.”Venetian blind image via Shutterstock"

asserting that his new employer is seeking to disrupt bitcoin's ...","May 2, 2017 at 19:20 UTC",Former Bitcoin Foundation director Jon Matonis doesn’t waste any time asserting that his new employer is seeking to disrupt bitcoin’s established development process.,"Matonis, who joined the secretive startup nChain today, is quick to state that this is the ambition of the London and Vancouver-based operation he now claims has 60 full-time employees, including infamous developer Craig Wright.As reported by Reuters, nChain was started by Wright, the 46-year-old computer scientist who claims to be bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto (though he hasn’t offered much evidence). To date, nChain hasn’t offered much to support its assertions that it’s now the industry’s best-funded startup either, hinting only that it has received more than $100m from Malta-based high-tech private equity fund SICAV plc as part of an acquisition.Yet, it’s a different company that Matonis has in mind in conversation – San Francisco-based blockchain services firm Blockstream.Long the subject of criticism for the significant financial support it provides to developers working on bitcoin’s open-source protocol and its primary implementation Bitcoin Core, Blockstream has been villainized for that group’s roadmap for scaling bitcoin, specifically its decision to prioritize innovations that don’t alter a hard-coded limit on block size.Matonis told CoinDesk:“I immediately recognized nChain would be an effective challenger to Blockstream, which is definitely needed in the space.”In conversation, Matonis echoes a familiar refrain, that Blockstream and Bitcoin Core are too intertwined, and that Core’s roadmap doesn’t have broad community support.In Matonis’s view, bitcoin can once again return to the days when its blockchain was able to quickly clear its backlog of transactions with virtually no fees, while providing more advanced scripting languages – if only other software implementations gain transaction.Yet, in conversation, Matonis backed away from the idea that nChain was “taking aim” at Blockstream, despite his frequent barbs aimed at the company.Rather, Matonis spoke broadly of what he clarified is nChain’s broader attempt to introduce choice into a bitcoin software market he described as in need of competition.“There’s a lot of resistance to the Blockstream model of pushing everything to a second layer, pushing SegWit and Lightning as the only solutions,” he said:“We don’t have to settle for just one approach.”Such comments come at time when alternative blockchain networks have come to show progress on flashier, more publicly popular updates to their technology, a development that stands in contrast to bitcoin’s now years-long scaling debate and offers some weight to critiques of Core’s model.For example, ethereum is hard at work on innovations that would find it redefining how large blockchain networks reach consensus, while litecoin has more quickly adopted innovations originally intended for increasing bitcoin’s transaction capacity. (Though it would be wrong to say Core developers aren’t progressing).However, ethereum, which lacks a reference implementation, is seen as more welcoming to alternatives, as its parity and geth clients allow developers a choice between competing softwares. (The benefit, proponents say, is that in instances of attack, should one fail, the other could emerge unaffected).Former Bitcoin Core developers Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik, for instance, are two voices that have supported the idea, the latter calling multiple implementations “healthier than a homogeneous monoculture” with one reference implementation.Against this backdrop, phase one of the nChain’s action plan is to release a software development kit (SDK) that Matonis said will likely be given away for free as a means of proliferating alternatives to Bitcoin Core, used today by 85% of network nodes.Matonis said the SDK will offer users the ability to boot up “specialized nodes” that would enable faster block propagation, a feature he contends would make scaling the bitcoin blockchain through a block size increase easier while appealing to node operators.“The SDK is going to enable on-chain scaling for bitcoin without degrading decentralization,” Matonis said.Already, he said nChain has been in talks with miners about the idea. But, how does this work within bitcoin’s existing architecture?According to Matonis, nChain’s SDK will be different from newer Bitcoin Core competitors including Bitcoin Unlimited and Bcoin, which he framed as being more compatible with Core. Bitcoin Unlimited, for example, is a version of Bitcoin Core with new features added. Likewise, BCoin was built from scratch, but to be compatible with Bitcoin Core.“nChain allows for other developers to build their own implementations using the techniques and innovations that we’ve tested here,” Matonis continued.In this way, Matonis suggested that nChain believes it could gain enough traction on the network to become a popular implementation for other developers, thereby getting rid of the notion that one implementation is big enough to be called a reference at all.He added:“Our mission is to separate the protocol from its one true reference.”Asked how the strategy would impact the bitcoin network, Matonis said that nChain’s software will enable network stakeholders to choose between the two implementations, a development that he projects could spur a network split if successful.Should nChain launch its implementation to widespread adoption, Matonis suggested that miners and node operators could be forced to choose between two competing versions of bitcoin’s blockchain history – one kept by Bitcoin Core and the other by nChain.“This is the governance model for bitcoin, there’s no other governance model. If you can’t get traction with pull requests, you launch software propagation battles, and when one reference implementation has greater than 50% or 75%, you can attempt a fork of the network,” Matonis explained.Such a scenario has long been the subject of fears in the bitcoin development community. For example, the idea that a hard fork could possibly disrupt the validity of the bitcoin blockchain was factor cited by Bitcoin Core developers in their support for their proposed scaling solutions.But, given the risk of creating two separate bitcoin assets in the process, why not build a competing blockchain network? According to Matonis, the answer is hashing power.While cryptocurrency markets such as ethereum and litecoin have recently hit notable highs, it’s bitcoin’s miners that Matonis believes makes it more valuable.
“It will make bitcoin more competitive against altcoins,” Matonis said of the implementation, invoking the idea that the design is similar to that seen in the open-source Linux project.Still, Matonis reports nChain is working on larger goals to make bitcoin useful beyond just being a store of value, one he suggested would have greater societal benefits.“I want to elevate the sector beyond fintech to a more general computation market for enterprise computing,” he said, concluding:“We’re still a small group fighting in the weeds. I’m looking beyond, there’s a much larger market across many verticals.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blockstream and Purse, the creators of Bcoin.Robots fighting via Shutterstock"
58,www.coindesk.com,"Apr 6, 2017",Bitcoin's New Controversy: The AsicBoost Allegations Explained,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-new-controversy-asicboost-allegations-explained,"Bitcoin is abuzz with fresh controversy following an inflammatory new post 
by Bitcoin Core developer and Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell in ...","Apr 6, 2017 at 17:21 UTC",Bitcoin is abuzz with fresh controversy following an inflammatory new post by Bitcoin Core developer and Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell in which he alleges some miners are engaging in unfair practices that may be harmful to the network.,"Posted to the bitcoin mailing list last night, the entry asserts that a mining hardware maker is secretly exploiting a previously known weakness in bitcoin’s proof-of-work algorithm that enables them to mine roughly 20% faster than competitors.The allegation is that this activity is ongoing, and that this has been proven by an analysis conducted on a mining chip.Here’s where the intellectual gymnastics begin.Of note is that the technology in use has already been patented by developers Timo Hanke and Sergio Demian Lerner in a scheme called “AsicBoost” for which a patent was filed in November 2014.Maxwell contends that someone has discovered what he called a “covert” version of the technology used in a mining chip. He did not state who conducted the analysis, whether him or a separate party.Taking a step further into speculation, the inference of the post is that Segregated Witness, a scaling solution developed and proposed by the Bitcoin Core team, would render the covert version of AsicBoost discovered obsolete, hurting the bottom lines of any miners using the workaround.As such, the statement has stoked controversy in bitcoin’s long-simmering scaling debate in that the allegation that the miner engaged in the practice is China-based Bitmain – one of the industry’s largest providers of mining equipment. (Bitmain has a separate patent for the AsicBoost technology in China).The assertion is that Bitmain is not only blocking a technical solution favored by the Core developers (through its support of alternative development teams), but doing so because it would enhance its profitability at the expense of users.In statements, Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu has vehemently denied that the company is using the AsicBoost workaround on the bitcoin blockchain.“There is no relationship between SegWit and AsicBoost,” Wu told CoinDesk.Bitmain released a statement on Thursday, adding that they tested AsicBoost, but they never used it in a real mining capacity, and further pointed to an agreement where they expressed support for SegWit in the past.Even those involved in the debate acknowledged that, given present information, it remains difficult to prove whether the allegations are true.Former COO of bitcoin mining firm BTCC, Samson Mow, told CoinDesk that the post confirms rumors that have been floating around for some time, though he did not offer any new evidence in the conversation.Mow told CoinDesk:“This is not something that you’re going to get solid proof for, but there’s smoking guns all around. All the science points to manipulation.”First things first, it may be beneficial to understand the specific mining technique at the center of the allegations.In short, AsicBoost is best described as a “mathematical trick.” Instead of taking a huge amount of computation, miners can use the technique to whittle down their choices of potential hashes that enable them to solve a puzzle and claim bitcoin’s rewards.These mathematical tricks can lead to an increase in mining profitability by boosting key mining hardware profitability ratios.For example, a primary measurement of mining profitability is the amount of money earned in gigahashes per second (GH/s). This is most often measured in USD per Gh/s.The other measure of hardware profitability involves determining energy consumption, commonly measured in Joules, and dividing that by the hashing speed. This is the Joule per Gh/s.The creators of the technology claim these key ratios are improved by roughly 20% thanks to AsicBoost.According to mining firm representatives, the technique has been known for some time, though it is largely out of use through a combination of patent protection and industry standards that aren’t enforced by any body or organization.Going back to Maxwell’s original post, what’s being speculated is that the company in question, allegedly Bitmain, isn’t using AsicBoost exactly.Rather, the mining chip in is said to implement another version of the idea whereby it is implemented in the hardware. Further, it is argued that Segregated Witness would, as a bi-product of its code, make this specific technique obsolete.Should this be correct, and should the mining chip maker be implementing the chip widely, it’s argued that they may have a business interest in blocking the software.For mining firms, which produce mining chips on a massive scale, the pace of technological innovation renders hardware obsolete within a period of months. It is argued that such a recall could be potentially devastating, adding pressures to the scaling argument.At the center of the issue is whether the specific technology use represents a natural desire for a competitive advantage, and whether miners can be working “against the network” if no rule prevents them from engaging in that activity.For example, there is no rule that currently prevents use of the AsicBoost design, meaning that miners have more of an unspoken agreement to refrain from using the technique on the basis it is “bad” for the network.As explained by an executive at one of the world’s largest mining firms, who wished to speak on privacy citing business concerns, the practice is widely known, and has little impact on their operations.“They operate differently, but that I think it is normal. Jihan [Wu] said it is the freedom given by protocol so they can do it,” he said.Mow noted that the technique isn’t “kosher” among miners, as it essentially enables them to try to solve bitcoin’s puzzle, without performing any useful work – say, processing transactions.Notably, others don’t think “attack” or “flaw” is the right term, arguing it’s simply a way for miners to mine more efficiently.IC3 co-director Emin Gün Sirer, for example, asserted in a blog post that there isn’t enough public evidence yet to verify Maxwell’s claims.The details of the so-called “attack” are rather technical, but in its most basic form it deals with how miners find blocks.To recap the mining process, miners use specially designed equipment to repeatedly hash bitcoin block data (or turn it into a fixed-length scrambled string of letters and numbers) until they hit a particular solution that unlocks bitcoin mining rewards.There’s certain data that miners aren’t supposed to know before they calculate hashes so that miners all have to go through the same calculation process, leveling the playing field.The problem, developers claim, is with the hashing algorithm, which miners can exploit in a couple ways. For one, the subject of Maxwell’s post, is a technique that developers call “merkle grinding.” But, Maxwell claims that some miners found a clever way of finding out more about the data that they expect to find ahead of time.In each block header there’s a “merkle root” that you can think of as a summary of the transactions bundled in a block. Miners can order transaction data in the merkle tree such that they need to calculate less data.“If the miner finds multiple candidate root values which have the same final 32-bit then they can use the attack,” Maxwell writes.This speeds up the process. Essentially, if it goes according to plan, it means occasionally skipping a step.Further, some developers contend that one sign that this technique being used is that some miners have been mining blocks without transactions, making it easier to reorder transactions in the merkle tree. (Bitmain, specifically, has been known to occasionally mine empty blocks).Notably, Timo Hanke, AsicBoost co-inventor and former Cointerra CTO, allege that the argument that AsicBoost is inhibiting Segwit adoption is overplayed.While admitting via Twitter that AsicBoost could potentially be used for purposes that may be detrimental to the network, he said he would not support any Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that would use the technology to harm bitcoin.AsicBoost co-creater Sergio Lerner noted on Twitter that newly proposed Segwit2MB, an alternative to SegWit, would also prevent miners from continuing to utilize the exploit.Still, the big worry is that this technique is being used to further centralize mining in bitcoin – a problem that developers have been concerned about for a long time – since miners using the faster mining technology could have an advantage over those who don’t.“Patents conferring large advantage are a problem for bitcoin,” Blockstream CEO Adam Back said.Further, there’s an economic advantage to the attack. A mining pool comprising 50% of the bitcoin mining power could save as much as $100m per year by exploiting the flaw, Maxwell noted.Others have gone on to theorize that, since SegWit somehow fixes the problem, there might be an economic reason that miners do not support the solution.“If you had a $100m cash cow, and it gets destroyed by a feature, you do everything you can to block it,” argued developer Alphonse Pace.Maxwell added that this implication is exactly why he began looking into the issue, adding:“An incompatibility would go a long way to explain some of the more inexplicable behavior from some parties in the mining ecosystem.”Alyssa Hertig and Garrett Keirns contributed reporting.Gun lighter for gas-stove via Shutterstock"

Now empty, the account is reserved for incoming transactions, while operations will be paid for, also in bitcoin, using other accounts and local bitcoin service providers.
Now that the company has been incorporated with a bitcoin account, Brave New World Investments co-founder Mikael Johansson told CoinDesk he is waiting for the final approval to open a bank account in Iran.Then, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be used to send funds to Iran, where they will be converted to the native rial and used to invest in publicly traded companies on the Tehran Stock Exchange.Johansson said:“We want to invest in Iran. In good, hard-working companies and individuals.”Since the Iranian Revolution of 1979, nations around the world have held various sanctions against the country, with the US being the most vocal detractor of doing business with the country.In recent years, however, the nature of those sanctions has begun to evolve.For starters, since the US, the EU and others in 2015 signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action for the peaceful development of nuclear energy in Iran, the EU has engaged in increased trade with the country.In the US, on the other hand, the response has been different. Last month, US president Donald Trump moved to tighten US sanctions on Iran, in response to missile tests he believes could prove to be a possible threat.Still, Johansson sees opportunity in the changing climate – for those willing to play by complicated international rules.He told CoinDesk that in order to meet demand in Iran for outside investment, he will work with a diverse group of professionals to ensure his firm is compliant with both US and EU sanctions positions.“We have a process that we are working on,” said Johansson, “which we will have audited and reviewed by regulators to make sure that we comply with anti-money laundering directives, with counter-terrorist financing directives, and also sanctions in general.”Now that Johansson’s firm has been incorporated, he wants to use bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to help Iranian companies overcome similar obstacles.As mentioned, Brave New World Investments was unable to get an account in Sweden due to concerns described by Johansson that the local banks might perceive the account as a violation of their agreements with US business interests.Similarly, for four years, interbank messaging platform Swift had cut all ties with banks in Iran. While some of those restrictions were lifted in January 2016 and international credit cards have been slowly entering the market, many sanctioned banks remain blocked.“The sanctions have impacted both economically, and in a humanitarian sense,” said Johansson. “Economically, they have been cut off from the international banking community.”Johansson sees Sweden’s willingness to accept a bitcoin account in lieu of a bank account as evidence of an emerging sector of companies that are unable to obtain bank accounts, but are doing everything from paying rent, buying copy machines and providing services using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.He concluded:“We expect a new segment of companies being unbanked and operating on cryptocurrencies.”Tehran image via Shutterstock"

volumes ...","Jun 11, 2017 at 10:45 UTC","This article highlights findings from CoinDesk Research‘s new Q1 2017 State of Blockchain report, and expands on the composition of bitcoin, ethereum and other exchange trading volume into Q2.","Click here to view the slides in your browser.Underlying bitcoin and ether‘s all-time-high price rallies in Q1 was a dramatically shifting global exchange market.So far in 2017, trading volumes have seen big changes, ones that indicate a reshaping of the global market.Global exchange volume for bitcoin, for example, plummeted in January after the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) issued guidance to domestic exchanges around their regulatory and operational policies. The development led to periods where withdrawals and margin trading were stalled, and trading fees were instituted after years of no-fee trading.Despite the substantial shifts, here are three trends that CoinDesk Research has highlighted as signs of a maturing overall market in Q1 and the period since.The PBoC’s impact on the Chinese ‘Big 3’ exchanges in January sent worldwide trading volume figures tumbling to levels lower than seen in years.The drop in CNY volume however made room for USD and JPY markets to develop as major constituents of global trading in Q1.Since the end of the first quarter, the Japanese yen (JPY) has continued as the leading fiat currency traded for bitcoin (following legislation recognizing bitcoin as a legal payment method), with USD trailing narrowly.Chinese yuan (CNY) volume has dropped to about a quarter to a third of that of JPY and USD, and South Korean won (KRW) and euros (EUR) are now not far behind, comprising one of the most diverse allocations of global trading the industry has ever seen.Markets for ether followed a different trend as prices and volume both spiked at the end of Q1.Trading throughout the quarter was dominated by BTC, with USD steadily gaining traction.Regarding exchange trading volume, Poloniex led BTC volumes by a large margin, while Coinbase narrowly edged out Bitfinex for dominance over USD-based markets in the first quarter.Since then, exchange dominance has remained relatively consistent, but currency rankings have shifted as KRW-based trading rallied into the third place position.The global composition of ether trading is similarly now the most diverse it has ever been.Ethereum now serves as the base protocol or infrastructure layer for many decentralized applications as well as acting as a cryptocurrency (now with a combined market cap of several billion dollars alone), further positioning itself as a major backbone of future projects and trading.The aggregate market cap of all blockchain tokens now exceeds $100m (or more depending on how you evaluate supply), currently dominated by bitcoin, ether and ripple.Over 130 tokens now have an implied valuation of north of $10m, comprised of new blockchains like zcash, monero or litecoin and tokens created on top of existing blockchains (like ethereum or waves) such as golem, augur or gnosis. Just four years ago, only two tokens had a market cap over $10m, bitcoin and litecoin.In the last month, 18 tokens averaged over $10m in daily trading volume.As alternative blockchains and assets have grown in popularity, many large exchanges have extended trading support to profit from the trend – fueling their rise in trading and quoted valuations.Leading global digital asset exchanges such as Coinbase, Poloniex, Kraken, Bittrex, Shapeshift and Bitfinex now support numerous markets for tokens and fiat currency pairs. Further, an emerging market of decentralized exchanges and protocols like EtherDelta and 0x is growing, all of which diversifies what was once a centralized and bitcoin-dominated trading market.The demand side of the equation has also seen increased inflows as all-time-high prices and increased media attention led to new users pouring into the cryptocurrency space, with major exchanges like Poloniex and Coinbase experiencing record growth and trading across assets.The allocation of cryptocurrency trading across exchanges and currencies has changed markedly over the years due to sentiment, regulation, hacks and business decisions by exchanges to support new trading pairs.In March, the SEC rejected two bitcoin ETFs, citing the lack of significant regulated markets and industry concentration in China. Around the same time, the markets saw a notable decrease in volume from China and an increase from South Korea and Japan after significant regulatory guidance.Since, trading volume compositions have remained more diverse than ever across bitcoin and ethereum, and the industry has seen both pushes to reconsider a bitcoin ETF and consider a new ethereum ETF. We will undoubtedly see future initiatives for new types of structured products as the market continues to mature.The biggest change, however, could continue to be the sharp decrease in bitcoin’s dominance should ethereum and other tokens capture a larger percentage of overall trading in a more diverse set of markets.View CoinDesk Research‘s full Q1 2017 State of Blockchain for more analysis on cryptocurrency trading volumes and other market statistics.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of DCG, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase and zcash.Urban road scene image via Shutterstock"

It’s really putting the card out into a far-reaching population.”So far, BitPay reports that 15,000 cards from its domestic product, unveiled last year at Consensus 2016, have been ordered. Further, the startup reported that it has seen growing demand for an international version of the offering since last year.“We have a waiting list of over 20,000 people who have asked,” BitPay marketing and communications manager James Walpole told CoinDesk. “This provides a lot of value, especially in emerging markets where bitcoin is used for real-world payments.”Still, the product launch notably come at a time when some projects and startups formerly using the bitcoin blockchain as a payment rail have begun to adopt other solutions due to escalating network fees. (As transaction volumes have grown, the hard-coded limit on block size has effectively created a market for space on the bitcoin ledger).But while Circle, another payments-focused startup, migrated to a new platform unveiled in December, Pair appeared less interested in this idea, stating that BitPay needs a “cryptocurrency that is secure, liquid and sufficiently scalable”.“We’re committed to one blockchain in the long term, but if there’s a problem with that network, we’d evaluate some other currency or a fork of the bitcoin blockchain,” he stated.Users have to pay the associated bitcoin network transaction fees to load the BitPay Prepaid Visa Card, but the BitPay team stressed the utility of its product and the benefits of cryptocurrency would be enough to override those concerns.Founded in 2011, BitPay is one of the longest-operating bitcoin startups, having raised just over $30m in three public funding rounds.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in BitPay. Images via BitPayThis article has been updated for clarity. "

Even though an individual bitcoin ...","May 28, 2017 at 10:35 UTC","While hundreds of cryptocurrencies have been launched and many have attempted to provide users with greater privacy, they have seen varying levels of success.","Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency to scale, was originally touted as providing users with anonymity. The cryptocurrency’s protocol attempted to offer a high level of privacy by shielding user identities behind pseudonymous addresses, randomly generated strings of numbers and letters. However, this approach proved ineffective.Bitcoin addresses and transactions are both recorded on the blockchain, making them publicly available. Even though an individual bitcoin address is pseudonymous, it can attach to many transactions over time, making it easier for friends, family and even government agencies to get a better sense of the address owner’s purchasing trends.While some thought that bitcoin kept their transaction history completely private, organizations such as law enforcement agencies have used blockchain analytics to track bitcoin transactions.In the years after bitcoin was released, certain cryptocurrencies were developed specifically to provide users with a greater chance of remaining anonymous. Dash, for example, harnesses a feature based on CoinJoin, which combines funds from several users to reduce the chances that any one user’s identity will be detected.Zcash, another privacy oriented cryptocurrency, leverages zero-knowledge proof constructions called zk-SNARKs to allow users to exchange information without revealing their identities. In addition, the currency’s blockchain does not disclose the value of any transactions.This cryptocurrency’s launch generated significant hype, but its privacy feature is optional, and many users have refrained from leveraging it. At the time of report, 28% of transactions were shielded.Monero, by contrast, is private by default, and it has achieved the widespread adoption of those interested in using cryptocurrencies to remain anonymous.Monero is an open-source, privacy-oriented cryptocurrency that was launched in April 2014. The developers involved introduced this innovative cryptocurrency without setting aside any for themselves, and the team has relied on donations and the broader community to further development.Monero leverages ring signatures and stealth addresses to obscure the identity of senders and recipients. Ring signatures combine or ‘mix’ a user’s account keys with public keys obtained from monero’s blockchain to create a ‘ring’ of possible signers, meaning outside observers cannot link a signature to a specific user.The concept of a ring signature was first described by academics from MIT and The Weizmann Institute in a 2001 paper, and using the technology has helped provide legitimacy for monero at a time when much of the cryptography used in blockchains is new and has not withstood the test of time.It is worth noting that while mixing services are available for many cryptocurrencies, users generally only mixed coins when they were looking to hide something. Monero, however, mixes all coins used in transactions, which helps eliminate the suspicion that coins are being mixed to conceal information the senders and recipients don’t want third parties to see.While monero users have the ability to keep their transaction history private, they can also share this information selectively. Every monero account has a view key, which permits anyone holding it to look at the account’s transactions.Originally, ring signatures obscured the senders and recipients involved in monero transaction without hiding the amount transferred. However, an update called RingCT implemented a new ring signature that concealed both the value of individual transactions and the identity of senders and recipients.In addition to leveraging ring signatures, monero also enhances privacy through stealth addresses, which are randomly generated, one-time addresses created for each transaction on behalf of the recipient. With this feature, recipients publish a single address and transactions they receive go to separate, unique addresses. As a result, monero transactions cannot be linked to the published address of the sender or recipient.By providing a high level of privacy, monero offers fungibility, meaning that each individual unit of a currency can be substituted for another. Another way of putting this is that every coin has equal value.Because the transaction history of individual bitcoins is recorded on the blockchain, coins that have been associated with certain events, like theft, could be shunned by merchants and exchanges.Due to monero’s untraceable nature, no two coins are distinguishable from one another, and they are both equal in the eyes of merchants. Without this level of fungibility, a vendor that accepts cryptocurrency might refuse a unit of one of these assets because of its past transaction history.Because of this, monero (XMR) has enjoyed a steady increase in adoption since its release. Dark web marketplaces including AlphaBay and Oasis have embraced the cryptocurrency, reportedly due to popular demand.“Following the demand from the community, and considering the security features of monero, we decided to add it to our marketplace,” the press release stated.Oasis adopted the currency later that year, and the endorsements of these two dark web markets helped provoke significant media coverage.Monero’s market operates like that of many other cryptocurrencies. Those interested in investing in the cryptocurrency can purchase it outright through exchanges including Poloniex, Bitfinex and Kraken.Poloniex was the first of these exchanges to offer the currency, listing eight separate currency pairs in July 2014. Bitfinex, the largest bitcoin exchange by BTC/USD, followed suit in November 2016, listing XMR/USD and XMR/BTC trading pairs and allowing deposits and withdrawals of monero.Kraken offered monero trading starting in January 2017, listing currency pairs XMR/USD, XMR/EUR and XMR/XBT. Kraken praised monero at the time, writing on its blog that the currency “trades with high volume and liquidity”.Like many other cryptocurrencies, monero offers interested parties the opportunity to mine blocks. While individuals have the ability to join mining pools, they can also mine monero by themselves.Anyone with a computer can take part in this activity, as it does not require any specific hardware such as the application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) required these days to mine bitcoin.Monero uses a proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm that was designed to be accessible to a wide range of processors, a specification that was included to ensure that mining was open to many different parties instead of just large mining pools.The cryptocurrency’s block time is approximately two minutes. Monero offers miners a ‘permanent block reward’, which is described as follows:“The block reward will never drop below 0.3 XMR, making Monero a disinflationary currency: the inflation will be roughly 1% in 2022 and go down forever, but the nominal inflation will stay at 0.3 XMR per minute. This means that there will always be an incentive for miners to mine Monero and thus keeping the blockchain secure, with or without a fee market.”At the time of reporting, the block reward was roughly 7.46 XMR, meaning that the monero network was producing approximately 224 XMR per hour and 5,376 XMR a day. The network hash rate was 81.84 million hashes per second.The price of monero’s XMR token has experienced significant volatility at times, climbing nearly 70% in the last month and more than 1,300% since it began trading on CoinMarketCap. Since inception, the cryptocurrency has fluctuated between roughly $0.25 (in January 2015) and close to $60 (in May 2017).While some market observers might interpret this volatility as making monero less credible, sharp price fluctuations provide opportunities for traders. Traders can buy monero using both fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, which might motivate them to buy and sell it in an attempt to make a profit. They might also use the currency as a hedge for other cryptocurrencies.Because monero has received the acceptance of multiple dark web marketplaces and has generated significant visibility for its ability to provide users with a high degree of privacy, it is less speculative than competitors like zcash.Going forward, monero’s price will be a function of supply and demand. The former is ever-increasing, and the latter is unknown. Interestingly enough, this uncertainty might prove compelling to investors, giving them an opportunity to speculate on the cryptocurrency’s future value in an attempt to generate strong returns.Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

— Saint Augustine, De natura boni, i, 405 C.E. (with minor edits)If you ask someone well-informed about the characteristics of blockchains, the word ‘immutable’ will invariably appear in the response.In plain English, this word is used to denote something which can never be modified or changed. In a blockchain, it refers to the global log of transactions, which is created by a consensus between the chain’s participants. The basic notion is this: once a blockchain transaction has received a sufficient level of validation, some cryptography ensures that it can never be replaced or reversed.This marks blockchains as different from regular files or databases, in which information can be edited and deleted at will. Or so the theory goes.In the raucous arena of blockchain debate, immutability has become a quasi-religious doctrine – a core belief that must not be shaken or questioned. And just like the doctrines in mainstream religions, members of opposing camps use immutability as a weapon of derision and ridicule.The past year has witnessed two prominent examples:For one, cryptocurrency advocates claim that immutability can only be achieved through decentralized economic mechanisms such as proof-of-work. From this perspective, private blockchains are laughable because they depend on the collective good behavior of a known group of validators, who clearly cannot be trusted.Scorn has also been directed at the idea of an editable (or mutable) blockchain, in which retroactive modifications can be made to the transaction history under certain conditions. Mockers posed the question: “What could possibly be the point of a blockchain if its contents can easily be changed?”For those of us on the sidelines, it’s fun to watch the mudslinging. Not least because both of these criticisms are plain wrong. Both stem from a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of immutability in blockchains (and indeed any computer system).For those short on time, here’s the bottom line:In blockchains, there is no such thing as perfect immutability. The real question is: What are the conditions under which a particular blockchain can and cannot be changed? And do those conditions match the problem we’re trying to solve?To put it another way, a blockchain’s transactions are not written into the mind of God (with apologies to Augustine above). Instead, the chain’s behavior depends on a network of corporeal computer systems, which will always be vulnerable to destruction or corruption. But, before we get into the details of how, let’s proceed by recapping some basics of blockchains themselves.A blockchain runs on a set of nodes, each of which may be under the control of a separate company, individual or organization. These nodes connect to each other in a dense peer-to-peer network, so that no one node acts as a central point of control or failure.Each node can generate and digitally sign transactions which represent operations in some kind of ledger or database, and these transactions rapidly propagate to other nodes across the network in a gossip-like way.Each node independently verifies every new incoming transaction for validity, in terms of: (a) its compliance with the blockchain’s rules, (b) its digital signature and (c) any conflicts with previously seen transactions. If a transaction passes these tests, it enters that node’s local list of provisional unconfirmed transactions (the ‘memory pool’), and will be forwarded on to its peers.Transactions that fail are rejected outright, while others whose evaluation depends on unseen transactions are placed in a temporary holding area (the ‘orphan pool’).At periodic intervals, a new block is generated by one of the ‘validator’ nodes on the network, containing a set of as-yet unconfirmed transactions. Every block has a unique 32-byte identifier called a ‘hash’, which is determined entirely by the block’s contents. Each block also includes a timestamp and a link to a previous block via its hash, creating a literal ‘blockchain’ going back to the very beginning.Just like transactions, blocks propagate across the network in a peer-to-peer fashion and are independently verified by each node. To be accepted by a node, a block must contain a set of valid transactions which do not conflict with each other or with those in the previous blocks linked. If a block passes this and other tests, it is added to that node’s local copy of the blockchain, and the transactions within are ‘confirmed’. Any transactions in the node’s memory pool or orphan pool which conflict with those in the new block are immediately discarded.Every chain employs some sort of strategy to ensure that blocks are generated by a plurality of its participants. This ensures that no individual or small group of nodes can seize control of the blockchain’s contents.Most public blockchains like bitcoin use ‘proof-of-work’ which allows blocks to be created by anyone on the internet who can solve a pointless and fiendishly difficult mathematical puzzle. By contrast, in private blockchains, blocks tend to be signed by one or more permitted validators, using an appropriate scheme to prevent minority control. (Our product MultiChain uses a technique called ‘mining diversity’ which requires a minimum proportion of the permitted validators to participate in order to create a valid chain.)Depending on the consensus mechanism used, two different validator nodes might simultaneously generate conflicting blocks, both of which point to the same previous one. When such a ‘fork’ happens, different nodes in the network will see different blocks first, leading them to have different opinions about the chain’s recent history.These forks are automatically resolved by the blockchain software, with consensus regained once a new block arrives on one of the branches. Nodes that were on the shorter branch automatically rewind their last block and replay the two blocks on the longer one. If we’re really unlucky and both branches are extended simultaneously, the conflict will be resolved after the third block on one branch, or the one after that, and so on. In practice, the probability of a fork persisting drops exponentially as its length increases. In private chains with a limited set of validators, the likelihood can be reduced to zero after a small number of blocks.Nonetheless, it’s important to remember that each node is running on a computer system owned and controlled by a particular person or organization, so the blockchain cannot force it to do anything. The purpose of the chain is to help honest nodes to stay in sync, but if enough of its participants choose to change the rules, no earthly power can stop them.That’s why we need to stop asking whether a particular blockchain is truly and absolutely immutable, because the answer will always be no. Instead, we should consider the conditions under which a particular blockchain can be modified, and then check if we’re comfortable with those conditions for the use case we have in mind.Let’s return to the two examples cited in the introduction, in which the doctrine of immutability has been used as a basis for ridicule.We’ll begin with the claim that the consensual validation procedures used in permissioned blockchains cannot bring about the ‘true immutability’ promised by public chains.This criticism is most easily addressed by pointing to the vulnerability of public blockchains themselves. Take, for example, the ethereum blockchain, which suffered a devastating exploit in June 2016. Someone found a coding loophole in a smart contract called The DAO, in which almost $250m had been invested, and began draining its funds at speed. While this clearly violated the intentions of the contract’s creators and investors, its terms and conditions relied on the mantra that ‘code is law’. Law or not, less than a month later, the ethereum software was updated to prevent the hacker from withdrawing the cryptocurrency ‘earned’.Of course, this update could not be enforced, since every ethereum user controls their own computer. Nonetheless, it was publicly supported by Vitalik Buterin, ethereum’s creator, as well as many other community leaders. As a result, most users complied, and the blockchain with the new rules kept the name ‘ethereum’.A minority disagreed with the change and continued the blockchain according to its original rules, earning the title ‘ethereum classic’. A more accurate choice of names might be ‘ethereum compromised’ and ‘ethereum the pure’. Either way, democracy is democracy, and (the pragmatic and popular) ‘ethereum’ is now worth over 10x (the idealistic but sidelined) ‘ethereum classic’.Now, let’s consider a less benevolent way in which public blockchain immutability can be undermined. Recall that block creation or ‘mining’ in bitcoin and ethereum uses a proof-of-work scheme, in which a mathematical problem must be solved in order to generate a block and claim its reward. The value of this reward inevitably turns mining into an arms race, with miners competing to solve the problems faster. To compensate, the network periodically adjusts the difficulty to maintain a constant rate of block creation, once every 10 minutes in bitcoin or 15 seconds in ethereum.In the last five years, bitcoin’s difficulty has increased by a factor of 350,000 times. Today, the vast majority of bitcoin mining takes place on expensive specialized hardware, in locations where the weather is cold and electricity is cheap.For example, $1,089 will buy you an Antminer S9, which mines blocks 10,000 times faster than any desktop computer and burns 10 times more electricity. This is all a long way from the democratic ideals with which bitcoin was created, even if it does make the blockchain extremely secure.Well, kind of secure. If someone wanted to undermine the immutability of the bitcoin blockchain, here’s how they would do it. First, they would install more mining capacity than the rest of the network put together, creating a so-called ‘51% attack’. Second, instead of openly participating in the mining process, they would mine their own ‘secret branch’, containing whichever transactions they approve and censoring the rest. Finally, when the desired amount of time had passed, they would anonymously broadcast their secret branch to the network.Since the attacker has more mining power than the rest of the network, their branch will contain more proof-of-work than the public one. Every bitcoin node will therefore switch over, since the rules of bitcoin state that the more difficult branch wins. Any previously confirmed transactions not in the secret branch will be reversed, and the bitcoin they spent could be sent elsewhere.By now, most bitcoin believers will be laughing, because I wrote “install more mining capacity than the rest of the network put together” as if this is trivial to achieve. And they have a point, because of course it’s not easy, otherwise lots of people would already have done it. You need a lot of mining equipment, and a lot of electricity to power it, both of which cost a ton of money. But here’s the inconvenient fact that most bitcoiners brush over: for the government of any mid-size country, the money required is still small change.Let’s estimate the cost of a 51% attack which reverses a year of bitcoin transactions. At the current bitcoin price of $1,500 and reward of 15 bitcoins (including transaction fees) per 10-minute block, miners earn around $1.2bn per year ($1500 × 15 × 6 × 24 × 365). Assuming (reasonably) that they are not losing money overall, or at least not losing much, this means that total miner expenses must also be in the same range. (I’m simplifying here by amortizing the one-time cost of purchasing mining equipment, but $400m will buy you enough Antminer 9s to match the current bitcoin network’s mining capacity, so we’re in the right ball park.)Now, think about the reports that bitcoin is being used by Chinese citizens to circumvent their country’s capital controls. And consider further that the Chinese government’s tax revenues are approximately $3tn per year. Would a non-democratic country’s government spend 0.04% of its budget to shut down a popular method for illegally taking money out of that country?I wouldn’t claim that the answer is necessarily yes. But if you think the answer is definitely no, you’re being more than a little naive. Especially considering that China reportedly employs 2 million people to police internet content, which totals $10bn/year if we assume a low wage of $5,000. That puts the $1.2bn cost of reversing a year of bitcoin transactions in perspective.Even this analysis understates the problem, because the Chinese government could undermine the bitcoin network much more easily and cheaply. It appears that the majority of bitcoin mining takes place in China, due to low-cost hydroelectric power and other factors. Given a few tanks and platoons, China’s army could physically seize these bitcoin mining operations, and repurpose them to censor or reverse transactions. While the wider bitcoin world would undoubtedly notice, there’s nothing it could do without fundamentally altering the governance structure (and therefore nature) of bitcoin itself. What was that about censorship free money?None of this should be construed as a criticism of bitcoin’s design, or a prediction that a network catastrophe will actually happen. The bitcoin blockchain is a remarkable piece of engineering, perhaps even perfect for the purpose its creator(s) had in mind. And if I had to put money on it, I would bet that China and other governments probably won’t attack bitcoin in this way, because it’s not in their ultimate interest to do so. More likely, they’ll focus their wrath on its more untraceable cousins like dash, zcash and monero.Nonetheless, the mere possibility of this form of interference puts the cryptocurrency immutability doctrine in its place. The bitcoin blockchain and its ilk are not immutable in any perfect or absolute sense. Rather, they are immutable so long as nobody big enough and rich enough decides to destroy them. Still, by relying on the economic cost of subverting the network, cryptocurrency immutability satisfies the specific needs of people who don’t want to trust governments, companies and banks.It may not be perfect, but it’s the best they can do.Now let’s move on to private blockchains, designed for the needs of governments and large companies.We can begin by noting that, from the perspective of these organizations, immutability based on proof-of-work is a commercial, legal and regulatory non-starter, because it allows any (sufficiently rich) actor to anonymously attack the network. For institutions, immutability can only be grounded in the good behavior of other similar institutions, with whom they can sign a contract and sue if need be.As a bonus, private blockchains are far less costly to run, since blocks only need a simple digital signature from the nodes that approve them. So long as a majority of validator nodes are following the rules, the end result is stronger and cheaper immutability than any public cryptocurrency can offer.Of course, immutability is still easy to undermine if all the participants in a chain decide to do so together. Let’s imagine a private blockchain used by six hospitals to aggregate data on infections. A program in one hospital writes a large and erroneous data set to the chain, which is a source of inconvenience for the other participants. A few phone calls later, the IT departments of all the hospitals agree to ‘rewind’ their nodes back one hour, delete the problematic data, and then allow the chain to continue as if nothing happened.If all the hospitals agree to do this, who’s going to stop them? Indeed, apart from the staff involved, who will even know that it happened? (It should be noted that some consensus algorithms like PBFT don’t provide an official mechanism for rollbacks, but this doesn’t help with governance since nodes are still free to bypass the rules.)Now, consider a case where most of a private blockchain’s participants agree to rewind and remove some transaction, but a few withhold their consent. Since every organization’s node is under its ultimate control, nobody can force the minority to join the consensus. However, by sticking to their principles, these users will find themselves on a fork being ignored by everyone else.Like the virtuous proponents of ethereum classic, their place in heaven may well be assured. But back here on earth, they will be excluded from the consensus process for which the chain was deployed, and might as well give up completely. The only practical application of transactions outside the consensus is to serve as evidence in a court of law.With this in mind, let’s talk about the second case in which the doctrine of blockchain immutability has been used to ridicule ideas.Here, we’re referring to Accenture’s idea of using a chameleon hash to enable a block buried deep in a chain to be easily replaced. The primary motivation, as described by David Treat, is to allow an old problematic transaction to be quickly and efficiently removed. Under the scheme, if a block substitution does occur, a ‘scar’ is left behind which all participants can see. (It should be noted that any later transactions that depend on the deleted one would need to be removed as well.)It’s hard to overstate how many people attacked this idea when it was announced. Twitter and LinkedIn were aghast and aflutter. And I’m not just talking about the crypto crowd, which takes sporting pleasure in mocking anything related to enterprise blockchains. The idea was broadly slammed by private blockchain advocates as well.And yet, under the right conditions, the idea of allowing blockchains to be modified retroactively via chameleon hashes can make perfect sense. To understand why, we begin with a simple question: in this type of blockchain, who would actually have the power to replace old blocks? Clearly, it can’t be any unidentified network participant, because that would render the chain ungovernable.The answer is that a chameleon hash can only be used by those who hold its secret key. The key is required to enable a new version of a block, with different transactions, to be given the same chameleon hash as before. Of course, we probably don’t want centralized control in a blockchain, so we can make the scheme stronger by having multiple chameleon hashes per block, each of whose key is held by a different party. Or we might use secret sharing techniques to divide a single chameleon hash key between multiple parties. Either way, the chain can be configured so that a retroactive block substitution can only occur if a majority of key holders approve it. Is this starting to sound familiar?Allow me to render the parallel more explicit. Let’s say that we share control over chameleon hashes between those same validating nodes which are responsible for block creation. This means that an old block can only be replaced if a majority of validating nodes agree to do so. And yet, as we discussed earlier, any blockchain can already be retroactively modified by a majority of validating nodes, via the rewind and replay mechanism. So in terms of governance, chameleon hashes subject to a validator majority make no difference at all.If so, why bother with them? The answer is: performance optimization, because chameleon hashes allow old blocks to be substituted in a chain far more efficiently than before. Imagine that we need to remove a transaction from the start of a blockchain that has been running for five years. Perhaps this is due to the European Union’s right to be forgotten legislation, which allows individuals to have their personal data removed from companies’ records. Nodes can’t just wipe the offending transaction from their disks, because that would change the corresponding block’s hash and break a link in the chain.The next time the blockchain was scanned or shared, everything would fall apart.To solve this problem without chameleon hashes, nodes would have to rewrite the early block without the problematic transaction, calculate the block’s new hash, then change the hash embedded in the next block to match. But this would also affect the next block’s own hash, which must be recalculated and updated in the subsequent block, and so on all the way along the chain.While this mechanism is possible in principle, it could take hours or days to complete in a blockchain with millions of blocks and transactions. Even worse, while engaged in this process, a node may be incapable of processing new incoming network activity.So chameleon hashes provide a far more computationally efficient way to achieve the same goal. If you imagine a bad transaction as a rock buried many miles underground, chameleon hashes can teleport the rock to the surface, instead of making us dig all the way down, retrieve the rock and fill in the hole.By reviewing the risks of proof-of-work blockchains and the technical value of chameleon hashes, I hope to have convinced you that blockchain immutability is far more nuanced than a yes or no question.To quote Simon Taylor quoting Ian Grigg, the question must always be: “Who are you and what do you want to achieve?”For cryptocurrency believers who want to avoid government-issued money and the traditional banking system, it makes perfect sense to believe in a public proof-of-work blockchain, whose immutability rests on economics rather than trusted parties. Even if they must live with the possibility of a large government (or other wealthy actor) bringing down the network, they can take solace in the fact that this would be a painful and expensive operation. And no doubt they hope that cryptocurrencies will only get more secure, as their value and mining capacity continues to grow.On the other hand, for enterprises and other institutions that want to safely share a database across organizational boundaries, proof-of-work immutability makes no sense at all. Not only is it astoundingly expensive, but it allows any sufficiently motivated participant to anonymously seize control of the chain and censor or reverse transactions. What these users need is immutability grounded in the good behavior of a majority of identified validator nodes, backed by contracts and law.Finally, for most permissioned blockchain use cases, we probably don’t want validator nodes to be able to easily and cheaply substitute old blocks in the chain. As Dave Birch said at the time, “The way to correct a wrong debit is with a correct credit”, rather than pretending that the debit never took place.Nonetheless, for those cases where we do need the extra flexibility, chameleon hashes help make blockchains a practical choice.This article was originally published on the MultiChain blog and has been reposted here with the author’s permission.

Yet they hit a roadblock last year, after US District Judge Joseph Rodriguez questioned whether the New Jersey court actually had jurisdiction in the matter.As reported at the time by the New Jersey Law Journal, the judge focused on the question of whether mining contracts sold by Lab Rat constituted “bonds” as argued by the plaintiffs. Rodriguez also moved to deflect a bid by the defendants to have the suit dismissed.A new court order indicates that the years-long legal effort is now progressing.On 30th March, Rodriguez sided with the plaintiffs, stating in an opinion that they had successfully argued that the court does, in fact, have jurisdiction over the case.“In light of the allegations set forth in the chart and the additional details provided in the proposed Second Amended Complaint, the Court is satisfied that it has diversity of citizenship subject matter jurisdiction and the amendment is not futile,” Rodriguez wrote.Justice image via Shutterstock"

In turn, IoT devices in the NeuroMesh net would run an SPV client which reads only transactions signed by NeuroMesh, and execute the commands contained in the OP_RETURN data.Because data is propagated between bitcoin nodes in a decentralized manner, in theory reading these commands does not give any further information about the location of the server which originally issued them.Dr Michael Siegel, Associate Director of MIT’s IC3 cybersecurity consortium and a research advisor for the NeuroMesh project, says that Li and Falco’s work comes out of a tradition of research into secure communication between distributed systems.“It’s a clever use of a small piece of code that can run on many types of devices,” Siegel told CoinDesk.He continued:“It’s a great idea: not totally new, but, in the IoT space, the combination of what they’re doing with botnets, blockchain and central command is something new they’ve established, and appears to be an extremely secure environment for managing small distributed devices.”Falco also confirmed that the uniqueness of the NeuroMesh offering is in finding a new use for existing practices.“While what we’re doing is new from a commercial standpoint, there’s been several case studies of white-hat security researchers doing what we’re doing to close vulnerabilities in a system,” he said.Roman Sinayev, a security software engineer who designs anti-malware systems at Juniper Networks, is familiar with the concepts behind the NeuroMesh project (although he’s not seen the software in action).Assuming the code is written without any exploitable errors, then the result would be a secure communication channel, Sinayev said.Further, he pointed out that blockchain isn’t required to hide communications.“[A]nother way would be any kind of P2P programme like BitTorrent,” he said. “You could also use many different proxy servers and change the IPs, or you could use some intermediate service – embed information in pictures on a public channel, for example.”Without having seen the code, Sinayev stressed that it’s impossible to verify that the NeuroMesh product works exactly as described. However, he suggested that (as with all security software) best practice would be to have an independent audit once the product is finalised.On a similarly cautionary note, MIT’s Dr Siegel pointed out that technology is not always the weakest point of a system, saying:“Underlying this is a very secure system with sound technology and difficult to break security. But this doesn’t stop humans from doing really dumb things! On the end of it, you’ll have someone who controls the passwords and controls access, and that person could always do something stupid.”Even factoring in human error, the bitcoin network has proven to be extremely resistant to malicious activity, and it’s this property that Falco and Li are hoping to tap into with their IoT product.Li said:“We call it ‘unhackable’ because to date, the bitcoin blockchain hasn’t been hacked.”World baby image via Flickr"

Over that span, bitcoin has been largely in the green, spurred by a diversity of factors on which analysts haven’t found much to agree.The pause in price growth may be stunning, if only for the fact bitcoin has been consistently setting new all-time highs in recent trading sessions.Analyst and trader Jacob Eliosoff, for instance, downplayed bitcoin’s off-day, positioning it in perspective of bitcoin’s overall gains. The price of one bitcoin is up over $700 so far this year, and up nearly $1,300 since May of last year, BPI data shows.Still, Elisoff pointed to data that suggests bitcoin’s historic corrections have been swift.He told CoinDesk:“A natural question is, when the correction does come, how far will it drop? I don’t know, but in the past they’ve been huge.”Others projected that the price may simply be consolidating after a period of intense growth, with over-the-counter trader Charlie Shrem reporting that he believes this to be the case.Shrem pointed to bitcoin’s long-term value projections as evidence the market isn’t “satisfied” even with the current price observed today.And as the momentum subsides, some worry that bitcoin’s past problems may now become more visible. For example, with litecoin having recently upgraded its code to scale its transaction capacity, it’s possible bitcoin’s scaling debate could soon again heat up.“I think bitcoin will be worth $5,000 or $10,000 in a few years time, but it can’t get there unless we get past this scaling debate, and short-term price rallies only serve to delay us dealing with this reality,” said angel investor and entrepreneur Vinny Lingham.Lingham went on to note that price spikes of any severity are also more likely to make bitcoin’s limited throughput apparent. “The rewards per block keep going up,” he remarked.Data from Bitnodes now suggests it costs about 240 satoshis to clear 1 byte of transactions on the network, meaning average transaction fees are now above $1.Charles Hayer, CEO of digital currency data website CryptoCompare, agreed with Lingham.“In terms of capacity bitcoin is straining at the seams, whilst litecoin is streets ahead in terms of forward thinking and governance,” he said.While still conjecture, the comments point to potentially troubled waters ahead – or big gains if an upgrade can finally be made.Charles Bovaird contributed reporting.Shuttlecock image via Shutterstock"

It uses the bitcoin blockchain as means to notarize transactions, creating a publicly available record trail for later referral.Carlo Brezigia, information security officer for the bank, explained:“Relevant data has been hashed to produce a short unique identifier – a digest – equivalent to its digital fingerprint. This fingerprint has been associated to a blockchain transaction and hence registered on the blockchain: the blockchain immutability provides robust non-refutable timestamping that will always prove without any doubt the existence of that data in that specific status at that precise moment in time.”The bank tested the tool between October and February, according to Deloitte, and the firm said that future plans include support for multiple blockchains, potentially including private ones.The trial notably showcases a willingness on the part of a regulated financial institution to experiment with a public blockchain. In a statement, Gianni Cavallina, the bank’s retail innovation accelerator officer, spoke to both the interest in testing such protocols beyond the use case of digital currency.“In particular, considering public blockchains, we are exploring the applicability of different use cases, abstracting from the value of its native digital currency. Notarization is one of the most interesting application[s],” Cavallina said.Intesa Sanpaolo – a member of the R3 distributed ledger consortium – has tested a number of blockchain use cases in the past, including trade finance and digital identity.Image via ShutterstockCorrection: Grammatical error"

First launched in January this year, Dandelion is currently running on the bitcoin testnet for trial and feedback. More information can be found in the official Bitcoin Improvement Proposal here.According to an email on the bitcoin development mailing list written by Zcash advisor and University of Illinois assistant professor Andrew Miller, the project is aimed at obscuring the original source IP of each bitcoin transaction by breaking the transaction proceeds into two phases: “stem” and “fluff”.As Miller explained:“During the stem phase, each node relays the transaction to a single peer. After a random number of hops along the stem, the transaction enters the fluff phase, which behaves just like ordinary transaction flooding/diffusion. Even when an attacker can identify the location of the fluff phase, it is much more difficult to identify the source of the stem.”According to the letter, Dandelion’s backers also include a faculty member from University of Illinois, Pramod Viswanath; two graduate students, Surya Bakshi, Shaileshh Bojja Venkatakrishnan; and one post-doctoral student, Giulia Fanti.The work has taken place amidst the wider backdrop of development around privacy improvements, a goal to which projects such as MimbleWimble have advanced in recent months.Image via ShutterstockDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Zcash Company. "

scaling debate, Bitcoin Core developer and Blockstream CTO Greg ...","Apr 13, 2017 at 13:59 UTC",“I’m sort of being scooped on the details by people just working it out for themselves now.”,"Despite kickstarting another fierce period in bitcoin’s now years-long scaling debate, Bitcoin Core developer and Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell admits even he’s a bit lost in the narrative he created last week.That’s when Maxwell posted a public note alleging an unnamed miner (largely assumed to be China-based Bitmain) was secretly using a more efficient mining technique, giving them an upper hand over other miners. Thickening the plot was that he alleged that this was the reason the company doesn’t support Segregated Witness (SegWit), a preferred technical solution to the network’s capacity issues that would accidentally turn off the technique.With the post, Maxwell unintentionally kicked off a grassroots movement in support of pushing SegWit through by way of circumventing miners altogether, the latest in a long line of new technical proposals.Called a user-activated soft fork (UASF), there are currently at least two groups working on a form of the idea, with a mess of discussion about whether the network can and should make technical upgrades in this way.Still, Maxwell argues that this process, by which users and node operators aim to quarterback technical changes, might be the preferred way to make upgrades to the network in certain instances.Maxwell told CoinDesk:“Ultimately, I think if we had a crystal ball and could get anything we wanted, we’d want to use UASFs always.”But, is a UASF safe? While there’s been an upsurge in support, the upgrading method is controversial.Maxwell mentioned, as others have, that the change requires “very, very broad” support from the ecosystem. Yet, the trouble is, it’s difficult to measure what bitcoin users really want and if there is such support.Many point to bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) 16 as a successful UASF, but it’s actually one example where the method didn’t go entirely smoothly. After activation, one pool mined invalid blocks for a couple of months (although, perhaps to its disadvantage and no one else’s).That’s one reason that developers have been using a different method, Maxwell said. It’s easier to deploy a consensus-level rule change if miners commit to upgrading and enforcing those rules.Despite those challenges, Maxwell contended that some form of a UASF might be the best option right now.If some miners are indeed running AsicBoost – the alternative mining method Bitmain is accused of employing – it poses a conflict of interest, as they don’t want to push through a fix for economic reasons, he contends.And, in his opinion, there are other tradeoffs to think about:“Not taking an upgrade has a cost too. As a community we have to balance those things.“On that basis, Maxwell advocates for a form of a UASF to fix mining practice profiled in his mailing list post, but with a slower rollout than others have proposed. Maxwell said that discussions are still ongoing and it will probably be a few months before developers start writing the code.For now, however, other groups are seeking faster solutions.One UASF proposal, BIP 148, the one with a website and a Twitter account, is gaining support with announcements that certain companies are in favor of the idea currently dominating social media. (Fifteen percent of bitcoin companies now support the BIP, up from five percent on Monday, according to one measure.)Maxwell is more cautious, though.“They’re proposing time frames that I think the regular developers are not quite as comfortable with,” he said. But, he didn’t write off the effort.“Ultimately, bitcoin is owned by its users and by the people who own bitcoin,” he said. “I’m very interested in seeing where this stuff goes.”Overall, Maxwell discussed the process in a largely academic tone, taking the recent developments as simply part and parcel to the kind of decision making that he seems to suggest is natural for a disparate community.Stories about life-changing hugs aside, community discussions have been tense amid the block-size debate, with discussion dominating Twitter and Reddit at a constant clip.One of the most obvious questions now is, what will come of the accusations against Bitmain? As for how and where the community could find the missing pieces of the story, Maxwell didn’t have an answer. He noted, however, that others have replicated his findings, posting them to Reddit.Further, although he plans to release more information about the chip in question, he said it’s not a priority because Bitmain already disclosed that it has used AsicBoost on its chip for testing.Bitmain has denied that it is conducting its mining operations as alleged, and that this is the reason it does not support SegWit.For all the contention this past week, Maxwell was largely optimistic when discussing the network’s future outlook, framing the ongoing debate as necessary.“It’s a consensus system after all,” he said, concluding:“I think people often get a little too caught up in the disputes, where really, that’s just part of the process. It’s natural. And, ultimately, it’s what makes bitcoin strong and secure.”Greg Maxwell image via CoinDesk"

At the time, the startup made the argument that a charter would enable it to offer services in more states without applying for licenses state by state.The approval comes two months after Washington passed Senate Bill 5031, which requires some digital currency businesses to comply with the state money transmitter laws and exchanges to obtain licenses.The new rules will become effective from 23rd July, 2017.While a small update, the decision has potentially major implications for cryptocurrency startups that may be classed as money services businesses or money transmitters.In response to the passage of the bill, Gemini competitors including Poloniex and Bitfinex announced they would no longer do business with customers residing in Washington.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Paxos.Washington flag image via Shutterstock"

Conducted at the Blockchain Expo in Berlin, Germany, the single transaction went across public blockchains, private blockchains, a centralized ledger and a traditional payment channel.While no single transaction would likely ever require so many ledger integrations, Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas said the purpose of the demo was to show future users that traditional channels can work in harmony with distributed ledgers.Thomas said:“We think that’s where the future is going. We think that in the future all different ledgers will be tied together and transactions will be very seamless. So we want to make sure that our customers are going to be set up for success in that world.”In addition to the newly open-sourced bitcoin and Chain integrations, an Interledger transaction for a “relatively small” value was also conducted with Ripple’s native currency, XRP, using both an XRP escrow and an XRP payment channel. Ethereum, Ripple’s centralized Five Bells Ledger and a so-called ‘trustline’ were also used in the transaction.The payment was converted from fiat to ether to XRP to euros, depending on the payment channels, with Interledger’s connectors converting the currency and forwarding the payments from one ledger to another.The Interledger demonstration is part of an overall industry trend towards merging blockchains –one that has gained significant momentum this year.In the last month alone, Blockstack launched its decentralized browser designed to let any number of blockchains mesh into a distributed version of the internet, and 0x launched an alpha version of its token trading platform built to allow decentralized applications to seamlessly interact by instantly exchanging their native tokens.Co-inventor of the ILP and managing director of Ripple’s Luxembourg office, Evan Schwartz, positions the demonstration as part of a bigger-picture push to show blockchain interoperability has moved past being just a good idea.“What this shows is that with this kind of architecture that Interledger has, it’s not just about integrating two ledgers, it’s about doing this across many types of ledgers,” Schwartz said.Ripple initially released the ILP in October 2015, at a time when banks were even more wary about doing business with cryptocurrencies and had only just begun to explore non-cryptocurrency applications of blockchain technology.Since the launch, banks have shown increasing interest in working with a wide range of distributed, shared databases and specifically blockchains, even if their willingness to transact in cryptocurrency remains largely stifled by concerns surrounding know-your-customer (KYC) compliance.Ripple has, in part, helped overcome this reluctance by working with banks to build a wide range of early-stage products relying on its distributed ledger technology, but not its native currency.Going forward though, that could change if the hesitance surrounding cryptocurrency lessens. This seems likely, because some banks around the world have already begun accommodating bitcoin companies that want to open fiat accounts. Ripple itself has even started building bank applications that rely on XRP, so the company seems to be preparing for a future of much broader acceptance.“Bitcoin is one of the most widely used and one of the most well-known ledgers,” said Thomas. “So any interoperability protocol has to be measured by [whether] it supports bitcoin, if it supports XRP, if it supports ethereum.”By the end of today, Ripple expects an eighth connector to be built at the Berlin event, one that would enable integration with litecoin. The process, according to Ripple executives, would take only a slight tweak of the bitcoin tool’s code.The firm further said a building session will take place, one in which it expects technologists from zcash, Lightning Network, GateHub, BigchainDB, PayPal and Monax’s Hyperledger Burrow to create yet more plug-ins.Zcash and Monax have confirmed to CoinDesk that each will have a blockchain engineer in attendance to assist with the work.Thomas concluded:“We want to make our customers happy, we want to act in the interest of our customers, and so part of that on our side – we’re all in the research department –  means thinking about what our customers are going to want before they even realize it.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Chain.Patchwork quilt image via Shutterstock"

Doge, Dash, Litecoin, Stellar, Gnosis … practically every coin has surged.”He further cautioned that this development is “a sign of unthinking buyers that will sell as soon as the tide turns.”Daniel Masters, director of the regulated investment vehicle Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund (GABI), offered similar sentiment, emphasizing that even cryptocurrencies with smaller market caps – like litecoin, ether, namecoin and ripple – have all experienced strong gains over the last few months.He told CoinDesk that he believes “sentiment [is] too strong,” noting that between this and record prices for cryptocurrencies, a bubble may be forming.While the aforementioned analysts provided cautious viewpoints, other market observers were more optimistic, asserting that cryptocurrency prices have significant room to appreciate despite current prices.Harry Yeh, managing partner of Binary Financial, took a bullish slant, telling CoinDesk that “there’s still quite a ways to move” as more investors take note of big gains in the sector.Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Currency Fund, also spoke to the market’s potential. “I would agree that prices have increased too far too fast, but I don’t think it’s a serious problem – more like a buying opportunity,” he said.He elaborated on this statement, pointing out that it is challenging to determine the “true value” of a cryptocurrency:“I’m not sure I would label it a bubble, at least not yet. It’s quite difficult to definitively state what the intrinsic value is or should be of an altcoin,” he said, adding:“Property is worth what people are willing to pay for it.”One strong indicator of the bullish sentiment is robust trading. While transaction volume for many of the digital assets listed on Coinmarketcap has risen, over-the-counter (OTC) trading firms have also reported an increase in activity.Martin Garcia, vice president of Genesis Global Trading, noted that his New York-based firm is experiencing such an improvement.“Our new applications are up significantly, and old clients are circling back as well,” Garcia said.Ryan Rabaglia, head trader for Octagon Strategy, expressed similar sentiment.“Our desk has had [a threefold] volume increase over the last few months and over the last few weeks we’re onboarding new counterparties at a record rate,” he said.Finally, Rabaglia spoke to the changing demands of his customers, emphasizing that while bitcoin and ether are still the “hottest names,” his trading desk has repeatedly received requests for trades involving lesser-known alternative cryptocurrencies such as ZEC, DASH, ETC and XRP.Ultimately, he characterized the current market as one with abundant opportunities for his business.He concluded:“Up to this point we’ve dabbled in each and are considering dedicating more resources if the demand persists.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Genesis Global Trading.Soap bubble image via Shutterstock"

Even this CoinDesk article is stored on a server controlled by a company that charges to hold this data should it be called upon.This setup has a number of conveniences, as these companies deploy teams of specialists to help store and secure this data, and remove the costs that come with hosting and uptime.But with this convenience, there is also vulnerability. As we’ve learned, a hacker or a government can gain unwelcome access to your files without your knowledge, by influencing or attacking a third-party service – meaning they can steal, leak or change important information.Brian Behlendorf, creator of the Apache Web Server, has gone so far as to label this centralized design the “original sin” of the Internet. Some like Behlendorf argue the Internet was always meant to be decentralized, and a splintered movement has sprung up around using new tools, including blockchain technology, to help achieve this goal.Ethereum is one of the newest technologies to join this movement.While bitcoin aims to disrupt PayPal and online banking, ethereum has the goal of using a blockchain to replace internet third parties — those that store data, transfer mortgages and keep track of complex financial instruments.In short, ethereum wants to be a ‘World Computer’ that would decentralize – and some would argue, democratize – the existing client-server model.With ethereum, servers and clouds are replaced by thousands of so-called “nodes” run by volunteers from across the globe (thus forming a “world computer”).The vision is that ethereum would enable this same functionality to people anywhere around the world, enabling them to compete to offer services on top of this infrastructure.Scrolling through a typical app store, for example, you’ll see a variety of colorful squares representing everything from banking to fitness to messaging apps. These apps rely on the company (or another third-party service) to store your credit card information, purchasing history and other personal data – somewhere, generally in servers controlled by third-parties.Your choice of apps is of course also governed by third parties, as Apple and Google maintain and curate (or in some cases, censor) the specific apps you’re able to download.Take the example of an online document service like Evernote or Google Docs.Ethereum, if all goes according to plan, would return control of the data in these types of services to its owner and the creative rights to its author.The idea is that one entity will no longer have control over your notes and that no one could suddenly ban the app itself, temporarily taking all of your notebooks offline. Only the user can make changes, not any other entity.In theory, it combines the control that people had over their information in the past with the easy-to-access information that we’re used to in the digital age. Each time you save edits, or add or delete notes, every node on the network makes the change.It’s worth noting that the idea has been met with skepticism.Although the apps appear to be possible, it’s unclear which blockchain applications will actually prove useful, secure, or scalable, and if they will ever be as convenient to use as the apps we use today.Authored by Alyssa Hertig; Images by Maria Kuznetsov"

Others, too, saw impressive gains that occurred relatively quickly in recent weeks.All told, the cryptocurrencies posted a median price increase (in USD terms) of 180.56% over the course of the quarter.The two top performers from Q1 2017 were Decred (DCR) and Golem (GNT), which gained 2,410.6% and 835.5%, respectively.Decred is a cryptocurrency that uses a hybridized consensus system instead of relying on either solely proof-of-work (POS) or proof-of-stake (POW). Similar to bitcoin, the DCR protocol sets a 21 million cap to the number of coins generated on the network.Currently, the largest trading pair for DCR is DCR/BTC. Poloniex serves as the largest marketplace for DCR trading. The majority of DCR’s gains came toward the end of the quarter, and the highest daily volume was achieved on 27 March with $14.03m.As for Golem, most of its gains came during the latter half of Q1. Cryptocurrency exchange announced markets for the token on 17th February, and following the announcement, the price rose approximately 100% with 48 hours, from $.02 to $.04 on 19th February, with a volume of $6.67m.Prior to the Poloniex announcement, average daily volume was between $20k and $100k per day.A second spike in price occurred on 21st March, following the release of news that GNT would be integrated into Shapeshift.io, an altcoin exchange platform. That particular day, the price increased approximately 22% from $0.045 to $0.055 on $5.28m in 24-hour volume.The final day of Q1, Golem developer Grzegorz Borowik published a blog post announcing Golem for macOS. The news buoyed the market, which boosted GNT to an all-time-high of $0.094 on volume of $11.4m.Bitcoin’s performance in the first quarter was more muted.The CoinMarketCap’s Bitcoin Dominance Index – which measures bitcoin’s market share relative to other cryptocurrencies – shed nearly 20%, ending the quarter at 68%. A weakening Bitcoin Dominance Index points to investor preference for alternative cryptocurrencies.Bitcoin (BTC) gained just 7.8% over the course of the quarter. This was a noticeable decrease from its 35.4% gain in Q4 2016.General fear, uncertainty and doubt has permeated the bitcoin community and can arguably be blamed for the anemic performance of the cryptocurrency in comparison to alternatives.Furthermore, bitcoin’s volatility has tapered off as a result of its maturation, coupled with the evolving narrative that the cryptocurrency is a safe-haven asset.Chart image via ShutterstockDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

Brazilian law, though a federal law issued a definition of digital currency 
by ...","Jun 11, 2017 at 08:00 UTC","Jonathan Darcie has a PhD and Masters in General Theory of Law and Tax Law, and is partner of a law firm in Brazil with ongoing consulting for digital currency businesses.","In this CoinDesk opinion piece, Darcie speaks out about proposed cryptocurrency rules in Brazil, arguing that attempts to regulate the industry at this stage are premature and misguided.Living in Brazil over the last four years has been an experience of watching a real and live – and even more interesting, some would say – version of TV’s “House of Cards”.The still in-course criminal investigation called ‘Operação Lava Jato‘ (Operation Car Wash) has become the most comprehensive criminal investigation in the history of Brazil, sending many dozens of politicians, CEOs and executives of the most important Brazilian companies to prison.At the same time, the country has entered the most intense recession of its history, leading businesses to bankruptcy, millions of people to unemployment and setting up a scenario of economic chaos.It is within this window of never-seen-before-events (the last one being a wiretap of the actual president of Brazil) that the Brazilian House of Representatives is doing something else unprecedented – initiating a debate about regulating bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.When reading the news that a legislative commission will study and regulate cryptocurrencies, one might have the impression that local startups will now have limitless freedom to transact and form businesses.Unfortunately, that’s not even close to the reality of any business in Brazil.As it happens with nations that have their legal system built under a civil law tradition, every innovation that emerges joins the current status quo to become legally equivalent of other similar technologies.Back in 2009, if someone living under Brazilian law made his or her first transaction buying and selling bitcoin at a profit, they had to pay (or should have paid) income tax in order of 15% of its capital gains (unless the total amount involved was less than to R$35,000 ($10,600) in a month, when a tax exemption was applicable).This means the current situation is the same for cryptocurrencies as it is for guitars, books or any other goods involved in transactions.Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were never legal currencies under Brazilian law, though a federal law issued a definition of digital currency by declaring it as a resource stored in a device or electronic system.As this definition didn’t capture the nature of cryptocurrencies in general – covering private cryptographic keys instead of ‘digital currency’ itself – their legal status is given by Brazilian Civil Code, which defines them as regular assets. Being a movable asset means that transactions are possible without any kind of restriction – except for the duty of paying taxes and declaring its property to Brazilian IRS.For businesses, the requirements are a bit more complicated.It’s not easy to have a business in Brazil. Anyone wanting to do so needs to hire an accountant and a lawyer to prepare a contract equivalent to the articles of organization in the US. Afterwards, there is the need to obtain a taxpayer ID issued by the federal, state and municipal governments.Small businesses are obliged to deliver monthly and annual income information for tax purposes (normally to more than one branch), including information about employees. The obligations more than double for larger businesses.The exact same process is applied to digital currency businesses. It doesn’t matter if we are speaking of an exchange, wallet or payment service: there is not much freedom involved.But differently from most businesses, cryptocurrency-related ventures that deal directly with large sums of money, securities, art, jewelry or other assets are subject to very specific duties regarding anti-money laundering policies and compliance in general.These obligations and duties were enacted in 1998 through a federal law written more than 10 years before the first bitcoin transaction happened.It is therefore required that digital currency businesses comply with strict compliance policies and keep logs of transactions made within its field of operation, reporting activities considered suspicious to the federal council that controls financial activities.Considering the intent of congress to specifically regulate cryptocurrencies, most people at this point might be asking: “What is left to be regulated?”Congressmen involved in the special commission gave statements covering tax aspects and the relation of digital currencies with criminal activities, though this suggests they don’t have a strong familiarity with the current legal status of cryptocurrencies.It’s notable then that the timing of the debate follows a recent kidnapping in which criminals asked for the ransom to be paid with monero and z-cash. Just a few weeks later, the WannaCry ransomware attack struck international organizations, bringing negative attention to bitcoin.It may have seemed like an opportunity for Congress to present the public opinion with a (supposedly) good agenda.First presented in 2015, the discussed bill adds nothing to the digital currency legal environment.There are three goals in the bill:So as long as the bill passes in the current form, owners and businesses should be just fine.Given the tradition of complicating things and the Brazilian actual political crisis, however, ‘just fine’ might be simply too much to ask for.Brazilian federal court image via Shutterstock"

fix. But because of this roadblock, some in the bitcoin community are ...","Apr 11, 2017 at 17:20 UTC",It seems to be one thing after another for bitcoin.,"Amid the long-standing debate, one well-known bitcoin developer recently posted a note to the project’s mailing list alleging a major mining entity is prolonging the debate over scaling because it would accidentally wipe out a technical advantage that gives it an upperhand over other miners.It’s unclear his claims are true. Even supporters admit there isn’t hard evidence, and many others are skeptical.Despite this, many in the community think there’s enough circumstantial evidence to back it up, and a grassroots movement is growing in the hopes of pushing through the change that miners are now being accused of blocking.Normally, miners are the ones that are tasked with pushing through such a fix. But because of this roadblock, some in the bitcoin community are calling for a different (more experimental, yet older) method of making a change to bitcoin based on support of the so-called “economic majority”, instead of miner support.The change is known as a “user-activated soft fork”, or a UASF.Coinkite CEO and co-founder Rodolfo Novak, an advocate for the nascent movement, said it aims to correct perceived inequities that have so far dominated the years-long scaling discussion.He told CoinDesk:“Miners trying to centralize bitcoin is an unacceptable thing. It goes against what bitcoin is supposed to be. This UASF is really like saying, ‘No, we control bitcoin, not you.'”And, support appears to be growing. There’s a website and a Twitter. There are UASF hats.Though the code isn’t safe to run yet, some volunteers running nodes are now flagging support with their nodes. Volunteers who run nodes can signal their support by adding a line to their node configuration file.Since the allegations were made last Wednesday, node support for the change has grown to 4.8%, or by about six times.But, since the code isn’t ready yet, and users are just showing support, does it really mean anything?“On a technical level, signaling it that way does absolutely nothing, it does however help the case on a social level and prevents users from running an outdated version of the code when enforcing starts,” developer Damian Mee argued.Beyond just gauging users’ support, some unidentified developers are allegedly testing and reviewing the reference implementation put forward by the pseudonymous shaolinfry in the proposal BIP 148.But, so far they’re secretive about it, and are waiting to see if people flag support for the change or not. (Though, one contributor delivered a reddit AMA on Monday.)That said, there’s a long been back and forth on the topic of this metric because node counts are easy to spoof.For example, one entity can spin up a bunch of nodes in a data center in a sybil attack, as it’s formally known.So, simple node count might not be the best indicator. Due to how a UASF works, it could be necessary to have explicit support from the “economic majority,” or exchanges, wallets, and other bitcoin economic players.And, support from key economic players is so far at about 6% since the BIP was put out on March 12th (by one metric), admittedly sparse. Though, others are allegedly on the way, many are starting to announce their company’s support via reddit.However, Novak pointed out that a sizable percentage of bitcoin nodes are running Bitcoin Core, and the versions with SegWit, which he thinks is a good indicator that the fuzzily-defined “economic majority” supports SegWit, and thus a UASF version of it.This is perhaps notable given that the code is backwards-compatible, so the 80% of nodes that are currently ready for SegWit, would also be ready for the change.Given this, Novak said he’s “very optimistic” the plan to scale the network could ultimately work.Again, there’s while there’s a reference code implementation, it hasn’t been fully tested and reviewed yet. The original activation date for SegWit was put at October 1st, 2017, but shaolinfry, recently moved it up to 1st August, meaning, if the community supports the proposal, that miners need to signal support for SegWit by that date, or they will fork off the network would need to upgrade.If it sounds dangerous or as if the idea is being rushed along, many believe it is. It’s highly possible that the current aura of confidence in the proposal is the result of high tensions.Others are proceeding more cautiously, as shown in one bitcoin developer chatroom.“I’d say we want [it], if we think there is community support,” said lead Bitcoin Core maintainer Wladimir van der Laan, when asked if developers should consider coding up Maxwell’s suggested BIP.Bitcoin Core contributor Pieter Wuille mentioned that it’s “complicated” to determine when that threshold is met.“Whether that BIP is the best solution to that is indeed open, indeed makes sense for the dust to settle on that, though it may still make sense to have actual code,” Van der Laan added later.In the mailing list thread where he outlined his allegations against the miner in question, Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell proposed using the method, but agreed that going through with it would depend on the level of support from the community.Yet another development is that some developers are calling for a UASF on litecoin, a smaller blockchain by market cap, as both a way to get it on SegWit, and as a way to “test” how a UASF would pan out should it prove to be as divisive as other proposals.But like past attempts to scale bitcoin, it remains to be seen if cooler heads, or strong passions, will prevail.USAF hat image via Twitter"

largest in terms of market cap, it could lose this position soon enough, ...","Jun 9, 2017 at 13:00 UTC",,"Ether prices are on the move, and they’re headed north.The cryptocurrency, which powers the world’s second-largest blockchain, ethereum, has seen its price rise more than 3,000% year-to-date and roughly 180% in the last month, according to data from CoinMarketCap.Yet, amid this rise, and increase in investor attention, many are wondering how the digital asset’s price will perform going forward. That answer, though, may not be exactly clear.When polled, crypto market analysts provided mixed opinions. Some asserted that ether could experience significant upside in the future, even going so far as to suggest its market capitalization (market cap) could surpass that of bitcoin, long the market’s progenitor and leader.Others, however, warned that ether’s price may have become inflated as the broader cryptocurrency space has drawn robust inflows.One crucial factor affecting ether’s price is the rise of initial coin offerings (ICOs) – sales of blockchain-linked data that allow investors to exchange ether for newly created digital tokens.Some of these offerings have generated significant visibility by selling millions of dollars-worth of tokens in minutes. As a result, ether’s value is “hugely related” to these offerings, according to Brad Chun, chief investment officer of hedge fund Shuttle Fund Advisor.Chun told CoinDesk he believes some companies are simply holding the ether tokens raised through these sales, since retaining the digital assets is more profitable than spending them on projects.By holding ether tokens instead of spending them, these firms could be placing upward pressure on the cryptocurrency’s price, he speculated.Marius Rupsys, cryptocurrency trader and co-founder of fintech startup InvoicePool, offered similar sentiment. He stated that while most ICOs let investors use bitcoin or ether to purchase digital tokens, some choose ether, a) because they are afraid of missing out and b) its transactions take place more quickly.“This keeps many ethers locked up in new projects and [fewer] ethers are available for trading,” he explained.Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of BitMEX, also emphasized how these offerings are affecting ether’s price. “The value of ether is directly related to the value of [ICOs] listed on the [ethereum] protocol,” he told CoinDesk.Hayes stated that if more highly successful ICOs list on this platform, ether’s price could experience significant gains.“If we get more instant sell outs like [Brave’s BAT token], the ether price is a bargain at the moment,” he continued.Hayes was certainly not the only one to offer a bullish forecast for ether, as some analysts have predicted that the alternative asset protocol will surpass bitcoin, a milestone event they inferred might take place in 2017.At the time of report, ether’s market cap was roughly $24bn, more than half that of bitcoin’s $45.8bn, CoinMarketCap figures reveal. Bitcoin’s share of the total market cap for all cryptocurrencies has been declining lately, standing at roughly 45% at press time. (This is after hovering above 80% during most of the time for which market data is available.)While bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to scale, and has long been the largest in terms of market cap, it could lose this position soon enough, said Tim Enneking, managing director of Crypto Asset Management.“I think ether will overtake bitcoin, probably before the end of the year,” he stated.Enneking is not alone in this belief, as Sebastian Limeres, a cryptocurrency advocate and Argentine attorney, also predicted that ether’s market cap will surpass that of bitcoin either this year or next.He said:“Ether is the next big thing for being a platform, same as Oracle is to software.”While some market observers are clearly bullish about ether’s future prospects, not everyone is so optimistic. Some analysts have warned that ether’s price may have grown overvalued.Their concern is understandable, as the price of many cryptocurrencies has skyrocketed in recent months and ether could simply be one more alternative asset protocol that has surged as a result. The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies surpassed $100bn for the first time ever this month, which represented an increase of more than 100% in less than 30 days, CoinMarketCap figures show.“We’re fresh off a speculative bubble across crypto assets, so true valuations won’t make much sense right now,” Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged cryptocurrency trading platform Whaleclub, told CoinDesk. He added: “I think ether is leading the pack in this crypto-inflated bubble.”Zivkovski further asserted that investors are making speculative bets on ether.“Many investors are betting on ethereum for its future potential, not its current network effects. They see bitcoin as a slow and inflexible cryptocurrency, while ether is adaptable, able to host and run decentralized systems and organizations, and has the backing of a team and corporations with a vision.”Jacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager, told CoinDesk that ether’s value may be a bit too high.“I agree that ether seems inflated,” he said. “As a newcomer I’d be very wary of buying in at these prices, but for long-term holders, [it is] safer to ignore the rollercoaster and just hold tight.”While many analysts took sides as to whether ether’s price is inflated, Rupsys took a more neutral stance, asserting that it is very difficult to answer whether the cryptocurrency is overvalued.He commented on the supply side, emphasizing that very few ether tokens are available for sale. On the demand side, several factors might provide tailwinds for the cryptocurrency, noted Rupsys. Chinese exchanges have been adding ether-based trading pairs, which could bolster demand for the alternative asset protocol.He emphasized that in some cases, ether’s trading volume has surpassed that of bitcoin’s on CoinMarketCap. Ether’s 24-hour trading volume reached roughly $1.69bn at roughly 04:30 UTC on 31st May, surpassing bitcoin’s $1.55bn.Since ether does not trade on all exchanges, he said, “This volume is very large and might increase.”“I see very few signs of correction for ethereum as of yet (it moves up, consolidates, then up again),” Rupsys told CoinDesk. “[But] I do keep an open mind and look for weakness signs in ether every day.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of DCG, which has an ownership stake in Brave.Green balloons image via Shutterstock"

The unveiling was detailed in a blog post that likened the project to WeChat, the popular social media service that has been cited as the inspiration for other blockchain payment projects of late.In the post, Coinbase framed Token as an extension of its long-held mission to use blockchain-based digital currencies as a means to achieve financial inclusion.The post reads:“We believe that everyone in the world should have access to financial services, and with smartphones becoming ubiquitous, digital currency can make that happen.”In addition to its Coinbase wallet service, the startup also operates another subsidiary brand, GDAX, an exchange service for digital assets and digital currencies in more than 30 US states and territories, as well as Canada, UK, Australia, Singapore and select European countries.Among the features Token will aim to offer is a built-in reputation score that adjusts as users interact with the platform. Future upgrades outlined in the post include support for the decentralized identity platform uPort.The blog post further indicated the product would seek to migrate to the live ethereum blockchain in the coming months, though no official timeline was made public.As noted in the announcement, the product is similar to other efforts to create mobile wallet platforms based on ethereum, currently the second-largest public blockchain by market cap.Image via Token blog"

The banks in question, according to the filed complaint, are KGI Bank, First Commercial Bank, Hwatai Commercial Bank and Taishin Bank.Named as plaintiffs in the case are Taiwan-based iFinex, Inc, along with two British Virgin Islands subsidiaries and digital asset transfer firm Tether.In addition to seeking an injunction against Wells Fargo in order to prevent the wire transfer stoppage, the exchange is seeking more than $75,000 in damages.The news is a major development for an exchange that has seen no shortage of significant events in the past year. Last summer, Bitfinex was robbed of tens of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin. In the aftermath, it issued a novel digital asset aimed at reimbursing affected users – the last of which were redeemed at the end of last week.As might be expected, news of the suit and the blocked transfers has sparked fears of locked funds and the specter of an exchange collapse. A representative for Bitfinex took to social media soon after word of the suit emerged, declaring that “to be clear, this isn’t a regulatory action” and that no funds have been frozen.They went on to say:“The decision to initiate legal action is because we cannot allow precedents in this industry where clearing houses can disrupt businesses that are by all metrics complying with the rules in place. If we allow them to simply flip a switch and disrupt business, then there becomes a precedent in the bitcoin industry beyond just Bitfinex, so we believe it is the appropriate time to take action.”So, what brought on the wire transfer freeze? Public records detailing correspondence between Bitfinex’s legal representatives and Wells Fargo reveal few details, apart from a seeming unwillingness to engage on the part of the San Francisco-based bank.For now, Wells Fargo is staying quiet on the case, declining comment when contacted by CoinDesk.Public records show that, as of Sunday, a summons had been issued in the case, with an initial hearing scheduled for 10am PST on 25th April. That hearing will focus specifically on the motion for a preliminary injunction sought by Bitfinex.Yet, at least one outside observer expects the exchange to run into at least some legal hurdles as it takes Wells Fargo to court.Stephen D Palley, a Washington, DC-based lawyer, suggested that Wells Fargo may challenge the jurisdictional nature of the suit, given that the plaintiffs are based outside of the US.Should it get past that potential problem, other pitfalls could trip up the effort as well, according to Palley.“Even if Bitfinex gets past a jurisdictional motion, it has no privity of contract with Wells Fargo. As a consequence, it pleaded a cause of action for ‘Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations.’ I know nothing about the underlying facts, but strictly as a legal proposition, this is a hard theory to prove,” he told CoinDesk.Palley concluded:“I can’t imagine that [Wells Fargo] really wants to intentionally interrupt Bitfinex’s business. It seems more likely that compliance red flags were raised.”A full copy of the original complaint can be found below:1-main by CoinDesk on ScribdJustice image via Shutterstock"

another. How do you do that? You can either find someone you know and 
trust ...","May 27, 2017 at 10:00 UTC",Litecoin for vertcoin anyone? Bitcoin for litecoin?,"Say, you want to trade one cryptocurrency for another. How do you do that? You can either find someone you know and trust to do it in person or, a more common scenario, you go through a centralized exchange.Ultimately, the latter involves risk, because it means taking your funds off the blockchain and putting them in the hands of an unknown third party. If the exchange fails, or simply decides to hold on to your money, for whatever reason, you are out of luck.But Lightning Network, an off-chain scaling solution originally intended for bitcoin, is setting the stage for a decentralized option – one that does not require a third party – called atomic swaps.Also known as atomic cross-chain swaps, the technology essentially allows two people holding tokens on two different blockchains to trade directly – and instantly – without the risk of one party running off with the other’s money before the trade is complete.That is where the word ‘atomic’ comes in. It means that either the trade happens in its entirety, or it doesn’t happen at all. So, if a Lightning node goes offline or Bob reneges on his end of the deal, everyone gets their money back.So far, so good. But there is a catch.In order for atomic swaps to work, Lightning has to be up and running on at least two different blockchains. Right now, it is just starting on one: litecoin. But, the hope is, it will be running on multiple chains soon.As it stands, several development teams are currently testing their implementations of Lightning on the litecoin blockchain. Further, SegWit (the protocol upgrade that is a prerequisite for Lightning) has been activated on a second blockchain, vertcoin, opening the doors to Lightning on that chain as well.According to Charlie Lee, the founder of litecoin, who is committed to atomic swaps, all that is left is to get Lightning fully operational on litecoin, and then begin testing it on vertcoin. Once those steps are complete, we may see the the first atomic swaps as soon as this year.Certainly, that is the idea Lee has been kicking around for some time. He wrote about his plans for atomic swaps in a blog post back in January. And, the 2017 litecoin roadmap clearly specifies a plan for atomic swaps between litecoin and vertcoin.Going back to the start, the idea of atomic swaps is nothing new – other ways of doing cross change trades have been proposed in the past. But with Lightning, the building blocks are already in place. (Another benefit of Lightning is that it allows for instant clearing, meaning transactions occur on the spot, with no waiting involved.)So how does it work?Essentially, atomic swaps make use of a scheme known as a hashed timelock contract (HTLC). Lightning already uses this same technology to establish bidirectional payment channels on top of a single blockchain, so it is no stretch to open channels across two chains.HTLC is a merger of two other technologies, a hashlock and a timelock. Both of which set conditions on a multi-signature (or multisig) transaction, which acts like a type of escrow.For example, a hashlock uses a cryptographic puzzle to ensure one party cannot release their funds without the other doing the same. And a timelock acts like a safety net if nothing happens, routing funds back to the senders after a certain amount of time.You can think of all this as a way of putting funds aside and then using ‘if/then’ conditions to stipulate their output.So, in short, an atomic swap looks like this:Now, if Bob or Alice fail to follow through, the first condition ensures that they get their money back. In this sense, you don’t risk losing your money, and more important, you don’t hand ownership of your money over to a third party escrow service.Of course, Lightning won’t work out of the box for atomic swaps. But, developers on the project say modifying the code would not require an undue amount of work.“We don’t have a standard for doing atomic swaps yet,” said Christian Decker, a Blockstream developer working on an implementation of Lightning for the programming language C. But he made it clear that, even though they don’t have the specification laid out, doing so should be pretty straightforward.Meanwhile, in a recent blog post, Lightning Labs developer Olaoluwa Osuntokun, who is working on an implementation of Lightning for Go called lnd (stands for Lightning Network Daemon), suggested that upcoming releases of lnd would be “multi-chain aware”.Another point to note: now that SegWit has activated on litecoin, users can begin sending test cross-chain transactions from litecoin to the bitcoin testnet.Once Lightning Network is up and running successfully on a worthwhile number of blockchains, we can start thinking about decentralized exchanges.To give more detail, these are exchanges that involve no central custodian. Other exchanges, like 0x (pronounced ‘zero-ex’) and EtherDelta, only allow you to exchange tokens that are supported by the ERC20 token standard on the ethereum blockchain. Whereas, atomic swaps allow payments across two different chains – an important distinction.But, keep in mind, atomic swaps only do one thing: execute the trade. A true decentralized exchange also needs to match up traders (so that Alice can find Bob) and aggregate trades to determine a market value (so Alice knows what sort of deal she can reasonably offer Bob).The good news is, those things don’t require a trustless service like the actual exchange of funds does.As Decker explained, you can solve the other problems by simply having websites collect the orders and present them in some fashion, or by creating a broadcast network that announces trade opportunities.But, as he told CoinDesk:“Just like in a centralized exchange, everyone makes their own decision about what their coins are worth and sets their own value. So, basically if Alice announces she’s willing to exchange 1 BTC for 50 LTC, then Bob can either take it or leave it.”Decentralized exchanges are a big part of the decentralized dream. They point to a future where individuals take control of their own money, and cryptocurrencies interoperate.In other words, one day, it may be possible to pay a merchant who only accepts bitcoin in litecoin, monero, zcash, or whatever. It wouldn’t matter, because behind the scenes, your money is instantly converted to bitcoin.And, from there, it is not hard to envision a time where centralized exchanges serve only as an onramp to the cryptocurrency world – but everything after that happens on the blockchain.Atom image via Shutterstock"

That is, until last Friday, when she completed her final day at the firm.Revealed today exclusively to CoinDesk, Valiente is now launching two startups in the research and development space.The first, is a an open-source, crowdfunded, crowdsourced applied research and development hub. The second is an educational enterprise designed to shorten the learning curve for recent computer science grads seeking to make meaningful contributions to the blockchain industry.The co-founder of Rubix by Deloitte, and former strategy and execution lead, told CoinDesk she views her new customers as the very same people who will help her pull off the endeavor: open-source researchers, startup employees and corporate executives.Valiente said:“This has value to all those groups of stakeholders, whether you’re talking about the research and development hub or the educational initiative, and I want to continue playing that role as a translator and a liaison between these various communities.”First revealed today as part of her trip to CoinDesk’s Consensus 2017 conference, the research and development hub called ColliderX takes its name from the CERN particle collider in Switzerland, which leverages researchers, scientists and academics to make technological discoveries.Born from Valiente’s own personal experience encountering research questions, the newly launched Toronto non-profit organization gathers difficult-to-answer questions from around the industry and then lets contributors, backers, and a scientific selection committee prioritize the order they are addressed.Crypto-tokens minted through an unspecified platform will then be used to rank the research questions in the order they will be answered based on the resources available, though she was careful to point out she doesn’t think the “governance tokens” as she called them will accrue value “as soon as it hits an exchange”.Initially, Valiente will encourage participants to select topics based on their status as foundational to the ability to answer other questions, and on them having a “smallish” scope that could lead to publishable results by a team of two researchers in a matter of months.Currently, she has collected 25 topics provided by industry developers, including the potential role that artificial intelligence could play in helping to figure out upper and lower bounds for smart contracts performance, leading to what she termed the creation of “crowd-trained smart contracts” that self-improve.Among the list of researchers who have already submitted topics are Mir Adnan Ali of CG Blockchain who wants to explore how the augmented reality space can be tied into blockchain and Steve Mann, an early innovator in wearable augmented reality devices and a visiting professor at Stanford.ColliderX now counts among its partners the Association for Computing Machinery, which administers the Turing prize, representatives from the University of Waterloo, the University of Toronto, York University and MIT, with advisory work contributed by MME, the law firm that helped incorporate the Ethereum Foundation.ACM chair of the Practitioners Board Conference Committee, Toufi Saliba, explained why his group joined the project:“We feel their intersection of effort with our initiative of colliding AI experts with blockchain experts is quiet fascinating. We couldn’t wish for a better timing in running this and we will be looking forward to working closely.”While the first half of Valiente’s post-Deloitte career is aimed at answering questions the professionals have, the second half of her work aims at questions of a different sort.By the time Valiente left Rubix, she said her team was spending a significant amount of time on-boarding recently graduated new hires who she said had not been adequately prepared for a career in blockchain, something she hopes to change by working closely with schools and universities.Initially, she said she’s starting with a handful of universities at which she has contacts, working with them to built out their curriculum to better prepare graduating students for the blockchain work force.As jobs in the blockchain space become increasingly in demand, Valiente believes her second project has as much a chance to go global as the research and development itself.She concluded:“Ideally, the fundamentals would be covered in training programs and schools before candidates start full time work. There’s plenty of on the job learning that will still need to happen once the theory ends and the practice begins.”Image of Iliana Oris Valiente courtesy of subject"

Chris Sununu signed measure on 2nd June, more than a month after the state’s legislature completed work on the bill. The measure was first introduced in January.According to the text of the bill, the new rules exempt “persons conducting business using transactions conducted in whole or in part in virtual currency” from the state’s money transmitter regulations.The bill is notable given that it enjoyed strong grassroots support in the state, yet its top regulators largely blasted it during public hearings. During a hearing in April, advocates strongly urged legislators to adopt the measure, while representatives from the state’s Banking and Justice Departments called for it to be scuttled.Divisions among state lawmakers on the bill could be seen during a vote in March, when it cleared the House of Representatives by a 185-170 margin. When the State Senate took up the measure in April, it passed by a 13-10 vote, public records show.The newly-signed bill also stands out for what is effectively deregulation for the state’s trader community, whereas other states have looked to beef up rules for those who engage in similar activities. As might be expected, the effort was cheered by community members who have called for fewer regulations for those who work with digital currencies like bitcoin.The law goes into effect on 1st August.Old Man of the Mountain image via Wikimedia"

As compared to traditional ...","Jun 6, 2017 at 13:00 UTC","CoinDesk Research’s Q1 2017 State of Blockchain report summarizes key trends, data and events in the public and enterprise blockchain sectors in the first quarter of 2017.","Click here to view the slides in your browser.The first quarter of 2017 was a big one for the blockchain space.From the spark of what has become a massive cryptocurrency rally to the emergence of major enterprise efforts like the launch of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, the first quarter may ultimately come to be seen as a defining one for the industry.The first quarter also saw initial coin offerings, or ICOs, continue to gain interest despite unclear regulatory guidance from agencies like the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).As showcased in CoinDesk’s latest State of Blockchain report, the first quarter of 2017 wasn’t all sky-high token valuations and enterprise announcements, however.Q1 also saw the emergence of all-time highs for bitcoin user transaction fees, while the SEC gave the thumbs-down to two proposed bitcoin ETFs (though one of those decisions is currently under review by the regulator).Further, the industry saw the People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank, take on a more active role as a watchdog of the domestic bitcoin exchange ecosystem. This lead to a months-long user balance withdrawal freeze and a shift in the makeup of the world’s trading volume.In the end, though, it was still a blockbuster quarter for the blockchain industry. To get the birds-eye view of what took place, read on for the six major highlights from CoinDesk’s newly released report.Nearly the entire asset class rallied in the first quarter as the overall market cap gained $7bn to an all-time high of $25bn.In the months since the end of Q1, the collective market cap of cryptocurrencies has rallied north of $90bn.In the first quarter, each of the top 10 assets gained value and a wide range of tokens set all-time highs, half with double-digit percentage gains and half with triple gains.
Despite bitcoin’s 10% price gain, its market dominance hit an all-time low as smaller assets made significant gains.As compared to traditional currencies, bitcoin’s rise exceeded that of nearly every major nation, as did precious metals (which are often compared to cryptocurrencies based on limited supply, independence from governments and usage as a hedge against a collapse in traditional financial markets).The first quarter set the record for the most bitcoin transactions per day (287,098), the largest blocks (0.92 MB) and the most expensive transactions ($0.62).In June, transaction fees rose to over $5 – see ‘Bitcoin’s Network is Objectively More Congested Than Ever’.Other major public blockchains experienced increased usage in the first quarter as well, including ethereum and dash, monero and zcash – a growing sector of ‘privacy focused’ cryptocurrencies.The stage has been set for scaling bitcoin both on-chain through proposals like ‘SegWit’ (which recently went live on litecoin) or increasing fixed maximum block sizes (or hybrids like ‘Segwit2Mb’) and off-chain through projects like the Lightning Network and Raiden.The composition of trading shifted in the first quarter as agencies around the globe made decisions impacting cryptocurrency trading structures and treatment.In January, the People’s Bank of China met with the ‘Big 3’ bitcoin exchanges and other domestic exchanges around the issues of zero exchange fees and AML policies. Global volumes plummeted as OKCoin, Huobi, BTCC and other Chinese exchanges responded by pausing features like withdrawals and margin trading, and increasing fees.As Chinese trading plunged, a more diverse allocation of worldwide volume emerged and continued into Q2 – see ‘3 Reasons the Cryptocurrency Exchange Market Is Maturing’.Other parts of the world saw major regulatory developments – both positive and negative – during that quarter as well.In March, the SEC rejected the Winklevoss COIN bitcoin ETF, initially proposed almost four years prior. Just weeks later, the SEC rejected another ETF proposal from SolidX, in both cases citing significant unregulated markets.Across the world, however, Japanese regulators moved to treat bitcoin as a legal payment method, sparking a renewal in interest in the Asian nation.A Spotlight Study in the Q1 2017 State of Blockchain used a survey distributed in Farsi on Telegram to gauge “Iranian Blockchain Sentiment” and found that the largest majority of respondents were using cryptocurrency for cross-border payments.Notably, the majority of respondents thought the Iranian government would be effective in advancing bitcoin and its community.As more traditional companies have become involved in blockchain, they have added to the research going into the growing ‘permissioned’ side of the space.Enterprise-oriented blockchain projects had an eventful quarter as consortiums grew in size – and pilot projects continued in partnership with major groups and corporations.In that time, the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger project has grown its list of members, proofs-of-concept and frameworks and tools.The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, launched in February with a combination of major firms and blockchain startups, has the stated goal of interoperability with the public ethereum network.Decentralized applications (dapps) and token sales continue to draw investor interest as short-term returns have been astronomical for many.As ethereum’s community has grown with more developers coming in (and investors willing to fund them), multiple early projects for different use cases are beginning to appear.The investor pool is small, however, as only several hundred to thousands of people control the tokens behind several million-dollar market cap projects.Ethereum dapps are not alone in grouping around use cases, as other broad ‘sectors’ have only become more apparent over time, like privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, dapp platforms, interoperability-based protocols (like Cosmos and Polkadot) and storage-based assets (like Sia and Storj).The first quarter also showcased notable data on ICOs, which totaled about a third of the total venture capital volume seen in the first quarter.Numerous token sales were launched, scheduled and announced soon after, including gnosis, cosmos, brave, tezos, civic and kik.At the end of May, cumulative ICO funding passed venture capital for the year – see ‘ICO Investments Pass VC Funding in Blockchain Market First’.As the market has grown, the players in the market have evolved, with specialized legal and advisory services, investment funds, and more, launching to cater to and profit from the trend.The main Spotlight Study in the Q1 2017 State of Blockchain was the “Bitcoin and Ethereum Sentiment Survey”.The survey revealed that the community was extremely enthusiastic about most aspects around the ‘state of ethereum’. That said, a number were torn – and bordering on the negative – regarding many aspects of the ‘state of bitcoin’.The full survey covers numerous aspects of the protocols and ecosystems, but perhaps just one chart says it all when weighing the overall level of sentiment (at least among this group of respondents) – see ‘Enthusiasm for Ethereum Hits an All-Time High’.To download the full State of Blockchain Q1 2017 report, visit CoinDesk Research.Skyscrapers image via Shutterstock"

But as co-founder of consultancy Spitzberg Partners, he is setting his sights beyond finance.Over the course of his time at both the Ministry of Defense and Minister of Economics & Technology, zu Guttenberg built up an extensive network of global politicians, technologists and bankers.Long rumored to be a potential candidate to replace his former boss, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, zu Guttenberg last month revealed exclusively to CoinDesk that his firm had partnered with the State of Delaware’s blockchain initiative to help bring a global tech cohort to the tiny US state.Now, he says his firm has taken on a “significant portion” of blockchain companies as clients and is consolidating those resources to focus on a concerted push to bring the technology to the world.At Spitzberg’s New York City headquarters, zu Guttenberg explained how the work he’s conducting in Delaware, with Ripple and with other blockchain firms, is part of a larger plan.Zu Guttenberg told CoinDesk:“I always tell the dreamers in the bitcoin community and the blockchain community, don’t expect that this will happen at one point and everyone is enlightened. It will be a bumpy process.”Zu Guttenberg founded New York City-based Spitzerg Partners in August 2013 in reaction to requests he said he received from leaders in the US tech sector for advice on navigating complicated geopolitical issues.After commissioning a study on the leading causes of failed companies, he narrowed the reasons to inadequate geopolitical and cross-cultural knowledge, as well as an inability to properly understand the regulatory implications of both.“I was interested in the fact that they were burning billions [of dollars] in their attempt to roll out by entirely misunderstanding a few core elements,” he said.Currently, Spitzerg focuses on revenue generating firms in four main industries – Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, big data analytics and blockchain – with a rapidly growing cohort of blockchain startups, though the co-founder didn’t share the exact number.Zu Guttenberg defines his typical client as a company that could become the subject of either a “fiercely led political debate, a harsh counter-reaction by old industry or a combination of both.”He added:“And there are many.”Zu Guttenberg first caught the blockchain bug in 2012 at a conference where he met the co-founder of San Francisco-based Ripple, Chris Larsen and New York-based Digital Currency Group founder and CEO, Barry Silbert.Following a conversation with the two, zu Guttenberg said his interest was piqued, mostly about the idea of a shared ledger with the power to let counterparties do business without a middleman.He bought about $30 worth of bitcoin and began a dialogue with Larsen that culminated in July 2014 when he formally joined Ripple’s advisory board.At the time, he had been working on a series of unpublished articles about international capital flows and the history of correspondent banking, and discussed the role that Ripple’s cryptocurrency, XRP, could potentially play in freeing up dormant money in banks around the world.With XRP in the midst of an explosive growth cycle that has seen it become the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, zu Guttenberg and his team have continued to work behind the scenes to help build out Ripple’s network.Most recently, Ripple has added 10 new financial firms to its network, including MUFG in Japan, BBVA in Spain and SEB in Sweden, and has completed a pilot with 47 global banks.Though Ripple has set legacy financial technology firm Swift square in its sights, zu Guttenberg said that Ripple’s secret to widespread adoption has been recognizing when to play nice with other legacy platforms.“Many of these players, although they are sitting on already rotten instruments or structures, will be in place, and in power,” he said. “[They will be] dramatically empowered by political circles for quite a while and they’re still extremely influential.”To help modernize those legacy systems, though, Ripple will require more than just a willingness to play nice with banks. Government support is crucial.Zu Guttenberg cited smaller nations such as Estonia and Singapore, and jurisdictions including the Zug region of Switzerland and Delaware, as fundamental testing grounds for the types of legislation that might one day underpin a new financial infrastructure.Specifically, he said the “charm” of Delaware’s increasing openness to blockchain should serve as a template for jurisdictions around the world.Most recently, Delaware state senators introduced a bill that would explicitly name blockchain as a recognized technology to support the owning and trading of corporate stocks.“Why don’t we translate the Delaware experience to another state or city in Germany?” zu Guttenberg asked. “Why don’t we try to do the same in the Middle East? Why don’t we try to do the same in Latin America somewhere?”The ex-minister added that he’s already had conversations with his former boss, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, in which she expressed a “general” interest in the technology.“The question is, will every department be adopted, or will it just be two or three departments doing it?” he said.While he said the topic of how blockchain is being adopted by governments comes up organically in his meetings with leaders around the world, zu Guttenberg argued that the push to bring blockchain into widespread adoption will require a more concerted effort.“People [need to] deliver the experiences from these test runs to other governments, to old industry and back to the blockchain industry.”He concluded:“That doesn’t happen by itself and we’re delighted to be at that intersection.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group.Karl-Theodore zu Guttenberg image via Wikipedia

One founding partner behind the Bitcoin Center, Bloq investor Tally Capital, has joined the new expanded operation as a strategic partner.Other strategic partners include media startup Distributed and law firm Perkins Coie, which has a practice dedicated to serving blockchain startups and enterprises.In addition to helping incubate startups, the public-private partnership is also intended to serve as a feeder of sorts between the region’s enterprises working to integrate blockchain and local industry startups.“Large, established companies will have the opportunity to tap into this dynamic ecosystem, which is already transforming their industries,” said O’Rourke.Since the Bitcoin Center first launched two years ago, the State of Illinois has grown into a governmental leader in blockchain adoption.Last November, the state first unveiled its blockchain policy, prompting a series of announcements including the February news that state legislator Michael Zalewski had called for the creation of a blockchain working lab. A month later, the state became the first US regulator to join the R3 blockchain consortium.CBC founder Roszak positioned the center’s transition from a focus on cryptocurrencies to blockchain more generally as crucial to the diverse set of founding partners.Roszak said:“We expect the CBC to prove to be a foundational component in the identification and maturation of the local distributed ledger technology talent pipeline.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Bloq.

in on the lesser-known cryptocurrency network litecoin.","May 10, 2017 at 17:00 UTC",A long-debated change originally intended to improve bitcoin has now locked in on the lesser-known cryptocurrency network litecoin.,"Segregated Witness (SegWit) has been the subject of bitcoin’s infamous scaling debate for a couple of years now, but it’s now getting an opportunity to shine on litecoin, or so its supporters argue, leading some to believe that it will now help reveal whether concerns about the change are valid for bitcoin.The change first locked-in two weeks ago, leading to two more weeks of waiting to ensure demand for the upgrade remained consistent. Earlier today, the change activated at block 1201536.What does that mean? Litecoin users can now begin using the new style of transaction, and there has been at least one such transaction so far.However, most advocates are excited about the new technologies that can now be built on top of a network with SegWit. For example, the Lightning Network, which could boost litecoin transactions by as much as a million times, can now hypothetically be used to move real money.Litecoin developer Loshan T told CoinDesk:“I think today will be a great day for pushing more awesome tech into Litecoin. With SegWit activated on litecoin’s mainnet, I cannot wait until we deploy confidential transactions, Lightning Networks, MAST and Schnorr signatures.”Still, these projects are rather early stage. Developers from the startup Lightning Labs, at least, seem to think that it’s too early to talk about sending money over the still-experimental network and plan to continue improving their code first.It’s unclear what exactly this activation means and what role litecoin will play in the future.Loshan mentioned that some onlookers are skeptical that litecoin really needs the Lightning Network, since litecoin transaction blocks are not yet full, but pointed to trustless cross-chain transactions between bitcoin and litecoin as a potential Lightning use case that the developer believes could benefit both cryptocurrencies.One piece is that wallets will need to upgrade to support the type of transactions. Multi-signature wallet mSIGNA, for example, has done so.Further, there were some worries about the activation – some logistical and some political. Earlier high-level analysis showed that developers are unsure whether all miners and exchanges are completely prepared for the change.Time will tell if these concerns mean anything. Less than an hour after the change, the cryptocurrency appears to be operating normally.Litecoin image via SegWit tracker website"

We do not see this quieting any time soon,” he said.When asked whether his company has experienced an increase in this activity amid the recent rally in cryptocurrency prices, Harry Yeh, managing partner of Binary Financial, told CoinDesk:“There’s definitely a larger demand, not just for bitcoin, but [for] everything across the board.”As for where cryptocurrency prices (and therefore total market cap) will go next, analysts offered mixed views. While the total value (and number) of assets in this space has surged in recent months, it is difficult to tell how much further they can climb without developing compelling value propositions.Yeh offered an optimistic point of view, telling CoinDesk that “we are just getting started”.“People still don’t really understand that there is a lot more room for this to move because it’s a global phenomenon now. Expect more moves up but also some pullbacks like in the last week,” he said.Jacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager, offered a more cautious stance, telling CoinDesk that the market was “reaching the frenzy point”. He expressed doubt as to how much longer these values would hold, noting that while nobody knows for sure when a bubble will pop, there are always warning signs.Eliosoff stated that in this case, a “crackdown” on initial coin offerings (ICOs), the process by which developers create new cryptocurrencies to fund projects, would likely spur a downturn.He also asserted that should bitcoin prices see a downturn, the cryptocurrency space could see diminished confidence.Price chart image via Shutterstock"

And there were no heirs apparent to his throne. The War of the Spanish Succession had begun.With Spain’s weakened leadership, and unable to defend its territory, a power vacuum formed through which nearly nearly all European nations vied for control of Spain’s undefended land.The war that started in 1701, raged on for nearly nearly 15 years and ended by treaty. The war ended without anyone clear victor, but the treaty resulted in significant changes to European and American territorial boundaries.What was left of the eviscerated Spanish mainland was given to Philip V, a member of the French nobility who held the closest genealogical claim to the Spanish throne. What was received by Britain and France was the title to ‘New World’ territory in North and South America. What was received by all participants, was debt and the need to build and rebuild trade routes upon the new redistributed land. Enter Britain’s ‘South Sea Company’.The South Sea Company was formed via a partnership between the British parliament and the Bank of England in the year 1711.The structure of this company was like many others in the 17th and 18th centuries. The company came into existence through a royal charter, and was given a monopoly on part of the monarchy’s commerce. In the case of the South Sea company, this monopoly was granted over the trade in the newly conquered Spanish territory.At the time of commencement, shares in the South Sea Company were primarily issued by conversion of war debt. The debt from the Spanish War, assessed at £10m, was assigned to the South Sea company for repayment. And at the option of an existing bondholder, that debt could instead be converted into equity into the new venture.It was a good deal for the state, as the debt was removed from its books and import tax revenues could be collected from the company. And for a while, it was a great deal for debt and shareholders. So, when the Treaty of Utrecht was signed in 1713 by all parties involved in the war, the ship that was the South Sea Company was ready to set sail.It’s tough to say just where the South Sea ‘bubble’ itself started, as the run up was caused by the culmination of many small decisions, each made with the best of intentions for shareholders.Marketing for the South Sea Company was unusually aggressive out the gates, with fantastic tales being told about the spoils awaiting export from the new land. Further, there was a complex front-running strategy that enabled legislatively privileged insiders to buy government bonds before the announcement, and ‘sell into the pump’.Later accounts of this time would reveal that the marketers of this security knew the tales of wealth were not sustainable at the time, but felt that, with the capital received, surely some profit would follow. Sure enough, as the claims of surefire returns were being propagated, the South Sea Bubble began its ascent.Unique to the South Sea company’s launch, and for the first time in British history, investors were courted from outside those with close ties to the monarchy. The perceived potential to share in the gains of this elite group were too good an offer for the common man to pass down. And, the buying and selling of the stock developed into a new form of gambling in which the country as a whole began to play.As the South Sea Company’s valuation began to grow, and expectations of great wealth compounded, promoters of the South Sea Company started to realize that they too could emulate its success by creating their own companies and issuing stocks. For the ICO speculators of today, this is where the bubble begins to get significantly more interesting.Initially, these ‘bubble companies’ (Yep, that’s just what they were called) had plausible enough goals.  In a time that preceded the invention of the ‘white paper’, these companies instead drafted marketing literature that was quick to read and high on aspiration.The initial companies were fairly benign in their focus. And, at first, most companies were focused on insurance, product and utility endeavors. To quote the canon of buttcoin, these companies could fairly be synopsized as having ‘but with the new world’ goals for their corporate strategy.Over time, as the public’s appetite for extraordinary investment opportunities continued to grow, the claims of these bubble companies grew equally extraordinary. No regulatory oversight or specialist review was needed at the time, so claimants began to pitch companies which claimed they would achieve: “the making iron with pit coal”, “the transmutation of quicksilver into a malleable fine metal”, “the making of rape-oil”  and, of course, “a wheel for perpetual motion”.At the height of the madness, the most famously ethereal company of the bubble promised, without irony, “a company for carrying out an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is”.As the mania grew, promoters and proto-exchange operators began to appear on the streets of London. ‘Stock-jobbers’, as they came to be known, began to market their paper on the busy streets between london’s coffee houses.The stock-jobbers would buy and sell the newest schemes to passers-by for a commission on the sale. These promoters were notoriously unscrupulous, and as the front men for many of the unsavory offerings, and they would also become the first to be held responsible by buyers whose investments fell short of the promise.Adjusted for inflation, at its peak, the South Sea Company’s market cap would equal $4tn in ‘real’ (inflation adjusted) terms. Nearly all the country’s bureaucracy, aristocracy and businessmen held significant exposure to the scheme. Even Isaac Newton was heavily invested in the company before its downfall. Oracles, it would seem, were equally unable to predict outcomes in times of manic fervor.As the South Sea company reached its peak valuation, a confluence of events caused its downfall. In December of 1719, having yet failed to achieve any profit, the South Sea company was unable to pay its year-end dividend to shareholders.This default started a snowball of action amongst politicians and bankers. Some bankers began to realize that increasing valuations could not continue indefinitely. Meanwhile, politicians began to see that investments in bubble companies, which were still technically illegal, competed with investment stake in their South Sea Company holdings.In January of 1720, a parliamentary commission was held on what should be done about the fervor. Through a series of compromises and scandals, the commission concluded that only companies with a royal charter could be bought and sold. By June of that year, the Bubble Act reaffirmed the illegality of bubble corporations and put an end to the trading of their stocks.The final nail in the coffin was due to an investor credit program of which the first payments were due in August of 1720. At that time, investors began to sell their holdings to make due on the payment, and this started the initial selloff.What happened next, should be unsurprising. Bankruptcies began, and within months had reached all time highs. As the losses mounted, then compounded, everyone was affected. Notable bankruptcy included that of Isaac Newton, who upon losing the near entirety of his life savings proclaimed:“I can calculate the movement of stars, but not the madness of men.”By the end of 1720, the price of the South Sea company stock had fallen 90%.Investors revolted against the stock-jobbers, the company founders, and the politicians who they blamed for losing their wealth. The mobs formed, and justice was demanded. Extraordinary claims that were once pitched and traded as foregone conclusions, were finally tested. Many of those who were responsible for the extreme claims fled the country. Those that remained faced jail and asset confiscations.Though many of the stock-jobbers escaped prosecution, they faced an inordinate public backlash in the form of mockery, ridicule, and disdain. Famous amongst this backlash is a lengthy written condemnation of their work by Daniel DeFoe (the author of “Robinson Crusoe”), a popular deck of playing cards commemorating the folly, and numerous plays written to ridicule the stock-jobbing profession.With the resulting contraction of the entire economy’s growth, the South Sea Bubble was the great depression of its century, and the Bubble Act remained in effect thereafter for over 100 years, restricting the growth of investment markets until it was finally overturned in 1825.Unregulated, and without peer review, the investment economy had turned into a perverse and unsustainable Keynesian beauty contest. The South Sea Bubble never returned a profit on its operating expenses during the entirety of the bubble, and what little trade it did attempt (mostly in slaves) was performed at a net financial loss.If it’s not clear by now, the parallels between the South Sea Bubble and today’s ICO market are… uncanny.As a new class of investor was given access to a securities market for the first time, and without any regulatory safeguards, this market quickly degenerated into a gambling racket where unscrupulous businessmen catered solely to the speculative markets, without any concern for long-term sustainability and non-speculative capital inflow.Not only that, these pitchmen starved out investment in modest, but actually profitable endeavors. The burden of this environment resulted in substantial externality costs borne by the entirety of the market.Given the chance, investors will rationally jump at the opportunity to be the second greatest fool. And to promote long-shot schemes over modest and humble endeavors.Whether bitcoin itself goes the way of the South Sea Company has yet to be determined. But what is certain is that, if and when the SEC chooses to restrict the growth of this sector, much like British parliament’s enactment of the Bubble Act of 1720, prices for these ‘undertakings of great advantage’ will quickly fall to zero.Sailing ship image via shutterstock"

the cryptocurrency is in circulation. In fact, according to Ripple's own ...","May 16, 2017 at 16:00 UTC","Distributed financial technology firm Ripple is on the verge of locking up billions of dollars worth of its native XRP cryptocurrency inside dozens of smart contracts designed to hold value in escrow until a certain time, or certain conditions are met.","The move to voluntarily freeze its own assets in escrow contracts is designed to combat fears that Ripple might flood its booming market with some of the $16bn worth of cryptocurrency it currently stores and that resulted from holding large amounts of its own currency that hasn’t been made available to the public.Specifically, the San Francisco firm has promised to lock-up 88% of those funds, or about $14bn worth, in a series of smart contracts that briefly make 1bn XRP available each month for a period of at least four-and-a-half years.Revealed today exclusively to CoinDesk, Ripple hopes the self-inflicted freezing of funds will give XRP owners and aspiring owners a sense of certainty that the market will not suddenly be flooded with the currency, potentially lowering the price.While Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse argued in interview with CoinDesk that flooding the market would be irrational, and go against his firm’s own self-interest, he added that it was time to move the tokens to the smart contracts and remove the element of trust altogether.Garlinghouse said:“We want to make sure that the Ripple Consensus Ledger is the most robust, and that XRP is the most liquid, and I think this is a very positive step towards that.”Currently, Ripple’s market cap is listed on most tracking sites as about $11bn, based on 38.3bn XRP in circulation. But unlike other cryptocurrencies including bitcoin and ethereum, not all the cryptocurrency is in circulation. In fact, according to Ripple’s own numbers the company owns almost twice the amount in circulation, or 61bn XRP.To help give potential future XRP owners certainty that the market won’t be flooded with this trove of cryptocurrecy, Ripple built 55 smart contracts using its own escrow feature released for public used in March, each holding 1 billion XRP and expiring on the first day of every month for a period of 54 months.As each contract expires, the cryptocurrency will briefly become available for Ripple to use as it sees fit.Historically, Garlinghouse said funds have been spent at a rate of about 300m XRP per month for the past 18 months to incentivize market makers to offer tighter spreads for payments, methods he describes as Ripple being “good stewards” of the nascent XRP economy.For example, he says funds have also been sold to institutional investors to help raise additional capital above the $93m already raised to help pay for engineers that oversee the open-source code base. Then, at the end of the month whatever XRP is unused will be added to the end of the escrow queue in the form of an additional month-long contract, starting the process all over.A specific time-frame to implementation has not been revealed, but Garlinghouse expects the process to be completed by the end of this year. Head of research at Ripple investor Blockchain Capital, Spencer Bogart, said that if the contracts are safely implemented they could positively impact XRP user perception.“The fact that Ripple owns the majority of outstanding XRP and could potentially flood the market with supply has historically discouraged investors from evaluating XRP any further,” he told CoinDesk. “Properly implemented cryptographic escrow with sufficiently limited supply would go a long way toward alleviating that particular fear.”Blockchain Capital does not currently have a stake in XRP, he said, but does own equity in the company.Collectively, the total number of XRP in existence is worth about the same as the entire bitcoin market cap, elevating the stakes far beyond just cryptocurrency speculation in its own right.In addition to the cryptocurrency’s explosive growth over the past few months, the company that wants to make it easier for banks to send each other cross-border payments has continued to grow the number of its partners.With the help of Germany’s former Minster of Defense who is an advisor to Ripple the company has been increasingly engaging global customers. For exmaple, the firm recently added 10 new financial firms to its network and completed a pilot with 47 global banks.While Garlinghouse said the banks weren’t among the XRP owners concerned about Ripple flooding the market with currency, he does believe that the more stable sense among open-source developers of liquidity being released into the wild could result in increased activity among the community.In the end, the result could in fact trickle down to the banks as the end users, he said. The increased liquidity being created by the cryptocurrency safely entering the market could in turn make it easier for a larger number of banks to conduct transactions without negatively impacting the price of doing so.Garlinghouse concluded:“I think increasingly, the market has realized that if we have a bank using us for messaging and settlements, there’s an opportunity to also introduce them to how they can lower their liquidity costs by leveraging a liquidity solution enabled through XRP.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.

This is good advice.There appears to be a frenzy around the issuance of new tokens in the form of ICOs.Many of these new protocols and apps based around a token have an interesting premise but little, if any, market proof. By conventional investing metrics, the ‘risk-reward’ on the pricing of many of these seems off, even to savvy investors in the space. Unless you deeply understand the details of the new token being offered and have a strong point of view on its value, this seems more like gambling than investing.In my view, bitcoin and ether are different. There is much that is unproven about their long-term success, but there has been a lot of de-risking of these protocols already. They have vibrant developer ecosystems, a diverse ownership base and highly liquid trading.With that as context, there are three thoughts I would like to add to the discourse that I have not seen widely discussed:One can sanely argue an equity is overvalued by forecasting future performance of the business and the resulting cash generated. In the dot-com bubble, a company called Internet Capital Group had $70m in revenue, $150m in net losses, and peaked at a $56bn market cap. You don’t have to be great at math to figure out the business was unlikely to produce the profits necessary to support that value.Bitcoin is not comparable: as a unit of value independent of any earning stream or productive use, the total money supply is untethered by economic productivity. Some, like Warren Buffett, view assets like bitcoin and gold negatively, and eschew asset investments that lack a means of producing cash flow.But as a unit of money, it also means the value of bitcoin can sustainably grow at a much faster pace than most real-world businesses, because it is untethered by building products or services; it is solely tethered to how many people believe that it is a valid store of wealth.The world believes gold is a reliable store of value to the tune of trillions of dollars. If and when the world believes the same about bitcoin, it will be worth 100–1,000 times what it trades for today, and that can happen at the speed limit of people ‘buying in’.However, unlike equity bubbles, the addition of new buyers to the ecosystem actually increases the value of the underlying token.The value (given fixed supply) is simply a product of scarcity, which is going to be directly related to how many people hold the currency. An additional buyer of Tesla stock does not increase the long-term cash flow of the underlying business, but each additional speculator who decides that bitcoin is valuable increases the underlying value of the bitcoin network.If bitcoin succeeds, there will likely be a series of tipping-points where the value jumps up due to a widely observed new plateau of acceptance.Yes, you might be clever or lucky and make some quick money, but if you are in this for the 100–1,000-times potential from here, ‘profit taking’ on small moves is picking up pennies in front of a steamroller.What if Warren Buffett or JP Morgan surprises the world and announces tomorrow they are all-in on bitcoin, and the price goes up 10 times overnight and never comes back down?If you have ‘traded out’ you will regret it.This post originally appeared on Medium and has been republished here with the author’s permission.Bubble wands image via Shutterstock"

bitcoin for ...","Jun 10, 2017 at 11:30 UTC","While the usual drumbeat of cryptocurrency innovation calls for ‘banking the unbanked’, a startup called Omise actually has the opposite goal: ‘unbanking the banked’.","And with the help of Joseph Poon, co-author of bitcoin’s Lightning Network white paper, the Thailand-based payment gateway network is building a decentralized exchange based on ethereum to move toward that goal.The decentralized exchange, which Poon has written another white paper for, is built directly into the company’s upcoming proof-of-stake blockchain, OmiseGo. Once it’s finished, users will be able to trade fiat currencies for cryptocurrencies, or exchange between almost any cryptocurrencies (say bitcoin for ether) without a third party like Coinbase or Kraken.Eliminating middleman was cryptocurrency’s original value proposition. Not to mention, trust in third parties is arguably what led to some of bitcoin’s most publicized disasters, including the fall of Mt Gox in 2014 and the $65m hack of Bitfinex last summer.In contrast, Poon described the project as a sign of what’s to come in the cryptocurrency space, calling the decentralized trading trend “a big deal”.He told CoinDesk:“The entire point of money is to trade for other things. To do that in a decentralized way is sort of a no-brainer.”And others agree. Decentralized exchanges are all the rage these days, with Shapeshift’s Prism, 0x and Swap all launching recently around the idea of ditching third parties in exchange.Poon, who also recently helped write the specifications for Purse’s extension blocks scaling project, expects even more such projects to arrive – maybe a couple of dozen – and soon.The launch of the OmiseGo blockchain is slated for Q4 2017, supported by the launch of a wallet. And with all that, Poon believes it will be more feature-rich than competing projects.“This is designed to be a full-blown exchange,” he explained, arguing it implements fine details other exchange projects haven’t yet considered.To do so, the decentralized exchange is being built with both an execution engine (which makes the trade between users) and an order book (the component that lists the buyers and sellers looking to move their cryptocurrency and at what price).“A lot of people talk about [these systems], but they don’t talk about: How do you know who’s going to be your counterparty? How do you know what price you’re going to trade at? How do you ensure there’s orderly execution? [OmiseGo] is going to resolve those issues,” Poon said.And, an important difference from other projects is that it uses a decentralized system to match buyers with sellers.How does it do that? As mentioned, the decentralized exchange is baked directly into the blockchain and its consensus rules. All nodes must follow these rules when checking whether blocks and transactions are valid. In addition to checking whether transactions in a block are valid – as they traditionally do – nodes also monitor the order book.So, if Bob aims to trade Alice one ether for one ‘bobcoin’, then the nodes check if the orders match. If they do, the nodes approve of the transfer.Unlike other decentralized exchanges such as 0x (winner of the Proof of Work pitch competition at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2017 conference), which is only focused on exchanging ERC-20 standardized tokens, OmiseGo users will be able to trade all but one cryptocurrency, monero.As an established payment gateway serving six countries in Southeast Asia, Omise might have the right connections to move the project forward. The company already helps banks and telecom companies with their payment system backends, and plans to offer clients the choice of moving onto the public OmiseGo network.“Omise’s existing roles will be leveraged to gain adoption for the network and the framework managing access to the digital money issued on it,” OmiseGo special advisor Thomas Greco told CoinDesk.So, the ultimate goal is to use the decentralized exchange to streamline fiat and cryptocurrency exchanges between these various clients.Plus, in Poon’s eyes, it’s important that OmiseGo is a “public” blockchain project that anyone can join, because it offers a much better model than popular private blockchain consortium efforts.Omise believes using a public blockchain solves industry coordination problems between parties that don’t necessarily trust each other. Private blockchains, he added, are merely recreating the traditional centralized clearinghouse system.Poon said:“So instead, they’re like, ‘Screw it, let’s just make a decentralized system.'”Joseph Poon image via PubNub"

And he did not disappoint, facing the digital currency issue head on.“Customers have been asking us if digital currency is going to wipe out the remittance business,” he said.According to the CTO, the answer is no. Thompson revealed cash-based transactions are on the rise in many of Western Union’s developing country markets. And anyway, he added, “the regulators are really pushing back on digital currencies because of the anonymity.”It may come as a surprise, therefore, that Western Union is trialing an integration with digital currency exchange Coinbase, in which Western Union will appear within the web app of the exchange.In conversation with CoinDesk, Thompson revealed that the project entered into development last fall, and is currently being piloted with Western Union employees. No launch date has been set, but an announcement could be forthcoming.Thompson stressed, however, that it will not be for digital currency transactions, but instead, on the back-end for fiat transfers.He said:“Until digital currencies become regulated and integrated into the law, we are not going to include that on the platform. Our regulators are quite direct with us; it’s not something they are [allowing us] to enable.”Thompson went on to detail other blockchain developments the remittance company is working on.After a planned pilot with Ripple a few years ago failed to materialize (there was apparently not broad enough adoption among banks), the team has continued to investigate possible use cases for the technology. One that’s compelling is using blockchain to standardize bank integrations (Western Union’s app currently integrates with about 2 billion bank accounts), Thompson said.But, perhaps one of the use cases with the most immediate effect on Western Union’s bottom line is blockchain’s possible role in streamlining compliance. Thompson revealed that Western Union is working on a blockchain-based know-your-customer (KYC) compliance pilot, focusing on bringing down its hefty compliance costs, which currently reach approximately $240m a year.In addition, Thompson said, Western Union is investigating how the technology can be leveraged for real-time settlement, integrated smart contracts for import/export transactions and alternative payment types. Could the alternative payment types one day include digital currencies? Thompson conceded that may happen “over time as changes are made in regulation around the world”.While non-committal, Western Union does appear to be getting ready for that day.And as digital currency regulation advances, and assuming the integration goes smoothly with Coinbase’s platform, the remittance company will be in a strong position to bridge the gap between incumbent financial services and alternative stores of value.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of DCG, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase.Image by Noelle Acheson for CoinDesk"

And the Turing-award winner’s answer set a few back on their heels.“Incentives are the hardest thing to do,” Micali said.In 30 years as a cryptographer, he had spent the last 10 working on just that issue.As he explained, when you put incentives out there, people learn how to use those incentives for making money in ways that are nearly impossible to predict. He pointed to bitcoin as a prime example, saying its creator probably never imagined bitcoin’s incentive structure would lead to industrial-scale mining pools.Micali also argued those using a system do not necessarily need to be rewarded for trivial computations. And that, while bitcoin miners are compensated for their work, validators, who in contrast do not have to invest in expensive equipment and electricity, are not rewarded.He said:“We must use incentives as a last resort. I believe I can [make Algorand work without incentives], but I have no formal proof that I can, because these formal proofs are much harder than the proofs of Algorand.”Intended as a public blockchain, Algorand contains a novel version of Byzantine agreement with nine steps, where players are replaced in each round of communication. The protocol tolerates one-third bad actors, and Micali said he assumes the majority of the system’s users are honest.Yet, the idea of a consensus algorithm that offers no incentives runs counter to the thinking of many, including those working on the decentralized application network ethereum, a blockchain project working on a PoS system of its own called Casper.“We basically explicitly put incentives front and center,” said Vitalik Buterin, founder of ethereum. He described ethereum’s approach as fundamentally about how much money stakeholders can lose, as opposed to the approach taken with Algorand.“One thing I would be concerned about, is if you have no incentives at all, then that means you have no incentive not to just be lazy and go offline,” Buterin told CoinDesk.Ethereum developer Vlad Zamfir, who is heavily invested in building Casper, had stronger words. He stated he simply did not think such a system would work.“My whole perspective on the space is, like, polar opposite. I don’t believe the ‘majority of people are honest’ assumption,” he said, adding:“There is a small number of people who control most of the coins in most [PoS] systems. It is not that hard for people to coordinate to undermine protocol guarantees.”Cornell associate professor Emin Gün Sirer, also questioned the idea Micali put forth.Sirer pointed out that, while it’s true bitcoin’s participants are not always fully incentivized, a lot of people run full nodes altruistically.“But to go from that and to say, since bitcoin works and it is not fully incentivized, ergo, any system will work – that is not incentivized. There is a gap there,” he said.But some had an altogether different take on the matter.Charles Hoskinson, CEO of blockchain technology firm IOHK, pointed to BitTorrent as an example of a system that works just fine while not being incentivized at all. No token exists and you aren’t paid anything to share files on the network.Another example he points to is folding@home, where thousands of people freely donate idle processing power for disease research.“It is an open question of whether you need incentives or not, and I don’t think it can be determined in an academic model. It is actually going to be determined by evidence. You launch something and you see what happens,” he said.The comments nonetheless suggest that Algorand’s eventual launch could be one to watch, especially for those who question whether the platform’s incentive plan will work or not.Correction: This article has been revised to reflect Emin Gün Sirer’s title.Disclaimer: CoinDesk received a subsidy to attend the Financial Cryptography and Data Security conference from the event’s organizers.Image via Amy Castor for CoinDesk"

We are thus entering an interesting transition period when successive applications of this technology will encounter legal norms not always adapted to the new reality.One of the more interesting examples to look at is personal data protection.Legal regulations protecting personal data are of great importance in many areas where blockchains already exist: finance, healthcare, electronic identification systems, etc. And while the application of existing data protection regulations in blockchain technology will cause issues, there are solutions.First things first, why are blockchains a challenge for the protection of personal data? There are three main reasons:Why are blockchains an opportunity for personal data protection?The legislation that most governs the protection of personal data in the European Union is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).Although the GDPR is said to have been designed to be technologically neutral and adapted to processing personal data in different contexts, structures and manners, in the case of blockchain technology, many questions are raised, nonetheless.The answers will be different for different types of blockchains, but here are some issues that need to be addressed:A look at blockchains through the prism of data protection laws – especially laws as ambitious as the GDPR – is an interesting exercise, since it is not just a question of concluding that the application of this technology will generate legal problems.This is only one side of the coin.Blockchains may also become key components of future institutions, systems and mechanisms developed to cope with data protection regulations. For maximum efficiency, blockchain elements will likely combine with traditional solutions.The advantages of this technology can be used to build a truly effective framework for the protection of personal data, in which the data subject will have actual power to control how their data is used.Therefore, we are facing quite a challenge. We should interpret the laws, and design and build blockchain applications, in a manner that maximizes their synergy. Otherwise we will be stuck in a situation where the law will hold back the development of technology and innovation, while personal data will be protected less and less effectively.Data protection image via Shutterstock"

The Mint is working with bitcoin startup BitGo and white-label exchange software provider AlphaPoint to develop the market, with a planned launch eyed for later this year.According to CME Group, which is also involved in the project, a number of as-yet-undisclosed financial institutions are also involved in the development and testing of the platform. The firm said that as much as $1bn worth of gold will be digitally represented using the blockchain being developed in partnership with BitGo, as detailed in a blog post published earlier this week.Sandra Ro, head of digitization at CME, said in a statement:“This is the first digital gold product that is institutionally targeted – and the first to work with a government entity – to be currently in a live testing state.”The Royal Mint will be responsible for issuing on-chain assets and maintaining the gold reserves. Rules regarding transactions and block creation will be verified and enforced by a community of validators which will include exchange customers, academic and public institutions, as well as corporate partners. Meanwhile, transactions will be verified by a peer-to-peer network of nodes. Wallets tied to the system will utilize multi-signature security protocols.When the project was unveiled last year, Royal Mint chief finance officer Vin Wijeratne positioned it as a way to improve the ways in which gold is traded.“Developing a trading platform with CME Group will satisfy customer demands for faster, cost effective and secure ways to buy, hold and sell gold and complement our existing product,” Wijeratne said at the time. “This landmark partnership allows us to combine the world’s leading mint, the best futures trading platform globally and best in class technology.”Mint coin via Shutterstock"

With the introduction of Segregated Witness (SegWit), litecoin, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, should see a boost in the capacity of its currently limited transaction throughput, among other changes to its protocol.Adding impact to the news is the context in which this upgrade takes place.SegWit has been at the heart of bitcoin’s scaling debate since it was first proposed at the end of 2015. On that network, miners have been hesitant to support the change for technical and political reasons, and as such, users have been calling to test the technology on litecoin as a way to determine whether concerns are valid.Since SegWit could potentially pave the way for technologies that expand the value proposition of cryptocurrencies, the move toward accepting the upgrade has reignited excitement around the normally less-popular cryptocurrency. Litecoin’s price has nearly tripled since the end of March as a result.But, what’s the big deal? Why are some in the community so eager to see the change?Litecoin Foundation director Franklyn Richards argued that the upgrade might pave the way for other technologies to be tested on a live platform, such as the long-proposed Lightning Network and sidechains – a sentiment echoed by mining pool F2Pool operator Wang Chun when contacted by CoinDesk.And, oddly enough, some see it as a way to move forward bitcoin’s scaling debate, even if it’s unclear exactly how that might happen.As the rules are coded into litecoin, the change will lock-in when 75% of blocks over a two-week period feature a snippet of code flagging support for SegWit.If by a predetermined point (block 1193472), 75% are still flagging support, then the code change will activate, making SegWit a permanent piece of the litecoin network.At press time, this decision was roughly 600 blocks away.After that, there are two weeks or so to go before the change officially activates to give wallets and users sufficient time to adopt the change. This process was originally described in BIP 9, a specification that outlines the currently favored method of making consensus-level changes to bitcoin.Further, it’s a backwards-compatible change, so litecoin services don’t need to upgrade to support the transactions if they don’t want to. And, perhaps partially because litecoin transaction volume is still low, wallets don’t seem to be in a rush to do so.“LiteVault may support creation of SegWit addresses in the future, if the demand for them exists. And at that time, LiteVault will be upgraded to be able to spend from those SegWit addresses,” said a spokesperson for the popular litecoin wallet.He added that, as far as he knows, no wallets currently support SegWit-style transactions.The bigger consequences of the change are a bit longer term.For one, it seems likely that an up-and-running version of the Lightning Network will also be deployed on litecoin, meaning yet another scaling solution originally designed for bitcoin may see live testing on the smaller network.Litecoin creator Charlie Lee said that he’s working with Lightning Labs on the possibility.Meanwhile, another Lightning Network startup ACINQ recently tested its version of the top-layer network on litecoin. It noted that, since the cryptocurrency is very similar on a technical level to bitcoin, it works nearly “out of the box”.These sorts of developments might breath new life into the cryptocurrency, since, despite being among the top five cryptocurrencies for a while, litecoin has been all but a barren field of innovation for some time. (F2pool’s Chun, for instance, even went so far as to joke that litecoin doesn’t have any developers.)As for now, it seems last-minute foils to the plan are unlikely due to a consensus from miners. Even mining firms that staunchly oppose SegWit on bitcoin (ViaBTC and Bitmain) have indicated they plan to continue to support the plan.The Litecoin Foundation’s Richards argued that litecoin users “unanimously” support the code change, and that the “politics really only exist on bitcoin”, stating:“If there was any doubt this is what the users want, then it has been thoroughly stamped out as even anti-SegWit pools are upgrading to support SegWit under the pressure.”Yet, SegWit was designed to help to expand transaction volume, and, while this might seem necessary for bitcoin right now (since blocks are filling up), ironically, it isn’t exactly necessary for litecoin. At press time, the cryptocurrency has about a fifth of the transaction volume observed with bitcoin.So, does it really need the transaction capacity boost? Some, including Charlie Lee, have framed it more as a step towards SegWit adoption on bitcoin.Jack Liao, CEO of litecoin mining hardware developer LightningAsic, for instance, admitted to CoinDesk that he expects the upgrade to do “nothing” for the litecoin economy.“But it can push bitcoin community to active SegWit as soon as possible,” he said.Henry Brade, CEO of investment platform Prasos, added that it might mark the first time that another altcoin will work as a technical testbed for bitcoin changes.He further suggested that, if SegWit proves to be safe, it will put more pressure on bitcoin mining pools to adopt the change.He concluded:“At least, a lot of people are hoping it will. There’s a lot of frustration about the whole issue.”Litecoin image via Shutterstock"

Yet, Ripple is now weighing in on the market activity, arguing that the sharp spikes in value of late are evidence of its progress.Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse told CoinDesk:“We have had a significant rally in XRP prices, but it is reflective of a lot of work we have done to make Ripple a very compelling solution.”He emphasized that there have been “huge” network improvements, adding that his company has invested significantly in ensuring that the Ripple Consensus Ledger – along with XRP – truly becomes a leading technology.Yet, not all market participants agree there’s a direct correlation.As the price of XRP has experienced sharp volatility of late (rising and falling 10% in some single sessions), some assert the digital currency became the latest victim of ‘pump and dump’ trading activity, several analysts told CoinDesk. Ripple is certainly not alone in this regard, as several other alternative asset protocols have surged to all-time highs lately and then suffered notable declines.Another major development that has helped provide tailwinds for XRP prices is bitcoin’s ongoing scaling dilemma, according to Garlinghouse.The bitcoin community has thus far been unable to form a consensus on how best to address the problem of block size, and that is sparking interest in alternatives, he reasoned.Because of the technical issue, the average time needed to confirm bitcoin transactions has risen significantly in recent months, reaching 168 minutes on 27th March and 145 minutes on 31st March.Garlinghouse sought to contrast this performance with Ripple’s, tweeting on 31st March that his network’s confirmations were taking an average of 3.7 seconds, while it costs $0.00031 per transaction compared to $0.48 using bitcoin.Yet, here too, analysts offered an alternative picture, contending the quick rise in Ripple’s price was more indicative of speculative market activity.Jacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund trader, told CoinDesk that XRP is most certainly benefiting from an “altcoin fervor” amongst active traders. As a result, buyers were either swayed by some news, or some large buyer chose this week to spark market activity, he posited.As for the decline in price that soon followed, analysts said this may have marked a period of “profit taking”, where long-term Ripple holders sold (and bought back at a lower price) to increase their return on their investment.Still, it remains an open question whether this activity amounts to real use for the Ripple platform. As such, the statements above mark a divide between the startup’s view on the market and those of avid traders.Garlinghouse, for example, suggested that the Ripple network may also be more practical than bitcoin’s, a feature that he argued is attracting users.“One of the big differences between XRP and many other digital currencies is that we are solving a real-world problems for banks and providing ROI. This has been giving us credibility in the broader cryptocurrency space,” he said.Some analysts mentioned Ripple’s partnership with Japan’s largest bank, MUFG, as helping bolster XRP’s price. As a result of this partnership, the Asian financial group will become the latest financial institution to get involved in creating and overseeing payment transaction rules and standards for Ripple’s network.However, such ideas are countered somewhat by the rise in trading activity on markets typically associated with more speculative trading.For instance, one Ripple gateway operator projected more than three-quarters of XRP’s trading activity is now taking place on Poloniex, an exchange for alternative cryptocurrencies that does not offer trading in fiat currency.In this light, the recent moves may mark a combination of factors.Tim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency hedge fund Crypto Asset Management, suggested that Ripple’s developing value proposition was perhaps encouraging it to be more aggressively traded.He concluded:“On a percentage basis, BTC moves have been getting steadily smaller for years. For those who have grown used to trading in that environment – with the attendant risks and rewards – alts have simply become more interesting.”Question mark image via Shutterstock"

First, because the level of mathematical complexity would provide a good benchmark for what was possible in a game-focused smart contract, and secondly, because slot machines are the most popular form of entertainment in Western casinos.(In fact, slot machines are credited for perfecting the addictive mode of user interactions which many modern games and applications try to replicate.)The demo video is recorded with Chrome running the Metamask browser plugin, though any compatible ethereum browser would work, including the Status mobile browser according to San’s post – a factor that could bring smart contract gaming to the lucrative mobile market.A release date for the playable version hasn’t yet been confirmed, but with the gameplay capturing all the gaudy sounds and colours of the real-world slots, there’s sure to be no shortage of gamblers chancing their ether on a winning line.Images via YouTube, Shutterstock"

Science who wrote a master thesis on the subject of bitcoin security in ...","Jun 4, 2017 at 10:40 UTC",Piotr Piasecki is a senior developer at Factom and an MSc in Computer Science who wrote a master thesis on the subject of bitcoin security in 2012.,"In this article, Piasecki offers his commentary on the rising price of XRP, the native token on the Ripple Consensus Ledger, aiming to offer a valuation for the cryptographic asset based on its underlying protocol and desired utility.As some of you might know, I really like the idea behind the Ripple system.Creating a settlement layer based on trust and IOUs, being able to issue any asset easily, working quite well as a middleware layer, incentivizing specialization, creating a singularity of money, all of that is great. The system is not without its flaws however – centralization of validators is an issue, and so is the token distribution.But while both are interesting topics, with the recent meteoric rise in XRP price, I think it’s worth focusing on that part of the discussion.Ripple is a crypto 2.0 system launched in late 2012. It is based on a protocol predating bitcoin by a few years, known as Ripplepay. As any good crypto 2.0 network, Ripple allows its users to issue and transact in any currency. It also supports its own native currency – ripples, or XRPs.XRPs have a few key uses on the ripple network. They are used to pay transaction fees, and are required as reserves for any address using the network and creating trust lines. All in all, it serves as an anti-spam measure for the network. Moreover, since every account on the Ripple network can accept XRPs, it is also promoted as a bridge currency.IOUs are user-created currencies. While any address can issue their own currency, most people will be using IOUs issued by gateways. Those will usually be denominated in fiat or crypto. The IOUs can be traded directly on the network, sent from one user to another, and even perform atomic, multi-currency bounces in a single transaction.There are a few key differences between XRPs and IOUs. IOUs have a counterparty risk: if the issuing gateway defaults, the tokens will be worthless. You can only send IOUs to or through people that also trust the same gateway. The gateways usually charge a small percentage fee on every transaction. IOU transactions are a bit bigger and more complicated, meaning they can cost more to execute. XRPs are their own cryptocurrency, meaning they are not redeemable for anything directly.Beyond that, the Ripple network handles both XRPs and IOUs identically: both can be traded on the decentralised exchange built into the network, both can be part of multi-currency transactions, both operate at the same speed and they are both highly divisible.The main criticism levelled at XRPs, and thus also against the Ripple network, is the way the XRPs were distributed. Ripple Labs, the creators of Ripple, created the network with 100bn XRPs in it, and no new XRPs have been created since the its inception. This is not an unknown practice in the crypto space – a lot of networks ‘pre-mine’ their tokens.However, the network creators usually only keep a fraction of the tokens for themselves, pre-selling the rest to anyone that wishes to buy some. Ripple, however, still owns about 60% of the originally issued tokens. This raises a few issues.First, the company could try cashing out and potentially crash the market. It is very unlikely, however. Ripple has recently taken steps to promote its XRP market and put the majority of their XRPs into an escrow (then again, the escrow is unlocking 1bn XRP every month for the next ~4.5 years, so it could be better).Secondly, since the network fees are paid through ‘burning’ XRPs, they essentially enrich everyone in proportion to the amount of XRPs they hold (if 1% of the tokens got burned, the remaining tokens would be worth about 1% more provided the market doesn’t change). This means Ripple Labs is essentially earning 60% of all network fees on the network. This probably doesn’t amount to much at the current time, but it may be more important in the future.Lastly, the amount of XRPs owned by one company gives it a negative reputation. A lot of people in the crypto space dismiss Ripple outright as a ‘pre-mined scamcoin’ just because of the amount of coins owned by Ripple.All in all, that isn’t too damning, really. Ripple appears to be reputable enough not to try cashing out of what appears to be their golden goose. However, they are not the only major players around…The founders of Ripple, Jed McCaleb, Chris Larsen and Arthur Britto, gave themselves 20bn XRPs early on. This later came to bite Ripple. McCaleb left the team to start his own version of Ripple called Stellar, and decided to sell his XRP stash, resulting in a legal kerfuffle, a settlement and a schedule for how those coins may be sold.If those numbers are correct, McCaleb is still cashing out $20,000 per week, and come ~2019, he will be able to cash out 750m XRP (worth ~$256m at today’s price of $0.34 USD/XRP). Not an ideal situation if the money from your network will be going to a former employee building your direct competitor to the tune of a quarter of billion dollars. While some of those funds might go to charity, that’s still not an ideal outcome.Now that we’ve dealt with most of the issues XRPs have had to face, let’s have a look at how they fare on their own network.While Ripple, the network, has to compete with bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrency networks, XRPs, the currency, have another important competitor – the rest of the assets on the Ripple network. Some networks, like NXT or Counterparty, ensure their native token is at the centre of every trade – you can’t trade IOUs for one another on those networks.In Ripple, you can transact purely in IOUs all day, every day, without touching XRPs for anything else than the fees. This ties to the central value proposition of XRPs – being the universal medium of exchange.The following graph is meant to illustrate how a distributed currency network compares to XRP as medium of exchange.In short, the problem is as follows. If you have many different currencies on the network, you can have potentially a very large number of markets between those currencies (mathematically, twice as many markets as there are currencies).This means you would have to have a lot of market makers providing liquidity to every market. However, if everyone agreed to use XRPs as the common currency, you would only need to make one market per currency – between that currency and XRP.At the moment, it looks like that is the case – the major markets on the Ripple network are all trading XRPs for the various currencies issued on the network. At the time of writing, $11m-worth of trades and $88m-worth of payments have been executed on the Ripple network in the last 24 hours, majority of which were using XRPs.The main advantages given for XRPs being better than IOUs are:However, there are also some drawbacks to XRPs, even not counting the coin distribution and centralization. Just because someone can receive XRPs, doesn’t mean they’ll want to settle in XRPs. The network just essentially forces everyone to have an unlimited trust line to XRPs, even if they wouldn’t want to hold them.XRPs might be a decent universal currency for people that want to hold XRPs, but that might not be ideal for banks or big institutions.That’s why we see networks like Corda, or even Interledger Protocol (also developed by Ripple Labs), that don’t rely on a native cryptocurrency gaining traction, while the best example of a real-world application relying on a crypto token in the middle is Abra. Creating a universal, international settlement currency was the idea behind bitcoin, and you don’t really see banks using it for that cause.Market making essentially boils down to either trading the currency like any other crypto, or copying the market from another source to offset your trades. The amount of liquidity you could copy with XRPs is small in comparison to the nigh-on bottomless FX market from the real world. If you are going to see real-world use cases being deployed on Ripple, they are more likely to be leveraging the existing FX markets, rather than going through XRPs.While XRPs have no counterparty risk, they also have no counterparty protection. If anyone steals your XRPs, they are gone. With IOUs, you can still appeal to the issuing gateway to halt the transaction and potentially track down where it was withdrawn to. The IOUs are thus much less of a target.On a similar note, XRPs are much harder to track, which would make them less appealing from a compliance standpoint. Gateways on the other hand can whitelist and blacklist addresses that can use their IOUs, thus having an easier time identifying anyone that uses their IOUs.If the value of a given currency changes, you only need to adjust the market using that currency. If XRPs were the universal currency against which all of the currencies would be traded, any time the value of XRPs would fluctuate, you’d have to adjust the entire market.Adding a new currency to the distributed IOU network wouldn’t necessarily mean you’d have to trade it against every other currency. You could only start trading it against the most popular currency or a few currencies that are easy to make the market for (say, fiatUSD, fiatEUR). Because you can easily execute multi-currency atomic transactions on the network, connecting to even one other currency connected to the network instantly means you are connected to the rest of the network.XRPs have no transfer fees attached to them. While is possible for a gateway to issue IOUs without transaction fees (that’s essentially Tether’s business model, but on another network), perhaps even leveraging some other big crypto like bitcoin or ethereum through voting pools, the fees on those IOUs can always be changed.It seems that the network standard for transfer fees is about 0.2%, which seems to be smaller than the spread on XRP’s biggest market (at the time of writing, 0.00015086 sell, 0.00015003 buy, giving about 0.55% spread). So, it is possible that by sending money through a very liquid FX market you would pay less in transfer fees than going through a less liquid XRP market on just the spread.So this leaves XRPs with their primary role: paying transaction fees and fulfilling the needed reserves. All in all, about 50–100 XRPs per person or account would be enough for a lifetime of usage. That used to be less than $1, and now is about $35.The Ripple network is a very useful crypto 2.0 tool.However, because of the high flexibility and value propositions of the IOUs on the Ripple network, they are XRP’s main competitor in its home court. While XRPs are still needed to pay the network fees, most of the remaining value prepositions can be seen as overstated.The recent rise in the price of XRPs appears to be largely relying on market speculation (as is the case for all crypto) and a new exchange coming on the market.This article originally appeared on the author’s blog and has been republished here with permission.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership in Ripple, the company that overseas the open-source Ripple Consensus Ledger.Water ripples image via Shutterstock"

We also want to listen, and we want to enable,” Zilgalvis told CoinDesk.Von Weizsäcker stressed the desire of the European Union (EU) to monitor, not suffocate, and pointed out that its role is to respond to the needs of constituents. To this end, the EP wants to get a feel for the sector, since “there is a public interest in what’s going on”.Overall, this interest was evident in the room, where every seat was full and stand-ups were lining the back wall. There, parliament members, financial enterprises, academics and blockchain businesses were eager to hear more about what could be the first step toward building a comprehensive policy that would clarify development in the future.Far from delivering the expected conciliatory and safe platitudes, the comments from moderators and panelists alike showed a willingness to recognize the urgent need for a new understanding and new rules, as well as a strong desire to overcome the difficulties in deciding what those rules should be.The subject of liquid democracy came up often, culminating in the question, “What will the role of politicians be?”. One commentator remarked on the irony of a disruptive technology that, rather than generating chaos, adds stability.The opinion was ventured that it’s not so much about creating new regulation as about adapting existing regulation to new terminology. And concern was expressed about the consequences of something going wrong with the technological base of a new paradigm.In a wide-ranging keynote speech, technologist Vinay Gupta called on the EU to “pick up the pace”, and outlined a framework to understand the difficulties in regulating software. In short, according to Gupta, you can’t. Software is “regulated for what it does”, he said.In conversation with CoinDesk, MEP Eva Kaili repeated this sentiment:“We can’t legislate the technology, but we can legislate the uses.”In her closing remarks, Claire Bury, deputy director general of the European Commission’s Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content & Technology, cited ethereum as “one of the more sophisticated applications”.She went on to highlight the technology’s challenges, quoting developer Vlad Zamfir’s recent tweet that “ethereum isn’t safe or scalable”.The surprising mention of the smart contract platform by a regulator was echoed in the results of an audience poll. In response to the question: “What should regulation focus on?”, the most popular answer, displayed in full color on a screen above was “ethereum”.As for next steps, the Blockchain Observatory will continue to engage industry representatives to get a feel for where to focus their regulatory efforts. The sense of urgency was palpable, but seemed to stem more from intense interest than a conviction that it would be easy.As von Weizsäcker pointed out, “It’s going to take a little bit longer than people anticipated.”An important question, he emphasized, is what governments could do to help the development of digital technology. Von Weizsäcker ventured that this could be achieved by governments using that technology themselves.He then suggested that an example could be an application that did two things: 1) put identities of companies or people on the blockchain, and 2) put money on the blockchain, speculating that private applications could be built on such an infrastructure.Lastly, the subject of bitcoin as a new form of money was broached, as was the question of whether it – or something similar – would ever replace the fiat currencies we know today.Von Weizsäcker was notably noncommittal on that front. He did, however, make an observation that cryptocurrency enthusiasts are familiar with, but that was unusual coming from a politician.He stated:“What is a currency really? It’s a ponzi game.”Image via Noelle Acheson for CoinDesk"

Blockchain Partner offers blockchain consultation services in France.
","In this opinion piece, Stachtchenko provides an in depth overview of the blossoming blockchain scene in France, arguing that now is the time to take official engagement in the tech to the next level.How well does France perform in the blockchain field? It is an interesting question to raise when speaking about the country that represented the third biggest world presence at the CES 2017 in Las Vegas, just behind the US and China, and the second in terms of startups.This article aims to present a quick panorama of the French blockchain situation.As of today, the French government has shown some interest in the technology, without yet having launched major initiatives in that field. Its main initiative was taken in March 2016 by the Ministry of Economy, when a decree was passed, based on crowdfunding laws, to allow debt-based instruments (mini-bonds) to be issued on a blockchain. If this first step is a success, the ministry envisaged “introducing this type of regulatory framework, for example, for unlisted securities”.Several banks have already communicated some positivity around related projects, such as BNP Paribas along with the startup Smart Angels.On the parliamentary level, an entire day dedicated to blockchain technology was organized in March 2016 at the National Assembly, with the participation of French blockchain startups (such as Blockchain Partner, Stratumn and Paymium), large companies (such as AXA and La Poste) and universities, researchers and public authorities. This was followed by another parliamentary forum in October 2016.More recently, the Public Treasury has launched a public consultation to gather ideas on how to boost blockchain development in France. In May 2017, France Stratégie, the French Prime Minister’s cabinet for national strategies analysis, held several hearings on blockchain issues such as legal and social issues or regulations.Similarly, several public institutions have started to take initiatives around the tech. For example, the French central bank has been working on an interbank proof-of-concept with the assistance of Blockchain Partner since last year. It also launched a Lab for blockchain startups last February.La Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations, a French public financial institution, has also launched a workgroup called LabChain to conduct experimentations with large companies such as BNP Paribas, AXA, etc, alongside a number of blockchain startups.More recently, Finance Innovation, a French institution dedicated to fostering the French financial sector, is setting up a working group to guide the government over initiatives they will need to lead in the blockchain sector.However, knowing that blockchain is still immature and complex, the legal status of blockchain technology is still open for debate. To tackle this issue, working groups have been launched with the participation of public authorities and lawyers.Even though France has taken some initiatives concerning blockchain, its actions are still somewhat timid. I would argue that it is now time to go beyond organizing conferences and workshops. For instance, French authorities could set up real experimentations, as has been happening in many other countries.There are many potential use cases for the technology being worked on elsewhere, from electronic voting secured on blockchain (Australia), to traceability of welfare spending (the UK), or land registry (Sweden and Georgia) and healthcare systems (US and Estonia).Some large French companies have seen the threats and opportunities of blockchain and as a result have started experimenting with the technology to avoid being left behind.As in the rest of the world, the first companies that have launched initiatives are the large banks, such as BNP Paribas, which has launched several proofs-of-concept (PoCs): for instance, an inter-company ‘immediate’ payment service, or the crowdfunding project mentioned above.Other banks have joined the R3 banking blockchain consortium, including Société Générale, RCI Bank & Services and Natixis.Meanwhile, some of the large financial institutions and the ‘Big Four’ auditing and consulting firms have created internal divisions to better understand and use blockchain technologies. Companies from other sectors are slowly building awareness around blockchain technology, and are starting to dig into it, for example SNCF (transport), Carrefour (retail) and Total (energy).The French blockchain startup ecosystem is of medium size compared with leading nations, but is dynamic and blossoming, with several startups eager to take on the world.Apart from Blockchain Partner, one of the most famous is Ledger, which raised €7m in March 2017, and is known for the quality and security of its hardware wallets.Stratumn, which also raised €7m in May 2017, is another example of a well-known startup. The firm offers a platform for developing enterprise-level blockchain applications. Acinq is also a rising star in the international blockchain scene. A pioneer of Lightning Network implementations, its Eclair project attempts to tackle bitcoin’s scaling issue.More recently, iEx.ec, a startup focusing on distributed computing for ‘dapps’ (decentralized applications), raised more than €12m in less than three hours through an initial coin offering, or ICO. And there are many more companies, less known but also showing promise, such as Ledgys, Woleet and so on.This crowd of startups is aware that to be stronger they need to work together. To that end, they have started meeting up and uniting in associations.French startups collaborate in associations to defend their interest and make their voice heard by public authorities.The general impression is that, for the moment, only big players such as banks or main financial institutions are giving their opinion to the regulators and public institutions, mostly focused on consortium blockchains. In this context, startups’ ideas and issues need to be listened to and dealt with, to ensure that an overall sound legal and public environment will be developed for blockchain technologies.The biggest association is Chaintech (a wink to the ‘Frenchtech’ label created by the government) with more than 120 members, representing around 20 startups, including Blockchain Partner, Ledger, Stratumn, Ledgys, Woleet, Belem, Bity, etc.Chaintech aims at “promoting visibility and synergy of French speaking blockchain actors, and give them a common institutional voice”. It organizes and participates in meetings, conferences and hackathons (such as Le BlockFest 1.0, held in 2016 – a founding moment for Chaintech).In addition, there are Le Cercle du Coin (a pioneer association in France, historically more focused on bitcoin) and Asseth (focused on ethereum). Less formal is the CryptoFR community, organized around a forum and a Slack group with more than 1500 people.This landscape is boosted by numerous passionate and specialist individuals, mainly emanating from the bitcoin and ethereum communities.ESILV, a French engineering school, was one of the first academic institutions in the world to show its interest in blockchain technology by certifying student diplomas on bitcoin at the beginning of 2016.The school has also been integrating blockchain in its curriculum. As early as September 2015, students were already being offered a course on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in order to understand how blockchain technologies work under the hood.Furthermore, the department of financial engineering launched, in September 2016, a fintech major which includes courses on cryptography, payment systems, blockchain and the history of currencies until bitcoin. ECE, another engineering school in Paris, is also quite active, thanks to its numerous alumni working in blockchain startups or projects.However, these kinds of initiatives are still rare and France needs more universities to take on the subject.Awareness is rising, though. In March 2017, ESCP Europe, a business school, held the first conference on French blockchain academic research in partnership with Blockchain Partner and the Ministry of Economy.While there are still few big actors or large-scale public initiatives, the French blockchain community is very active, thanks to the associations that federate the ecosystem, and public authorities are slowly building awareness of the subject.All the conditions are being met for France to become a major actor in the international blockchain scene, and the future looks very promising.Louvre museum image via Shutterstock"

What most people do they make an account at the exchange, they make an account at the exchange and they just leave them there. It causes a huge counterparty risk.”Still, Voorhees cautioned that Prism isn’t meant to be “all things to all people”, but rather just a product for the growing number of more casual cryptocurrency users who want to gain exposure to certain assets without the risk created when dealing with exchanges.And that’s a valid concern in an industry where exchanges have proven susceptible to hacks, fraud and issues with banking providers that have impaired their operations and cost users money.With Prism, the user experience changes. Instead of buying a cryptocurrency and keeping those funds on an exchange (or holding the keys in an offline wallet), users put a dollar amount, invest it in “bitcoin”, “ether” and “monero” and select the exposure they would like the “portfolio” to have relative to the price fluctuations of each asset.In this case, there is no bitcoin or monero, only ether in a smart contract that changes its value based on data fed to an oracle that receives its prices from traditional exchanges.“Now that the Prism has been created, the investor can watch the current value of their portfolio, which will rise and fall with the value of the underlying assets,” the company stated.There’s also a social component, with the most successful prisms showing up on a leaderboard of where these custom assets are ranked. “People can see the Prism you made, and they can clone it and make their own portfolio,” Voorhees said.In this way, the product is the latest that seeks to capitalize in the run-up of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, which exceeded $60bn for the first time this year, reaching a new all-time high last week.Users create Prisms by first putting up a certain amount of collateral (denominated in ether) into a smart contract. (Behind the scenes, a smart contract operated by ShapeShift deploys a smart contract that represents the portfolio.)Users then fund the address they provide, and for which they responsible for maintaining, keeping the custody of the assets underlying the portfolio.Finally, users send funds to the address, thereby creating a contract. The result is that the portfolio doesn’t even hold ether assets, but rather it tracks contract terms, which are set up to change to track the value of all the assets.“A prism portfolio doesn’t have a bunch of proxy tokens sitting somewhere, it is simply ethereum as collateral put into the contract by the buyer and ether put into the contract from the seller, and the price can rise and fall,” he continued.Still, to create the Prism, another user needs to take the other side of the trade that sets up the account, effectively betting against each investment in the portfolio.Future versions of the product, Voorhees said, may enable users to enter into such agreements with other users, but to start, ShapeShift will be the counterparty to every transaction, hedging its trades in the background to ensure the integrity of its finances.“The simplest explanation is you make a prism of 1 bitcoin, that’s the whole prism. It’s worth 1 bitcoin. ShapeShift takes the other side of that, so that means ShapeShift is short 1 bitcoin. ShapeShift just buys a bitcoin from someone, then if bitcoin goes up it lost $10 on the prism, but gained $10 on bitcoin, so it’s a wash,” he explained.In this way, ShapeShift will make its money on closing costs associated with the accounts.Users will be charged a 2.4% fee to close out Prisms, plus 0.05 ETH (about $6 today), a fee that covers the gas cost the ShapeShift must pay to run the smart contracts on the public ethereum blockchain.As the Prisms are fully with ether capital, there’s also a 1% per month fee paid to cover that cost of capital.The product launch also marks an evolution for ShapeShift, originally founded in 2013 as an advancement over traditional order-book exchanges.Instead of trading, users of the original ShapeShift project swap between cryptocurrencies, a process that occurs without the need for account creation or management, reducing trust in the service, and as long argued by Voorhees, creating a value proposition in line with the spirit of decentralized economic networks.Still, Voorhees appears to already be thinking ahead to the next step.In conversation, he mentions how the technology exists for users to take their Prism and issue tokens on the ethereum blockchain representing shares in that Prism.“There’s no block on someone doing that,” he said.Voorhees has even gone so far as to conceptualize a time when regulated firms may even use a white-label version of the service, or a similar type of technology, for the more traditional financial assets that are well-known by Wall Street.When broaching the subject, I even float the idea, speculating it could as far as 20 years into the future, should the technology mature sufficiently.Voorhees concluded:“Well, more like in five years, but I don’t want to get into that too much.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in ShapeShift. Images via ShapeShift"

Missouri resident Jason Klein plead guilty to selling bitcoin to undercover agents on five separate occasions, and a seller from Rochester, New York named Richard Petix plead guilty to the same charge a week prior.Court documents detail how Mansy would purchase bitcoin through digital currency exchanges Coinbase and Bitstamp, later selling the digital currency on LocalBitcoins and depositing the proceeds into bank accounts connected to a company he operated, TV TOYZ, which was also named in the government’s lawsuit.Coinbase, according to a prosecutorial filing from 15th May of this year, closed Mansy’s account in June 2014 after questioning him about the nature of his account. Communications between Mansy and support staff for Coinbase and Bitstamp were included in that document, showing how both exchanges raised questions about Mansy’s bitcoin purchases and whether he had registered with the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a money transmitter.The prosecutorial document shows that Mansy argued, in discussions with the US Department of Homeland Security, that he wasn’t operating a money transmission business.“According to Mansy, he had looked up the money service business requirements on the Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) website and determined that his business model did not apply to that of a money service business,” the filing stated.Mansy faces as many as five years in prison and $250,000 in fines at sentencing later this year.Image via Shutterstock"

of a venture capitalist or investment professional: khaki pants, a 
collared ...","Apr 18, 2017 at 11:30 UTC","Bruce Fenton is managing director of wealth management firm Atlantic Financial, a board member of the Bitcoin Foundation and host of the annual industry event Satoshi Roundtable.","In this entry in CoinDesk’s “Bitcoin Milestones” series, Fenton recalls the wide-eyed days of TNABC 2014 – a two-day conference held in Miami that he argues marked the beginning of a new, more professional bitcoin era.It concluded with a rooftop party, had controversial dancing girls and saw one startup hand out bitcoin wallets with neon vodka shots.That’s probably what most people remember about The North American Bitcoin Conference Miami. Organized by Moe Levin and held in the days when bitcoin’s price had gone from a few dollars to more than the price of gold, the industry had yet to hit the turbulence that this early success would bring.As an industry without leaders, a governing structure or centralized control, we relied – and still rely – on our peers. This isn’t just for validating transactions and making sure that the network works, but for sharing news, knowledge and the social interaction needed to keep pace with change. Because of the lack of structure, events are particularly important, and early industry events had an entirely different character than most do today.What many might forget about TNABC 2014, however, is that it was simultaneously the last of the era of pure ‘community events’ and the first of the ‘business events’ to follow.At my first bitcoin conference, for example, I wore the standard ‘uniform’ of a venture capitalist or investment professional: khaki pants, a collared dress shirt and a blazer. I was vastly overdressed. To try to blend in with a sea of casual T-shirts, leather jackets and Phineas Gage (who was wearing a pink tutu), I quietly slid off my blazer crumpled it into a ball and threw it in the corner.During the coffee break, I introduced myself to a young hacker-looking fellow and mentioned that I was interested in the technology and came from the world of investment management.I don’t think he meant it in a rude way when he responded:“Yeah, we don’t really need suit-wearing Wall Street stooges here… Bitcoin is different.”By January 2014, the industry had changed: record price highs and new interest from investors were shaping the landscape. Someone wearing a suit coat would now no longer be alone.Indeed, a few professional-looking executives were sitting near the front row in Miami, and whispers could be heard saying, “See those guys? They are venture capitalists! Here! At a bitcoin event!”The thought that serious investors would be interested in this industry was both exciting and validating.Outside my hotel room, an orange Lamborghini was parked bearing the license plate “BitPay”, a wise publicity stunt for one of the few young startups seeking to raise early venture investments around a bitcoin business.The conference hall still had that same exciting buzz that was characteristic of the earliest bitcoin events – few, if any of us, were attending with any hopes or expectations of an ROI.There was no division, no scaling debate, no pressure from investors to deliver, no rivalries, no major regulatory involvement and no notable agendas, just pure energy and excitement about something new.The attendees walked from room to room overwhelmed with positive energy and a steady flow of information.Steve Beauregard took the stage at the event, as did Charlie Lee.Shortly after the major announcement that TigerDirect would be one of the first major retailers to accept bitcoin as a payment option,Roger Ver gave a presentation that very few of us had seen before. He talked about the potential for this technology, he reassured many that it was “not too late” to become involved and he closed with a heartfelt statement that people having control of their own money can reduce war.I’m sure I was not the only one in the audience who had a tear in their eye thinking about the potential of this amazing technology.After hearing from Jeff Berwick and Elizabeth Ploshay (now McCauley), I headed to the adjacent conference room to hear from a young entrepreneur named Charlie Shrem. I was particularly interested in his thoughts on the upcoming BitLicense hearings, which were scheduled for later that week.As we all now know, Charlie never made it to Miami nor to testify at the BitLicense hearings (he was arrested at the airport in New York). His arrest was used as fuel for Ben Lawsky’s media show, and would throw the hearings into disarray, placing bitcoin proponents on the defensive.As if the event had not been eventful enough, a very young man named Vitalik Buterin – who’s title on the program handout was “Head Writer at Bitcoin Magazine” – started his presentation in the main room.This was the first announcement of a brand-new project called ethereum.Now an accomplished presenter with hundreds of engagements under his belt, the Vitalik of January 2014 was nowhere near as polished. On his first major public speaking event, he seemed a bit nervous and hard to follow. Whatever lack of polish he may have had in his presentation skills, however, did not hamper interest in this project.After listening with rapt attention, at the conclusion of his presentation, a mob of a couple dozen people swarmed the then little-known 19-year-old. Forty-something computer scientists and developers flocked to learn more about joining the project, some of them reportedly changing careers to join ethereum right on the spot.Brock Pierce and Nic Cary concluded the day’s speakers.Buzzing from information overload, I retired to my room at The Clevelander.It was a day full of excitement and energy. It was a lot to process. And looking back, there were hints of the troubles to come as well.Earlier in the day, an experienced bitcoiner warned me about impending troubles at an exchange called Mt Gox.Tired as I was, I decided to heed his advice and move my bitcoins out of the exchange. I received an error message mentioning something about issues with a hot wallet. I broke my withdrawals into smaller pieces and was able to get them to execute. I did several transfers this way until I received a different error: “Bitcoin withdrawals are suspended until further notice”.This suspension would, of course, never be lifted.But I wasn’t concerned then. As I drifted to sleep, I reflected on the incredible people I had met, the weekend and exciting potential ahead.It was wild and crazy, a space filled with the most interesting and eclectic group of geeks, geniuses and rebels I had ever seen. The early days of pure speculation were ending. I was sure real capital and established interests were moving in.This proved true. We’d have some ‘group hug’ moments, but we’d never again be the eager, wide-eyed band of idealists who came together in Miami.Like many, I thought to myself:“This bitcoin thing is real. It’s here to stay. I can’t wait to see what happens next.”Images courtesy of TNABC"

lauded for the creative way it seeks to increase transaction capacity ...","Apr 21, 2017 at 14:05 UTC",Litecoin’s scaling debate may be coming to an end.,"A group of miners and exchanges is throwing support behind a new proposal, an agreement that follows weeks of increasingly acrimonious debate over whether the technical upgrade would be enacted on the litecoin network, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.Backed also by the cryptocurrency’s creator, Coinbase employee Charlie Lee, the statement endorses a “Segregated Witness soft fork on Litecoin”, which would bring a scaling upgrade first proposed for bitcoin to litecoin, most likely sooner than it could be activated on the bitcoin blockchain.According to organizer and litecoin community member ‘PZ’, the meeting was held on WeChat for over eight hours, from 12pm to 8pm Beijing Standard Time today.Created by bitcoin’s development team, the SegWit upgrade has long been lauded for the creative way it seeks to increase transaction capacity without needing to alter hard-coded block size rules. Litecoin, like bitcoin, also has a 1 MB cap on the total capacity of transactions per block, and as such, it faces similar scalability constraints long term.Overall, the statement endorses a collaborative approach and blasts the use of so-called user-activated soft forks, or UASFs, as viable scaling alternatives.The post reads:“We agree that protocol upgrade should be made under community consensus, and should not be unilateral action of developers nor miners. We advocate that Litecoin protocol upgrade decision should be made based on the needs of the users, through the roundtable meeting voting process, and activated by miner voting.”Miners backing the proposal include Bitmain (Antpool), BW.com, BATPool, F2Pool and LTC1BTC – a combination that represents roughly 68% of the hashrate. That number rises to approximately 84% if you include LTC.top, which is reportedly controlled by the same owners as LTC1BTC according to the meeting’s organizer.Notable among the participants, however, is Bitmain, which threw its support behind a potential block size increase as well in the future – provided that capacity usage rises over a certain threshold.Speaking to CoinDesk, Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu confirmed he was personally in attendance at the meeting, despite his long opposition to the same upgrade on the bitcoin network. He said that it was the combination of SegWit, with a promise to support on-chain scaling solutions, that ultimately led Bitmain to back the proposal.“Charlie [Lee] promised to provide solution of increasing the block size when it is half full,” he said.Going forward, it’s unclear how quickly the capacity upgrade could be enacted on litecoin. Miners will now need to signal for the upgrade by downloading the latest software that includes support for SegWit.More than 75% will need to signal for the upgrade, and this figure will need to be held for two weeks, according to the original proposal, published with the software in January.“When the usage of litecoin block capacity is over 50%, we will start to prepare for a solution to increase the 1 MB block size limit through a hard fork or soft fork,” the statement reads.According to organizers, efforts are being made to bring other parties and stakeholders within the group, including exchange services Bitstamp, BTC-e, Bitfinex and Poloniex.Stan Higgins contributed reporting.Agreement image via Shutterstock"

According to ShapeShift, platform growth has averaged 48% per month in the last three years, seeing an average monthly trade volume of about 50,000 bitcoins spread across 40 digital currencies and assets.Although tight-lipped about the exact nature of future ShapeShift products, Voorhees indicated that both were new types of exchange, one built entirely around smart contracts.More broadly, Voorhees spoke to the exchange’s clear vision of the potential diversity of cryptocurrency tokens, which was less well understood by the industry in 2014.He told CoinDesk:“What we saw when we started was that tokens were going to become a widespread phenomenon. We believed there would be blockchain tokens representing all sorts of value beyond currency, and that’s become increasingly true, which is why ShapeShift’s frictionless exchange is important.”Voorhees also said that ShapeShift’s policy of not holding any customer assets or other details helped to give confidence that the effect of any hacks or other breaches would be minimal.“We take consumer protection to a new level by not endangering them in the first place,” he said. “In the hack we suffered a year ago, it was the first exchange hack where customers weren’t at risk either in funds or personal information.”The funding coincides with a broader uptick in interest for alternative cryptocurrencies, with this market experiencing a recent boom some suggest is a sign it is developing into a new asset class.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in ShapeShift. Image via Shutterstock"

now, and works extremely well for what it was intended: managing ...","Mar 26, 2017 at 11:00 UTC","Arno Laeven is a strategy and innovation consultant at Laeven Consult, and the former blockchain lead for global healthcare giant Philips.","In this CoinDesk opinion piece, Laeven offers his advice for organisations setting out to explore blockchain with a view to adoption, arguing that expectations need to be managed at this early stage of the tech.Even though motivational speaker and author Simon Sinek has over 300,000 followers on Twitter, 80,000 on LinkedIn and his Ted Talk was viewed 30 million times and counting, most people still don’t do what he advises and start with ‘Why?’.So, when looking at blockchain tech for your organisation, why would you want to get involved in a technology which is immature, where the legal framework is unclear and where business models are still hard to come by?To start with the technology, sure bitcoin has been around for eight years now, and works extremely well for what it was intended: managing electronic cash without a central administrator. Yet, demanding anything beyond that on the bitcoin blockchain is complex, if not impossible, due to limitations such as scalability, throughput and privacy.So along comes ethereum which aims to be a decentralised virtual machine or a ‘world computer’ in the words of Gavin Wood, one of the project’s founders. The absence of a central authority is the essence of a blockchain, but also a challenge when you want to ensure users that the machine is working properly.Vlad Zamfir, one of ethereum’s core developers, wrote a great post about the state of ethereum and why he thinks that we all should take care when handling such a powerful but immature technology.I believe that blockchain exploration projects should keep as much ‘off-chain’ as possible, and only use a blockchain for whatever core functionality it may provide for your use case.From a technology point of view, what you are going to explore will likely: a) be obsolete by the time you’ve built it (given the speed of development of the technology), and b) not have the full functionality of a blockchain, since you want to keep as much off-chain as possibleLegal concerns are twofold.First of all, current law and legislation does not fit the technology, as such.Take, for example, the concept of controller and processor: who is what with regard to data on a blockchain?The second issue concerns blockchains replacing and/or altering the concept of law – a subject about which Alan Cunningham of the University of Manchester School of Law wrote an interesting piece. In the article, Cunningham singles out for criticism the concept of absence of governance, which has proven not to hold up in crisis situations (as with failed ethereum project The DAO).He argues further that the roots of blockchain are to be found in anarchistic and libertarian movements. My take is that one cannot embrace blockchains without embracing these world views too.So, then the question becomes broader than law, it is a question of world view. Is a world without government and without central governance one in which you see your organisation functioning?In other words, a choice for blockchain is implicitly also a choice for new forms of governance.That brings me to the third point, that of strategy. Blockchains will alter the value chain and even the organisation itself. This has all to do with the organisation of trust which will shift when introducing a trustless system like blockchain as a foundational layer.Take a look at your own organisation and identify the positions and departments created just to make sure that transactions can be trusted. Auditors, compliance professionals, in-house lawyers and managers are in most cases ‘just’ there for the reason of trust. What if they are no longer needed and what if the cost of transacting goes down and the ease of collaboration goes up?Before addressing those fundamental questions, it’s rather silly to be asking, ‘What’s the business model of the blockchain?’, or ‘What’s its killer app?’.So why, for crying out loud, would you be interested in blockchain?One reason – and it’s not the worst reason – is that your competitors are investigating the tech. FOMO, or fear of missing out, is very real, and the basis for many innovation projects and blockchain consortia.A more intelligent answer, though, is that blockchain could be a technology, legal construct and strategy that profoundly impacts your industry and your company in the mid to long term.So, why should you start exploring now? Because have the chance to influence the course the technology is taking, rather than being confronted by it in a couple of years’ time.Further, blockchain could possibly enable new revenue streams and lower operational costs. A blockchain exploration project therefore should be aimed at moving to deeply understand the consequences of blockchain on a technical, legal and strategic level.Yet, carefully choosing the right use cases for blockchain will be paramount to the success of the project.Navigating maze image via Shutterstock"

The subject line read: “moolah – Mr. Alex Green.” The first line: “Alex Green = Ryan Kennedy/Gentle.”Ryan Kennedy was the founder and CEO of Moolah, a dogecoin exchange startup that Palmer and Ben Doernberg, a friend he met through the cryptocurrency’s non-profit foundation, had just interrogated via a public Skype video over its sketchy doings.Palmer pretty quickly Facebook messaged Doernberg, who was on the other side of the US in New York, sending him screenshots of the email.The message was from a group of people, one of which was an ex-girlfriend Kennedy abused, who said she wanted to expose him for running a ‘Magic: The Gathering’ scam in Bath, England. The note also accused Kennedy of many other past exploits as a scammer in the UK.Later, Palmer received a dump of Kennedy’s entire C: drive from a laptop he had left behind after police had arrested him. (This was after his first crypto-scam on Bitcoin Talk). Some former roommates who were part of the group emailing Palmer had received the laptop from police once Kennedy didn’t return for it.“Holy shit,” Palmer thought at the time, although, he and Doernberg had sensed trouble from the beginning.The group had only put two-and-two together after reading a TechCrunch article about Moolah declaring bankruptcy. Palmer and Doernberg then spent several days putting all the evidence together before publishing it all online as a warning to the dogecoin community.But the community still didn’t buy it, said Palmer. That is, not until Kennedy wrote a blog post admitting to changing his name, although he still denying responsibility for Moolah’s stolen funds.Most cryptocurrency enthusiasts will remember the Moolah debacle.Kennedy came into the community under the guise of Alex Green, an entrepreneur wanting to make buying, selling and trading dogecoin easier. He threw around dogecoin, and not just a couple dollars worth here and there via Twitter, but tens of thousands of dollars at dogecoin meetups.Plus, the company took the lead on several dogecoin-based fundraisers, including sponsoring the NASCAR driver, Josh Wise.Because of all this, the community loved Kennedy.And so it was more than willing to buy into Kennedy’s company, sending bitcoin and receiving a token equivalent to shares of the company (this was even before ‘initial coin offerings’ (ICOs) were part of the broader cryptocurrency lexicon).Through that process, Kennedy raised somewhere around $750,000 from mostly wide-eyed teenagers getting their first taste of the cryptocurrency world, according to Palmer.“I was skeptical of this at first, thinking [Moolah] was a shady, corporate interest taking the fun out of dogecoin,” Palmer explained, adding:“It all seemed like a some kind of pyramid or Ponzi scheme, and Ben [Doernberg] and I started pushing back on it pretty hard.”And the community, hypnotized by a manipulator, was not happy about this.The Skype interview and the published evidence of Kennedy’s alleged scams “culminated in a backlash … and the community kind of ousted us for our opinions,” Palmer said. “We got shouted out and we just said ‘screw it’.”This wasn’t the only case of fraud that swept through dogecoin. And that might seem strange given the cryptocurrency’s friendly outward appearance.From the outside, the parody cryptocurrency featured a Shiba Inu dog and traded for less than a penny – it seemed cute and innocent, but under the surface, was a dark history, riddled with scams.Initially, this piece was just a harmless oral history, but as I spoke with the people whose lives revolved around dogecoin several years ago, it became clear that the story would focus on fraud and as Doernberg told me: “I think that’s the only accurate way to tell the story.”Dogecoin launched in early December 2013, cloned from bitcoin with a few adjustments (including a faster block time, the total number of coins to be released and the hardware needed to mine, oh, and the code was written in the Comic Sans typeface) that made the coin easier for people, especially those new to cryptocurrency to interact with.The jocular tone brought a group of people to the community that didn’t take themselves (and the cryptocurrency) quite so seriously, and because of that, the dogecoin community was known for being far more friendly than the bitcoin community which could be sometimes cut-throat and haughty.Palmer said:“The thing that was cool about dogecoin, I had just spent the past eight months or so learning about bitcoin, but the bitcoin community was full of overly serious know-it-alls. On dogecoin, there were all these regular people that just wanted to know more about cryptocurrency.”Started as a parody because of the vast number of altcoins being launched after bitcoin’s initial rise, the dogecoin community never took itself that seriously.When people came in determined to rally people around raising the price, most responded with memes and the disjointed dialogue of the ‘doge’.That casual style not only caught newbies’ attention, but also scammers’. And with an industry still unregulated, it was a perfect target.“Most scammers saw it as easy to pull off,” said Doernberg, adding:“Because of the unclearness about whether cryptocurrency was legal, even if you ripped someone off, those people many times wouldn’t go to the cops.”It’s almost surprising dogecoin didn’t disband sooner.The first hack happened less than 20 days after the cryptocurrency was launched. About 21m dogecoin, which at that time was equal to $12,000, were stolen from Dogewallet.But the community was determined to keep the joke alive. The community decided to raise the amount of money stolen from the web wallet to reimburse the victims of the hack. According to Doernberg, nearly $13,000 was raised.And that might have been the ‘aha moment’ for many of the community’s leaders, who then began brainstorming ideas for other fundraisers that the dogecoin community could participate in.Plus, only three months later, Dogetipbot, a doge in a spacesuit that allowed users to send dogecoin tips via Reddit, Twitch and Twitter (functionality is currently only available via Reddit now) caught fire as well.Josh Mohland uploaded the tipbot to Reddit and asked if people would upvote his post so he didn’t have to type in a Captcha every time the bot needed to send a tip. The next morning, 3,000 people had upvoted the post and “the thread took off and users started rolling in,” he said.“Before we knew it, we had 5,000 users of the tipbot and hit 10,000 users in a month,” said Mohland, who’s now a customer champion at application automation provider Zapier.Many people “saw it as a gateway cryptocurrency,” said Mohland, explaining:“People would come to dogecoin because it was a nice community that was active in explaining cryptocurrency in a non-technical way that was welcoming.”And to experiment the community decided to fundraise for charities.The first fundraiser, sending the Jamaican Bobsled Team to Sochi, Russia, for the 2014 Winter Olympics, raised $30,000 in dogecoin in 24 hours.And subsequent fundraisers for charities – including one that helped children with autism; one that worked with service animals; and one, Charity Water, which built wells in Kenya – all had similar success.But there was a seedy underground abounding with mining and wallet hacks.“Dogecoin is only second to bitcoin as the shadiest thing in cryptocurrency,” Doernberg said.According to him, while all this big-heartedness was going on, there were more sinister things happening in the background, including people threatening to attack mining pools unless they were paid, and the founders of digital wallets running off with customers’ money.Doernberg dealt personally with an interestingly nefarious scam when the dogecoin community was raising money to send Shiva Keshavan, an Indian luge athlete, to the Sochi Winter Olympics. According to Doernberg, the head of the Winter Games Federation of India, began emailing Doernberg to send the money directly to him or his son, who was also an Olympic athlete.It seemed that the head of the federation wanted to use the money on his son instead of on Keshavan. Keshavan, also in contact with Doernberg, allegedly told him not to send the money to the federation.In the end, the dogecoin community raised about $7,000 for Keshavan, but it never got to its intended recipient. The Indian Ministry of Sports, who at first denied having the money to send athletes, agreed to pay Keshavan’s travel expenses and the dogecoin raised was returned to the donors.Then there was Wolong, a pseudonymous character pretending, according to Doernberg, to be a Singaporean day trader on behalf of the Chinese. “That was the weirdest,” Doernberg said.Wolong created an IRC (internet relay chat) channel that people had to pay to join. Further, people that wanted access had to buy his book of life advice.Wolong apparently manipulated the price of dogecoin for a while before launching ‘pandacoin’, which he pumped and then, three days later, dumped – his millions of coins making significant money for himself while ripping off everyone else that had invested in the altcoin.Ironically, such pump-and-dump schemes were why dogecoin was created in the first place. But, it seems that nothing in cryptocurrency can be all fun and games, not when money is involved.Even though dogecoin weathered the storm of a number of fraudsters and scammers, the Moolah incident created a fissure in the community that it has never fully recovered from, Palmer said.Palmer and Doernberg would eventually be justified in their suspicions about Kennedy – about a year later, he was sentenced to 11 years in prison on several counts of sexual assault and rape.Still, despite these negative events and characters, Palmer believes dogecoin offers an important lesson.“Dogecoin’s value is in its history and lessons about community,” Palmer contends. “There are multiple lessons for other cryptos that can be gleaned from how dogecoin grew and how the community helped that. And at the same time, what [those projects] should strive for their communities to be like.”And this is why a lot of people have stuck with dogecoin. And why those same people will be upset to see it fall into disrepair.“It’s a sad thing, whether the coins you lose are worth much money or not, it’s like losing a piece, a fun piece, of the cryptocurrency history,” said one ‘shibe’ (the name adopted by supporters of the altcoin) who preferred to remain anonymous.He added:“I don’t have much dogecoin. It wouldn’t be a big financial loss, but it would be a loss of something important.”Darth Doge image via Reddit"

Events 路 Latest 路 Opinion ...","May 21, 2017 at 23:01 UTC","The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance has more than tripled in size, with the group announcing 86 new members today drawn from a wide range of industries.","Among the new members are South Korean telecom Samsung, pharmaceuticals giant Merck, automaker Toyota, investor communications platform Broadridge, financial markets firm DTCC, and the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, which oversees licensed businesses in the state.The EEA was officially launched in late February, aimed at developing enterprise-focused solutions with the open-source ethereum as a basis but that are, in some cases, more privacy-oriented. Conversely, the idea is to create a kind of positive feedback loop that leads to improvements of the public blockchain protocol as well.And the diversity of the new members, according to Andrew Keyes, head of global business development for EEA founding member ConsenSys, is evidence that the initiative is positioned to disrupt many more industries beyond the finance world.Keys predicted that the collaborative effort could lead to some unexpected partnerships among the financials, tech giants and nascent startups all working on EEA projects.He told CoinDesk:“Not only can these industries work and learn from each other, you’re going to start seeing multi-sided, or n-sided marketplaces where it’s not just the banks operating with each other, it’s actually the banks turning into software companies and getting close and more seamless with their clients.”Some of the major firms that joined today echoed that sentiment in statements.“We look forward to active collaboration with the members of the alliance,” said Kwang Woo Song, vice president of Samsung’s Distributed Ledger Technology Business Group. “And believe that there will be significant synergy opportunity to drive the adoption of blockchain in the enterprise space.”A number of startups focused on the blockchain space are joining the EEA’s ranks as well, including AlphPoint, BigchainDB, BlockCypher, Datarella, DigixGlobal, Gem, Hashed Health, Hijro, Libra, Melonport, the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance, and the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company.2017 has been a year of major change for the world’s blockchain consortia, and today’s announcement signals that these collaborative efforts are likely to evolve further as the year continues.Early this year, a shake-up at banking consortia R3 saw founding members JPMorgan and Santander align themselves more closely with EEA, even as R3 itself expanded its focus to include a number of regulators among its ranks. Meanwhile blockchain consortium Hyperledger continues to grow its own member base, as well as the number of projects that are developing under its umbrella.As for the EEA, representatives say that its growth phase is far from over.After the group announced its initial batch of 30 members two months ago, it took another month to recruit today’s batch, according to Keys, whose employer, ConsenSys, is widely credited with helping organize the consortium.Now that the members are public, he says it’s only a matter of weeks before the next class is debuted.Keys explained:“We’ve got a similar volume of companies that are still going through onboarding right now, and we’ll be having that announcement next month.”Image of Samsung via Shutterstock"

One buyer went so far as to purchase 20,000 ETH (or about $4.7m) worth of tokens – designed to monetize online attention and create a new revenue source for publishers.Another buyer paid more than $6,000 in ethereum mining fees to almost guarantee their place at the top of the line.Still, that speed has apparently come with trade-offs.Only around 130 people were able to buy the tokens today, with five buyers scooping up about half of the supply. The top 20 addresses in the token sale control more than two-thirds of all BAT, according to Joseph Lee, founder Magnr bitcoin exchange, who conducted a post-sale analysis.The fast nature of the ICO has drawn some ire online from users that were hoping to buy into the token but were quickly shut out. However, the company has so far sought to portray the sale as a success.Eich told CoinDesk:“We are pleased with the sale, and we’re looking forward to disrupting digital advertising and building a user-centric platform for supporting the Web.”A spokesperson later commented on frustrations around the sale, acknowledging some were naturally likely to be “disappointed” that they could not participate.Still, the representative stressed that Brave has received ample positive feedback on the structure of its offering. The company published details of the pricing structure yesterday.For those who haven’t been following, token sales – by which blockchain-linked data is sold as a form or project crowdfunding – have been on the rise in 2017.As such, the Brave sale is the latest in the growing popularity of ICOs, and its lightning fast sale is likely to draw more attention to the funding model, both from companies and regulators. Last week, for example, the popular messaging app Kik announced it would embark on a similar token offering, becoming one of the first mainstream brands to embrace the concept.Looking ahead, Brave has said it will use its remaining tokens to fund basic “grants” for users in the future who may help improve the platform. (The company plans to release the open-source code for BAT on GitHub to foster the creation of a new ecosystem for publishers and readers based on this token.)The browser is aiming to build a digital ad service around the token that cuts out third parties so that users pay BAT to publishers based on how long they browse and read a page. Brave itself will take a cut of these earnings.Brave’s next major challenge will be user and publisher adoption, though it hopes offering an incentive through the token will provided needed assistance.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Brave.Empty plate image via Shutterstock"

The message sent in the December announcement was clear – a shadowy part of the crypto world was finally being opened for business.So, if there’s someone who knows the secret to the budding market, then Polychain CEO Olaf Carlson-Wee might be that person, or at least, the one best positioned to figure it out.Founded in mid-2016 (shortly after Carlson-Wee left VC-backed bitcoin exchange Coinbase), Polychain has emerged the de-facto leader in the market (if for a lack of competition at the moment).The first notable pillar of its investment strategy, however, is that despite what headlines might advertise, Polychain doesn’t see token sales as necessarily a new way of funding, a disruptor for traditional Silicon Valley deals.In a sense, anything that could be considered an existing security isn’t of interest to the firm.Carlson-Wee told CoinDesk:”If your token really doesn’t interact with your business, that token isn’t part of what you’re building. You’re building a business. You’re using tokens to raise money but you could use something else.”So far, Polychain has made only a few of its bets public, but it is largely investing prior to any public sale in lesser-known token-based projects such as Tezos and MakerDAO.It’s also backed ethereum, the second largest blockchain by way of its ether token, hinting that it’s also interested in existing players as well.The investments come amid a banner year for ICOs, which attracted nearly 50% of the capital raised by more traditional blockchain ventures in 2016, according to a report by CoinDesk Research released in March.Still, the survey also found that problems in the market remain.For example, 76% of participants in token sales indicated they were interested in the projects primarily for financial gain – a statistic that backs up the perception that many ICOs may be just ‘pump and dumps’, little more than modern get-rich-quick schemes.But Carlson-Wee disputes these notions about the nascent market.In discussion, he was open about what his team looks for in a token sale, and how it is turning speculation into informed investment strategy.Essentially, it amounts to this: Polychain is looking for tokens that incentivize ‘core actions’ of the protocol, and considers that doing so could result in 100x opportunities.The line of thinking is similar to what was put out last year by Union Square Ventures in a blog post that touted the idea of ‘fat protocols‘, a theory that says blockchains will create the most value for investors at the infrastructure layer, not in applications.What does this mean in practice?For one, Polychain is paying close attention to attempts to tokenize elements of base blockchain components, like the scripting languages they use to describe commands that can then be read by their distributed networks.“We think that application developers are similar to applications on the normal internet, they want a selection of programming languages, and certain applications make more sense in certain languages,” Carlson-Wee said.That’s why Polychain made a bet on Tezos, a husband-and-wife project advertised as having new governance innovations.Tezos is written in OCAML (a language that can be formally verified). This makes it an interesting differentiator, Carlson-Wee said, though even he isn’t yet sure if the feature will create value.“It’s unclear how useful that will be,” he said.One thing that the firm does believe can add value, however, is its support.For example, the firm’s co-founder (an investor who became the firm’s second staff member), Ryan Zurrer, described Polychain less as a VC firm and more as an investment bank, one that is directly involved in helping to boost the projects that it puts its money in.This includes helping projects with marketing efforts and even the structure of their token offerings, he indicated.Take Cosmos, a project aiming to build an ‘internet of blockchains’ that raised $16.8m in 30 minutes last week.“They were only planning on raising $10m, but we realized it’s going to take a long effort to get Cosmos operating, and that it’s a many-year project,” Zurrer said. “Raising the soft cap [on total investment] made sense.”Further, assisting in security auditing is one of Polychain’s biggest value-adds, according to Zurrer.He mentioned Jordie Melina, Joey Krug and the developers behind the smart contracts project Zeppelin as some of the more active auditors working with the firm. Despite high-profile issues with auditing, he also contended that understanding of the science of token issuance is advancing.“It’s increased significantly since The DAO and because of The DAO,” he added, referring to the failed project that lost more than $60m last year.But Polychain is also interested in investing toward a larger vision.Ultimately, Carlson-Wee sees blockchain as providing ways to replicate the entire functions of companies programmatically.“When you think about the endgame of Uber as a protocol competing with Uber as a company, that’s great, but Uber is built on a massive stack of technologies,” he explains. “Mobile, identity and reputation, and without each component, Uber wouldn’t exist.”“What is interesting to us is a decentralized server protocol, a computation protocol, a mobile internet status,” he continues.Asked what the world will look like if the firm’s investments succeed, Zurrer defaulted to similar assessments of change brought about by the internet.Projects like IPFS, Cosmos, Polkadot and ethereum, he said, will form the backbone of an internet where power isn’t centralized in single entities.In the meantime, he explained, the nascent community supporting token-based projects will simply have to work through issues, including the inevitable “spectacular failures” while trying to prove the market can offer more than high-tech penny stocks.For Polychain, that means continuing to invest in talented and robust teams, just like VC firms historically have.He concluded:“It comes down to the technical maturity of the project. Is their white paper a hype paper or is it a technical specification? The rules of early-stage investing haven’t changed.”Casino gambling image via Shutterstock"

But basically in all those different types of money, there’s only one that’s a bearer instrument, and that’s cash.”Starting from the realization that bitcoin could eliminate financial middlemen, Ballinger said he became interested in exploring the idea of applying blockchain to new concepts.“The realization was the value was linked with the transaction, and this means that the transaction itself is a bearer instrument. And therefore all these problems tend to fall away, and it’s all the other middlemen,” he continued.Still, while he’s come to a similar insight as many startups and enterprises, Ballinger detailed a unique philosophy for applying it to the mobility sector – the word chosen not to limit the idea to personal vehicles, but encompassing many forms of mobilized transportation.Elsewhere, Ballinger discussed his frustrations with the existing state of the blockchain industry, and what he described as an environment where real progress is often undermined by companies seeking publicity.“It’s fairly easy to put an asset on a blockchain. But, people put out a press announcement that they’ve put greeting cards on a blockchain – so what?” he remarked.Rather, he voiced his belief that what will make blockchain work at scale is a collection of companies all supporting the network, a development he termed a “minimum viable ecosystem” – a homage to the “minimal viable product” philosophy.“The whole point of platform economics is that the network effect matters. The type of asset on the chain doesn’t matter. More and more, the focus needs to turn to creating an ecosystem, and so I began to think about what does that mean for our industry, how do you create that work in an industry,” he said.In this way, Ballinger said TRI’s big presence at Consensus 2017 was to showcase its work, create buzz and bring more attention to what it said were its lesser publicized applications.Ballinger also put forward a vision suggesting a core belief: that the world’s existing automotive fleets are an underutilized asset.Blockchain technology, he said, opens up the idea for the sharing economy to extend to new networks, potentially creating opportunities for automobile owners – and for Toyota as a company – to rethink how it derives value.“The vehicles and the entire mobility infrastructure can be used more efficiently. It’s hard to monetize your car. The empty seat in a car, it’s pretty hard, the frictional information costs of doing that are prohibitive,” he said.In this way, he sees the broad economic benefits a car enables being broken off and split into distinct markets. Ballinger pointed to potential marketplaces for automotive data, with payments sent for the display of advertising or even to jump ahead of someone in traffic.For now, however, he said the message from TRI is more modest.Asked what he would like to say to those in the traditional transportation ecosystem, he said: “Come join us.”Ballinger went on to say:“The future of mobility is shared, connected and autonomous, and when you think about what technologies are needed for that world, you think of the infrastructure, the IoT-blockchain angle.”Image Credit: APISITH / Shutterstock.com"

In the first five months of this year alone, $136m has been raised in 37 token sales, according to ICO data firm Smith + Crown.But these two worlds are colliding as some leading blockchain VCs show an increasing willingness to participate in the funding mechanism, even if the exploding price of their corresponding cryptocurrencies brings new variables into the age-old investment equation.In conversation with CoinDesk, several leading investors in startups working with bitcoin, ethereum and other tokenized assets almost universally agreed that the explosion in cryptocurrency values has led to even more opportunity, not less, for their existing investment model.Seeking resources beyond just capital, these crypto-startups are increasingly coming to venture capitalists in search of veteran partners and experience.The result is not only more investment opportunities for traditional VCs, but changes to the firms’ overall strategies ranging from a complete rethinking of how they serve startups to a doubling-down of existing practices.Perhaps the most conservative of those polled, Union Square Ventures partner Albert Wenger, described the changing investment landscape to CoinDesk:“We are definitely seeing more and more cryptocurrency businesses, but that was well underway before the current run-up in prices. It is not changing how we feel about the sector.”An early investor in firms such as Coinbase, OpenBazaar, Blockstack and Polychain Capital, Wenger has already helped his New York firm grow from one of the earliest traditional investors in bitcoin to an industry mainstay.Going forward, though, Wenger said USV plans to continue investing “at a steady pace” in spite of the growing popularity of ICOs – a decision placing him largely in alignment with several other investors.One such investor is Brock Pierce, co-founder of San Francisco-based Blockchain Capital, who was among several VCs who also confirmed he has seen an “accelerated” rate of firms entering his company’s pipeline as a result of increasing attention from rising cryptocurrency prices.In fact, Blockchain Capital and USV portfolio company Polychain Capital are both examples of one of the new ways VCs are experimenting with the ICO model, having both participated as early investors in the 0x token sale by buying in early at a 30% discounted rate.Similarly, the co-founder of Menlo Park-based DFJ, Tim Draper, earlier this week participated in another hybrid investment round, this time in Tezos, by agreeing to participate in its ICO.Pushing the concept of hybrid investments even further, Blockchain Capital’s Pierce showed another way VCs are working with ICOs when he made headlines by announcing that his firm had raised $10m in an ICO comprised of tokens designed to comply with securities regulations.Beneath these changes, though, Pierce’s investment strategy stayed the same.With existing investments that already include Abra, Blockstream, BTCC, Ripple and Xapo, Pierce described why he believes the cryptocurrency price increase will likely only have minimal impact on his strategy.“If anything, our risk appetite tends to be counter-cyclical to crypto prices in that we like to deploy capital in times when other investors are nervous,” said Pierce. “And, conversely, we tend to be more skeptical when unbounded enthusiasm sets in and valuations get stretched.”Also experiencing an uptick in startups looking to raise capital is Digital Currency Group (DCG), the New York-based investment firm behind startups such as Axoni, BTCC, Coinbase and Kraken.DCG investing associate Travis Scher reported that the increased popularity of cryptocurrencies has led to what he termed a “modest but not significant increase” in VCs backing digital currency firms.But he cautioned that the increased popularity has its limits, adding that the “run-up won’t last forever,” even if he believes it validates his company’s strategy.Scher said that, while most VCs still don’t know which type of blockchain companies to invest in, they are increasingly becoming “believers in the technology” and are looking for new ways to get involved.He said:“VCs all over the world are seeing the explosion in the value of cryptocurrencies and the innovation that is happening in the space, and many are now exploring how they can invest directly or indirectly in tokens.”The co-founder of Boost VC, Brayton Williams, explained the colliding worlds of venture capital and ICOs a different way. While other investors’ strategies may stay largely the same, he reported that his is evolving in response to the changing landscape.In conversation with CoinDesk, Williams compared the current increased interest to the 2013 bitcoin rally that helped contribute to the venture capital community investing in bitcoin companies, but not necessarily in bitcoin itself.An early investor in Veem (formerly Align Commerce), Blockcypher, Ripio and others, Williams said that, this time around, that trend has continued and “a large disconnect” exists between firms willing to invest in cryptocurrency startups and those willing to invest cryptocurrencies.Williams lists his own firm, along with USV, Blockchain Capital and Pantera, as among those who have been more quick to invest directly in tokens.To demonstrate his point, Williams said he’s currently in conversations with multiple entrepreneurs looking to take advantage of the access to capital provided by ICOs. In exchange for early access, Williams said potential portfolio companies would receive help building a team and developing a strategy leading up to the token sale.He concluded:“Because our goal at Boost VC is to fund and accelerate cryptocurrency and blockchain founders, we are not trying to fight this new trend, we are ready to play our role.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has ownership stakes in Abra, Axoni, Blockstream, Blockstack, BTCC, Coinbase, Kraken, Ripio, Ripple, Xapo and Veem.Unconventional handshake image via Shutterstock"

Yes, but not in the way most people imagine.The combination of technology, regulation and geopolitical shifts points to the emergence of a new type of digital asset: a cross-region blockchain-based currency.Last year, Barbados-based startup Bitt announced the creation of a digital Barbadian dollar, a digital asset pegged to the value of its real-world counterpart and that could be traded on its blockchain platform. The news, while interesting, created little stir given the relatively insignificant size of the Barbados economy.Now, however, other central banks in the region are joining the project – the platform will soon also handle Aruban florins and Bahamian dollars.Given that the three currencies are pegged to the US dollar (although at different rates), switching from one to the other is a simple equation. And a smooth interchangeability would reduce friction and boost trade between the islands.Caribbean economies are being hit hard by the ‘de-risking’ of commercial banks. The US State Department has identified several of the islands’ financial systems as havens for money launderers, which increases the costs for banks maintaining branches there. Given the relatively small size of the economies, many international banks are pulling out of the region, cutting off access to foreign currencies.This especially affects the region’s less-well-off, given their dependence on remittances, and pushes the economies into a downward spiral: the banks pull out because the islands are poor, which makes them poorer still.At CoinDesk’s Consensus 2017 conference this past week, Ryan Peterson of the Central Bank of Aruba quantified the potential benefit:“We did a calculation for the economy of Aruba, and this could potentially lead to a 4–5% GDP growth. Now that, for a region that hasn’t seen 0.5% growth in over two decades, is tremendous.”As a more fluid flow of local currencies provides a welcome relief to small businesses starved of working capital, other regional central banks are likely to take note.Of the 15 local currencies in the region, nine are pegged at a fixed rate to the US dollar, which reduces exchange friction. And with time, as people become accustomed to the ease of use of the digitized currencies, a logical step would be currency unification.This is obviously a big step, which would require an overhaul of local financial systems as well as laws. But, as other zones that have gone through this can attest, the boost to local economies is considerable.And the Caribbean needs the help. A lack of access to foreign exchange hits trade, which accounts for most of the region’s economic activity. In Barbados and Jamaica, for example, imports and exports are over 80% and 77% of the country’s GDP respectively (compared to less than 30% for the US).In other words, the incentive to implement a radical change is strong, and the economic risk of not doing so is a question of survival.The transition would be smoothed by the existence of an operating blockchain-based payment rail. Governments and users can see that it works (albeit on a relatively small scale), so the trust issues will be less difficult to overcome. And the shock to local economies will be mitigated by the long-standing exchange rate peg in most jurisdictions.While the Caribbean economies are still largely cash-based, which could make it more difficult to change currencies, the success in other areas of demonetization initiatives and of getting entire populations to switch denominations shows that it can be done.Furthermore, the emergence of a type of account that is easy to open and transact with, complies with anti-money laundering regulations and holds digital tokens that can be used as ‘real’ money would spread financial inclusion throughout the area.Currently, only half of the population of Latin America and the Caribbean has a bank account.If this comes to pass, we would have yet another example of an underdeveloped region leapfrogging more developed ones in terms of financial innovation and efficiency.And a relatively small group of sunny islands could end up showing the rest of the world the benefits that blockchain-based central bank currencies could bring.Barbados image via Shutterstock"

In an ...","Mar 19, 2017 at 12:00 UTC","If a public blockchain is to be successful — whether its use is for currencies, smart contracts or something else entirely — it needs a consensus algorithm that can scale.","While the race is on to develop a system that can do just that, a recent design by an eminent scholar could mark an advancement in this long-held quest. That design is called algorand, and its creator is MIT professor Silvio Micali.A cryptographer and computer theorist, Micali is known for his work in pseudo-random numbers and zero-knowledge proofs (the basis for the zk-SNARKS that power the anonymous blockchain project zcash). He is also the co-winner of the Turing Award (aka the “Nobel Prize” of computing).But while Micali has impressive credentials, his technology also holds big promise. Algorand is a variation of proof-of-stake that uses cryptography to randomly select the players involved in adding the next block (or set of transactions) to the blockchain.If algorand is successful, Micali believes his system could easily handle millions of nodes – presenting a solution to one of biggest problems in blockchain today.In bitcoin, miners race to solve a cryptographic puzzle. The winner proposes the next block and earns a block reward.But bitcoin’s proof-of-work results in the expenditure of an exorbitant amount of energy. Some say that it’s also led to a centralization of bitcoin’s processing, meaning only a few, large entities are able to claim new bitcoins.In an attempt to democratize this distribution, algorand uses what Micali calls “cryptographic sortition” to select players to create and verify blocks.While most proof-of-stake systems rely on some type of randomness, algorand is different in that you self-select by running the lottery on your own computer. The lottery is based on information in the previous block, while the selection is automatic (involving no message exchange) and completely random.Micali borrowed the idea from the ancient Athens, where political officials were chosen at random in a process known as “sortition“. (It was essentially a way of putting everyone’s name into a big hat and pulling out a few names.)By employing cryptographic sortition, the theory is that algorand can scale on demand. Other benefits include security and speed. “The system has to be fast,” Micali said. “I don’t want any proof-of-work, and I don’t want an excessive communication.”Because algorand’s computational requirements are trivial, anyone can run the system on their laptop in the background. And while bitcoin has classes of users (‘consumers’ who transact and ‘miners’ who search for blocks), algorand makes no such distinction.The vision is that all users would have the same access to the network.Similar to other proof-of-stake systems, your chance of being selected for a reward is based on the number of coins (algos) you own or otherwise set aside. The more algos you have, the better chance you have of getting picked.Once you know you are selected as a proposer, you create a block and then propagate it to the network along with a hash proof (a random number easily verified by a digital signature), saying essentially, “Here is my block, and here is proof that I won the lottery.”The proposer with the smallest hash proof (again, random) is the one to present the next candidate block.The next step in the algorand process is to verify that candidate block and — in the event a block proposer has proposed two or more blocks — insure there is no fork in the chain.And for that, Micali turns to a decades-old protocol.One byproduct of Nakamoto consensus is the possibility of network forks, a process that occurs anytime two miners solve the network puzzle at nearly the same time.As a result, users generally wait 30 minutes (three blocks down the road) to be reasonably sure a transaction has gone through.“And now you have to deal with a fork, and that creates some anxiety, psychologically and otherwise, because a block is not final, and people need the finality,” said Micali.The way algorand deals with that ambiguity is to reach consensus on one block with a negligible probability of forks. The system does this by employing a modified version of the Byzantine consensus algorithm.Conceived in the 1980s, Byzantine agreement offers a way to reach consensus in a distributed system where none of the nodes can be trusted. In such a design, the system can tolerate up to one-third of the players working against the system.Byzantine agreement has two properties: If all the players start with the same value, they agree on that value. And, if the players start with different values, all honest players (those who comply with the protocol) will agree on one value. On the blockchain, those values are the candidate blocks and the players are verifiers.A problem with traditional Byzantine agreement, however, is that it requires many rounds of intense communication between all players, making it difficult to scale the system.“I cannot run Byzantine agreement with 1 million users or 10 million users or, if a successful system, 100 millions users. It is too much,” Micali said.To remedy that, he developed a modified version with only nine expected steps.In algorand, a small subset of players run Byzantine consensus on behalf of the entire system. That allows the protocol to be run at higher speeds, and as more players are replaced in each step, the idea is it makes the system secure in an adversarial environment.Put simply, Micali’s Byzantine agreement works like this: Coin holders self-select to be verifiers in the first round. Those verifiers send out their messages along with their credentials to the network.Now that they have revealed themselves, a resourceful adversary could easily corrupt them. But that doesn’t matter, because once the message is out of the bottle, there is no way to put it back.“The adversary can no more do this than the government can put back in the bottle a message of Wikileaks. They can arrest him, put him in prison, but that message is now propagated on the network,” said Micali.And so, even if an adversary does succeed in corrupting the verifiers, it is too late. A new set of players has already self-selected for the next round of communication, and the process continues for eight more rounds until a common agreement is reached.Once agreement is reached, and the block is certified by the signatures of a sufficient number of players in the last step of byzantine agreement, that block is then gossiped through the network so all users in the system can add it to the blockchain.Since the only real latency in the system is based on propagating that block through the network, Micali has set his block size at 1MB. When networks get faster, it is possible to increase the block size without any security risks, he contends.That said, Micali doesn’t think algorand will replace bitcoin. He feels different systems can exist concurrently.Even bartering still exists today, so there is no reason to think bitcoin won’t exist in the future, he argues. But he does feel strongly that its energy waste is unnecessary.“Somehow people make the analogy that when you are digging for gold you also waste energy. The fact that gold was mined that way with a lot of waste doesn’t mean we should destroy the planet because our ancestors did,” he said.He also makes the point that algorand is intended to serve as a consensus protocol for all types of blockchain systems, not just cryptocurrencies.Much like its name, though, algorand exists as a theoretical protocol.For now, Micali said he is hammering out technical issues in the hopes that, one day soon, they can be put to the test.Image via Amy Castor for CoinDesk"

The experience of booking tickets and organizing the visit is often a lot more stressful than it needs to be, and anything that minimizes this process is likely to be well received.Meanwhile, the digital world is undergoing a change in the way it stores information and makes financial transactions. A technology known broadly as ‘blockchain‘ is gaining more and more attention amongst development circles, and it promises a new way of interacting with data altogether free of server costs or security issues.You’ve probably heard of the first major application of the blockchain known as bitcoin – an entirely digital currency given value by those who use it.But for all the hype you’ve heard about bitcoin, this is only the very pointy tip of a continent-sized iceberg. The next iteration of cryptocurrency is called ethereum, and its applications to the theme park world are far ranging.Ticketing is probably the most obvious application of the blockchain to the operations of theme parks. There are already a range of interesting ethereum-based ‘dapps‘ that promise ticketing services for music festivals and concerts at a fraction of the price.Because the blockchain only ever allows one copy of a digital property (such as a ticket to a theme park), users can have a password-protected wallet on their phone that contains the digital tickets signed by the park which are scanned at the gate, at which time the payment transfer is finalized between the guest’s wallet and the theme park’s.No ID, no paper tickets, just a secure decentralized system approved by consensus.What’s more, these digital tickets don’t have to be bought all at once or even by the same person. A guest who knows they want to go to the park a year out can make a promise to buy a ticket, which they can then pay off at their will over the remaining time they have. The blockchain can easily store the payment history of the guest without any specific human approval or oversight.Now that your tickets are digital assets that you don’t need to keep an eye on, you can pretty much allow people to do whatever they want with them.Ethereum has the ability to run ‘smart contracts’ (executable code with instructions to carry out actions based on specific triggers), so any time someone sells on your park’s tickets at a profit you can get a cut. Say you take 50% of any resales as part of the contract when you sell the ticket. On popular days that ticket might go through any number of hands, and you are making money each time without any effort, while also allowing others to make money from their good predictions.Similar to theme park ticketing, fastpass tickets for ride queues like this one at Universal, or the equivalent at Walt Disney World can be entirely controlled through smart contracts, giving them much more flexibility than the current systems.The current system has a whole range of books and forums dedicated to how to game it, with people spending hours trying to get the best ride times and cover the rest of their favorite rides through careful planning. It surely doesn’t need to be so stressful.What if everything switched over to a bidding system with every guest given equal opportunity to start with?You could provide guests with some tokens to spend on fastpasses when they buy a ticket, then use a demand-based system for the token cost of each ride in the park. The hardcore fans can spend all their tokens on the newest ride at the most popular times, while the kids can spend theirs on riding the Jungle Cruise for the five-millionth time.Now that you’ve established a within-park market for ride times, there’s nothing stopping you from selling additional tokens to guests buying premium packages, or to their relatives wishing them a good holiday.The cool thing about this is that you get a lot more information about which rides people really wanted to go on, because you can track the ‘price’ and watch them trading with each other. This would let you start improving your recommendations to them, giving them indications of rides they might like and good times to ride them that suit their intended schedule.You can probably see where all this is heading: a theme park currency that can be used at any of the park owner’s subsidiary and affiliate businesses.A majority of people that visit premium parks now download the app before they go so they can organize their day and use the map. It’s not a great step for that app to become a digital wallet that visitors can use in your parks, stores and even online platforms. What makes this a digital currency rather than the old-school version of ‘park dollars’ is that these could be exchanged back into local currency anywhere someone wants to set up an exchange.On its own, the prospect of having a future corporate currency that could be more stable than many local governments is interesting, but the immediate benefits are still compelling. Once you transfer your ticketing, fastpasses, merchandising and digital distribution payments through one channel that doesn’t require a bank, your accounting suddenly becomes a lot simpler.The concept is especially exciting for larger brands who may not have a park, but do have a store in a particular country.The park currency can be used in all these stores without having to make special banking or business arrangements, allowing for much faster expansion into new markets. With incredibly low transfer costs between countries, theme parks that embrace blockchain would be able to capitalize on the post-visit experience much more effectively.One of the most popular early uses of the ethereum cryptocurrency was as a voting system. Rather than a ‘one person one vote’ approach, The DAO (the earliest manifestation of an ethereum organisation) used a share-based system where those with more coins had more vote.While this may not be exactly what you want for your theme park, having a good knowledge of what the highest spenders in your park are looking for is a useful thing.On top of that, you might also see a groundswell of grassroots support from lower-spending guests  (like Universal saw with the opening of Harry Potter worlds in Florida), which would give you an indication that you need to build a ride with high throughput that doesn’t need a lot of stores nearby.Whatever the outcome, an audience survey with the answers weighted by how much they have invested in your company is a lot more useful than standing around on corners asking people how they feel about things.Once you have your audience used to using your park’s currency, and it’s gained some value, there’s more and more benefit to offering what are essentially cash rewards for advertising and information about your park.This could be as basic as forwarding coins to a wallet linked to a Twitter account that posts lost of highly retweeted content, or as sophisticated as real-time rewards for advice about park waiting times, incident reports and events. There are already dozens of forums online vying to be the expert of one park or another, why not bring it all into your own app ecology and reward your guests for their effort?You could create ‘flashmobs‘ in the park with your most loyal fans by incentivizing them with tokens, as could any guest with enough tokens and approval from the park’s digital protocols. There is no end to the ways people could build secondary and tertiary businesses around your brand, and with the right protocols you wouldn’t need to spend a cent on protecting it.There’s a massive range of ways which theme parks can use blockchain technology, and it’s exciting to imagine what the future might hold.What other ways could theme parks use blockchain technology? Or should they be looking at this at all?

I ...","Apr 15, 2017 at 09:08 UTC","At the start of April, Matchpool, a new dating app that pays out cryptocurrency rewards to successful matchmakers, held a highly successful ICO.","In less than 48 hours, the company reached its target of 125,000 ether ($5.8m) and, after posting a celebratory thank you to their supporters, the team started to consider their next moves.However, on April 5th, two days after the ICO concluded, warning bells were sounded.A post on /r/Ethtrader and a tweet from cryptocurrency writer and former Coinbase staffer Nick Tomaino spelled out the concerns: the text of a post in the Matchpool Slack channel from co-founder Philip Saunders announcing his departure from the project and casting suspicion on the withdrawal of 37,500 ether ($1.7m) from the Matchpool ICO wallet by CEO Yonatan Ben Shimon.Saunders wrote:“Yonatan keeps claiming he’s working with Bitcoin Suisse and it’s all okay, but so far I haven’t seen any evidence of this. I suggest you all demand an explanation and keep a close watch. In all likelihood your guppies [Matchpool’s currency token] are worthless.”Redditors and Twitter users were quick to pick up on the thread, and the term ‘exit scam’ was thrown around, not just on forums but on cryptocurrency news sites.Had the funds really disappeared? Was Ben Shimon more conman than CEO?The short answer: no.Though it might come as a surprise to readers who heard of the story through social media, Matchpool had already announced plans to convert a proportion of the funds from ether into bitcoin prior to the supposed ‘scandal’ via the firm’s Medium blog.The rationale behind the conversion is that with ethereum’s relative volatility – prices have fluctuated between $30 and $50 in the last month alone – could be mitigated with a conversion into the more stable bitcoin.In a call with CoinDesk, the Matchpool team accepted that a greater effort could have been made to publicise the post at the time.We also asked Ben Shimon to clarify the authorisation process for the movement of the funds – a contentious point since they were meant to be stored in a multisignature wallet as a guard against any single actor making the decision alone.In fact, Ben Shimon held two signing keys to the wallet, requiring an additional signature from one of three other people in order to make the transfer. In this case, the third signature came from Stas Oskin, core developer of the Wings ethereum DAO platform.Oskin confirmed that he had authorised the signature in an email to CoinDesk, adding:“[Hedging] seemed completely reasonable, in fact we advise a similar strategy to any project planning to launch on Wings.”Even if claims of financial mismanagement are unfounded, the dramatic exit of a co-founder is never something that reflects well on a company.CoinDesk reached out to Philip Saunders for this article, but had not received a response by time of publication, meaning his perspective is absent from the narrative. Still, according to Matchpool’s remaining team, he had not delivered on work that was expected from him ahead of the ICO.In a blog post written after Saunders’ exit, Ben Shimon accuses his co-founder of providing smart contract code that was rejected in an audit as having too many errors, and needed to be rewritten from scratch by Parity in order to be usable.Parity did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment on the story, but until and unless more information comes to light, the onus is on Saunders to prove any further allegations of mismanagement on the part of the Matchpool team.While any kind of scandal is damaging to a new company, and reputations can be difficult to repair once damaged, Matchpool now has the resources to move on into the build and prototyping phase. This process will be spearheaded by incoming CTO Or Demri, previously a software developer for the Israeli Air Force and a former consultant to various companies in the cryptocurrency space.In his first public communication for the company, Demri laid out the development plan for an alpha launch of the product in Q3 of 2017 – an event that many investors will have their eyes on as a key indicator of the company’s ability to deliver on its promises.“My mission is to give the community and all the contributors the best product, and deliver what Yonaton has promised – that’s my target,” Demri said.CoinDesk also contacted Joe Shapira, founder of popular Jewish dating site JDate.com and a member of Matchpool’s advisory board, who confirmed his active involvement and continued support for the project, adding:“I think that Matchpool will be a very beneficial venture for its founders and the investors in its currency.”It’s been a bumpy ride from the heights of the ICO to the allegations of a scam, but now the message from Matchpool is: we’re here to stay.Lovers in pool image via Shutterstock"

After months of testing, the initiative will now focus on integrating the tech into bank processes.While this may seem like an obvious non-financial application for blockchain (given the paper-intensive, slow and complex process of most property transactions), its rollout won’t be easy, especially in geographical areas where it is most needed.Why? It comes down to trust.For a government to migrate something as fundamental as property rights to a new platform based on an unfamiliar technology, it will need to count on the support of the people and institutions it is designed to benefit.Without a high level of confidence in the government’s motives and competence, the project will encounter resistance, especially given the value involved, the risk if it goes wrong and the comfortable familiarity with the existing (albeit clunky) system.Coincidentally, this week also saw the publication of the OECD’s trust barometer, which tracks the evolution of the degree to which citizens trust their government.As expected, trust is declining in most countries.Sweden, however, held steady at a relatively high level (56%), news that bodes well for public acceptance of the new platform, and should help the country set a good example for others to follow.The Republic of Georgia is in a similar situation.Earlier this year, it revealed that it was increasing the scope of a trial aimed at registering land titles and recording transactions on a blockchain platform.The country does not make it onto the OECD barometer, but the World Bank indicates it is a relatively trusted place to do business.Yet even in countries with ‘reliable’ governments, implementation will not be easy, especially when it requires the buy-in of a wide spectrum of private institutions.One of the banks participating in the next phase of Sweden’s land registry trial has already said that they have no plans to implement the platform – it is participating just to learn more about the tech. However, with time, testing and communication, organizations in Sweden and Georgia should be able to gradually roll out blockchain land registries.The positive impact on the economy could inspire other implementations, at home and elsewhere.Yet most other countries have higher barriers, according to the OECD trust barometer. A lack of confidence in official institutions will weaken the acceptance of any change they propose.Unfortunately, it is precisely those countries that could most benefit from a more transparent and tamper-proof land registry system.The irony does not stop there. An even greater and often overlooked paradox is this: you need to start with a high level of trust before you can implement a system that makes it unnecessary.Click Here to Never Miss a Weekly Email AgainFingers crossed image via Shutterstock"

Muscat, the paper said, is planning to release the strategy for public comment in the near future.He did, however, suggest that Malta might look to apply the tech to its land registry process – a concept other governments have begun embracing. Muscat also indicated that Malta’s health industry may also utilize blockchain.The prime minister went on to say:“This is not just about bitcoin, and I also look forward to seeing blockchain technology implemented in the Lands Registry and the national health registries. Malta can be a global trail-blazer in this regard.”A strong endorsement from Malta wouldn’t be that surprising, given past comments from Muscat himself. In late February, when addressing a conference in Brussels, Muscat called on EU leaders to embrace cryptocurrencies and support accommodative regulatory approaches to the tech.According to Malta Today, Muscat returned to that point during his speech, saying that the EU shouldn’t shy away from taking an early – and positive – stance on cryptocurrencies.“We must be on the frontline in embracing this crucial innovation, and we cannot just wait for others to take action and copy them,” said Muscat. “We must be the ones that others copy.”Image via Wikimedia"

In the first quarter of 2017, for example, ICOs raised to just under a third of entities seeking VC funding.In the months since, however, this trend has reversed with ICO investment totals growing over 800% and soaring past venture capital funding.The second quarter has seen less than 10 venture capital deals thus far.More than 80% of that funding was contributed by two deals: bitcoin mining chip maker Canaan ($43.6m) and distributed ledger consortium R3 ($107m).By comparison, more than 20 ICOs have closed thus far in the second quarter, with over 10 exceeding $10m (and numerous selling out in just seconds or with massive valuations.)ICO investment into early-stage blockchain projects has now totaled more than venture capital, the primary funding source for the industry in every year prior.Making sense of the data and its impact, though, might be more challenging.While they’re often compared, it may not be the case that sales of blockchain-based tokens – which in a sense monetize a startups network effort (and distribute ownership and influence to the widest audience possible) – will replace traditional venture capital, designed to enable investors to buy a share of a company’s equity (with no real downside to a limited group of holders).Already emerging are a number of startups (Brave, Civic, Kik) that have both traditional VC investment and have issued a form of token, though its not clear that this hybrid model will prove ultimately impactful.Whether it be by token sales and projects supported largely by the retail public from the start, institutional investors who begin to dominate ICO rounds or some hybrid structure, the space is wide open for innovation and evolution.Further, the proliferation of new decentralization application platforms and independent blockchains has added additional difficulty to surveying the universe of tokens, as investors must not only analyze the application or system (like augur or golem), but also the base protocol or infrastructure layer (like ethereum, waves or lisk) in numerous cases.Still, with proven demand and interest from both entrepreneurial and investor audiences and limited regulatory guidance, ICOs could continue to gain steam as a fundraising mechanism.How the structures, valuations and legalities evolve is a much larger question, but undoubtedly the continued and growing wave of token sales will focus the spotlight on each of these questions and more.View CoinDesk Research for the full Q1 2017 State of Blockchain and ICO Spotlight Study.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of DCG, which has an ownership stake in Civic and Brave.Horse race image via Shutterstock"

Among other projects, Krishna described a partnership with Maersk, a Danish transport company, which he says will cut costs by streamlining the checks that shipping companies are required to go through as they transport goods across international borders.A typical shipment, according to Krishna, must pass the scrutiny of about 30 organizations during its circuitous journey to the market. Every hold up in this process nicks dollars off the profitability of the product.“A single piece of paper, if it’s missing when it arrives in Rotterdam, means that a container full of avocados just sits there. A few days extra of sitting there and you’ve got to throw out the whole container because you’ve crossed the limit of how long those goods can sit there without being considered spoiled,” said Krishna.Blockchains, he went on to say, are an ideal platform for aggregating and transmitting the certifications required at each step along the way and could shave twenty percent of the cost from international shipping.“We believe that just doing this kind of digitization can result in tens of billions of dollars saved across that network,” he said.Arvind also touted blockchains as a solution for verifying that diamonds originate from conflict-free zones and mentioned that Walmart is looking into the technology as a way to track and verify organic products. He further argued for the potential to cut coordination costs in capital markets by using blockchains as a common ledger for finalizing settlements in derivatives markets.The struggle, according to Krishna, will be to craft blockchain applications in a way that is intuitive to people outside the enthusiast bubble. Increasing usability will be key, he argued.“Making it scalable, making it easy, making it possible for a lot more people to adopt the technology is where a lot of technologies and companies flounder,” says Krishna.Image by Morgen Peck for CoinDesk"

Bitcoin has seen some progress in that respect, but with other projects like ethereum now emerging, an entirely new ecosystem of use cases is springing up.Much of the conversation during the CoinDesk’s Consensus 2017 legal workshop centered on this confusing state of affairs.Harvard Berkman Center fellow and special counsel at Cooley LLP Patrick Murck argued that, while this regulatory uncertainty might cause problems for businesses, it’s actually better that regulators are so far taking a hands-off approach to blockchain companies and letting the ecosystem develop it’s own system for weeding out bad actors.In the meantime, though, he had some advice:“As long as you’re not stupid or have ill-intent, most of the time you’re going to be fine. It’s amazing how common-sensical this could be. Don’t be stupid. Don’t have ill-intent.”Another trend discussed during the panel, one that very much related to this uncertainty, was the growing spread of initial coin offerings (ICOs).The potential for ICOs (or token sales) was one of the more prominent themes at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2017 conference at large, and it popped up again and again during the day’s three-hour legal session.Advocates argued that the concept is fueling a new, more democratic way of funding businesses inspired by cryptocurrency, but it could also have its downsides amid the recent hype cycle.“What we have now is the term ‘ICOs’. I don’t know who started that, but they should be reprimanded for it,” Perkins Coie partner Dax Hansen joked, adding that ‘token sale’ is a term with better regulatory implications. Though, as for the concept itself, he said that many entrepreneurs are using the funding model in legitimate and promising ways.And, it’s indeed an exploding market right now. Davis Polk associate Reuben Grinberg claimed that over half of venture spending in the space now comes from ICOs, rather than older, arguably less democratic, methods of raising money.A panelist from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) noted that this form of funding is exploding, doubling just in the last few weeks.“I think you’re right that it’s starting to reach a level where regulators will take a look at it. Where that goes, I don’t know,” he added.But even if regulators have held back so far, other legal experts think that more regulatory action could be around the corner. Grinberg, for one, argued that catastrophe might ultimately be what piques the action of regulators.He said:“When everyone’s making money, then everyone’s happy, but when everyone’s losing money and their houses – which has happened in the past – then you’re going to start to see regulatory actions.”Correction: The article has been revised to clarify Hansen’s comments.Image via Alyssa Hertig for CoinDesk"

And while ethereum supporters have long argued that the global computing platform would help to form a new kind of internet, a wave of innovators are now trying to deliver on that ideal.The problem is that there might be downsides to this increase in price and increase in attention. Namely, as the price increases, ethereum apps grow more expensive to use.That’s because on ethereum, users need to pay directly for the computational power they use, whether to place a bid on a prediction market or use new kinds of decentralized Twitters and Ubers. For now, this is a different picture than, say, Facebook, the popularity of which rests in part on its ‘free’ platform.Matus Lestan, co-founder of the ethereum app Ethlance, for example, recently posted a screenshot of a user looking to create a user profile on the platform – an action that cost 0.08 ETH, or $7. It would have cost “little more than $1” when ether was at $10, he wrote.Given this increase, Luis Cuende, project lead at decentralized startup Aragon, told CoinDesk:“[I]t’s very understandable that some users may be pissed off.”Still, many ethereum apps, including Aragon, are in the test stage right now. So, it’s unclear how many apps and users are actually impacted by this increase.It might be more of a harbinger of future friction. Augur co-founder Joey Krug, for instance, said that users of his ethereum-based platform aren’t being impacted.“Since Augur is currently still in beta on testnet [the higher prices haven’t] affected us directly yet,” he said. “However, once it’s live, it will indeed.”Adding to the complexity, though, is that the prices are more dynamic than simply being affected by the cryptocurrency’s increase in value.The details are a bit thorny. First off, it’s worth noting that ‘gas’, ‘gas price’ and ‘gas cost’ all mean different things. (Even ethereum’s inventor has mixed up the terms.)‘Gas’ describes units of computational power in ethereum, while ‘gas cost’ is used to denote how much gas is required to perform an action on the platform. A simple transaction costs 500 gas, while storing data using ethereum costs 100 gas.These numbers are hardcoded into the software. Finally, the ‘gas price’ is how much each unit of gas costs in ether.The total cost of an action on ethereum is the gas cost multiplied by the gas price. If the gas price stays the same while the value of ether increases, as has been the case so far, then the overall price of smart contracts increases.In ethereum, miners set these gas prices. “Miners are the ones calling the shots,” Jason Teutsch, founder of scalability project TrueBit Foundation, told CoinDesk.Some expect that miners will lower the gas prices. Their incentive to do so, one argument goes, is that if they don’t, less people will use the network and pay transaction fees. So far, though, this hasn’t happened.The gas price sometimes fluctuates, according to a chart from ethereum data site Etherscan, but has stayed at roughly the 22 to 23 Gwei range (0.000000000000000022 ETH or less than 1 cent) for the past year.“It’s a bit of mystery to me why this quantity remains so stable. Perhaps it’s an artifact of mining pool policies, but it might also reflect some average fixed cost perceived by miners,” Teutsch said.So, the situation could be mitigated if miners pushed down fees. Indeed, some users are currently campaigning mining pools to push down the gas prices.Adding to the confusion, as Krug pointed out, is that users can post transactions with a fee that’s less than this hardcoded price. Transactions might not go through as quickly, but he pointed out that, even at about one-twentieth of the current price, “it’s really not much slower”. The problem is that most users are simply going along with the hardcoded price.Given this, there might be less reason to worry about an increase in prices just yet. Because blocks aren’t full, in fact many of them are empty, users aren’t fighting to get their transactions into a block with increased fees (as with bitcoin).“Gas prices aren’t going down, but blocks aren’t being filled either, it’s a lose-lose all around,” Krug said.“A large amount of this is due to developer failure to act,” he said, arguing that developers should introduce a more dynamic gas price that is dependent, in part, on how full blocks are.Longer term, there are other limitations to public blockchain technologies as they stand today. For example, there’s a limit on the amount of computational power per block on ethereum. This limit is roughly equivalent to bitcoin’s block size, although ethereum miners, again, can increase or decrease it.Wouldn’t it be simple to just reduce the gas prices while also increasing the amount of gas that fits into a block? Well, there are trade-offs: increasing the gas limit increases the burden of running an ethereum full node.Dealing with these trade-offs is a problem bitcoin has also faced. And is, in a sense, a big element of its block size debate is centered on the community arguing about growing transaction fees.In other words, a lower gas limit is required for ethereum to remain decentralized. But that could lead to higher smart contract prices in the long term, as more people use the platform.In that way, you could think of these price increases as a symptom of blockchain tech’s larger scalability problems, of which there are a range of projects that might help.One such project is TrueBit, which pushes ethereum smart contract computation verification, such as more advanced computations like machine learning, to a new layer above the blockchain.“TrueBit is immune to some of these problems,” Teutsch said, arguing that the platform can help with transaction throughput, as well as facilitate more advanced ethereum computations.What does that mean in this situation? The idea is that then you don’t have to settle as many computations directly on the blockchain. You’ll still have to pay fees to the computers in the TrueBit market, but the idea is that you will rarely have to pay the more expensive fees required to settle a transaction on-chain.Gilles Fedak, co-founder of distributed cloud computing app IEx.ec, noted that although their applications are already primarily off-chain, the team behind the computing platform is looking to another off-chain network, Raiden, to help with some of their problems.In another direction, Cuende said that Aragon’s business model might be an inspiration for other decentralized apps. The startup plans to pay transaction fees on the platform, shielding users from the increasing prices.Still, all of these projects are works in progress. And until they come to fruition, or miners adopt new fee structures, ethereum smart contract fees could climb. Which is a little ironic, considering Buterin once suggested that bitcoin’s transaction fees are too high.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Etherscan.Sword image via Shutterstock"

Digital currency businesses whose practices meet these definitions will now need to secure a TOMA license.Other activities such as miners receiving digital currency for verifying transactions, exchanging only between digital currencies and exchanging digital currency for money between two parties are excluded from this category.Perhaps most notably, however, the IDFPR went on to state that industry startups can use cryptocurrencies as permissible investments, arguing that capital requirements in traditional currencies imposed “added burdens” on smaller operations.The report reads:“The [IDFPR] understands dollar-denominated capital reserve requirements impose added burdens on digital currency companies and therefore will consider digital currency reserves as a form of permissible investment.”Elsewhere, the IDFPR said it will allow applicants to consider digital currency they own or hold as part of their net worth, though such a recognition does not include any digital currency held on behalf of others.Sears Tower image via Shutterstock"

His current blockchain project, Loki, is in stealth mode.","In this opinion piece, Metnick recalls his journey to uncover applications for blockchains in Major League Baseball, ultimately presenting a hard-fought rubric outlining the intersection between two of his passions.“The future ain’t what it used to be.” – Yogi BerraWords that start with the letter ‘b’ hold power in our industry.There’s ‘bitcoin’, the foundation-stone, then there are the ‘banks’. Even ethereum can’t escape the clutches of definitional terms like ‘blocks’ and ‘build’. And there’s that other academic casus belli – the Byzantine General’s Problem that started it all.Which brings me lastly to an unrelated term. I’m talking, of course, about our national pastime: baseball.First, I love bitcoin and I love baseball, and it’s with no small mental effort that these two topics have been fused together finally in this piece.I have nobody to blame. I brought this upon myself.Six months have passed since I lucked into a basic exploration of this topic on the spot, at a snap presentation in Chicago. But resuscitating the memory of those fading words into a cogent story left me directionless.I forcibly alliterated my way out of this mental barricade, one ‘b’ at a time – could our National Pastime be one of America’s lesser studied beneficiaries of blockchain technology?Writer’s block drifted all around me, and settled in with the definiteness of Bay-area fog forcing a rain delay.Sometime mid-August last year, while standing in the checkout aisle at my local grocery store, I received a call from an individual representing both Chicago Cubs owner Tom Ricketts and the CEO of Aon, Greg Case.They were organizing an annual event called the Chicago Cubs Executive Summit, and they wanted a “blockchain guy” – someone qualified and experienced enough in the subject to discuss it with a group of executives at Wrigley Field as a member of a three-person panel.We were allotted 40 minutes to speak and answer questions.Howard Tullman, CEO of Chicago’s 1871 Center for Technology and Entrepreneurship, recommended me as a panelist. The last time I had discussed anything related to blockchain with Howard was about three years ago, when I lugged a Zeus Litecoin Miner into his executive office in a giant suitcase. I recall a rather puzzled (concerned, perhaps?) look that overcame Howard as I started my then introduction to bitcoin.Did he not realize that I was transforming ephemeral electricity into immutable litecoins? Apparently with the branding power of a Greek Thunder God? In my kitchen?Of that meeting, I only have vague recollections of firing up the noisy, demon-spawn hardware from Shenzhen, China. All while manically babbling about ASIC-resistant vs true ASIC-proof consensus algorithms.Many of us who have tried illustrating the value of the blockchain struggle to find a concise definition that can hit its barn door sized potential. If the problem is generally defined as how to improve blockchain descriptions, though, there is at least one approach that has worked for me.Part of the problem is with the question itself – it’s too broad. An analogue might be: What are databases and why should you care? Or even, What is water and why should you care?To TD Ameritrade, databases provide specific, more definable use cases. For a nuclear ballistic missile submarine, or your local fire department or a high capacity desalination plant, water has decidedly different uses.Six months ago, Anthony Di Iorio, CEO and founder at Jaxx and a co-founder of ethereum, tweeted: “Can this def be improved? ‘A Blockchain is a distributed database of ledger entries, digitally signed to ensure authenticity & integrity.'”Alex Lawn, a long-standing voice to the cryptocurrency industry jokingly responded with the inspirational: “Transactions timestamped using blocks.” Alex’s sarcastic retort induced laughs, but it speaks to a genuine headache for those of us spreading the gospel.Di Iorio’s attempt at getting to the best 140-character description of a blockchain has wider applicability than Twitter: “Attention is the new.”Back to Wrigley Field.An hour before showtime, and I was still searching for a succinct, accurate and engaging translation for ‘blockchain’; Ideally, something that wouldn’t be as sleep-inducing as listening to two last-place AA teams battling on a crackling AM radio.I’m still lost in my head, searching for a captivating opening act for a word as alluring sounding ‘blockchain’. It was only improvisational necessity that forced me to answer that question a different way.It helps, I think, to stop defining blockchain horizontally, in terms of generalizations and faux excitability (eg “The Blockchain Will Change Everything!”) and start defining it more practically, more tactically.Intersect the blockchain with a given vertical industry, and then the blockchain explanations start to shed their oblique grandiosity and start becoming meaningful.Speaking of my own experiences:Viewing professional baseball vertically through the blockchain looking glass, the result was that specific examples were easier to delineate.As I was speaking about this technology from inside a ballpark, I thought: ‘What if Major League Baseball ran on a blockchain?’ ‘What problems would it solve? What opportunities would it present?’I went on to describe some of the problems, solutions and feature examples listed below. As it turns out, there is an abundance of uses in baseball for a blockchain. Or, in the words of Dizzy Dean: “It ain’t braggin’ if you can back it up.”Taking a step back, I think it’s helpful to first get general bearings on the larger components of Major League Baseball economics and financials.Much of my source data for this article can be found here.Major League Baseball is a sizable industry. It’s not banking, or treasury bond big, but it’s economically big enough to benefit from a blockchain.According to Mike Ozanian of Forbes, “If MLB traded on a stock exchange it would be worth $36bn.” It is estimated that the betting economy for MLB alone is between $30bn and $50bn, annually – this may develop into a significant demand component of prediction markets such as Augur and Gnosis.Any economic ecosystem of this size will attract financial fraud in various forms. It will also present myriad opportunities to improve existing information systems with new technology – ie increase revenues or decrease costs. A blockchain can perform a select set of features and functions arguably better than predecessor systems.Focusing only on the fraud committed within a subset of baseball merchandise and memorabilia – autographed memorabilia, annual sales exceed $1bn. Experts estimate $100m of that revenue derives from fraudulent, counterfeited goods.To help combat this, Major League Baseball keeps highly granular track of the chain of custody for each and every baseball item, and it employs both current and former law enforcement to oversee the process.It is estimated that over 50% of autographs on collectible memorabilia are fake. This one subset of a subcomponent of the baseball economy was significant enough to merit a large-scale FBI operation.According to Shira Springer of The Boston Globe: “Operation Bullpen … dismantled 18 forgery rings and prevented more than $15m in economic losses due to the seizure of tens of thousands of pieces of forged memorabilia through 75 search warrants and over 100 undercover evidence purchases.”Clearly, tokenizing the provenance of memorabilia on a blockchain would go a long way in eliminating the possibility of faked authenticity.Many of these esteemed ballparks are not immune from credit card theft by the stadium-full, either.As explained by Robert Hackett of Fortune regarding The Madison Square Garden Co hack:“Anyone who purchased food, drink, or other merchandise at the company’s Madison Square Garden properties between 9th November, 2015 and 24th October, 2016 may have had their payment card information filched. According to the disclosure, affected venues may include Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall, Beacon Theater and Chicago Theater.”It’s old news that push payment systems like cryptocurrency present an elegant solution for combating credit card fraud. Unfortunately, mass adoption has been about as tricky to nail as a Phil Niekro knuckleball.The advantages of putting event tickets on the blockchain is an idea almost as old as bitcoin itself. Ticketing fraud has been a loss vector that predates the Cubs first World Series victory in 1907. According to data collected by Riskified, an organization dedicated to countering fraud in the ticketing industry, chargebacks alone currently cost vendors $9bn per year.False positive declines (rejecting legitimate orders) have cost the same merchants an additional $118bn.Baseball influence may be immune from the long hand of Vladimir Putin – but fans are passionate about their favorite players. These pitched emotions manifest as significant MLB voting fraud. When I was a kid, I remember going to baseball games with friends, where we would scoop up as many leftover All Star Game ballots as we could carry. I recall it being one of those things that we thought “everybody did” – and we grew out of that pretty quickly. But, All Star Game ballot stuffing is a serious problem.It is estimated that between 10–20% of MLB All Star Game votes are fraudulent. In 2015, MLB Advanced Media caught and cancelled 65 million fraudulent All Star Game votes, out a total of about 400 million votes! This is yet another idea that goes back close to the bitcoin’s beginnings as well.Ideas for new features abound, and are only limited by the breadth of imagination and depth of blockchain knowledge.The time, location and the veracity of unique memorabilia can be registered in an immutable, readable and open public blockchain. Baseball cards as unique assets can be completely re-envisioned for our digital future, similarly to how unique Rare Pepe cards are conjured and brought to market using top-level blockchain protocols.Smart contracts within an MLB blockchain framework can be used to enforce standardized player payments, where terms under salaries or bonuses may be tired to irrefutable blockchain truth oracles.Individual teams can create their own branded currencies and promotional tokens, valid horizontally for team merchandise across heterogeneous retailers, or vertically for use only within a given stadium.In filtering the base question, “Can a blockchain add utility to Major League Baseball, and is it the best technology to do so?,” it helped me to create a basic table of some of the higher level functions at which blockchains truly excel.Though it’s early innings in the blockchain space, the sooner Major League Baseball starts adopting this now eight-year old technology, the sooner it will start winning against various problems that have plagued professional baseball since its inception.In the words of Yogi Berra: “It’s getting late early.”Images via Ryan Chiu and Josh Metnick"

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","May 22, 2017 at 13:18 UTC",The largest bank in the world has partnered with the makers of zcash to provide a new layer of privacy to the users of its enterprise-grade blockchain.,"Revealed onstage today at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2017, JPMorgan and the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company are now in the process of integrating ZSL, a zero-knowledge security layer designed to securely – and anonymously – settle transactions on the blockchain that were previously conducted elsewhere.While the zero-knowledge security layer is crucial to the anonymous transactions enabled in the zcash cryptocurrency, the technology itself was designed to let a wide range of networks securely settle the movements of digital assets.But JPMorgan’s implementation of ZSL marks the first time the technology is being formally adopted by a distributed ledger platform as part of its ethereum-based Quorum project.Zcash CEO Zooko Wilcox said that the tech integration could lead to major growth in the kinds of assets that can be utilized, with JPMorgan’s open-source blockchain as a basis.Wilcox said:“It’s the same thing that we’ve deployed in the zcash cryptocurrency. We’re fitting that on top of Quorum, and it’s providing the same kind of security for Quorum that it provides for zcash.”Though Quorum already lets enterprises execute privacy-oriented smart contracts, the new zero-knowledge security feature is designed to extend the actual settlement of those transactions onto the blockchain itself.Similarly to how SSL was invented to provide a new layer of security on top of the public-facing HTTP in the early days of the internet, ZSL provides a degree of anonymity beneath the more public features of a blockchain.But the heightened anonymity comes with a volume button of sorts – similar to the functionality of the zcash token – letting corporate policy makers give authorized individuals, regulators and investigators varying degrees of access to the underlying data.“The cryptographic and software engineering engine that implements secure transfer of ZEC tokens on the open blockchain is basically the same technology that implements the secure transfer of these digitized assets on an enterprise blockchain,” said Wilcox.Not that long ago, the idea that JPMorgan might integrate technology developed explicitly for a cryptocurrency would have seemed far-fetched.Back in November 2015, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon ruffled some feathers in the blockchain community when he publicly stated that “no government” would tolerate a cryptocurrency that is designed to evade government control. But in the same speech, he expressed interest in distributed ledger technology for its potential applications in the finance space.Since then, the bank, valued at $300bn, has become a leader in the blockchain space, first with Juno, an early experiment with the technology unveiled at a Hyperledger meeting last March.By October, the project had evolved into Quorum, an enterprise-grade blockchain designed specifically to let large financial institutions comply with regulatory requirements, especially on the privacy protection front.This year has been a breakout year for the bank, which has seen Quorum accepted into Microsoft Azure’s blockchain-as-a-service platform. The bank formally departed the R3 distributed ledger consortium to make a go of it as a founding member of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which the Zcash team formally joined earlier today.“By adding the Zero-knowledge Security Layer into Quorum,” said Suresh Shetty, JPMorgan’s lead architect at its Blockchain Center of Excellence in a statement. “We are able to explore how state of the art cryptographic privacy technology will enhance the next generation of financial services applications.”Disclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Zcash Company.Safe lock image via Shutterstock"

According to Karl Floersch, blockchain engineer for ethereum startup ConsenSys and a coder working with Buterin on Casper’s development, the result is that the network is choosing the more conservative of two potential paths forward.Floersch told CoinDesk:“What Vitalik has come up with is a get-it-out-the-door, working version, that works, but might be less theoretically revolutionary than Vlad’s.”Because Buterin’s implementation of Casper can, he thinks, get to production faster, it will be used in the first stage of ethereum’s evolution.If implemented, this would be the first time proof-of-stake would be employed on the live ethereum platform, albeit playing a minor role. It also would a large real-world test of proof-of-stake, enabling the cryptocurrency community to determine whether the proof algorithm is a superior one, as proponents have argued.To advocates, the goal of this potentially revolutionary change to proof-of-stake is to reduce the electricity ethereum requires to reach agreement on the state of transactions and contracts on the network. But, since it has been pushed back several times, detractors see this hybrid as the latest evidence that proof-of-stake won’t ever be fully implemented successfully on ethereum.Others say the hybrid implementation is just about security given that the network now secures millions of dollars in value.Blockchain consultant Ciaran Murray, for example, called this move a “precautionary” measure, while Buterin called it a “stepping stone” that he expects to take place after ethereum shifts to stage three of its development process, a planned phase called Metropolis.Buterin told CoinDesk:“[T]his is going to be our primary focus after Metropolis from a development standpoint, and right now we are very actively in the process of developing a prototype in Python.”To take a step back, the big idea behind proof-of-stake is to ‘virtualize’ the mining process.In proof-of-work, miners compute puzzle answers at dizzying speeds, a process that requires money for equipment and electricity. In proof-of-stake, participants similarly commit money to the system, but not with electricity and equipment. With Casper, virtual miners, known as validators, commit money to the system with the understanding that they will lose their deposits if they don’t follow the rules.Recently, alongside advancements in the algorithm theory, Ethereum Foundation formal verification engineer Yoichi Hirai has been running the Casper scripts through a mathematical bug detector, a process known as ‘formal verification’.According to general notes on his formal verification work, Hirai is using the mathematical tool on smart contracts “so that no surprises happen after deployment”.Since smart contracts can’t be changed after deployment, developers are proceeding with extra caution. The same caution applies to Casper, which is itself enabled by a smart contract.In stage one of Buterin’s plan, proof-of-stake will be used as a ‘checkpoint’ every 100 blocks, and will offer further evidence that blocks store the correct transactions (what the devs call ‘finality’).Floersch is currently coding the ‘fork choice rules’ for pyethereum, the Python ethereum client. These rules outline how validators determine which ethereum chain to build on, he explained. Validators look at the chains in front of them and make their choice partially based on how much ether is committed to each chain.If validators make the wrong decision, they’ll lose money.“You can see how it forms a consensus, or it forms a single chain instead of a bunch of chains,” said Floersch.Casper developers will publish the smart contract on ethereum, creating an official Casper account where anyone can deposit ether if they want to engage in the virtual mining process.Once the pyethereum version is done, the team will pass on the work to be incorporated in the Casper daemon, a package that will eventually be run along with each ethereum client, whether Geth or Parity, for example.Stage two, then, is to deploy this process on a larger scale.Whether proof-of-stake will work or not has already been debated ad nauseum, with sides largely split based on people’s previous cryptocurrency purchases.But dissenters have some reason to worry. If the network doesn’t work as planned, there’s a chance transactions won’t go through as users expect, or that smart contract rules might not add up. This is why ethereum’s engineers are trying to work out the ‘finality’ property.Others are skeptical of the hybrid approach in general.“I’m not exactly sure about the wisdom of a staged transition. You either have faith and confidence in your consensus algorithm or you don’t,” said Charles Hoskinson, CEO for blockchain tech firm IOHK.It should be noted that IOHK is heavily involved in the development of ethereum classic, which is often viewed as a competitor to ethereum.“Adding an untested or insecure component to your network as a wait and see is a terrible idea,” he continued. “Also where is the peer review? What conferences have they submitted a proper white paper to and what feedback have they gotten?”But, to some in this nascent field of ‘cryptoeconomics’, this back and forth is exciting. Floersch mentioned the combination of economics and cryptography that underpins Casper can potentially be applied to other global problems.“Of course [proof-of-stake] a really cool problem and it’s great. But, I think down the line, there will be other applications of cryptoeconomics, which I think is a whole new field of mechanisms to use economics to provide a desired outcome,” he said, concluding:“Casper is one of the first ones that do that.”Alarm clock image via Shutterstock"

sought to sidestep issuing its own token by leveraging the bitcoin 
blockchain.","Apr 24, 2017 at 23:55 UTC",,"The latest in a long line of initial coin offerings, a sale held today for tokens that will power the ethereum prediction market Gnosis is emerging as a novel entry – if not for the reason intended.Ostensibly designed to discourage the kind of speculation that has come to define ICOs, the resulting sale was arguably anything but usual – concluding in less than 15 minutes and with the creators owning the vast majority of the funds (95% worth more than $280m at press time).In short, given the choice between waiting to purchase (thereby lowering the purchasing price of the tokens and decreasing the share of founder funds), investors jumped at the chance to buy the tokens that will power the network (now in beta) – just 5% of the project’s tokens sold for a combined $12m.The result has been that Gnosis is attracting significant commentary, with proponents arguing that it shows the strong demand for blockchain project funding and detractors asserting it’s merely the latest case of speculation run amok.To give you an idea of how much was raised, the total valuation was about double the current value of another blockchain prediction market, Augur. Further, ethereum, the blockchain platform on which the decentralized application is based, raised $18m in its original 2014 crowdsale, the largest-ever at the time. (Augur raised $5m in 2015).The result is that even those who support the project seemed taken aback.Demian Brenner, project lead at Zeppelin, a firm that does technical due diligence on ICO projects, called the results evidence prediction markets are simply a “hot area” of the market.Others viewed it more as the latest litmus test for assessing the uncharted ICO market. Such a view was put forward by Dan Cawrey, co-founder of blockchain derivatives project Pactum, who compared the project to Augur.Cawrey told CoinDesk:“Both are prediction markets. Both projects are approaching that problem differently. At this point, it’s all about the team and how they devise the structure.”But, it has prompted some worries, with some pointing to the high market cap for the project as an example of the recent “irrationality” of token sales. Some have gone so far as to state that investors didn’t know the details of what they were investing in, and that a “redo” might be order to more equitably distribute the funds.As indicated in an investor release, Gnosis intends to lock up at least 99% of the funds for at least one year, with more details on how the funds will be used coming in the release.While there have been many crowdsales in the ethereum space (from Augur to Golem), the formula generally goes something like this. First, the team sets a date for the token sale. Then, in most cases, a portion, say 10% of the total tokens, are set aside for the development team to sell as a means to continue engineering the project.Some token sales, such as SingularTV or Cosmos, have ended in just a matter of minutes or hours, often presumably with big players eating up most of the tokens. (There are signs this may have been the case with Gnosis, according to estimates.) Others have taken months or have been shelved due to inactivity.So far, these projects have also deployed a number of token distribution models. Usually tokens grow more expensive over time, as they did in e-sports platform First Blood’s ICO.Gnosis put together a different structure, though, one on which they worked on with ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and developer Alex Van de Sande.The idea behind the “dutch-style auctioning system” was for the tokens to grow less expensive over time, thereby encouraging investors to buy in later, prolonging the time it would take for users to buy up all the tokens.But, that’s not what happened. Further, Gnosis did not add any cap on the amount of tokens that the team would receive, as is typical for other projects. Rather, the sale was scheduled to end once $12.5m was raised or 9m GNO tokens were sold.Because the incentives of the new system didn’t work quite as intended, some have gone on to suggest that investors are not rational for buying at such a high price. (Even Slock.it founder and CEO Christoph Jentzsch weighed in with this view.)Monero developer Riccardo Spagni, a long-time critic of the ICO practice, argued that the Gnosis token sale architects should have expected the crowdsale to play out the way it did, with investors rushing to buy the tokens before others.“The choice wasn’t really a choice at all,” he told CoinDesk. “It’s a little bit of a completely expected selfish choice.”Still, the quick access to funding has at least one startup founder re-thinking the model. Ryan X Charles, CEO of Yours, a project that aims to use blockchain for content funding, has long sought to sidestep issuing its own token by leveraging the bitcoin blockchain.Yet, Charles said the funding could help to change his mind, calling the result “impressive”.He concluded:“I’m becoming much more bullish on cryptocurrency and tokens in general.”Burning money image via Shutterstock"

One focuses on four possible scenarios for blockchain adoption in Australia, while the other centers around the opportunities and risks for the tech in several application areas, including government registries and agricultural supply chains.Australia’s government has taken a proactive stance toward the tech, issuing a broad-ranging policy statement last spring. Last month, the government made good on its promise to address a much-maligned tax issue around bitcoin and other digital currencies.The government framed the release as a way to provide information to both public and private sector organizations that may be exploring or testing blockchain.Australian treasurer Scott Morrison said of the release:“It will give decision makers in business and government guidance on matters they need to consider in developing a system that uses blockchain technology. The reports demonstrate the benefits of this technology could be profound – delivering productivity, security and efficiency gains.”Data61 also made several recommendations to policymakers and regulators. Key among those: to “implement technologically-neutral regulation and policy”, echoing calls from the industry for that approach.The organization also called for more resources for research and development into blockchain, as well as “indicative guidance on sufficient evidence for regulatory acceptance of blockchain-based system[s]”.The full reports can be found here.Flag image via Shutterstock"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Mar 20, 2017 at 04:02 UTC",Tech giant IBM is set to unveil what it’s calling the first “commercial application” of Hyperledger’s open-source Fabric codebase.,"Previously released in beta and scheduled for official release today, the offering – dubbed “IBM Blockchain” – is formally debuting in front of a group of 20,000 developers at the Interconnect conference. There, its first two major deployments will also be detailed.One of those is a blockchain identity solution built with SecureKey, in which it will power a public-private partnership that saw six Canadian banks invest $27m. In addition, it will be revealed that a Chinese energy company is using the IBM Blockchain to create an exchange for trading carbon credits.In conversation with CoinDesk, Jerry Cuomo, IBM’s vice-president of blockchain technologies, described how the company used Hyperledger’s open-source code to create a series of new features, which are now in use as part of its IBM Blockchain product.Cuomo said:“Hyperledger Fabric is the operating system for IBM Blockchain, and the IBM Blockchain built an environment to develop, govern and operate a production, permissioned blockchain.”Currently available on IBM’s BlueMix cloud computing store, the commercial blockchain application will be available on a graded price scale based on the size of the implementation, with startups being charged less than enterprise builders.The announcement comes after Fabric became the first of several open-source projects to emerge from the Linux Foundation-backed Hyperledger’s “incubation” period into “active” status.Secured using IBM hardware security modules that cost on average about $10,000 per month for four nodes, IBM Blockchain gives users the ability to spin up blockchain networks with tailored governance models for onboarding new customers, supporting about 1,000 transactions per second, according to a statement.Previously revealed clients that we now know are also using IBM Blockchain include the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Everledger, Maersk, Northern Trust and Walmart.At the conference, Toronto-based SecureKey will discuss an identity network built in partnership with Canadian banks BMO, CIBC, Desjardins, RBC, Scotiabank and TD Bank.Using the platform, the banks will be able to share information about onboarding clients with one another – for a fee – while potentially also saving money by paying one another less than they currently pay credit agencies for the same information.The idea, according to Cuomo, is to create a blockchain identity solution that would make it simpler to verify identities while also reducing the amount of data shared.To develop the identity network, a group of regulators, including the Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC), the Command Control and a research center funded by the US Department of Homeland Security, took part in the project.Notably, Cuomo said the group has solved the problem of adhering to the “right to be forgotten” requirements of some governments that don’t want their citizens permanently recorded, while still using the immutable Fabric blockchain.“We do have a patent pending, so I don’t want to go into too much detail,” said Cuomo. “But we solved it without deleting from the blockchain, which is pretty cool.”The second commercial-scale deployment revealed today involves Beijing-based Energy-Blockchain Labs Limited.The firm announced what it described as the “world’s first blockchain-based green assets trading platform,” built with Hyperledger Fabric and deployed using IBM Blockchain.The so-called “cap-and-trade” system allows companies a certain amount of carbon emissions, and lets them exchange those allowances with one another to incentivize the creation of policies and technologies that minimize emissions. But a lack of transparency in the system has resulted in fraud concerns, both in China and elsewhere.Cuomo told CoinDesk the blockchain-based carbon credits exchange is designed to make it easier for companies that generate pollution to trade credits as part of the build-up to China’s transfer to a unified national market later this year.It’s an application that has won the support of the Chinese government as well.The director of China’s National Climate Change Strategy Research and International Cooperation Center, Li Junfeng, said in a statement:“We must work to limit high energy consumption and high emission industries, encourage clean energy development and further promote energy saving and emission reduction. These tasks are not only necessary for China’s own sustainable development, but for the welfare of the entire human family.”IBM logo image via Shutterstock"

highlighting how the value of bitcoin has risen sharply in that time.","Jun 12, 2017 at 12:07 UTC",A growing legal dispute between the customers of a now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange and the business itself has ensnared one of the industry’s largest and best-funded startups.,"Former customers of the exchange alleged in a complaint filed in December that Cryptsy and its CEO, Paul Vernon, laundered millions of dollars-worth of their funds through Coinbase over a several-year period as part of a bid to abscond with their money.At the heart of the argument is that Coinbase, as a regulated money services business in more than 30 states, should have known that the approximately $8.3m in funds – which Vernon allegedly claimed were derived from Cryptsy’s profits, as well as his own activities – came from a questionable source.The backstory: The case represents the last twist in the long-running Cryptsy saga.Once one of the most voluminous exchanges for alternative digital currencies, Cryptsy collapsed in late 2015 after months of escalating service issues. Trading was ultimately suspended in early January of 2016, and just days later, the exchange went offline amid claims of insolvency and concealed theft.A class action lawsuit, filed in Florida, soon followed, with a court-appointed receiver taking control of Cryptsy’s assets in the spring of 2016, setting the stage of a settlement agreement between users and Vernon’s ex-spouse, who was also named in the original suit.Vernon, who has not responded in court to the suit, has denied allegations that he stole millions of dollars worth of funds from users.The current saga: It’s those funds that are at the center of the case between the class-action users and Coinbase.Coinbase, which declined to comment on the lawsuit when reached for comment, sought to negotiate the dispute through arbitration, citing user agreements Vernon signed when he and Cryptsy first began exchanging funds through Coinbase. Further, the startup asked the court to stay the case pending that arbitration, as well as prevent discovery from taking place.Yet, in a court order from 1st June, Judge Kenneth A Marra shot down Coinbase’s motions to compel arbitration and to stay discovery, arguing that Cryptsy users weren’t bound by the agreements signed by Vernon.Attorney David Silver, one of the lawyers representing the users, reiterated those arguments in an interview with CoinDesk.“We believe that Cryptsy users that did not sign the contract with Coinbase were entitled to their day in court and be judged by a jury of their peers,” he said.”[W]e’re quite happy the court agreed with us, and this case is going to move forward in the public light.”He said that Cryptsy’s body of users have been waiting years for some kind of resolution, highlighting how the value of bitcoin has risen sharply in that time.“The users we represent from Cryptsy, they’ve been killed,” said Silver.What comes next: Judge Marra’s decision effectively blocks any effort to resolve the case out of court, setting the stage for discovery and for the suit to advance.A broader class-action suit – in which Crypsty users have sought to reacquire funds lost during the exchange’s collapse – is also moving ahead.According to Silver, the legal team behind the class-action suit is gearing up for its first distribution of funds, gleaned from the settlement with Vernon’s ex-spouse – a process he said should take place over the next several months. In the meantime, he said, the case filed against Cryptsy will continue following Marra’s ruling.“We’re gonna hit the ground running,” said Silver.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase.Justice image via Shutterstock"

Under the proposed system, the beneficiary of a cheque (as well as their bank) would be able to check whether it is valid, relying on a blockchain as a tamper-proof verification layer.That work, Sajwani said, has continued to advance, and Emirates NBD is working with the UAE’s central bank on the initiative.He went on to explain:“We are currently working with the central bank of the UAE to add the blockchain security feature to our paper cheques, so we can prove that the technology is fit for purpose at production volumes. We are very excited at this prospect and we welcome the cooperation of other banks and institutions in developing the use case into not only a new standard for cheques but also to develop best practices that we can apply in other use cases.”In comments, Sajwani also touched on the bank’s participation in a cross-border payments trial with India-based banking institution ICICI.That test, unveiled in October, involved transmitting a transaction between an ICICI branch in Mumbai to an Emirates NBD branch in Dubai, recording on a distributed ledger.When asked about the results, Sajwani said that while informative, the test wasn’t aimed at solving immediate barriers to payments – namely speed.“While cross-border payments seem like a natural fit for application of blockchain technology between banks, they are largely solved with current technologies in terms of speed,” he told CoinDesk. “As an example, our direct remittance service to India, Pakistan, or the Philippines takes a minute today.”At the same time, the bank positioned the test as one with an eye on the horizon, indicating that future developments around the tech could tip the scales to further applications.“Even though today’s blockchains cannot operate with such speed and volume, we know this is only temporary. Blockchains provide tremendous potential in standardizing message flow between transacting parties and simplifying network architecture,” Sajwani said, adding:“Our cross-border remittance tests aim to leverage the technology to open more channels with much less effort.”Pete Rizzo contributed reporting.Image via YouTube"

solution for bitcoin, though not without some measure of debate.","May 17, 2017 at 11:30 UTC","Smart contracts are touted as having the potential to do all kinds amazing things. But, to fulfill their promise, they need a way to communicate with the outside world.","That is not so easily done. Due of the nature of a blockchain (all nodes need to agree on any change in state of the database), smart contracts cannot simply fetch data on their own.So, instead, they rely on ‘oracles’.A key part of the smart contract ecosystem, oracles allow smart contracts to access information, like commodity, currency, derivative pricing and more, from websites, and then use that data to implement the terms of a smart contract.But oracles come with their own set of challenges.For example, an oracle needs to be able to provide a tamper-proof source of information. So, if your smart contract offers insurance against flight cancellations, you want to make sure that the data you are getting on flights is accurate, and has not been altered at any point after being scraped from the website.Confidential queries are another issue. Say, a smart contract needs information on a personal bank statement or a medical record. A query from the oracle to the website would need to contain login, password or other private information. And you don’t want anyone seeing that.To that end, researchers at Cornell’s Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts (IC3) have launched an oracle service that allows ethereum smart contracts to obtain trustworthy information and to securely send confidential queries to websites.Unlike other oracles, Town Crier, as the service is called, gets its added security from Intel’s Software Guard eXtensions (SGX). IC3 has already implemented SGX on Teechan, a proposed off-chain payment solution for bitcoin, though not without some measure of debate.But Town Crier is officially IC3’s first published and first deployed SGX-based tool.If you are wondering how SGX works, it essentially lets you run code inside an enclave, or a type of black box environment, which provides extra protection against tampering. Not even a computer’s own operating system can see the data inside the enclave.Another feature SGX offers is ‘remote attestation’. That means those using the service will be able to validate Town Crier code is in fact running in a secure SGX environment.Ari Juels, a professor at Cornell Tech working on the project, told CoinDesk:“Assuming that you trust SGX, data delivered by Town Crier from a website is guaranteed to be free from tampering. This authenticity property means that to trust Town Crier’s data, you only need to trust Intel’s implementation of SGX and the target website.”While Town Crier runs its core code on a server with an SGX chip, the solution also has a front end that consists of a smart contract running on the ethereum blockchain.According to Juels, Town Crier will also be instrumental for permissioned blockchains, in which fewer, trusted participants exchange data.He said:“Even if banks trust one another to source data correctly, they are not going to trust one another to handle data on business plans or trades, so confidentiality features of a system like this are also very important in a permissioned setting.”Still, IC3 is not alone in seeking to provide assistance on oracles.Other oracles that have been proposed in the past include Augur and Gnosis, which are both prediction markets that rely on the ‘wisdom of the crowd’.Another service is Oraclize, which relies on a TLSNotary – a service that allows an auditor to verify if a specific web page was accurately retrieved. Still, Town Crier is framed as unique in that it relies on a specific type of hardware for its security.Right now, although fully functional, Town Crier is still officially in alpha, and supports only query types for flight data, stock tickers, UPS tracking and weather data.The project has also partnered with SmartContracts.com, so anyone wanting to spin up a Town Crier oracle and experiment with coin price queries, can easily do so.Fortune cookies image via Shutterstock"

Long accused of being a pyramid scheme, those solicited are often encouraged to purchase large packages of “tokens” (which can then be redeemed for OneCoins) and find other buyers to increase the size of their network.The scheme has caught the attention of law enforcement and regulatory officials in a number of countries, including India. Speaking to The Hindu, a police official said that a new investigative team had been established to focus specifically on complaints tied to OneCoin.“We need police custody for investigating the case and to get all details of the scam. We have got custody of the accused till May 3,” the official said.That Indian police are shifting resources and seeking additional information from those held indicates that officials in that country are continuing to step up their fight against OneCoin. Recent reports show that other countries, including most notably Germany, are taking aim against the scheme in other ways as well.As reported last week by CoinDesk, BaFin, Germany’s top finance regulator, issued cease-and-desist letters to major elements of OneCoin’s global operations, effectively ordering it to stop operating in the country.Reports from last month also indicate that Kazakhstan’s government has also taken steps, ordering a OneCoin advocate under house arrest pending further investigation, according to a report from regional news service Tengri News.Jail cell image via Shutterstock"

supply, relative fungibility and ease of exchange. If gold can also start 
to ...","Apr 17, 2017 at 09:00 UTC","Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and a member of CoinDesk’s product team.","The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.It’s hard to believe that the price of gold was fixed twice a day via conference call as recently as two years ago.In 2015, the London gold market (the largest in the world) switched to an electronic pricing system, broadening participation and, in theory, ending decades of opacity, inefficiency and occasional manipulation. However, the price is still fixed only twice a day and most trading of physical bullion still occurs on OTC markets, perpetuating the lack of transparency and cumbersome reconciliation.This partially explains the recent flurry of activity in gold trading technology.This past week alone, both Euroclear and the Royal Mint announced progress in testing blockchain-based gold trading. IEX also has trials under way, and the Canadian Royal Mint already allows the public to buy and sell bullion on a blockchain platform.Other exchanges are looking at non-blockchain clearing solutions.While each project has different specifications, the common aim is to improve price discovery, smooth settlement, lower counterparty risk, make it easier to verify ownership of the underlying bullion and offer traders and investors a more liquid market in which to buy and sell.Yet, the magnitude of the upcoming change to the gold market is largely misunderstood. It’s not just the mechanics that change – it’s the entire ecosystem.Let’s take a look at what a more liquid and verifiable market for physical gold could do.To start with, greater trust in ‘digitized gold’ is likely to further increase demand by lowering skepticism about price fixing and removing doubts about the authenticity of the underlying asset.Furthermore, late last year, Shariah law was clarified to allow digital gold investment for Islamic finance if physically backed, opening up a potentially huge market.Also, it would allow for the creation of new types of securities. Rather than ‘paper gold’ and ‘gold reserve banking’ (in which derivatives and funds are only partially based on possession of the real thing), investors would have a choice of instruments with solid backing.Increased demand and a greater choice of vehicle is likely to further boost liquidity, which in turn would increase circulation. This would enhance gold’s functionality as collateral or even as a means of exchange.The greater the ‘usefulness’, the greater the value.Assuming all gold trading eventually moves to systems with verified reserves and instant settlement, we would finally get a better idea of how much gold is actually stored in vaults.This could create an opportunity for new applications, or even old applications revisited. For example, as a basis for a new kind of digital currency.While a return to the gold standard is unlikely for the world’s major economies (if only for the magnitude of the operation), the growing interest of central banks in digital currencies is telling.Bitcoin is often referred to as a ‘good’ money because of its limited supply, relative fungibility and ease of exchange. If gold can also start to satisfy those requirements, a seismic shift from fiat to digital could be easier to ‘sell’ – the public is predisposed to trust gold, certainly more so than cryptography.It could also open the door to the creation of a new global currency as an alternative to the dollar, something that Russia and China are rumored to be looking at.Thus, a system that started out by backing cryptographic representation and distribution with a solid underlying value could end up doing so much more than boosting transparency, efficiency and demand.Looking ahead, it could even be setting the stage for a new age in monetary policy.Click Here to Never Miss a Weekly Email AgainGolden nuggets image via Shutterstock"

That’s the case for entrepreneur Vinny Lingham, whose latest venture Civic turned down the opportunity to collect millions more in sales.Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the startup has already sold $33m in Civic tokens (CVC) – eight days before the official offering was to take place.In interview, Lingham, the company’s founder and CEO, explained that as a result, investors in the pre-sale will now effectively return one-third of these tokens so that investors who couldn’t participate in any preliminary offerings are able to get a fair shot at purchasing.Lingham told CoinDesk:“We don’t want the vanity headlines, where it all happens in pre-sales and behind the scenes. We don’t want to be sold out in 30 seconds, we want to be distributed to as many people as possible.”This means even with the outsized demand for the project, 33% of the 33 million CVC tokens the project has sold will be headed back to the market in the formal ICO.“All the buyers that have sent an allocation in bitcoin and ether to us, we’re going to release a part of it to [the market]. Whatever doesn’t sell out, the [pre-sale] buyers are going to get,” he said. “It was a smart way of ensuring buyers if we didn’t sell out.As detailed in the firm’s public statements and white paper, the remaining assets will be divided between the company itself and as-yet-undefined opportunities to advance a future ecosystem.CVC tokens will still retail for $0.10 each, a price that was also fixed for pre-sale investors. According to Lingham, even funds that participated in the pre-sale – and investors in its traditional equity round – paid the same price that crowdsale participants will ultimately be offered on 21st June.Further, crowdsale participants will also be required to verify their identities via Civic, a feature that Lingham said will both reduce fraud and showcase the company’s technology.Announced on 20th May, Civic’s service aims to rethink web logins, providing a decentralized means for internet users to verify components of their identity without exchanging personal data. As such, the service is positioned as a potential alternative that adds more layers to the experience via the power of a blockchain system.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Civic and has invested in Civic tokens.Colorful locks and keys via Shutterstock"

The technology is moving out of the lab, and dividends will likely be be expected soon.From the report:“The technology is moving from hype to reality and we will likely see business use cases becoming more common.”Seventy-seven percent of respondents said they expect their companies to incorporate blockchain into their production by 2020.But a separate section about upcoming investment plans paints a different picture.While half of all financial technology companies intend to focus on blockchain in the next 12 months, only 19% of large banks made the same claim.On a list of future investment areas related to technology among the same-sized companies, blockchain was near the bottom, with only 20% of respondents saying they would invest in the next 12 months.At the top of the list was ‘data analytics’ with 74% of respondents expecting to invest during the same period, followed by ‘mobile’ with 51% and ‘artificial intelligence’ with 34%, respectively.Other interesting takeaways from the report include that 90% of payment companies are “heavily invested” in blockchain and plan to adopt the technology as part of a production system by 2020.Twenty-four percent of the respondents identified as “very or extremely familiar” with blockchain, an increase of 7% since last year, with North American respondents being the most familiar across regions.While 77% expect some sort of live implementation of blockchain by 2020, 55% say it could happen as soon as 2018.As with the other so-called ‘Big Four’ accounting firms, PwC has been positioning itself as a leader in the blockchain industry.In November, the firm released details about Project Vulcan to study bitcoin, and last month, it joined the Crypto Valley Association in Switzerland.Going forward the report finds that the most likely business use cases for early blockchain implementations were payments infrastructure, fund transfer infrastructure and digital identity management.The report concluded:“We have also seen growing interest in the technology from insurance companies in areas such as personal and marine insurance, including claims processes.”Image of PwC logo via Shutterstock"

on the world's largest cryptocurrency. And as attempts to enact the ...","May 2, 2017 at 08:00 UTC","A new test version of the Lightning Network is launching in the coming days, marking its latest step toward a long-awaited live debut.","But, what’s most notable about the news isn’t that it’s occurring (the idea has, after all, been in the works since 2015), it’s where the technology will be deployed.First envisioned as a way to expand bitcoin, Lightning has yet to go live on the world’s largest cryptocurrency. And as attempts to enact the necessary upgrade have stalled there, some of Lightning’s developers are taking action by moving work elsewhere – to the litecoin blockchain.This is now possible largely because last week the network passed a technical upgrade called Segregated Witness (SegWit), making it the first major blockchain network to adopt the upgrade since it was proposed back in December 2015. (Other smaller cryptocurrencies, such as Syscoin, have also implemented SegWit.)Now, just a few days after this milestone, San Francisco startup Lightning Labs is releasing a version of its software for litecoin’s testnet.In interview, Lightning Labs co-founder Elizabeth Stark noted that the software will initially be available only for developers. Though, with SegWit locked in, the hope is that users will be able to use it to move real money for the first time once sufficient testing has been carried out.Stark told CoinDesk:“It’s a great example of Segregated Witness in action, right? The litecoin community worked together to activate it, and I think we’ll see the benefits, including those that we’re building out on Lightning.”In this way, Stark now expects that the activation will help demonstrate why SegWit’s fix to transaction malleability is believed to be so important for bitcoin.As such, the news is the latest to advance a larger narrative that finds litecoin seeking a value proposition amid bitcoin’s scaling debate. The move is also the latest for Lightning Labs, the startup originally co-founded by the authors of the Lightning white paper, Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja, though both have now moved on to other opportunities.Among a handful of Lightning Network implementations running on the bitcoin testnet, one, known as lnd (for Lightning Network Daemon), has now been made compatible with both bitcoin and litecoin.“We’re enabling litecoin to hook into it,” Stark explained.Lightning Labs developer Olaoluwa Osuntokun noted that on bitcoin, lnd is compatible with one of a few alternative bitcoin implementations, btcd, which is written in Go. So, in addition to making litecoin-specific additions to the lnd software, the team ported over a version of this software to litecoin.But just because developers can easily shift over their work, that doesn’t mean a live Lightning will be up and running on litecoin soon. There’s still a little over a week to go, or roughly 6,000 blocks at time of reporting, before SegWit will activate on the network.Indeed, Stark doesn’t expect that a version will be ready for the main litecoin network that soon, although she said Lighting Labs is working toward that goal.Litecoin creator Charlie Lee, on other hand, was highly optimistic about the timeline for the upgrade.“Soon after SegWit activates on Litecoin, I expect people will be able to send real value over the Lightning Network on Litecoin. This will motivate developers to build out the Lightning infrastructure and wallets,” he said, adding:“So by the time SegWit is activated on Bitcoin, Lightning Network will be ready for mainstream adoption!”Osuntokun further mentioned that, in addition to improving the Lightning protocol, there are a number of features that he would like to add to litecoin, including a block explorer.Still, in technology, there’s always a long to-do list.At least one other Lightning Network startup, ACINQ, has also tested Lightning Network on litecoin. Later, it revealed its finding that since bitcoin and litecoin are so similar, the shift doesn’t require very many changes.Still, Pierre-Marie Padiou, CEO of Lightning Network startup ACINQ, also argued that it could still take some time to deploy on the main litecoin network.“The results are very encouraging, but it doesn’t mean that Lightning Network is ready for prime time on litecoin,” he said. “It isn’t on bitcoin, either, even if we are close.”Because of that, the team is focused on finishing a version of the Lightning Network for bitcoin, he said.“Our immediate goal is still to finalize a first version, and to achieve full compatibility with other implementations. We believe this is the best way to build a high quality, safe and usable Lightning Network,” Padiou said.That’s not to say litecoin couldn’t play a role here.He concluded:”Once this is done, litecoin could serve as a realistic testbed for Lightning Network until SegWit activates on bitcoin.”Stark seemed agnostic on the point of litecoin solely offering a testbed for bitcoin, noting that some in the community have expressed that sentiment.“We’ll see if that happens,” she said.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Lightning Labs.Correction: Lightning Labs has postponed launch.

On 17th March, a slate of new members was revealed, including Mizuho Bank, Daiwa Securities Group, Merrill Lynch Japan Securities and Nomura Holdings, among others.The project has attracted the participation of several key regulators, including Japans’s central bank and the Financial Service Agency (FSA), the country’s top markets watchdog. The Japan Securities Dealers Association, an industry self-regulatory organization (SRO), is also taking part.According to JPX, additional resources are being brought online this month, and that starting in April, software testing amongst the consortium’s stakeholders will begin.The firm said in its announcement:“We will be launching a community website for registered participants in March. Furthermore, in terms of the actual testing environment, we plan to release the first user application for this series in April.”JPX has said in the past that it seeks to explore the distributed ledger technology (DLT) ecosystem for potential applications. Last February, the group announced that it was working with IBM to further experiment with the tech.That the consortium would grow is perhaps unsurprising, as JPX signaled its intention to expand membership in the months after launch.“We will seek participation from a wide range of Japanese financial institutions in order to gather broad industrial expertise,” the firm said at the time.Image Credit: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com"

With the strong correlation that exists between efficient supply chain management, increased revenue and profit, a number of companies have entered the space.In April, US software firm SAP Ariba partnered with blockchain supply chain startup Everledger, and shortly thereafter IBM joined up with Chinese supply chain management firm Hejia for its own blockchain trial.Another recent trend is that ‘blockchain supply chain’ also means moving trade finance to a blockchain, with Taiwanese manufacturing giant Foxconn spinning off a related startup with P2P lender Dianrong, and Chinese lender CreditEase launching its own blockchain service.As industry leaders continue to push the technology, Mojix, too, has plans: namely, to deal with the issues of incorporating blockchain benefits into existing enterprise applications.“The next step is we’re going to take two to three retailers and set up automated verification, RFID readers, so we can track either shipments or receipts,” said Doles, as he used one of his company’s readers to scan a box of shirts from several feet away.If all goes as planned, decentralizing the supply chain could have trickle down effects to smaller contractors, according to Microsoft’s global business strategist in charge of blockchain.Rhodes believes that the results of improving multi-party work flows include improved cash flow and stronger margins. “Ultimately,” said Rhodes, “companies will be able to radically change how they think about supply chain insurance, financing, and letters of credit.”To test that idea the Project Manifest proof-of-concept currently being built is being designed use specially designed ‘adapters’ that connect RFID scanners directly to the ethereum blockchain. Brand-owners that ship goods, and the retailers that receive them, would then automatically trigger a diverse set of smart contract functions.Doles concluded:“If we can solve that problem and create a secure way to verify the perfection of those contracts, then we have a way to expand upward and outward from there.”Image of Dan Doles via Microsoft"

These include more well-known names (Civic, Gem, IDEO, Netki), and those seeking to make an impact (Consent and Blockchain Foundary) in the digital identity space.As explained by Wayne Vaughan, CEO of member startup Tierion, what unites the group is a focus on building open-source software, code that will support all the different blockchain identity work ongoing throughout the world.“It’s about contributing to common technologies for certain areas, and still being able to run our businesses,” Vaughan said. “Take Civic. If people are generating identities and running Civic, if it’s only inside Civic that this works, what’s the point?”Instead, this new breed of identity company concentrated on blockchain needs to work together, he argued – at least on the core architecture that more specific identity applications will ride on.Vaughan continued:“Our real competition isn’t with each other, but with the big identifiers in the world: Facebook, Apple, Twitter. They control all the identity information that we have.”More specifically, common areas of work include ensuring interoperability of names and identifiers used in blockchain identity systems; the attestations and reputation data enabling verification of information associated with these identities; and methods for securing the blockchain-based identity data underlying them.The long-term goal is to use this approach to create tools that enable a college like New York University, for example, to validate to others that someone really graduated from a certain program.But the result could be that such systems even enable new forms of identification and authentication not yet realized or conceived. For instance, autonomous machine-to-machine payments have been on many industry participants’ minds since blockchain for the Internet of Things (IoT) environment got a serious new look after several commercial applications proved viable.“These identifiers and names are not just for people,” Vaughan explained. “It’s for companies and devices. The blockchain provides a root of trust that isn’t controlled by any one organization.”What does a blockchain-based identity system look like in practice?Those involved seem to have a clear idea. The end result, Vaughan hopes, is that there will be a reference implementation that all the companies involved can use to call and query identity-related information. But one that’s distributed and decentralized.If you were to build such a system with today’s tools, Vaughan explains, it’s very possible to end up with all your data stored on a cloud platform like Amazon Web Services or Dropbox.This centralized system, though, is vulnerable to hacks, snooping and other types of compromise. By using a blockchain-based system, however, data could be called and verified (instead of just shared), enabling the selective disclosure and verification of the underlying information in a way that puts control back in the hands of users.“It’s like name services on the web. Here’s the four locations where Wayne’s stuff is, no matter if it’s running on our version. They can speak the same protocol,” Vaughan said.With this new system, Vaughan continued, he might chose to use a string of letters – say ‘vaughan.id’ – to represent his identity, the same way he might have ‘Tierion.com’ to represent his business online today. Just as on the internet, this moniker would aim to be broadly accessible, not barred off like early email silos.So, where is the system in development today?According to Microsoft’s head of decentralized identity, Daniel Buchner, four working groups are underway so far. Yet, individual companies involved in the working groups are still seeking to build out their existing infrastructure in their preferred way. Blockstack, for example, will continue to use the bitcoin blockchain, while uPort will build on ethereum.As explained by DIF members, the goal now is to enlist other developers and other standards groups, like the W3C and IETF, which are already active in this area. For now, this means more conversations with key players such as IBM to help the foundation reimagine how identity services could be delivered in the future, in the hope of doing it better than our current system.“IBM worked with the US government on social security, and that has become, in the US to this day, the cornerstone of how we share our identity,” IBM’s Cuomo said.He concluded:”It’s 2017, we can do better than that.”Digital identity image via Shutterstock"

Washington, there are new rules you will have to adhere to as of next month.","Jun 8, 2017 at 10:30 UTC","Vic Lance is the founder and president of Lance Surety Bond Associates, and a graduate of Villanova University and the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.","In this opinion piece, Lance provides an overview of upcoming legal changes in Washington state that affect the virtual currency industry.If you are trading virtual currencies such as bitcoin in the state of Washington, there are new rules you will have to adhere to as of next month. Virtual currency operators in Washington need to comply with new money transmitter laws starting 23rd July.Introduced with Senate Bill 5031, the direction taken by Washington follows similar moves in New Hampshire and other states.Online operators will now have to obtain a license and comply with the money transmitter bond requirement, but with the new legislation, Washington lawmakers are also reducing the differences in the legal framework that applies for more traditional money transmitters and for virtual currency operators.Here are the most important changes that affect virtual currency operators in Washington, and how you can prepare to meet the new requirements.With the passing of Senate Bill 5031, virtual currency operators are placed under the jurisdiction of Washington money transmitter laws. They need to comply with the same rules as traditional money transmitters. This means they have to get licensed with the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions.The new bill provides a definition of virtual currency as a “digital representation of value used as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value, but does not have legal tender status as recognized by the US government”.Operators who store virtual currency are now also required to provide a third-party security audit of their data systems as a part of their licensing.Virtual currency licensees need to make a special list of disclosures to their clients, which are included in the newly added Section 21 (2) of the bill. They must:All money transmitters also need to comply with a new rule regarding license and trade names. If they a name is similar to an existing one, licensure can be denied.Besides adding virtual currency operators to the laws governing money transmitters in Washington, the new bill brings changes to one of the licensing requirements. All transmitters will now have to post a money transmitter bond, and, unlike before, no other option will be available for fulfilling this security requirement.The surety bond is an extra layer of protection for transmitters’ customers. It guarantees their legal compliance. If they fail to follow applicable laws, affected parties can make a claim on the bond to receive a financial compensation for any damages.The bond needs to be between $10,000 and $550,000. It is calculated on the basis of the transmitter’s dollar volume and payment instrument’s dollar volume for the previous year. In exceptional cases, the bond amount may be increased up to $1m.As earlier, the bond must be continuous and should be active for the whole period of the licensure. It should cover at least five years after the licensed transmitter has stopped operations in the state. The bond amount represents the maximum penal sum that can be paid to harmed parties on proven claims.With the new bill, Washington currency exchangers will also need to post a surety bond as a part of the licensing. It should be between $10,000 and $50,000. Its amount is based on the dollar volume of currency exchange for the previous year.What are your thoughts about the new Washington money transmitter laws that affect virtual currency operators?

As such, the figure is higher than even the funding raised by The DAO, the notorious failed fundraising project that made headlines last year when it lost the millions of the $152m in investor funds it raised in a similar sale.Overall, 79,323,978 Bancor network tokens (BNTs) were created as part of the ICO, with the top token holders now possessing 83.96% of the tokens, or 66,601,702 BNT. Fifty percent of the total tokens, or 39,661,989 BNT, were sold to the public, while the remaining 50% were allocated for future use.The ICO attracted 10,885 buyers, according to available data, with more than 15,000 transactions sent to the address for purchases during the sale. One buyer went so far as to purchase 6.9m BNT, or roughly $27m, in the sale.Launched in 2017, Bancor, overseen by the Bprotocol Foundation, has been pitched as a platform designed to make it easier for users to launch their own blockchain tokens.Of the remaining funds, a blog post by the company states token capital will be directed toward partnerships, community grants, public bounties and project advisors.As with past sales of this kind, the ICO was accompanied by reports that the ethereum network faced significant transaction loads, resulting in delays for buyers.However, the project itself was adversely affected by long wait times on ethereum.According to the Bancor website, an initial funding target was set at 250,000 ether, though this figure was not hard-coded into the smart contract deployed. As a result, a transaction sent on the ethereum blockchain in an effort to change the contract and limit the crowdsale in length did not work as desired.Due to network disruption and delays holding up this transaction, the company said the crowdsale ended up continuing longer than initially desired. Overall, it lasted an two additional hours as a result of the delay.Posts on social media further suggest that at least some users saw transaction issues during the sale. One thread on Reddit drew complaints about transactions being dropped as long as 35 minutes after they were sent to the ICO address.Some participants who spoke to CoinDesk also said that they had experienced delays in transacting, including one who had issues moving their ethers off an exchange for the purposes of participating in the ICO.One exchange operator went so far as to argue that the ICO had increased transaction congestion, colorfully remarking that larger ether buyers were disrupting the sale.Another factor contributing to the frenzy is that, as sale was getting underway, Bancor revealed it had attracted new and notable investors.Among those announced to be contributing funds was investor Tim Draper of VC fund Draper Fisher Jurvetson. Though new to the ICO space – he previously backed the Tezos project ahead of its yet-to-be-held offering – Draper has invested in a number of bitcoin startups in the past few years.In 2014, Draper made headlines when it emerged that he had bought 30,000 bitcoins during US government auction, later picking up an additional 2,000 BTC during a second sale. As part of the funding, Draper will also be joining the project as an advisor.The Bancor sale was also backed by Blockchain Capital, an investment firm that focuses on startups in the space.According to a blog post published today, Blockchain Capital is making its investment via its BCAP token, which it launched earlier this year.In the blockchain community, the reverberations of the sale were felt far and wide among market observers, many of whom expressed disbelief at the funding totals raised.Some commentators, when reached by CoinDesk, simply responded by calling the investment ‘insane’. Likewise, when asked if the total raised was related to project’s fundamentals, Jaxx director of business and community and bitcoin entrepreneur Charlie Shrem simply responded: “No.”Even proponents of the token sale model found fault with the sale.Nick Tomaino, a former business development manager at Coinbase and principal at Runa Capital, remarked that he hadn’t been following the project due in part to the level of hype that it had attracted.In particular, Tomaino took issue with how the project popularized news about investments in its token supply, noting the blog post that advertised investor Tim Draper’s personal contribution.“Posting that the day of a token sale is not something that many teams really building something valuable would do,” he told CoinDesk. He later added that he doesn’t rule out founding teams, though, and that Bancor could well succeed in the face of doubts about its long-term value.Still, others took it as a positive sign of market maturity. Among those to comment on the sale was JoyStream founder Bedeho Mender, who suggested that the raise had given him some pause, stating:“As someone actually building a decentralized application on bitcoin, it really makes me think what I am giving up in terms of community support and funding by staying on the platform.”Representatives for Bancor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The blow-out sale follows other offerings in recent weeks that have generated significant activity, putting new attention on the token sale model as a method of project capitalization.More notable entries have included web browser startup Brave, which raised $35m at then-current ether prices in just under seconds. Gnosis, an ethereum-based prediction market, also attracted a bevy of speculators for its $12.5m sale in April.Indeed, the ICO model has emerged as an alternative to traditional venture capital in recent months, though some observers have questioned whether the speculative frenzy taking place today is a healthy one.Others still have criticized ICOs as vehicles for scams that take advantage of an uninformed public’s thirst for big gains in emerging technology.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Brave. Calculator image via Shutterstock"

It’s not only a technical issue of which one do we go to, it’s a question of which one is more widely used.”The official blog post cited the lack of development in Counterparty as a concern, one that could be solved by ethereum.It further credited ethereum’s ERC20 token standard (which effectively allows exchanges to more easily add support for new coins), and the progress on its layer-two solutions aimed at micropayments as other influencing factors.Storj also reported that users (colloquially called ‘farmers’) have been asked to pay increasingly high fees as a result of block size constraints on the bitcoin network. (Due to bitcoin’s limited block size, those who send transactions effectively bid for space, a development driven by increased use and limited capacity).“For the February farmer payout, we paid over $1,600 in transaction fees, or about 13% of total payouts. This is not sustainable or scalable,” the company said.Founded in 2014, Storj uses a native cryptographic token called Storjcoin X (SJCX) to incentivize users with spare computer storage to safeguard the files of enterprise users. The combined technology is then sold in a standard software-as-a-service model.Storj announced it had raised $3m in funding in February, a figure that includes capital raised in traditional crowdsourced fundraising.Still, Winkinson framed the decision as one that would benefit Storj long term. Faced with its own set of scaling problems and technical concerns, Wilkinson pointed to the performance of ethereum’s core development team as the deciding benefit.“All of the projects are being built on ethereum. At some point, you have to say that’s a good enough metric.”Cardboard shipping box image via Shutterstock"

The two plead guilty last year.Court records show that Michael Lord operated a LocalBitcoins.com profile, with the moniker ‘Internet151’, dating back to 2012. The profile lists more than 3,000 confirmed trades since it was created. Prosecutors alleged that the Lords used a series of personal and business bank accounts as part of an effort to obscure their bitcoin exchanging.“Cybercrime is an emerging area of criminal activity, and we want the criminals who hide behind logon names and internet aliases to know that IRS Special Agents will follow the money in whatever form, whether it be digital or paper currency,” Jerome McDuffie, an IRS official, said in a statement.The case is the latest to involve a LocalBitcoins trader in the US.

“strike a middle ground” between permissionless ledgers like bitcoin ...","May 10, 2017 at 12:15 UTC",The single biggest challenge for digital identity systems has been to create counterparts to the secure physical identifiers we use today.,"For instance, there has yet been no effective online equivalent to producing your driver’s license at the drug store. And while there are traditional identifiers most people are familiar with online (like the Facebook login), these systems raise key questions about the centralized registries trusted by consumers and the control they have on the systems that secure them.Now, Project Indy, a blockchain initiative developed by the Sovrin Foundation, is trying to fix this problem using a hybrid distributed ledger platform. As described, the ledger would be public, but in order to interact with it, an invite would be required.According to Phil Windley, chair of the Sovrin Foundation, the idea is to “strike a middle ground” between permissionless ledgers like bitcoin and permissioned options like R3’s Corda.“One of the key philosophies of Project Indy is that private information is never written to the ledger, even in encrypted form,” said Windley. “It gets anchored on the ledger so there’s proof that it existed on a certain day.”Elements of identity are then updated on the distributed ledger to be verified by an agent. In the example of a digital driver’s license, an agent could be the Department of Motor Vehicles (in the US). However, the idea is that the system is used by third-party operators, but not owned or controlled by them.Project Indy subscribes to the concept of ‘verifiable claims’ – a method of cryptographically authenticated online identification, where no private data is written to ledger, returning some ownership to the user.Windley explained:“With a verifiable claim, this is now a cryptographically signed self-contained set of data that I can hold. Now when I come to the pharmacy and need to prove I’m over 18, my system can prove that to the pharmacy in a way they can trust, they can verify, they can validate that it was the DMV that issued that.”It’s worth noting that the World Wide Web Consortium has set up a verifiable claims working group to encourage interoperability among different players building decentralized ID solutions.
But why is centralized identity a problem? And what does blockchain do to provide a solution?Online identity has been a “disastrous situation” for some time according to Brian Behlendorf, executive director of Hyperledger, the blockchain group overseen by the Linux Foundation.Project Indy recently joined Hyperledger, and now hopes to get the ball rolling on this new form of identity with some practical use cases. A prominent use case would be in the financial services sector, replacing fractured systems that are prone to privacy breaches and leave the user with little or no control over their identity data.The mission statement of Project Indy is restoring control to people’s online identity by moving away from centralized services.Windley told CoinDesk:“By putting this on a ledger that’s operated by a number of different players under governance rules, nobody owns its, everybody can use it, anyone can improve it.”In partnering with Hyperledger, the Sovrin Foundation is contributing Project Indy’s code to the non-profit consortium – a move Windley believes will hasten development of the project’s proofs of concept (PoCs).“We have running code that can serve as the basis for prototyping, experimenting, hacking, certainly for finding holes, both security holes or conceptual holes,” said Hyperledger’s Behlendorf.Like many distributed ledger technology efforts, the financial services sector is showing the most interest in Project Indy so far. And, according to Windley, there are six financial services PoCs already underway.“Probably the first one that’s going to be launched is one that identifies people in call centers, which isn’t the sexiest application you can imagine, but it’s a real problem that financial institutions have,” he said.Another banking use case is compliance with know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. Identity ledgers would reduce the regulatory costs felt by financial institutions in this regard, claimed Windley.Healthcare is also a potential beneficiary of the tech. The project envisages a system where doctors who move between different hospitals could hold their own identifiers to verify their credentials.Still, Behlendorf is more open-minded about where the project might lead, saying:“Right now we are very eager for people to come in and kick the tires.”Egg in flour image via Shutterstock"

These currencies can also be used even if banks’ systems fail – as long as the Internet is still functioning.”It’s these characteristics, he said, that have led Norges Bank to consider new options. Among those possibilities: the issuance of a digital currency through which consumers could hold an account at the central bank. Another proposal, Nicolaisen said, is the introduction of an app that would enable anonymous, cash-like payments.Norges Bank is far from alone in exploring this area, sparking what Nicolaisen described as a long-term effort to explore which directions the institution might take. A number of central banks worldwide are looking at blockchain as a possible mechanism to issue the currencies.And, echoing representatives from other central banks, including the Bank of England, Nicolaisen said that a central bank launch of a digital currency could have significant implications for today’s financial system.“For many consumers, electronic central bank money could provide an alternative to deposit money in a bank, as cash does today. Banks can attract deposits through the interest rates they offer,” he said, adding:“But their ability to create money and extend credit could nonetheless be affected, especially if this new form of electronic money enters into widespread use.”Norwegian kroner image via Shutterstock"

184,www.coindesk.com,"Jun 14, 2017",Thomson Reuters to Power Blockchain Contracts with Experimental Service,https://www.coindesk.com/thomson-reuters-power-blockchain-contracts-new-experimental-service,"To target startups, Chadwick expects new data sets to be added, 
specifically around cryptocurrency prices for bitcoin, ethereum and 
litecoin.","Jun 14, 2017 at 08:04 UTC",Media giant Thomson Reuters is opening up its data to smart contract authors building on private versions of the ethereum blockchain and R3’s Corda distributed ledger platform.,"Released in beta today, a ‘smart oracle’ called BlockOne IQ (B1IQ) is designed to power smart contracts with the kind of reliable financial information required to let counterparties transact without a middleman. B1IQ allows blockchain participants to leverage the media giant’s reputation for providing accurate data about share prices, exchange rates, financial benchmarks and more.The firm devised what initial data should be offered to blockchain developers based on requests from existing customers. The data being made available is useful for actions including the payment of dividends, stock splits “and anything where the company’s equity is impacted by some sort of action,” according to Sam Chadwick, director of Thomson Reuters financial and risk management division.Currently, the oracle is only experimental.While Thomson Reuters is targeting the larger members of R3 and the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, the oracle can only be used as part of any organization’s proofs-of-concept, just not in live applications. By the end the year, Thomson Reuters intends to decide whether to monetize the oracle, or scrap the project altogether, according to Chadwick.Centralized applications, such as those run by banks and brokers, have had access to the the firm’s data via more traditional APIs and FTPs for some time. But, this launch opens up access to the growing decentralized application market for the data needed to facilitate more sophisticated transactions.With additional data sets forthcoming, Chadwick believes the oracle could eventually enable an endless array of advanced blockchain transactions without the need of middlemen. As an example of how a smart contract could facilitate more sophisticated deals, Chadwick described an interest rate swap where one party would pay a floating rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor).While the role of Libor in such a smart contract would stay the same each time the contract was executed, the number itself changes daily based on industry data. And Thomson Reuters keeps up with those changes. So, a rate swap powered by such a smart contract would query the B1IQ oracle and based on the result, determine which party owes how much.Chadwick said:“The bank, at the moment, plays that middle role. And what we’ve been looking at is ways in which smart contracts can play the roles [instead].”The oracle product seems to be focused on proactively finding new sources of revenue for Thomson Reuters.Last year, the firm’s Financial & Risk department generated about $6bn in revenue, according to its annual report. While the year-over-year revenue change is negligible (approximately a 1% decrease), the way that revenue was generated has changed dramatically, according to Chadwick.Though Chadwick said it’s too early to comment on whether blockchain efforts could be a potential new source of revenue, he added:“Our beta program is intended to understand market demand to inform exactly that point.”Thomson Reuters plans on opening up access to data to additional blockchain consortia, including the Linux-led Hyperledger project. (The company is part of Hyperledger, R3 and the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.)From there, its plan is to expand its focus from the larger consortia members to the smaller blockchain startups involved in the consortia, Chadwick said. To target startups, Chadwick expects new data sets to be added, specifically around cryptocurrency prices for bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin.“Although we’ve got a bias towards the large banks experimenting, some of the smaller firms just in the crypto-space are very interesting to us as well,” Chadwick said.He continued:“As crypto-securities show the potential to become new assets, it’s a way of experimenting in that space and learning about who’s active in that space. too.”Thomson Reuters is not alone in its aim to provide reliable data to the executors of smart contracts.Startups like Augur and Gnosis use prediction markets to generate reliable data. Further, firms like Oraclize are building hardware-based solutions for accessing reliable data. And last month Cornell University released its own oracle called ‘Town Crier’, which uses software guard extensions to help ensure the reliability of the data.Thomson Reuters building image via Shutterstock"

when compared to bitcoin's block time of 10 minutes, but to clients ...","Apr 8, 2017 at 09:00 UTC","Sometime in the future (we can’t be certain when), ethereum will likely switch from its proof-of-work consensus algorithm to Casper, a proof-of-stake system its developers are now in the throes of completing.","While this may sound like a slight change to those who are unfamiliar, altering this one parameter will have an outsized effect. When the protocol change happens, the ethereum blockchain will hard fork, meaning that, for a short period of time, two networks – the old and new – will exist simultaneously.At that point, the goal for ethereum will be to persuade the majority of its users to upgrade to the new proof-of-stake-powered blockchain. Otherwise, ethereum risks winding up creating another blockchain, as it did when a past technical update created ethereum classic.On the surface of things, getting the companies that use the ethereum network to switch should not be a problem. After all, proof of stake promises to be faster and more scalable, and to consume far less energy than proof of work.To most of the ethereum community, Casper sounds like a great deal. Unless, of course, you are a miner.That’s because proof of stake doesn’t rely on mining. Rather, it gives the job of creating the next block to those who own tokens on a blockchain – a move that essentially puts miners out of a job.But, two things could go wrong with ethereum’s big switch.One would be if Casper does not work as planned. In this case, ethereum could simply delay the switchover. The second is if miners continue mining the old chain. But ethereum has always had a plan for that – something called the ‘difficulty bomb’.Baked into ethereum shortly after the network launched, the difficulty bomb was created to make mining a block increasingly difficult over time. The slowdown is set to happen gradually at first, but will spike upward after the launch of Casper.When mining requires more work, miners are not able to produce as many blocks. The block time gets longer and, as a result, miners earn less and less revenue. Eventually, the network just becomes unusable.That is the plan, at least.As ominous as all that sounds, however, miners don’t appear too concerned.Jonathan Toomim is co-founder of Toomim Brothers, a cloud mining company that has a high percentage of its business invested in ethereum.Toomim told CoinDesk that, right now, the difficult bomb mainly effects his purchasing decisions. Any hardware he buys has to pay for itself before ethereum updates to Casper.Toomim also pointed out that, if and when mining ethereum does become unprofitable, he will simply switch to mining other coins, like Zcash or ethereum classic, that use a similar mining mechanism.But that right there could be a problem for ethereum.If enough miners leave the network before ethereum switches to proof of stake, that could impact the security of the main ethereum blockchain – the one that most of its users are still active on at the time.Toomim though made it clear he intends to mine altruistically, saying:“We will switch to mining more profitable coins as long as the survival of ethereum is not threatened. That is, assuming that a hard fork is performed as planned either to enable proof of stake or, worst case, to delay the bomb, we will mine something else.”Ethereum’s difficulty algorithm started with this core commit in August 2015 in the ‘Frontier’ patch, the first release of the ethereum network.At that time, ethereum’s then-CCO Stephan Taul wrote in a blog post that, starting from block 200,000, mining would become progressively more difficult. So much so, that by the end of 2016, an ‘Ice Age’ would occur, meaning a point when the network freezes up.But less than a year later, in June 2017, that Ice Age got delayed, partly to allow more time for the development of Casper.[post-quote]Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin wrote on Reddit: “With the change in the difficulty adjustment algorithm brought about in the last hard fork, the Ice Age will come very slowly indeed.”How slow? The difficulty adjustment happens every 1,000 blocks.Currently, block time is averaging 14 seconds, but for the last year, it has been inching up to 15 seconds. And, according to calculations made by Buterin three months ago, that number will double to 30 seconds by mid-August of this year.Block times could be as high as 14 minutes by 2025.A block time of 30 seconds may not sound like a lot to some, especially when compared to bitcoin’s block time of 10 minutes, but to clients running apps on ethereum, that slowdown could get annoying.Still, some ethereum users say the temporary slowdown is worth putting up with, because proof of stake will ultimately be much faster.Zack Coburn, the lead developer at FirstBlood, a gaming platform that runs on ethereum, said he’s not fussed.He told CoinDesk: “We don’t rely on extremely high frequency transactions, so a brief period of 30-second block times wouldn’t be a major concern.”Some have a different opinion, though.Rick Dudley, a blockchain developer who contributed to Casper, thinks any change in block time is a huge deal. And if the block time climbs to 2 minutes, the difficulty bomb will seriously impact businesses.“Yeah, I think that is pretty crippling. Two minutes from 15 seconds is extremely painful. I think it is easy to misinterpret how bad that really is,” he said.He points out, though, that the bomb is only going to hit when there is already a viable alternative: proof of stake.In this light, Dudley he said he feels ethereum won’t have a problem getting users to upgrade, concluding:“If the choice is between the proof-of-stake network that is lowering time and the proof-of-work network that is increasing block times, why would you stick with the network that is increasing block times?”Faded match via Shutterstock"

However, thanks to a new partnership with Netki, one hurdle may have just gotten easier.","Announced today at Consensus 2017, Bitt revealed it will use identity tools developed by California blockchain startup Netki to improve and automate its customer onboarding.While it may sound like a small step, according to Bitt co-founder Oliver Gale, the upgrade will serve to advance a larger bid to connect regional central banks and commercial banks using digital fiat currencies and blockchain tech as a new kind of payment rail.“Across more than 7,000 islands, the Caribbean has 13 sovereign island nations and 12 dependent territories, most with their own financial system and currency,” a press release from the companies explains.Bitt revealed it is already working with the Central Bank of Barbados on “pilot initiatives” behind the concept. (The Central Bank of Barbados declined to comment, but will be speaking later at Consensus 2017 today).Gale told CoinDesk:“We’re offering Bitt as a payment network. The vision is connecting the Caribbean with a settlement network.”In this way, Gale framed the solution for conducting AML and identity on a public blockchain as one that would enable it to take this concept “to the next tier”, satisfying concerns that a open digital currency network wouldn’t normally include identity features natively.For Netki, the announcement also marks a major product milestone, serving as an extension of a digital identity standard it first made public at Consensus 2016 last year. At the time, it likened the service to the certificate authorities that today provide trusted transactions in online commerce transactions.As such, Netki CEO Justin Newton explained to CoinDesk that the partnership serves to highlight the work it is doing to bring blockchain to the enterprise.“One of the reasons that I think the partnership we have with Bitt will be so successful is that it is addressing these digital identity with open standards. Using an open, permissionless network gives them the most flexibility for the future,” he said.As put forward by Bitt, the partnership is one that finds it seeking to solve real-world challenges with blockchain tech, in a way that builds on its past work and helps position it as a licensed financial institution that can solve big regional challenges.Specifically, this news builds on a 2016 announcement that Bitt would launch a digital Barbadian dollar on the blockchain in partnership with blockchain startup Colu.The idea is that the cryptocurrency would be pegged to real, government-backed currency, which could then be sent between peers with the freedoms similar to what bitcoin today provides its global user base.Gale concluded:“The end-game solution is that central banks will be able to use legal tender issued on the blockchain, with all the checks and balances you’d have with regulated financial institutions.”Hammock image via Shutterstock"

But, when compared to bitcoin’s nearly 50% surge in value since the start of the year, ethereum’s 900% climb is worth examining in context.From roughly $8 on 1st January to an all-time high of $82 this week, ether has come a long way since its began trading in 2015.Here are 5 things newcomers may benefit from knowing about the market.Since early 2016, ether has been the second-largest market cap of any cryptocurrency, managing to outshine more tenured alternative asset protocols such as litecoin and ripple, according to CoinMarketCap data.This sharp increase has taken place as the broader cryptocurrency space has attracted significant capital inflows, rising almost $7bn in value in Q1 2017.During this time frame, the price of ether returned more than 500%.When examined over a broader time frame, cryptocurrency’s price gains have been even more impressive, as ether has appreciated more than 2,800% since it 2015.Ether’s trading volume has fluctuated quite a bit during its history.Trading activity for this digital asset was very modest at times, with 24-hour trading volume falling below $100,000 in some cases. At other times, this activity surged, with 24-hour volume nearing $600m in March.Overall, however, the market has seen a gradual upward trending, with volume picking up notably in March and April.What does search interest have to do with price?As CoinDesk contributor Willy Woo has put forward – quite a bit given that most traders and buyers Google the price first. (Woo has even described a whole strategy around gaining insights from such data).Ether’s search interest has risen sharply in the last few years, although its upward movement coincided with some significant pullbacks, according to Google Trends.The cryptocurrency’s search interest peaked in mid-March, as the term “ethereum” attained its highest point of popularity between 12th and 18th March.When broken down by geographic region, the search interest for this term has been quite varied, according to additional data from Google Trends.Switzerland has been the post popular area for these searches over the last five years, with Venezuela coming in a close second, claiming 95% of the search interest.Several major exchanges have started offering ether trading to customers over the last few years. Poloniex, the single largest exchange in terms of ETH/BTC volume began offering the currency pair in August 2015.Kraken, Bitfinex, Coinbase and Gemini followed suit shortly after, with some offering US dollar trading. Other companies provide their clients with over-the-counter (OTC) trading of this cryptocurrency.Genesis Trading, for example, began offering OTC ether trading in early 2016, and Octagon Strategy started providing this service for its clients in March 2017.Due to the design of the ethereum platform, developers are able to issue their own assets on top of the blockchain network.The number of token sales for ethereum-based projects has surged over the last year, and is gaining steam. As a result, there’s a strong belief interest in these projects could continue to fuel trading interest and demand.Track the price of ether on CoinDesk’s new ethereum price page.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Genesis Trading, Coinbase and Kraken.Ethereum visualization via Shutterestock"

returns for their early investors, while creating a new economy – the ...","Apr 17, 2017 at 10:00 UTC","William Mougayar is the author of “The Business Blockchain” and a board advisor to, and investor in, various blockchain projects and startups (See: Disclosures).","In this opinion piece, Mougayar discusses the early days of venture capital, drawing parallels and comparisons to the state of cryptocurrency and token-based investing taking shape today.Investor Fred Wilson posted the other day about General Georges Doriot, giving us a timely reminder of his work as the ‘father of modern venture capital’.The post inspired me to revisit Doriot’s story as told in the book “Creative Capital: Georges Doriot and the Birth of Venture Capital”, published in 2008 and written by Spencer Ante.In doing so, I was struck by the similarities between what happened in the 1940s and what is happening now with cryptocurrency, specifically how these early venture capitalists were pushed to break the regulatory mold in order to allow something new to flourish.Following World War II, Doriot founded the world’s first public venture capital firm, American Research and Development Corporation (ARDC), but it wasn’t greeted with the fanfare we associate with the modern VC firms of today.Consider this:“The idea of venture capital was so new that the founders of ARDC were forced to reengineer aspects of various financial regulatory structures in order to make it viable. Before ARDC could offer its stock, for instance, it had to obtain a number of exemptions under the Investment Company Act of 1940 from the Securities and Exchange Commission.”What’s startling about this sentence is that it is almost exactly where we are with cryptocurrency tokens and funds.Today, the industry is begging for a rewrite and a reengineering of the financial regulatory structures of yesteryear, giving hope to the current array of activities that have developed around cryptocurrenciesIf that sounds far-fetched, remember that stocks were once considered a new asset class.The current asset classes include stocks, bonds and cash as ‘traditional assets’. Alternative assets include commodities, REITs, collectibles, insurance products, derivatives, foreign currency, venture capital, private equity and distressed securities.It is also worthy to note that the alternative asset classes have varying degrees of compliance requirements: from being regulated to non-regulated.Should regulators stop scratching their heads and treat cryptocurrencies simply as a new alternative asset class, we’ll be done with the debate.There is a precedent to that evolution, citing Doriot’s work.Most regulators have been waiting and watching the industry. Their wait has been useful, and will be vindicated because we are starting to see progress.Crowdfunding via cryptocurrencies, I believe, is a viable practice. A lot of good ideas and innovative companies are coming out of these ventures, and while we may not readily see it, this segment is creating thousands of jobs and companies all over the world.Cryptocurrency fund management is also gaining steam, even though today it looks like a fringe activity or strange beast that has characteristics so unique they can’t be described in the current legal lexicon.The main point, however, is that cryptocurrencies are not just for money launderers and scammers.They are for entrepreneurs, technologists, change-the-world dreamers and anyone who believes they can (and will) enable new business models, new types of organizations and new ways to service consumers and businesses alike.Sound familiar? The prose dedicated to early VC firms will ring a bell.From Spencer Ante:“ARDC may have been launched in 1946, but it took close to 20 years before the investment community bought into the whole the ‘venture capital’ thing. It really took one big success for investors to take the venture capital business model seriously, which for ARD came in the form of its investment in Digital Equipment Corporation. In 1957, ARD invested $70,000 into Digital Equipment Corp for a 70% ownership stake. By 1967 the position was worth $200 million or 2,800x its original investment.”Hopefully, crypto will not take 20 years before the investment community buys into that concept wholeheartedly.These groups should note, it has already seen big successes. Bitcoin, ethereum and many other crypto projects have generated financial returns for their early investors, while creating a new economy – the blockchain economy.Just as Georges Doriot was credited for seeing that capital needed to get ‘creative’ to birth venture capital, we need to be creative today, in order to birth ‘crypto capital’. The difference now is we have a roadmap to replicate.This topic will be discussed in greater depth and with a variety of experts we have assembled from around the world, at the upcoming Token Summit in New York, on 25th May.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Apr 5, 2017 at 12:59 UTC","The future of central banks could be either on an open, permissionless blockchain or a closed, permissioned distributed ledger, according to a paper released today by bank consortium R3.","That is, assuming anything changes at all.Already, the global institutions that actually issue national currencies have moved vast amounts of the paper money they print to digital, centralized ledgers.But as more and more central banks around the world reveal details about their interest in blockchain and other distributed ledgers, the very real possibility of central banks decentralizing is being seriously studied by academics.Most recently, a research paper published today by R3 and revealed exclusively to CoinDesk presents a detailed picture of the benefits and detractions of two of the most popular strategies being consideredIn conversation with CoinDesk, report author and chair in economics at the University of California Santa Barbara, Rod Garratt, detailed the impact he believes blockchain and other distributed ledgers could have if implemented by central banks.“Most central bank money is digital. Reserves are digital,” Garratt said, adding:“What really distinguishes the idea of this sort of central bank digital currency is the idea that, while it may be generated on the central bank balance sheet, it can transact off the central bank’s balance sheet.”Currently, most central banks inject new currency into the economy through a number of monetary policy actions, including buying government bonds that, in turn, supply securities dealers with cash. This then makes its way into the market through a number of mechanisms.But the issuance of fiat money on a blockchain or other distributed ledger opens up a wide range of new possibilities, according to Garratt, who is also a member of R3’s academic advisory board.Revealed for the first time in the new paper, titled “CAD-coin versus Fedcoin”, are new details about Project Jasper – a secretive project being undertaken by the Bank of Canada, R3, and others.First announced last year, Project Jasper was designed to be implemented in a series of phases, the first of which concluded at the Payment Panorama conference last year.As detailed in the paper, Project Jasper’s CAD-coin was designed to have a neutral impact on the Bank of Canada’s monetary policy, by settling all CAD-coin exchanges at the end of each day.In the phase one simulation, this was accomplished by six private Canadian banks pledging cash collateral – which was pooled into an account held by the Bank of Canada – in exchange for an equal amount of CAD-coin to be exchanged throughout the day.For the test, CAD-coin was issued on a permissioned version of the ethereum blockchain set up to use the proof-of-work mining built into Geth, but with the platform’s token, ether, removed. However, R3 is also developing its own distributed ledger, Corda – also without a cryptocurrency – intended to further streamline a number of financial transactions.According to the report, banks were identified by a public address in this early CAD-coin implementation, but live transactions would have required much more information, including a complete list mapping the names of banks to public addresses in the distributed ledger.The report states:“With CAD-coin, the central bank again acts as the gateway to conversion from central bank money to CAD-coin, but privacy at conversion is not required. In fact, it is quite the opposite. Central banks typically have the authority to monitor payments transactions in their role as overseer of a systemically important financial market infrastructure, so complete privacy is not a reasonable objective.”Permissioned distributed ledgers, though, are not the only potential solution being seriously discussed as a possible replacement for central bank-issued currencies.Initially proposed by blogger JP Koning in 2013, the concept now known as Fedcoin, has already been personally embraced by David Andolfatto, vice-president of the US Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis.Whereas CAD-coin is presented in the R3 report as a permissioned solution with cryptocurrency cashed out at the end of every day, Garrett positions Fedcoin as a permissionless solution that is actually swapped out with traditional currency, resulting in a new form of sovereign currency.Though it is important to note that the US Federal Reserve has not formally expressed any interest in issuing the cryptocurrency first described by Koning, central banks around the world have begun to explore it and similar concepts.Last June, the Federal Reserve co-hosted representatives from 90 central banks gathered in Washington DC to discuss the possible network effects of moving global currency to a blockchain or distributed ledger.Garratt distinguishes CAD-coin from Fedcoin in that CAD-coin is being designed as a temporary tool to expedite the movement of traditional digital cash, whereas Fedcoin as described by Koning would be a substitute for currency already in circulation.According to the paper:“Fedcoin is intended as a retail payment solution, while CAD-coin is intended as a wholesale payments solution: it does not trade on a public network, nor is it consumer facing.”Preventing the adoption of central-bank issued cryptocurrency are a number of potential problems, not least of which are large-scale runs on banks, similar to those that triggered the Great Depression.Joining a growing list of skeptics who warn of the difficulties facing adoption, Garrett enumerated a number of obstacles between central banks and their use of cryptocurrencies.For example, he positioned the Fedcoin concept as particularly susceptible to runs on the bank, since the process of making a withdrawal would be simplified to a potentially dangerous degree in times of economic uncertainty.“Unless the central bank put limits on peoples’ ability to convert money into Fedcoin,” wrote Garratt, “there could be significant swings in the composition of the monetary base which could have serious implications for liquidity.”Meanwhile, the adoption of a CAD-coin style currency by the Bank of Canada or elsewhere could be inhibited by uncertainty among some banks that others will follow suit – a crucial component of the potential efficiencies that Garratt suggests could be freed up by moving fiat money to a distributed ledger.Already, a number of global central banks have publicly expressed interest in fiat currency issued on a blockchain, while at least one company, eCurrency, has been established for the sole purpose of helping central banks digitize their currencies.Further, non-central-bank-related solutions are also being developed.For example, the cryptocurrency Tether is specifically designed to be pegged to the US dollar without the need of a central bank, while Bitshares’ SmartCoins are intended to be pegged to any number of assets, including gold.Garratt concluded by embracing a ‘more the merrier’ philosophy:“If you have multiple countries offering central bank digital money that can be transferred on this ledger, then suddenly you have the possibilities for very efficient clearing and settlement in multiple currencies.”World currencies image via Shutterstock"

as ...","Apr 14, 2017 at 14:33 UTC",An under-the-radar effort to supercharge ethereum smart contracts is gaining momentum.,"While it may seem like another in-progress scalability project, TrueBit is distinguished by its developer team, including developer Christian Reitwiessner, creator of the network’s Solidity smart contracting language, and mathematician Jason Teutsch.Announced last year, TrueBit’s goal is to enable support for more powerful smart contract computations on the distributed application platform – the most ambitious of which are those that would be needed for applications like rendering photos or machine learning and artificial intelligence.The scaling issues inherent in public blockchain architecture are known, but computational power could prove a significant problem for ethereum, which looks to be a ‘world computer‘ that supports a richer variety of complex applications similar to those found in an average app store.Proof-of-stake, the Raiden Network, sharding and state channels are all initiatives aiming to improve ethereum’s scale. In this way, TrueBit is an addition to the pantheon.The creators foresee a way to increase ethereum’s computational power by harnessing another distributed network that would conduct and verify computation, while disagreements would be settled on the ethereum blockchain. In theory, this would limit the workload placed on the lower levels of the system, where data is stored by a large network of global nodes.TrueBit founder and University of Alabama at Birmingham postdoc Jason Teutsch told CoinDesk:”[Today,] smart contracts can only do very trivial tasks from a computational point of view. Basically, what TrueBit does is to give smart contracts the ability of doing scalable computations.”So, what’s wrong with the system today? Currently, ethereum has a ‘gas limit’ that puts a cap on the network’s computational power per block.This is roughly equivalent to bitcoin’s limit on the transactions it includes in each block, though the gas limit is dynamically set by miners as opposed to being hard-coded into the network.To date, the gas limit has already given rise to issues. For example, miners last year temporarily lowered the gas limit to thwart attacks on the network, impacting the operations of ethereum apps and companies.Yet, without such a limit, Teutsch said, a problem known as the ‘verifier’s dilemma’ arises, and miners are incentivized to accept unverified scripts into the blocks they mine.“If you allow unbounded computation with ethereum smart contracts – the way they are right now – you would not only get denial of service attacks, but you would also end up getting wrong answers on the blockchain,” he said.Finding a workaround to these limits is where TrueBit and similar projects come in.Like other next-generation blockchain projects, TrueBit uses a layer above the blockchain to do the heavy lifting. In this case, it outsources the verification of computations.Rather than each and every node computing each and every smart contract, participants in the market – potentially anyone who owns a computer – perform this task. These participants are called ‘solvers’ and they submit a solution to the problem for a reward, while ‘validators’ check their work.The project’s white paper describes the TrueBit system as a ‘verification game’, where a market of off-blockchain computers verify computations. If even one participant disagrees with a solver’s result, they can kick it to the blockchain to settle the dispute.And the system aims to incentivize players to act in a trustworthy manner.“At the end of this game, either the cheating solver will be discovered and punished, or the challenger will pay for the resources consumed by the false alarm,” the paper explains.Already, the computationally heavy distributed application Golem, a market for CPU and GPU power, intends to use TrueBit, as opposed to the ethereum blockchain.However, there are other applications for TrueBit, Teutsch suggested. Dogethereum, a project aiming to connect the dogecoin blockchain to ethereum’s, is one he is particularly excited about.Dogethereum is different from other ‘bridge’ attempts, such as BTC Relay (which bridges bitcoin and ethereum), in that it could allow users to export currency instead of having to switch currencies between blockchains.BTC Relay allows users to pay for ethereum applications with bitcoin, but it does not transfer the currency to ethereum, Teutsch said.“In contrast, the Dogethereum bridge, as we envision it implementing with TrueBit, would effectively allow users to export currency from dogecoin to ethereum without (necessarily) making dogecoin transactions visible to ethereum smart contracts,” he said.Others have come to TrueBit with application ideas, as well, such as using it to stream video on Livepeer, which Teutsch described as a “YouTube without the YouTube”. And still others, such as Gnosis, are working on separate off-chain computational scaling.Will TrueBit help power this new wave of applications?That answer seems uncertain. However, Teutsch said that it looks like they might deploy the technology on both ethereum classic and bitcoin-bound smart contract platform Rootstock in the near future.Either way, the project shows the continued demand for scaling, and the many ways developers on the ethereum network are taking to attack the issue.Light and shadows image via Shutterstock"

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Apr 11, 2017 at 04:09 UTC","IBM advanced its status as a blockchain leader Tuesday with the launch of a supply chain platform designed to streamline flows among buyers, sellers and financiers in the pharmaceuticals space.","The Yijian Blockchain Technology Application System – built in a partnership between IBM and Hejia, a Chinese supply chain management company – seeks to eliminate some of the financing problems faced by the country’s pharmaceutical retailers. Specifically, it targets the country’s underdeveloped credit evaluation system, which it argues can make it difficult to raise short-term working capital.The platform is designed to bring greater transparency into supply chain networks by tracking the flow of drugs, encrypting trading records and offering an easier means of authenticating transactions. The end goal is to reduce the time small retailers must wait to be paid after delivering medicine to hospitals – which currently can be as high as 60 to 90 days.Overall, Ramesh Gopinath, vice president of Blockchain Solutions at IBM, said that the use case offers an ideal example of how the company’s enterprise blockchain platform can smooth multi-party transaction processes.He told CoinDesk:“Blockchain is perfect for the kind of flow that happens between three parties. It’s not a random thing, we see a pattern of this appearing again and again.”Initially, the Yijian system will be implemented on a test basis by one pharmaceutical retailer, one hospital and one bank, but plans are in place to expand in July to create a farther-reaching network.Leng Tianhui, board chairman of Hejia, emphasized in statements that he expects the platform to be adopted far beyond just the pharmaceuticals sector in China.Yet, the Yijian platform’s launch also strengthens IBM’s positioning in China – it has now rolled out five different solutions in the world’s second-largest economy in the last 12 months.In March, the technology giant announced the creation of a green asset management platform designed to help companies develop, manage and trade carbon assets more efficiently under China’s carbon emissions quota scheme. Further, in January, it teamed up with the Postal Savings Bank of China to launch a blockchain asset custody system.As far back as 2016, this strategy could already be observed, as IBM partnered with UnionPay – China’s largest payment credit card processor – to roll out a blockchain platform facilitating the exchange of user loyalty points in September.It also launched a pilot in conjunction Walmart to move China’s pork industry supply chain on to a blockchain in October.Still, Gopinath said that IBM’s focus on China is a function of the availability of pertinent use cases and local partners.“I wouldn’t calculate this as ‘OK, we have a concerted effort to do something in China’,” he said, adding:“It’s more like there are all these classic, what I would call, great uses cases starting up in different places.”Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the name of the application, and the IBM representative interviewed.IBM Beijing building via Shutterstock"

Caribbean central banks have begun working with bitcoin-based ...","Jun 18, 2017 at 11:00 UTC","Steven Hopkins is chief operating officer and general counsel of Medici Ventures, an Overstock subsidiary focused on the advancement of blockchain technology.","In this opinion piece, Hopkins discusses issues with the global AML and KYC requirements placed on banks, concluding that, while this is encouraging blockchain innovation, more legal clarity is needed to prevent developing countries being largely excluded from the financial system.In 1970, legislators supporting the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) emphasized that the new law would not be a burden to financial institutions because they already kept most of the records required and the Secretary of the Treasury would have broad latitude to provide exemptions in cases where regulatory costs exceeded benefits.Since then, each of the 11 additional laws has added more requirements for banks and money transmitters. Today, this compendium of regulation is generally referred to as the anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) rules.In addition to reporting transactions above certain levels, banks are now required to know who their customers are, and to report any ‘suspicious activity’. Ask any financial institution today what its largest burden is, the answer is invariably “compliance”.Regulatory burdens on financial institutions are expensive, and growing bank fees and service charges have reflected this. However, after the financial crisis of 2008, regulators added uncertainty to the mix.They began to use the broad authority granted them by Congress to impose large fines, levying $321bn in penalties on banks between 2009 and 2016. The perceived randomness of who might be fined next and how much, added enormous uncertainty to the world of banking.In addition to the financial impact of nine- and 10-figure fines, being singled out as a supporter of terrorism and organized crime carries an enormous reputational risk for any company.Banks got the message. Their response was to sever ties with virtually any foreign correspondent bank with customers that regulators might deem ‘suspicious’ using 20/20 hindsight.They are also careful not do business with customers or industries that might later turn out to be ‘suspicious’. It’s a rational course of action with devastating results.The amount of de-risking activity has been significant. Accuity, a banking industry research group, found in May 2017 that 25% of global correspondent banking ties have been severed since 2009.Businesses dealing with cryptocurrency and legal marijuana have had accounts closed and been refused banking services pursuant to a practice labeled ‘pre-risking’ by bank executives. Certain regions such as Africa and the Caribbean have been hit hardest, with nearly 70% of Caribbean banks reporting severance of correspondent banking relationships by 2015.A separate study published by the Charity and Security Network in February 2017, found 66% of charities and non-profits experiencing obstacles such as payment delays, additional due diligence requirements and fee increases.Fully 16% of charities surveyed said they had experienced account closures or a refusal to open accounts.Regional economies have been deeply affected, with exporters unable to engage in trade finance and individuals who rely on remittance payments from relatives unable to receive them. Even with worldwide economic growth during 2015 and 2016, remittance payments to developing nations declined two years running – the only double decline in recent memory according to the World Bank.The economic impacts of de-risking have been so severe that several Caribbean central banks have begun working with bitcoin-based payments company Bitt in order to create an alternative currency settlement network in the Caribbean.Bitt founder and CEO Gabriel Abed has been a passionate critic of de-risking and emphasized at the Medici Ventures Blockchain Summit recently that, for the already impoverished citizens of the Caribbean, de-risking is exceptionally painful.After noting the myriad of very high costs in making a simple transaction, Abed summed it up by saying simply:“It is expensive to be poor.”By forcing millions out of the financial system, de-risking is creating a large population that has no other alternative but to use gray market or illicit means to make payments, move money or otherwise participate in the economy.Henry Balani of Accuity notes, “[R]egulation designed to protect the global financial system is, in a sense, having the opposite effect and forcing whole regions outside the regulated financial system.”This marginalization of millions has helped many see the benefits of blockchains, cryptocurrencies and other methods that do not require significant interaction with the global financial system. Without access to traditional banks, Caribbean governments are finding no other way to ensure that their citizens will have access to payment and banking infrastructure.With so many pushed out of the system, financial inclusion has become more than a nicety. As Paul Taylor and Juan Martinez of Swift put it in a recent article, financial inclusion is now a necessity that “needs to remain front and center, not only because it is essential to society, but also as a means of minimizing illicit flows”.The obvious solution to this humanitarian and law enforcement problem is to find a way to bring ‘de-risked’ areas, industries and individuals back into the financial system. Cryptocurrency money transmission businesses are eager to provide solutions for the de-risked at much lower costs than traditional banks, but cannot easily obtain banking relationships.Banks remain uncertain as to whether they will be rewarded or punished for financial inclusion efforts. All parties want to know that they are operating within the law. With this background, no financial institution or money transmission business will risk doing business with industries, individuals or regions that have been ‘de-risked’ until there is a safe harbor regulation.The US Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has attempted several times in the past two years to state that its regulations are clear and do not require banks to sever correspondent banking relationships. The empirical results show that this is simply not true. De-risking continues apace.The only thing that is clear today is that banks do not know how to comply with the regulations so they err on the side of caution.A ‘bright line’ rule with reasonable requirements and a safe harbor is the only thing that will reverse the disturbing trend of de-risking. Legislators passing the Bank Secrecy Act assured us the law wouldn’t be a burden.Let’s go back to that sentiment and give financial institutions a way to be sure they have fully complied with AML/KYC rules.Disclosure: Medici Ventures is an investor in Bitt. Knot and dock image via Shutterstock"

Perhaps the most revealing statistic from our ‘Bitcoin and Ethereum Sentiment Study’ stemmed from the simplest question one could ask.When queried about overall sentiment on the ‘state of bitcoin’ and how it compared to the ‘state of ethereum’, there was a stark contrast.Respondents were absolutely ecstatic about ethereum, with less than 5% responding negatively.In contrast, sentiment around bitcoin was largely split.Some of the negativity toward bitcoin undoubtedly stemmed from the continued rise in daily transaction numbers and average block sizes, which reached their all-time highs in the first quarter amid record-breaking transaction fees and confirmation times.Perhaps, however, there is a positive side to the increasing network use – the simple fact that all-time high transaction volumes and fees occurred at the same time, illustrating that the demand to use bitcoin did not falter amidst exponentially largely costs.Another question found that many users now view bitcoin as less of a ‘digital currency’ (like its creator Satoshi Nakamoto seemingly described in the ‘Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System’ white paper), and more of a ‘digital gold’ (seemingly used more for value storage and investment).Perhaps as a result, there’s a growing belief that other cryptocurrencies can also be used for transactional and exchange purposes.Notably, as questions got more granular, this discrepancy in sentiments continued.For example, the bitcoin mining network is now also seen as much more centralized than ethereum’s, despite the fact that certain ethereum mining pools currently account for larger percentages of its network’s hashing power when compared to bitcoin.When it came to supporting projects, sentiment on ethereum also largely remained positive.Despite the early stage of many ethereum dapps, participants were very positive on the current landscape of projects across the ecosystem.Further, while seemingly initially created as a system aimed at disrupting traditional incumbents, most appear positive and excited about traditional financial and technology firms becoming involved in ethereum, even if focused on ‘permissioned’ forms of the network.Beyond gathering feedback and sentiment around the current ‘state of ethereum’, our Q1 study also had participants look ahead with their predictions on the future of the network.The community is positive about ethereum’s impending transition to a ‘proof of stake’ consensus algorithm, and the effect it will bring to the overall decentralization of the network – with 93% confident it will be live by the end of 2018.Indeed, when it comes to technical progress, expectations for ethereum are now exceeding bitcoin’s in certain areas. Respondents, for example, indicated that off-blockchain scaling solutions are more likely to take place on ethereum.Overall, 57% think we’ll see Raiden (ethereum’s off-chain scaling technology) live in 2017 and 87% believe Raiden will be live by the end of 2018. By comparison, just 19% said they think bitcoin’s long-proposed Lightning Network would be live this year.Also notable was the fact that more respondents thought that the Lightning Network would not be live until ‘2020 or later’.As ethereum continues to grow, however, it remains to be seen whether it can keep its momentum – and optimism – amid an influx of users, projects and startups. Already, signs suggest there could be tensions here as sky-high expectations meet the reality of shaping a large, distributed network.View CoinDesk Research‘s full Q1 2017 State of Blockchain for more analysis on the ethereum network and the full results of our bitcoin and ethereum sentiment survey.

The DAO.Casino ecosystem seeks to reward users for participating in the platform (whether they’re developers or players), and ethereum distributes funds depending on the value they bring to the ecosystem.The developers claim the platform will help protect users from gambling scams by ensuring that those running are operating accordingly.Yet, even while the platform has laudable intentions, DAO.Casino must be licensed, and that means it must seek approval from regulators.This raises questions around online gambling regulation, and it seems regulators are only in the early stages of thinking about blockchains and how they might mitigate scams.A spokesperson for the European Commission told CoinDesk that it does not have a position on using blockchain technology as a way to regulate online gambling.Gambling legislation remains a matter for member countries in the EU, she said.The UK Gambling Commission (UKGC), likewise, warns gamblers and operators about the use of digital currency, but has no specific comments on the blockchain.Tim Miller, the UKGC’s executive director, told CoinDesk:“We think that by far the best way for consumers in Britain to protect themselves from scams is to check they’re gambling with an operator licensed by us.”In this context, an interesting disagreement seems to emerge. Namely, who should users trust, cryptography or authority?Still, it remains unclear how much of a problem gambling scams are.Stats from the UK, for example, show that 29% of the gambling market share is now online. Yet, concrete figures on the amount of people affected by online gambling scams and fraud are hard to come by.The founders of DAO.Casino describe the traditional gambling infrastructure as being far too closed off and opaque.For example, this month, bookmakers in the UK and Ireland are seeing a boost in online bets placed thanks to the Cheltenham races, but there have been allegations around the use of software to restrict gamblers and curtail their winnings.In DAO.Casino’s blockchain alternative, developers need to create games on smart contracts on the platform, yet after that, there is a more democratic review.“After that, somebody from the community or from the foundation makes an audit of your logic of your game,” explained Ilya Tarutov, CEO of DAO.Casino.He believes this creates greater trust among the community and encourages more users to play and gamble.Faced with this prospect, regulators seem to suggest that there’s little evidence that gambling scams are a pervasive problem. The European Commission stressed that it makes recommendations on common principles for protecting consumers online, and that an expert group regularly discusses new technologies. Blockchain, it said, may be a future issue.The spokesperson did however raise questions around how DAO.Casino presents itself.“We are certainly aware that there are many rogue websites out there and we know that regulators are facing huge challenges … but the suggestion that all of ‘traditional’ gambling is unfair is not one we have come across before,” she said.She added:“Conversely, I am sure the proposed platform will raise regulatory questions for the relevant national authorities.”For now, though, DAO.Casino is moving ahead, with about 1,000 test users.Tarutov is seeking approval from the government of Curaçao to operate the games. The Caribbean island has granted licenses to bitcoin gambling site MegaDice for example.Because of this, he stressed that the platform only in “testing mode” so far: “When we have a license we will start promoting it.”For now, it seems, this means larger questions implied by blockchain may go unanswered.Slot machine image via Shutterstock"

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Apr 29, 2017 at 11:45 UTC","The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) sounds like just the kind of futuristic protocol that would coalesce with blockchain, and its inventor, Juan Benet, has big plans for the two decentralized technologies.","By storing multiple copies of data, the IPFS protocol, heralded as a tool for building a more permanent web, makes data more difficult to erase. Notably, it caught the attention of global warming archivists earlier this year when many worried that US government agency data would disappear under the new administration.But Benet envisions future blockchain applications as well.Mainly since blockchains have proven an inefficient and expensive way of storing data, Benet believes data, from webpages to PDFs, can be offloaded to another computing layer like IPFS. Since distributed ledgers can be put on top of IPFS for application building, he calls the two systems a “great marriage”.“If you add it to IPFS and take that hash and put it in a block, you can then use IPFS to browse the transaction and browse the file directly on the web,” he told CoinDesk.Benet continued:“IPFS connects all these different blockchains in a way that’s similar to how the web connects all these websites together. The same way that you can drop a link on one page that links to another page, you can drop a link in ethereum [for example] that links to zcash and IPFS can resolve all of that.”The ethereum–zcash example, which is currently in progress, is an interesting one, since those blockchain’s developers have previously floated the idea of connecting the two blockchains.So, how does it work? It’s a bit of a complex process, one that’s more easily grasped by understanding IPFS and its functionality.Much like ethereum developers, IPFS developers want to decentralize the internet. The protocol is an experimental replacement for HTTP, the technology currently responsible for delivering webpages like this CoinDesk article to a computer.But rather than central servers managed by a few companies storing webpages online in the cloud (think Google Docs and emails), IPFS distributes data across a web of computers. A single computer, for instance, could participate in storing a slice of data.The way this is achieved is through content addressing, hash-linked lists and other technology that’s still being worked on today.With this underpinning, data links can be embedded in other places, such as in blockchains.“What we have is a situation where you can create a link. You can go into the ethereum blockchain and issue a transaction that links to zcash. You can browse and access the entire ethereum blockchain and the entire zcash blockchain on IPFS,” Benet said.Effectively, it’s a way to abstract away from cryptocurrencies.“Imagine you’re browsing one blockchain,” Benet explained. “You can click through from one to the other, which means that you can write applications that relate the two without those applications having to understand either ethereum or zcash.”The idea is, if ethereum, zcash and other blockchains can store smaller amounts of data, IPFS can be a tool for linking them and browsing them.But, while IPFS and MetaMask developers have presented how this would work with the two blockchains, there are still challenges. The biggest hurdle is coming up with one data format to work between all the networks.If this sounds forward-looking, Benet’s long-term vision is much stranger, and revolved around the ‘interplanetary’ in the protocol’s name.“Yes, we mean it,” Benet said, noting the team is working on versions of today’s most popular applications available over IPFS in time for people to travel to Mars.“By the time SpaceX sends the first people to Mars – or NASA if it’s them – we want people to be able to use their normal computer applications there so that they have a good internet experience,” he said.The idea is an homage to computer scientist and internet pioneer JCR Licklider, who directed ARPANet, one of the precursors to the internet, Benet said. In one of his early memos, the word internet is actually short for ‘Intergalactic network’.“He had this crazy vision of all these computers hooked up together and this network of networks, and then he wanted to extend it to the whole galaxy,” Benet said.IPFS is then an extension of Licklider’s original vision, one that cryptocurrency and other blockchain technology have expanded on by added immutability and permanence of data.For now, however, it’s watch and wait as the idea tries to stand the test of time.Earth network image via IPFS"

engineering Silvio Micali, pointing to bitcoin and its industrial mining 
pools as ...","Apr 10, 2017 at 11:00 UTC",,"On the first day of the Financial Cryptography and Data Security conference in Malta, an academic with a cryptography career spanning three decades ended his keynote with a caution.Incentives should be used as a last resort, said MIT professor of engineering Silvio Micali, pointing to bitcoin and its industrial mining pools as an example of what can go wrong when people find ways to make money that nobody could have predicted.But not everyone shares that view on incentives.Fast forward to the Workshop on Trusted Smart Contracts at the tail end of the conference, and another keynote address.This time, the speaker is someone with no formal background in cryptography. Yet, his success in creating one of the world’s largest blockchains, second only to bitcoin, is hard to ignore.As he spoke to the audience, Vitalik Buterin, the creator of ethereum, argued that, not only do incentives play a key role in securing the blockchain, they are also the reason bitcoin soared to success when decades of previous attempts at peer-to-peer currency failed.With that, he launched into a discussion on smart contracts and mechanism design that in some ways contrasted with, but in other ways built on, what Micali had said at the event.Simply put, mechanism design is a field at the crossroads of game theory and economics that looks at how incentives can be used to achieve favorable outcomes. In the blockchain world, that means getting people to play by the rules.But, as anyone who has followed the discussions on consensus algorithms knows, this is an incredibly difficult thing to do.It also underscores the onerous job ethereum is up against as it designs a proof-of-stake system to replace the existing proof-of-work protocol that underlies its own blockchain.So, it is no surprise Buterin is thinking so much about mechanism design and its impact on the stability of blockchains, and particularly on his smart contracts platform, ethereum.One way to look at mechanism design, Buterin said, is through a framework of what he called ‘crypto-economics’, a term he credits his colleague Vlad Zamfir for coining. Buterin went on to explain how cryptography and economic incentives come together to play a critical role in keeping a blockchain secure.Cryptography, he explained, allows users to prove properties of messages in the past. For example, digital signatures allow you to authorize messages, hash chains let you prove one message came before another and zero-knowledge proofs preserve privacy.Buterin told attendees:“You can use all of these [cryptographic] tools basically to prove things that happened in the past according to a certain set of rules.”In contrast, economic incentives, he said, guarantee that the desired properties of a blockchain will continue into the future.Further, the idea of combing cryptography with economic incentives was Satoshi Nakamoto’s real stroke of genius, he said, and the reason why bitcoin has become so “large and successful”.Buterin went on to describe the two “layers” of a blockchain: a bottom layer that consists of a consensus algorithm and an upper layer that includes things like smart contracts, gadgets and channels, like Lightning Network.‘Gadget’ was another new term that Buterin defined as a “mechanism that gets used by other mechanisms”. One example of a gadget would be an oracle, which a smart contract uses to access information from the outside world.As the ethereum creator explained, there are two ways to look at the smart contract layer: one way is to assume the bottom consensus layer works fine and view both layers as separate; another way is to analyze attacks on both layers simultaneously.And, it is entirely possible, Buterin said, for an attack in the smart contract layer to permeate down to the consensus layer.The rest of Buterin’s talk focused on the various attacks that can happen at the smart contracts layer and how incentives work to secure the blockchain.But while incentives, as Buterin argued, may have led to bitcoin’s $20bn market cap, one has to wonder, if bitcoin’s success is also leading it to a kind of slow demise.Arguably, incentives in bitcoin have led to a non-stop arms race and turned the issue of scaling into a civil war that threatens to split the community.It is clear Buterin and his team are working hard to get away from mining by planning a switch to proof of stake. But the question that comes to mind is, does proof of work present the danger – or does that threat lie more inherently in incentives, as Micali pointed to?Because, if incentives are the problem, ethereum may be veering from one path, only to venture down the dark corridor of another.And, if incentives are not the problem, than Algorand, the proof-of-stake system that Micali is designing to have no incentives (if he can pull it off), may stagnate and never get off the ground.Chess game image via Shutterstock.

Now, Brave is expanding that service with the launch of a new ethereum-based digital advertising platform built from the ground up, to be backed not by gold, or mining power, but its users’ attention.Notably, perhaps, it’s not just Brave that will be able to use the platform, as its code will be published on Github and made available under an open-source license.The digital token that fuels the network is called a Basic Attention Token (or BAT), and is scheduled to be released later this year in a sort of ‘air-drop’ to those signing up, as well being apportioned to investors and the Brave team.According to Brave founder Brendan Eich, approximately 70% of the total amount of available coins will be sold to investors. Tentatively, 15% of the tokens will then be given to Brave with a six-months lockup, and the remaining 15% will be give to users as a “one-time initial grant.”“We’re trying to re-monetize user attention,” said Brave founder Brendan Eich in conversation with CoinDesk, adding:“Which is to say, we’re trying to price user attention into the market from the beginning.”Further, Eich said that, with the token launch, Brave intends to “actually give users a take; we stake them with tokens almost like a mini basic-income grant”.Rolled out in phases, the Basic Attention Token is designed to cut out third-party advertisers that create data-heavy browsing experiences and slow down search and download times, while fueling an ecosystem of transactions between users, publishers and advertisers.A white paper published discreetly yesterday describes how cutting out the middlemen can lead to new efficiencies for each of the participants, and potentially expanded margins for the business counterparties.Already, Brave has been testing that theory since October of last year by letting its users pay publishers they like in bitcoin in exchange for the ad-free browsing experience.The browser was initially publicly attacked by members of traditional media for its promise to block their ads. But, last year, Eich went on a road trip in an attempt to reposition the product as a way to regain ad revenue that was already being lost to other services.Publishers can follow a few steps to prove they manage a website that creates original content and, in exchange, collect bitcoin their users have set aside for them. But the Brave Ledger itself, which underlies the browser, remains a centralized component of the user experience.The ledger provides a cryptographically protected way to measure user engagement within the browser without divulging a user’s personal information. At the end of each month, bitcoin is doled out to the top-five most visited sites based on the browser’s preference.By integrating the service with an ethereum-based network, Eich says Brave will take the first steps towards completely decentralizing the offering.“Over time you can move from the centralized Brave browser to a decentralized system,” he said.As a result of launching BAT on the ethereum network, rather than the Brave ledger, is that it will be open source, meaning anyone will be able to build on it.At the time of the initial roll-out of version 1.0, a BAT wallet will be integrated with the Brave browser, with verification and transactions handled by the company’s own ledger.Later versions will fully transfer the verification process to ethereum, making it more difficult for the browser to be shut down.Although Brave is still, in effect, a middle-man – taking a share of the ad revenue – publishing the code to its Github page has the potential to lead to an ecosystem of ethereum-based browsers and other products based on attention that pay out micro-transactions in a variety of ways.But the process of moving to ethereum does not amount to an endorsement of the network’s underlying token. Instead, Eich says Brave payments will continue to support bitcoin, and other currencies might one day, too, be added.“Bitcoin is under some stress and ethereum is a wild ride,” said Eich. “We don’t want to pick a winner here.”To facilitate the open-source, blockchain agnostic paradigm, Eich says his team is currently exploring using Zcash’s cross-chain atomic transactions (XCAT) – a feature expected to be rolled out in the near future and being designed to let multiple blockchain interact.Eich concluded:“We know that there can be multiple choices here, we think there’s going to be evolution and convergance. Down the road we don’t know what the world looks like, but I would say blockchains, smart contracts, private protocols that look like blockchains.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Brave.Laptop image via Shutterstock"

From infrastructure provider the DTCC, which conducts quadrillions of dollars worth of transactions each year, to legacy bank Citi, valued at $171bn, an enterprise blockchain track brought together a host of incumbents who have been active playing innovator.Following shortly on the tail of news that Citi and Nasdaq have been running a live blockchain powered by Chain technology, Ian Lee, head of Citi’s Global Lab Network, publicly discussed the importance of collaboration among incumbents.Lee told the audience:“Partnerships have been integral to our strategy from the very beginning. They have accelerated our efforts and helped us bring products to market in a short period of time.“Lee recounted the history of Citi Venture’s blockchain work, which kicked off in 2015 with a partnership with Ideo to help create the Collab idea incubation facility. Lee credited this early move as leading to the business relationships that culminated today.Yet, Lee put into perspective how this journey was not taken in isolation. He projects the number of blockchain proof-of-concepts has risen to 240 in 2016, up from 56 in 2015. At the same time, he tried to quantify the number of consortia engaged in this work, speculating the number has increased to 25, from just three a few years ago.Elsewhere, panelists from the DTCC discussed the creation of what they termed “minimum viable networks” that could showcase blockchain efficiencies.In January, the DTCC revealed that IBM was helping build a platform to settle $11tn worth of credit derivatives using technology created by blockchain startup Axoni, and overseen by distributed ledger consortium R3. This is in spite of the fact that IBM, Axoni and R3 all have their own blockchain solutions.As a result of their ability to work well together, DTCC chief technology architect Rob Palatnick said he expects the solution to go live in the first quarter of 2018, triggering savings for many of the clients actually using the DTCC framework.Palatnick said:“Instead of just taking 25% out of DTCC’s cost, we could take 25% of the entire industry costs.”In a twist on the idea of what a minimum viable network might look like, “Big Four” accounting firm PwC revealed more details about its work to make cryptocurrencies more palatable for big banks.Launched in November 2016, PwC’s Project Vulcan is also a collaborative effort between a number of startups with little more in common that that they serve complimentary parts of what its leaders believe will help lay the foundation for wide-spread use of cryptocurrencies.Initially focused on using public blockchains such those that power the bitcoin and ethereum, the collaborators including infrastructure provider Bloq, auditing firm Libra and identity platform Netki, are now working with a bank to build out a private blockchain solution.Instead of building solutions from scratch for bridging banks and cryptocurrency products, PwC’s Robert Allen, the co-founder of Project Vulcan, formally now as Vulcan Digital Asset Services, recommended that the audience to use a “plug and play” solution to integrate their existing data into a blockchain.As such, the presentation served to underscore the theme of the day – startups and enterprises need to work together, both among themselves and with each other.Image of sandbox via Shutterstock"

Specifically, the US market was selected for its size and complexity; Singapore was identified as a possible growth market for Standard Chartered; and Kenya was chosen for its unusual regulatory requirements around dispersals.While London-based Standard Chartered has long been a leader in the blockchain sector, most recently announcing plans to launch a cross border payments platform powered by blockchain, this is one of AIG’s first public forays into the industry.Over the past few months, insurance has become a heated space for blockchain innovation, with three new firms joining the blockchain insurance consortium B3i and Shanghai Insurance Exchange and nine other partners completing a test focused on this application.Ultimately, project participants were optimistic about the test and what it hints at for this blockchain use case going forward.The general manager of IBM Blockchain, Marie Wieck, said in a statement:“There is tremendous opportunity to apply advancements in blockchain technology to transform the insurance industry.”AIG image via Flickr"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Jun 17, 2017 at 10:08 UTC",Ethereum wants to create an ecosystem where everything works together seamlessly as part of its vision for a ‘world computer‘ – and that includes the tokens required to power it.,"Launched in 2014 by a band of coders and an upstart teenager, ethereum was designed to make it possible for anyone to code nearly any type of app and deploy that on a blockchain. Many of these decentralized apps (or ‘dapps’ for short) needed their own token that could, among other things, be sold and traded easily.To that end, nearly 18 months ago, the ERC-20 token standard was born.It’s hard to overstate how important that interface has been. By defining a common set of rules for ethereum-based tokens to adhere to, ERC-20 allows developers of wallets, exchanges and other smart contracts, to know in advance how any new token based on the standard will behave.This way, they can design their apps to work with these tokens out of the box, without having to reinvent the wheel each time a new token system comes along.As a result, almost all of the major tokens on the ethereum blockchain today, including those sold in the recent surge of ethereum-based initial coin offerings (ICOs), are ERC-20 compliant.Before delving deeper, it’s important to spell out what a token actually is and how it differs from ether, the native currency driving the ethereum blockchain.As they relate to the ethereum network, tokens are digital assets that can represent anything from loyalty points to vouchers and IOUs to actual objects in the physical world. Tokens can also be tools, such as in-game items, for interacting with other smart contracts.But put simply, a token is nothing more than a smart contract running on top of the ethereum blockchain. As such, it is a set of code (functions) with an associated database. The code describes the behavior of the token, and the database is basically a table with rows and columns tracking who owns how many tokens.If a user or another smart contract within ethereum sends a message to that token’s contract in the form of a ‘transaction,’ the code updates its database.So, for instance, when a wallet app sends a message to a token’s contract to transfer funds from Alice to Bob, this happens:In contrast to tokens, ether is hard coded into the ethereum blockchain. It is sold and traded as a cryptocurrency, and it also powers the ethereum network by allowing users to pay for smart contract transaction fees. (All computations on the ethereum network have a ‘gas’ cost.)When you send tokens to an exchange, for example, you pay for that transaction (in this case, a request to the token’s contract to update its database) in ether. This payment is then collected by a miner who confirms the transaction in a block, which then gets added to the blockchain.Early on in ethereum’s history, standards were part of the overall plan to create a user friendly and broadly accessible system. But like all standards, ERC-20 took time to evolve over a series of long discussions and careful considerations.So, sometime before DevCon1, the first big ethereum conference in 2015, Vitalik Buterin, the founder of ethereum, introduced the initial standards token.Later that year, Fabian Vogelsteller, one of the developers working on ethereum’s Mist wallet, took that standard, changed a few things, and proposed it to the community as ERC-20 to initiate a formal conversation around how the standard should be implemented.Then in April, due to changes in how the Ethereum Foundation was organizing its GitHub, the ERC-20 standard was moved to a Github pull request.ERC-20 defines a set of six functions that other smart contracts within the ethereum ecosystem will understand and recognize.These include, for instance, how to transfer a token (by the owner or on behalf of the owner) and how to access data (name, symbol, supply, balance) about the token. The standard also describes two events – signals that a smart contract can fire – that other smart contracts ‘listen’ for.Together, these functions and events make ethereum tokens work the same almost everywhere within the ethereum ecosystem. As a result, nearly all wallets that support ether, including Jaxx, MyEtherWallet.com and Ethereum Wallet (also called Mist Wallet), now also support ERC-20 compliant tokens.
According to Vogelsteller, who spoke to CoinDesk about the importance of ethereum’s token standard, this interoperability lays the groundwork for big changes to come.He said:“I believe we are just at the beginning of tokenizing everything. Maybe in the future, you will be able to buy a share of the chair you are sitting on, the paint inside your house or a fraction of equity in a huge building complex.”One thing to keep in mind, though, is that ERC-20 is formally a draft, meaning it is not being enforced and still needs to be fully blessed by the ethereum community. Regardless, Vogelsteller said, every new token will likely conform to its set of rules.He cautioned, however, that the standard is still young, so there will be bumps in the road. One of those bumps is that sending tokens directly to a token’s smart contract will result in a loss of money. That is because a token’s contract only tracks and allocates money. When you send tokens to another user from a wallet, for example, that wallet calls on the token’s contract to update the database.As a result, if you attempt to transfer tokens directly to a token’s contract, the money is ‘lost’ since the token’s contract cannot respond.So far, $70,000 worth of tokens have been lost in this manner. (The amount varies depending on the market price of ether.)But solutions are in the works. As an extension to ERC-20, ERC-223 attempts to resolve the issue by suggesting a token’s contract implement a tokenFallback function to prevent the contract from holding tokens sent directly to it accidentally.Vogelsteller argued this is all just part of developing a solid system, though, saying:“Driving with these prototypes can be rocky at times, but ultimately they provide the necessary learning that will bring us to the future of blockchain and smart contract interactions.”Question mark image via Shutterstock "

bitcoin and ethereum are still murky, the claim was big news. US law ...","Apr 30, 2017 at 12:50 UTC","When first contacting CoinDesk, the team behind a movie called “Braid” had big news to share.","Unlike your traditional crowdfunding model, used by the likes of Kickstarter or Indiegogo, the goal of the project was to let a global pool of buyers both crowdfund and profit from the movie. Among the tools at their disposal were ethereum, a global blockchain platform, and WeiFund, a new crowdfunding platform built on top of this emerging technology.Mitzi Peirone, the director of Braid, heralded the solution as one that would make crowdfunded movies – by the fans, for the fans – more democratic.“A Kickstarter movie could go on to make millions of dollars and the people that gave money in the first place wouldn’t see a return,” she said.Further, there were implications for the blockchain sector and its practices.According to producer Logan Steinhardt, the token was to be unique – not only in that it represented a stake in a movie, but that it was to be the first one issued by a US company in “full legal compliance with applicable regulations”.At a time when regulations surrounding popular blockchain platforms like bitcoin and ethereum are still murky, the claim was big news. US law firm Perkins Coie, the team said, had even worked on the structure.Steinhardt said:“We think that this may open the floodgates for similar structures for all types of crowdsales.”And then came the regulatory hurdles.Eventually, when opportunities to participate in the crowdfunded movie finally become available on WeiFund (designed by blockchain firm ConsenSys), the offering will be a bit different than described.Backers will still receive a tradeable token as part of a revenue sharing model, but it will only be available to non-US investors. As it stands, WeiFund still isn’t a fully fledged crowdfunding platform, and current regulations mean that WeiFund has to jump through some hoops to make this work.Part of the reason for this is uncertainty around blockchain and its use in crowdfunding.While there are some US-based seed investors who have participated privately, they will not be issued any tokens. The token sale for Braid, which hopes to raise $1.25m, will rely on international backers alone.Still, the campaign will adhere to Regulation S of the Securities Act, permitting sales to international investors, which was the “easiest and quickest path” to compliance, Lowell Ness, partner Perkins Coie, explained.“We didn’t have time to get WeiFund set up with the SEC as a crowdfunding portal. This is a new process and can take 4–6 months. We’re working on that for future offerings by WeiFund,” he said.Another issue is how the specific funding for the movie was designed.While some cryptographic tokens are made to function as digital commodity akin to bitcoin, others need to be structured like traditional investment offerings.“This token is inherently designed to give people the benefit like a security would give them, this right to profit, this right to revenue, so it is a very unique structure,” Matt Corva, legal counsel for ConsenSys, told CoinDesk.The whole narrative, however, illustrates the current difficulties in unlocking token sales as a funding mechanism for startups and projects – even movies.The campaign, put together by a team of lawyers at ConsenSys and Perkins Coie, aimed to fit the idea for Braid’s offering within regulations that could serve as a guide to other companies for running compliant crowdfunding, albeit with new tools.Crowdfunding, for example, is governed by Regulation CF and requires an intermediary to assist the issuer. Previously, this intermediary needed to be a registered broker-dealer, and while no longer the case, the new rules still require this intermediary to register with the SEC and FINRA.Ness describes this effort as offering a sort of light version of a broker-dealer, where WeiFund is building a system for verifying accredited investors that use the service.“You will see that forthcoming on future launches in which we do target the US market in depth,” added Corva. WeiFund is tight-lipped on when these other sales will begin, but revealed there are a few in the pipeline in the coming “weeks to months”.But, why go through all this effort? Those involved believe it could usher in a new way to pay for creative works.All revenue generated by the film, plus 15% interest, will be paid back to investors until they make their original investment back. Targeting $1.25m via the crowdsale, the first $1.43m goes straight to investors. Beyond that, 30% of revenue will go to token holders.Once the film starts to generate this revenue, this money will be pooled into an account and deposited into a cryptocurrency exchange. These funds will be either converted into ether, the token on the ethereum platform, or a US dollar token.And while it didn’t go off without a hitch this time, those involved see the ethereum blockchain – and WeiFund specifically – as something that could come to have an impact beyond entertainment.“Right now, we’re in a pretty critical stage where we’re between our service model, servicing these independent crowdsales, not as a platform but as a crowdsale provider,” said Nick Dodson, one of the main developers behind WeiFund.Dodson added:“These sales like the ones for Braid are a step toward a broader platform, but right now we’re in a service model.”Currently Braid is in a “soft-prep period” and will begin shooting in June with the aim of having a cut ready by fall.But those involved are optimistic about the funding.“I think this is going to be revolutionary for independent filmmakers out there,” said Peirone, adding:“This kind of financing system will really open up the doors for people.”Camera repair image via Shutterstock"

advantage in scale both of payments and the applications that can ...","Apr 18, 2017 at 09:30 UTC",Trond Vidar Bjorøy heads new product development and implementation for Nordic markets at travel management firm ATPI.,"In this opinion piece, Vidar Bjorøy argues that blockchain can eliminate a number of pain points for both travellers and travel companies. At this point, most blockchain enthusiasts know that distributed ledger tech has potential beyond fintech. Yet, one industry that hasn’t seen much attention from those enthusiasts is the travel industry. And it’s one that deals regularly with a number of pain points that blockchain technology has the potential to solve.Here are some of the more notable issues and how blockchain could help:Everyone saw that man get dragged off a United Airline’s flight last week, right?Blockchain’s ability to prevent double spending could in theory remove the problem of double bookings in the industry, which would hopefully (for both passengers and airlines) eliminate instances like this from happening.It should be noted, though, that overbooking is very much a part of a decades-old strategy to increase profits and optimize resources, so unless the practice is made illegal, it might not be the use case that will drive widespread adoption of blockchain in the travel industry.Merchants that sell travel are typically seen as high risk because of the amount of refunds and chargebacks that occur in the industry.But with blockchain, once a payment has been made, typically you can’t reverse it. And this mechanism will make fraudulent cases easier to spot and less likely to occur.Blockchain could also ease PCI DSS compliance (a credit card security standard), at least for travel management companies and other incumbents in the space.In a blockchain-enabled world where cardholder data is no longer stored in corporate databases and instead stored on a distributed network, along with the booking transactions – to whom does PCI apply? Probably the companies that develop the solutions that will let travel companies store our sensitive data on the network.A big part of the world’s population is excluded and disconnected from the global economy today.Decentralization through crypto-economies will enable billions of people to get access to basic financial services, connecting them with the rest of the world. And to give everyone in the world the opportunity to travel, consumers need a means of proving their identity, one that is impossible to forge or change. This could be provided through access to reputation-based identity systems.Even though there are identity systems in use for authentication today, like federated identity and social login, you can’t easily build on them to pull in data from many sources or use the attributes that you want when you want them – unless you integrate with every party.Decentralized identity systems are here to fix that.As a trusted individual with a reputation guaranteed by the blockchain, you could say goodbye to waiting in lines, TSA and obtrusive checking of personal details.While blockchain is very much about moving values, it’s also about handling and securing data in better ways.In travel, user profile security and privacy have always been hot topics. When a company enters into an agreement with a travel management company (TMC), airline or other supplier, the company usually needs to give that supplier access to employee data so they are able to provide the expected service.Whether that process is manual or automated, building a well-functioning profiling process takes time and effort and creates friction on both sides.If employees had their information on the blockchain, this could remove much of the pain on both sides. The companies wouldn’t have to build new API connections between the supplier’s profile database and the buyer’s HR system for every new implementation. And manual profile workflows would become history.There’d be no need for employees to create user accounts with multiple suppliers, duplicating their information along with thousands of other users on systems that stand the risk of being breached. Nor would they have to adopt every new supplier’s user interface.Instead, there’d be just one unified profile available to those explicitly given access.Among the more obvious improvements we will see from the blockchain is the ability to move money faster.Many fintech innovations – the removal of middlemen and their fees, money transfers in real-time, instant settlement, streamlined and continuous auditing – will benefit the travel industry as well.By now we’ve probably all heard about the promises of interoperable loyalty programs: instant credit, exchanging points, transferring points between friends, receiving personal promotions, converting points into cryptocurrency.But what about buying a flight ticket with points that you earned from flying with a competing airline?When traveling, I’m not a very loyal person. I just want to enjoy the best offers I can at any time so this setup is perfect for me and multiple other travellers that aren’t loyal to one airline.But could this become a predicament for the loyalty program owners? Maybe. But we might also see models emerge where participating businesses unite forces to meet these traveler expectations.TMCs today have a role as the gatekeeper, there to help corporates stay compliant.But what if blockchain could take over this responsibility?Imagine the company travel manager receiving real-time alerts for policy breaches that are about to happen. Whenever an employee is trying to book a trip outside the correct channel, a direct two-way communication channel is set up between the travel manager and the, knowingly or not, disloyal employee.Or perhaps we’ll see a paradigm shift in managed travel and booking behaviour.Remember open booking? Perhaps the blockchain with its potential for unmatched transparency, security and privacy will be the enabler of this promised model for the future of managed travel. Book where you want as long as it’s within policy. Your travel data still gets collected, consolidated and made available to you, instantly.With blockchain, it’s easy to foresee how risk management systems could be granted access to a traveler’s location at any time.The travel manager, looking at the map of her employees’ whereabouts, would see this update whenever a new reservation gets created, modified or cancelled, plus when a traveller boards the plane, checks in at the hotel or starts the rental car. Or perhaps the system doesn’t use reservation details for traveller tracking, but instead receives real-time updates from an IoT-enabled device.Health records stored on the blockchain network could also aid a traveller in need of medical help.Smart contract transactions are executed in autonomous software code, not law.If we look at a legal contract or a business agreement, it’s basically the same as code – a series of if-then statements.For example:Hotel A enters an agreement with TMC B with a clause saying that for the next six months, room nights booked more than seven days in advance will give a higher commission than those booked later. With today’s model, both parties would sign a contract. When the period ends, both the TMC and hotel might have to run reports to identify the total number of online bookings from the TMC, or they use some commission consolidation service to document it for them.Eventually, the correct commission amount gets paid out, although this takes time and effort, plus there might be middlemen involved in the process taking their piece of the pie.What if all that was programmed into a smart contract?There are obviously many benefits to this, including cost savings with the removal of intermediaries (lawyers, notaries, brokers, etc), time savings from cutting down business processes and the trust achieved from storing documents encrypted on a shared ledger.For now, it helps knowing how to code if you want to build smart contracts, but there are currently visual editors that help write and deploy smart contracts for you. Eventually tools will come that enable any business role to create smart contracts.Will we see a predominance of permissioned and private blockchains in our industry as the big incumbents try to evolve and maintain their power?  We’re already good at closed ecosystems, so this could be the next natural step in that direction.On the other hand, perhaps the very nature of the blockchain – the more open and public you keep it, the faster more nodes can connect to it, and the bigger, stronger and more secure your network gets – could actually be what this industry needs to really disrupt itself?There are initiatives that seek to enable connectivity between different blockchains, building an ‘internet of blockchains’, if you will, so there’s hope of seeing large-scale systems that open up for collaboration even if the industry should go down the route of private networks.However, both public and private blockchains have advantages in the travel industry.The established public blockchains, such as bitcoin and ethereum, have an advantage in scale both of payments and the applications that can be built on them, compared to the newer alternatives. Newer and smaller blockchains, on the other hand, will have an easier task achieving the network-wide consensus required to make strategic changes to the protocol.I’m hoping, although I’m not yet fully convinced, that blockchain will revolutionize the travel industry. After all, we’re talking about an industry where fax is an indispensable part of many business processes and where 40-year old tech dominates distribution.Lost luggage via Shutterstock"

We plan to continue to test the technology, by including more data attributes, for example. And we will continue to test how we can use it to improve food traceability and transparency by collaborating with others throughout the supply chain. This means farmers and suppliers and other retailers.”Walmart explained that the technology has helped it reduced the time it takes to track food from days to minutes, enabling more effective response in the event that tainted products are discovered.“This will help enable precise and rapid recalls to preserve consumer trust in the food industry, while increasing traceability and transparency of the food system,” the firm said.Image Credit: Zhao jian kang / Shutterstock.com"

cryptocurrencies is beginning to pick up interest in the world's largest 
institutions.","May 9, 2017 at 12:15 UTC","You might not expect someone at the European Central Bank (ECB), the institution that manages monetary policy and oversees financial market infrastructure for the 28-member European Union, to be interested or even passionate about blockchain tech.","But, Dirk Bullmann, fintech coordinator and adviser to the director general of the ECB, is evidence of how the technology that originally powered bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is beginning to pick up interest in the world’s largest institutions. Not only is Bullmann’s mandate to explore distributed ledgers, but he’s leading a team actively seeking to identify ways to use the tech to enhance the ECB’s services.This isn’t to say that Bullmann has bought into the idea that blockchain is disruptive, or that one day the ECB will go so far as to issue its own cryptocurrency. Rather, he thinks it will mark a “fascinating” change in how the world exchanges assets, one he believes could enhance, if not redefine, existing financial processes.But despite a recognition of the opportunity, he said there isn’t competitive interest driving central bank’s intrigue in utilizing blockchain.Bullmann told CoinDesk:“In the future, even in the vision of a peer-to-peer world, there’s always a role for the central bank. There’s no race between central banks, we work together.”To this end, the ECB launched a joint initiative with Japan’s central bank in December. Announced by executive board member Yves Mersch, the two institutions resolved to explore the tech and release their findings.Bullmann’s task now is to coordinate with the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to explore topics such as how financial market participants could send payments using the technology, prioritizing how a certain payment might be cleared, for instance.Yet, like other enterprises, the ECB is also looking for faster ways to test how blockchain could be applied to newer markets, ones that don’t disrupt or interfere with established practices and working processes. For example, Bullmann’s group is exploring how DLT could be used in its new securities clearance platform T2S, a system designed to make it easier for financial institutions to issue securities meant to cross borders.“We are currently exploring the idea to offer an issuance service for certain supranational debt securities in the European Union, and we are testing if DLT could potentially be used to offer specific aspects of such a service,” Bullmann said.Central securities depositories (CSDs) that participate in T2S today can effectively pool their securities so they can be bought and sold by investors across Europe. Since some technology would need to be selected in standardizing the issuance, Bullmann said DLT was a natural candidate for testing.“It allows us to further explore the potential benefits of this technology, and at the same time, see whether it could be used efficiently and safely. It’s more of a proof of concept,” he said.Initially designed to help bridge the boundaries between different national institutions, it’s perhaps not a surprise that DLT is being considered for T2S. Applying the technology to this type of project makes sense when also considering the ECB’s drive to harmonize Europe’s differing financial markets.Further, the idea has been broached by other institutions, with Standard Chartered publishing a 2016 report in which it asked whether DLT could threaten or replace T2S.The ECB first hinted it could pursue a strategy whereby it examined DLT opportunities as a market operator in a December statement, though it confirmed to CoinDesk trials are actively underway.“Our goal is a single financial market in Europe where the markets over time harmonized technical, business, legal, taxation issues, and this is what we analyze before we implement a new service,” Bullmann said.The idea is that systems like T2S, which was launched in 2015 and will onboard its final wave of CSD members some time in 2017, will make institutions more interoperable. And Bullmann said there’s a broader interest in how DLT could have an impact on this goal.Yet, T2S offers a baby step into implementing DLT more extensively within the ECB. This is especially important when noting the ECB’s worry, which was highlighted in its most recent annual report, that the technology is too immature to use in highly complex financial systems.In the past, the ECB has opined as to whether DLT would serve this purpose, or “introduce a new layer of fragmentation” as outlined in an April 2016 report on the technology.As for its work with partners, the ECB said it’s more about determining if existing service levels and requirements on safety and efficiency can be met by distributed ledger tech.Bullmann pointed out that much of the work is focused on modeling payment exchanges between member institutions via smart contracts, or self-executing blockchain-based code.The idea is that by doing so, liquidity could be improved in markets.“In our payment system, you can qualify a payment with a priority as normal, urgent or highly urgent, and there are specific features in the system that makes sure that the payments are settled according to their priority,” Bullmann explained.He said this work is serving as the starting point for the banks, one that finds the organization dedicating a three-person team to cooperating in a test environment.“The test environment is not entirely comparable to real-life conditions, but this is the starting point of whether the functionalities could meet existing service levels and high requirements on safety and efficiency,” he said.For all the positioning, though, Bullmann is reluctant to make any predictions about where the technology will head, dismissing this as “speculation”.“I sometimes have the impression that the discussion around DLT is driven by the desire just to implement new technology. But, the approach we follow is, first we look at the services our market participants want and the market players need. The question of which technology to use comes in a subsequent step,” he said.Bullmann reported having conversations with various market participants who were moving to implement specific DLT use cases, and given those conversations, he suggested the ECB is currently moving in line with the market by analyzing specific, new use cases.Despite the ECB being one of the more vocal institutions on the subject, Bullmann isn’t ready to compare the work done by those abroad. For now, Bullmann said the approach of the ECB, and its peers, is to study, collaborate and assess.Bullmann concluded:“If the market moves to DLT relatively quickly, we have to make sure that the DLT world could smoothly interact with our world.”ECB sign via Shutterstock"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Mar 30, 2017 at 09:59 UTC","A project set up last year by Sweden’s land registry authority, the Lantmäteriet, to trial blockchain technology for recording property deals has just moved to its second phase.","Conducted by blockchain startup ChromaWay and consultancy group Kairos Future, the initiative is also working in partnership with two banks: SBAB and Landshypotek.“It could be a great benefit for economic growth,” said ChromaWay CEO Henrik Hjelte on the project’s potential, further arguing that Sweden is the ideal place to test a blockchain system for land titles, as trust in public authorities is high and could influence agencies elsewhere to follow suit.Under the proposed system, a buyer and seller would open a contract where banks and the land registry can view the workflow of the deal, such as due dates for payments.“In the blockchain confirmation of each step in the workflow is made with a hash, like the blockchain normally,” said Magnus Kempe of Kairos Future, adding: “Everyone has the same information and you can check it yourself.”Another use example is verifying the existence of the IOU issued by the bank to the property buyer.“That part is going to be hidden for the others in the contract. You will only have the hash confirming from the bank that the IOU has been signed,” said Kempe.The newly entered second phase involves examining how the technology can be integrated with banks’ existing processes when verifying contracts. The firms indicated that ChromaWay’s platform won’t be handling any payments on the system – those will remain separate.SBAB Bank however said it has no immediate plans to implement the tech, saying:“Our reason to participate in the project has not been to actually implement the solution in our current processes. But rather an opportunity for us to get a better understanding of the blockchain technology and how it might possibly fit in our future products/offerings.”There remains one major hurdle to fully integrating this blockchain system for selling a house from start to finish.“We want to work fully digitally, but the law requires, at the moment, physical signatures on the papers, which makes it difficult,” explained Kempe.While trust in digital contracts has been lagging for a long time, he argued that blockchain tech can now provide the trust needed to move forward.“As soon as the legislator understands that this is possible, I think it will come true,” said Kempe.Helping that process, the EU passed a directive in 2016 that puts more weight behind digital signatures and could eventually influence Swedish policy.For now, the land registry project is looking at ways of working around the issue. Kempe said:“Actually, the land registry today, they don’t receive much physical paper, they get PDFs of the contracts which are signed electronically so they don’t store the physical contracts. What we are thinking of is, you can actually sign the contract digitally in the blockchain to the land registry, they can award the land titles and then you can throw away the paper so you’re not dependent on the physical archive.”ChromaWay and Kairos Future said that they have been approached by more than a dozen public authorities from other countries expressing interest in the project.The team explained that they don’t hold any patents for the platform, preferring to see other organizations work on similar schemes, eventually leading to more collaboration.Sweden’s testing of the blockchain for land titles is possibly the most ambitious application of the technology in real estate thus far. Others are working on the concept, however. Early last year, the land registry authorities in Eurasian nation Georgia began working with blockchain startup BitFury, which, in February, signed a memorandum of understanding to extend the tests to other government agencies.According to ChromaWay’s Henrik Hjelte, the use of blockchain could be transformative for developing countries in managing ownership of property and improving transparency in real estate sales.On the other hand, proof-of-concept tests in Honduras were put on the back-burner in late 2015 over an apparent breakdown in communications between the government and Factom, the company that was supposed to conduct the trials.ChromaWay and Kairos Future are confident about the future, though. Kempe said:“There’s very little reason to think that this won’t work.”Sweden image via Shutterstock"

Today, the company released a white paper outlining its strategy for Kin, how it will be integrated into the app and how it hopes to create a wider ecosystem for buying and selling digital services.The Canada-based company, which has raised over $120m in VC funding, said the cryptocurrency will “combat the monopolization” of digital services where a large companies exert more and more control over digital services.“These companies are the only ones with enough scale to effectively monetize through advertising,” said Ted Livingston, CEO of Kik, arguing this makes it difficult for independent developers to monetize their services.He told CoinDesk:“We think this is leading to a future for consumers and for society that has less choice, less innovation and ultimately less freedom.”Some of the inspiration for the new token stems from Kik Points, a rewards system for users to access certain features inside the messaging app, but, Livingston said, the firm has been looking at the idea of a cryptocurrency since 2011.Kik has now outlined multiple steps it will take for the creation of Kin and its ecosystem.It will launch a token sale for the first Kin later in the summer and begin integrating the cryptocurrency into the Kik app where users buy and sell features and services like stickers, the use of bots and group chat hosting.“It will also give Kin value on the public exchanges,” the CEO said. His company ultimately wants to spread Kin beyond its own app and create a decentralized ecosystem, using Kin, for all digital services.To support these aims, the company will establish an independent non-profit called the Kin Foundation later this year or early next year. The organization will oversee the fair and open growth of the ecosystem, and further manage the Kin Rewards Engine, a financial incentive program to encourage uptake of the cryptocurrency and foster the ecosystem’s growth.Livingston explained:“Every day, a certain amount of Kin will be given out to all the owners of the digital services proportional to the number of transactions that they drive in their particular digital service relative to the overall ecosystem.”A game developer, for example, could transact with its players using Kin, and get a payment from the rewards engine. This will create more reason to continue accepting and transacting with the token.“Let’s say you’re creating 10% of all the transactions in the Kin ecosystem, you would get 10% of this daily reward,” Livingston said.The foundation will also serve as an ID service, he added, likening it to a “decentralized Facebook Connect” that allows Kin users to move around the ecosystem:“As a user when I show up to a new digital service, I start using Kin right away in a frictionless yet secure way.”Kik has 15 million monthly active users and with this userbase, the company claims that Kin can become the “most adopted cryptocurrency in the world”.Kik Messenger image via Shutterstock"

Bitcoin in market cap in 2017?” and placed a bet of 10 ether by ...","Apr 5, 2017 at 11:59 UTC",An ethereum prediction market project is moving forward toward its public debut.,"Following its beta launch last fall, Gnosis, now a team of eight, will become the first incubation project of ethereum development firm ConsenSys to spin off into a separate startup, according to co-founder Stefan George and strategist Matt Liston.The firm has further revealed that its token sale (or ICO) is now set for 24th April, with the fundraising target set at $12.5m.If you’re not familiar with the concept, prediction markets are a potentially useful type of betting tool – one proponents say could help forecast future events, such as sports games or political campaign outcomes, to greater societal benefit.Platforms such as Gnosis and Augur aim to help drive the idea forward by experimenting with different decentralized models that can’t be shut down by outside actors. At least, that’s the idea. (It’s worth noting that there has been some debate over the utility of decentralized prediction markets.)George told CoinDesk:“Now Gnosis is becoming it’s own entity. It will still have very strong ties to ConsenSys, but we are now our own company.”The company has now moved its headquarters to Gibraltar in anticipation of the launch.Developers can already build applications on top of the Gnosis platform using a JavaScript library that allows them to communicate with the app’s smart contracts and oracle platform (which pulls in information from the outside world).“It makes it easy to make interfaces for prediction markets,” George explained.One example app from the team lets users broadcast their bets and predictions to Twitter with the help of a bot.The Twitter bot lists all of the market questions on which users can place bets.For example, George scrolled to the question, “Will Ethereum surpass Bitcoin in market cap in 2017?” and placed a bet of 10 ether by responding with the tweet “10 higher ether”.With the help of the self-sovereign identity system uPort, the bot responds with a QR code for the bet, which the user can then harness to finalize the transaction.Though it might seem like an odd idea to broadcast predictions to Twitter, the motive is for users to build alternative interfaces that might make it easier to interact with the platform, or to make their activity more public, if they choose.Admittedly, though, not every participant would want to broadcast their bet to the world. One use case that’s often put forth by prediction market advocates is that the new markets could encourage people with insider information to bet based on little-known information.What’s more, if they know something others don’t, they might place a larger bet.Other than that, apps built on top of Gnosis are already cropping up, such as a sports app. There’s also predART, with which users can valuate art prior to sale at auctions.The team has plenty to juggle with currently, including some unknowns, such as a new token sale structure that will be used to bootstrap the platform.Liston explained that their idea for a “modified Dutch auction” extends the amount of time in which users can purchase tokens. The hope is that it’s not just a few players, or big entities, snapping up all the tokens, say, within the first five minutes, as has been the case for other sales.The idea is to draw the process out, while still preserving a cap on the total number of tokens sold to buyers.As shown in a recent CoinDesk survey, more than 50% of ICO users support the idea of a hard cap on transactions.Tech glow image via Shutterstock"

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Mar 31, 2017 at 12:00 UTC","The last time the folks behind Slock.it needed to raise money they reimagined the way venture capital worked, and in the process raised the largest crowdfunding round in history.","Then everything came tumbling down in one of the most definitive moments of the early years of ethereum: The DAO, and its subsequent failure.Instead of raising a round of traditional venture capital or going to centralized crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo that would have helped the Slock.it founders collect investments in exchange for a fee, the team wrote open-sourced code for decentralized funding platforms based on ethereum that could, in theory, never be shut down.Things did not go as planned, however, and approximately $60m-worth of ether was drained from the The DAO by a hacker. Finally, the lost funds were returned via a controversial hard fork of the ethereum blockchain that resulted in what appears to be a permanent schism in the community.Now, Slock.it has pivoted its business model. In some ways, the goal is even more lofty than before, but in others, namely the way it is raising capital, the polarizing startup has taken a much more conservative approach.Revealed yesterday, a single, unidentified entity is said to have invested a $2m seed round in Slock.it to hire at least five new people and build out a Universal Sharing Network (USN) that uses smart contracts to monetize the Internet of Things (IoT).Slock.it chief operating officer Stephan Tual told CoinDesk:“The smart contracts that we’re going to write as part of the USN are going to be written keeping in mind all the lessons that we’ve learned from The DAO, both in terms of how to write smart contracts, how to keep them safe.”CoinDesk was unable to independently confirm the investment as a result of the conditions of anonymity Tual said surround the investment.But the COO also described a due-diligence process as part of the investment that included the verification of intellectual property ownership, and an ongoing financial auditing process related to how the company is spending funds and what the founders have accomplished.With the new funding, the startup indicated it intends to hire at least one mobile app developer, a software engineer with IoT experience and a business manager to sell products and build relationships with manufacturers of locks, bikes, automobiles and more.Discussions over the investment began in earnest about six months ago, according to Tual, who added that the unnamed investor also wished not to be identified as either a firm or an individual, but that details would likely be revealed as part of a larger unveiling in the future.Tual said:“They wish to conduct their business in a way that will be part of a much greater strategy when it comes to blockchain and other fields.”While it’s been a while since Slock.it was regularly in the headlines, the team has remained active behind the scenes.According to Tual, the company has even been profitable since the collapse of The DAO, and has been charging consulting fees, including for projects such as a ‘Democratic Mobility System‘ for German utility company Innogy SE.The two firms have also partnered with the Oxygen Initiative, EBG Compleo, and Wallbe to build Share&Charge, a sharable charging station set to launch in April on both Apple and Android.However, the revenue generated from the partnerships has not been sufficient to allow the company to build out its own flagship product, the USN –aimed to let users write elaborate leases for a wide range of internet-connected objects, in a similar way to how Airbnb lets users sublet their own property.The startup isn’t only concerned with raising funds, though, and Slock.it CTO Christoph Jentzsch last year revealed his plans for Charity DAO, designed to be a philanthropic implementation of The DAO concept.According to Tual, the team learned lessons from the collapse of The DAO, and will build the resulting improvements into the USN. These include the implementation of what has been described as ‘backdoors’, but which Tual called “escape mechanisms”, designed to cease the execution of a smart contract in certain extreme cases.Panels of “guardians” will also be implemented to help oversee contract credentials and problems with the smart contract compiler or even with the programming language itself.Tual took pains to provide assurance that security was at the top of the development check list, telling CoinDesk:“There’s going to be top-notch security around the stuff and who’s in a better place to do it than [us]?”Prior to the rise of smart contracts, systems engineers tended to embrace the philosophy of ‘fail-fast’, meaning that products should be released early and frequently to test them ‘in the wild’.But, as The DAO perfectly illustrated, the intended immutability of the ethereum blockchain is not compatible with learning as you go.The collapse of The DAO ultimately led to the creation of ‘ethereum classic’, a rival currency to ether, and built up some resentment of the team in the ethereum community.Shortly after the collapse, some leading figures in the space even called for the Slock.it team to be ostracized. However, others did credit the team for sticking around to help pick up the mess that ensued.Tual is pragmatic about the criticisms, and again stressed the lessons the team has learned in areas ranging from building on blockchain more generally, to writing smart contracts and trusting (or not) the compilers that process them.He concluded:“There will always be some people who make trollish comments about stuff online, and that’s the fun of the internet. The reality is there was a huge amount of work that we did to get this project.”Image courtesy of Slock.it"

In an exclusive interview, Kawai discussed how blockchain is emerging as one of the “hottest topics” among central banks, and how her own institution is working to get up to speed on the technology.Speaking on whether central banks should play a role in developing new platforms and technologies, she reported that her institution and its peers are looking to the private sector to provide the leading area of activity.Kawai told CoinDesk:“We believe technologies should be developed in the private sector. Talking about a global platform or the joint research between the public and private sectors, I don’t think we’re at that stage.”Kawai pointed to the Japanese market as one where private institutions are already leading the charge, citing a consortium led by the Japan Exchange Group (JPX) as the epicenter of local research and strategy. JPX announced in March that it had 26 members – including Mizuho Bank, Nomura Holdings and Bank of Japan – involved in its work.As for work with other central banks, however, Bank of Japan has gone public with one formal partnership, unveiled with the European Central Bank earlier this year.The two organizations are now working on tests that explore how distributed ledgers could be applied to market infrastructure. As explained by the ECB’s Dirk Bullmann in an interview last week, the ideas is that banks would be able to prioritize how payments are cleared.“We are trying to replicate the interbank payment system and trying to apply the blockchain in a closed system,” Kawai affirmed.Still, despite her organization’s interest in the area, like other central banks, the Bank of Japan still believes it’s too early to use the technology in its financial market infrastructure. Despite its strong rhetoric, the Bank of England recently pulled back on its blockchain work, opting for a ‘DLT-compatible‘ infrastructure for its new settlement system.“I don’t think we can say that blockchain technologies or other technologies are mature enough to be applied to the real world,” Kawai continued.Aside from its study with the ECB, Bank of Japan said it does not have any proof-of-concepts running related to the technology.Another topic addressed was the possibility that, like the private sector, global central banks could take an interest in collaborating broadly on distributed ledger tech.Here, Kawai sidestepped the idea there would be any formal collaboration akin to R3, the consortium of more than 80 global banks designed to focus on DLT applications. “Coordination can mean anything. If you mean we are exchanging information, the answer is already yes,” she said.Kawai went on to address the idea of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), one she said “almost all central banks” are studying. The People’s Bank of China, for instance, published a new opinion piece on CoinDesk last week in which it looked in depth into that idea.Still, Kawai said that the organization sees this as more of a topic of intellectual interest than operational strategy.“Will we be issuing a digital currency any time soon? I don’t think so, but we are researching it and trying not to be too ignorant about the technology,” she said.In this way, Kawai framed Bank of Japan’s exploration of blockchain and distributed ledgers as part of the bank’s responsibility. While not a market regulator – a job for the country’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) – she described her department’s role as a gateway of information to the wider organization.Still, there’s the question of whether Bank of Japan is truly moving at the pace of the market, given that the country is emerging as one of the most forward on the technology.One key difference is that, despite early setbacks, Japan is now home to the dominant market for bitcoin trading, outpacing even the US dollar market, according to data provider CryptoCompare. Sensing an opportunity, private sector companies are beginning to move in.Encouraged by the use of digital money and payment more broadly, companies including internet services provider GMO Internet and SBI Holdings are gearing up to launch bitcoin exchange offerings that would compete directly with domestic exchange startups including Quoine, Coincheck and BitFlyer.However, Kawai said that the Bank of Japan shouldn’t discourage private sector innovation relating to the use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.“We are very interested in cryptocurrencies and how they will work in a bank ecosystem. If bitcoin could become ever sizable enough to affect the traditional financial market, bitcoin and cryptocurrencies might have that potential in the future,” Kawai explained.She concluded:“If that age comes in the future, we can’t be behind.”Bank of Japan image via Facebook"
230,www.coindesk.com,"May 9, 2017",How Blockchain Could Finally Unite the United Nations,https://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-finally-unite-united-nations,"Transparency challenges. Yamamoto's own exposure to bitcoin goes back to 
2011 when it was little more than a passing interest. But, it wasn't ...","May 9, 2017 at 13:15 UTC",The United Nations is a Swiss army knife of humanitarian aid.,"When catastrophe strikes, dozens of agencies within the organization, founded in the aftermath of World War II, lay in wait in offices around the world, each with their own specialized role to alleviate suffering and establish peace.But with billions of dollars at their disposal and organizational mandates that often overlap, keeping track of who needs what, and getting it to them quickly, is just part of the challenge.Crucial to ensuring continued support, the agencies must also be able to prove that the taxpayer money donated by its 193 member nations actually accomplished its intended goals – a historically difficult balancing act.One man, who has spent the last 25 years helping conduct this symphony of services, thinks that much of the difficulty can be alleviated by moving both the dispersal of aid and the internal operations of the UN itself to a blockchain.For the past four months, the newly appointed special advisor for UN engagement and blockchain technology at the UN’s Office for Project Services (UNOPS), Yoshiyuki Yamamoto, has been meeting informally with members of other agencies to imagine what the organization would look like if it was truly united on a blockchain.Speaking to CoinDesk from UNOPS’ New York offices, Yamamoto said:“We started thinking about forgetting about traditional competition among UN agencies. There’s no point. We are so early stage, let’s try to exchange our opinions. We have a lot of lessons, let’s exchange lessons. Let’s see what is going to happen. This is so foundational. It’s not time to compete.”Yamamoto’s own exposure to bitcoin goes back to 2011 when it was little more than a passing interest. But, it wasn’t until last year that he “by chance” read Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper that he started to see how an immutable, shared ledger might help align the agencies within the UN.To demonstrate the inefficiencies of the current system, Yamamoto, the former director of the UNOPS Peace and Security Cluster, told the story of when a hospital in Kabul was so desperate for a generator that it applied to multiple UN agencies for help, only to finally receive five generators.In another story demonstrating how difficulties proving identity have resulted in aid being diverted from its intended recipients, Yamamoto related how ID cards that entitle their owners to UN supplies have been collected by tribal leaders and traded as currency.Exactly how much is lost to such waste is hard to say, he said, but this lack of transparency is one reason he now advocates for blockchain.The problem is so pervasive that, in 2012, the 8th secretary-general of the UN, Ban Ki-moon, stated that corruption in the previous year had prevented 30% of all development assistance from reaching its final destination. To give some idea as to how much this loss might be, that same year, $12.2bn in net disbursements were granted by the UN, according to the Global Policy Forum, a policy watchdog that monitors the work of the agency.If blockchain can be implemented successfully, Yamamoto believes increased transparency could result in fewer internal disputes and more efficient allocation of resources. As a result, he argued, this might increase the willingness of donors to give money, including individual donors, a largely untapped resource at the moment.With new donation options that might one day also include cryptocurrency itself, the end result could be more funds to help those in need.“If ordinary people can contribute directly to the UN and the international community,” said Yamamoto, “that is a completely new avenue of fund flow from rich countries to developing countries.”Progress towards this vision is slow, but steady.After discovering unrelated blockchain efforts being conducted within the World Food Program (WFP), the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) and UN Women, Yamamoto reached out to get a better understanding of those groups’ work. Yamamoto and these other early supporters established an informal blockchain group shortly after.Over the following months, Yamamoto said he and other UN representatives frequented multiple Bitcoin NYC Meetups, asking about the potential benefits of the technology to the UN.Word spread, Yamamoto said, and individual representatives from other UN organizations also expressed interest in getting involved. They agreed to meet in person approximately every other week, when an invited guest from outside the UN would discuss what it might mean if their agencies worked together on a joint blockchain initiative.Speakers at these events have included the former CEO of ID2020 and advisor to One World Identity, Susan Joseph, and Dickson Nsofor of blockchain startup Humaniq, which last week raised $5m in an initial coin offering (ICO).Last month, in a published joint request for information (RFI), Yamamoto announced the informal group had grown to seven UN organizations – also including the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the UN Development Group (UNDG). The RFI set out “to identify potential partners/suppliers for the future work in the area of international humanitarian, development or peacekeeping assistance”.A week after the RFI was published, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank announced they would be organizing the information in a way that caters to “the needs of the multinational development and humanitarian community”. The request deadline was also extended to 4th June.One of the early supporters of the inter-agency blockchain initiative, WFP financial officer Houman Haddad, described the cooperation between initiatives in an interview with CoinDesk, saying that developing the technology collaboratively could help “harmonize” humanitarian global aid.“We are in discussions with everyone we can be in a discussion with,” said Haddad, adding that the aim is to involve those parties in the “design and development” of the project, rather than just build a system and later tell them “use it”.Since the informal group of UN agencies first met, blockchain activity in the organization has grown. But, as the participants make clear, the meetings are still very informal, with independent work still largely driving the progress.In March, UN Women partnered with Innovation Norway; in April, the WFP revealed its first large-scale ethereum project; and, earlier this month, the UN Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (Cefact) proposed writing a pair of white papers focused on technical and business implications of blockchain.Most recently, the group of UN agencies exploring blockchain had its regular meeting on Thursday, 4th May, including invited guest speakers from Microsoft, ConsenSys and the Estonian government’s e-Governance Academy.“Rather than I become the messenger,” Yamamoto said, “I wanted them to explain for themselves to the other UN attendees.”Though the event was closed to the media, Yamamoto told CoinDesk afterwards that approximately 10 representatives of the UN were present, including for the first time two from the UN Secretariat.The group is currently at the earliest stages of exploring multiple blockchain consortia models, including the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and Hyperledger. Concerned about committing to a specific blockchain too early, Yamamoto said participants are keeping an open mind.“All options are on the table at the moment,” he said.While increased transparency from blockchain might one day lure new donors, the immediate future calls for preserving the donations that already exist.In spite of a strong record of spending donations on actual aid, US President Donald Trump was elected in part thanks to a series of promises to defund the UN. And he’s stayed true to that campaign promise, saying last month that looking at the UN budget, costs are “out of control” and no one country should take on a “disproportionate share of the burden militarily or financially”.With 28.57% of the UN’s $7.87bn peacekeeping budget this year coming from the US alone, losing financial support could result in the closure of long-term projects.Going forward, Yamamoto believes moving more of that money to a blockchain could have the potential to, not only cut back on waste, but also make it easier to prove to taxpayers back home exactly what was accomplished with the money.Yamamoto concluded:“Transparency makes it much easier for the donor government to make a decision. Transparency is a key for them. Because the donor government has to convince their own people. If it’s not transparent, it’s very weak.”United Nations image via Shutterstock"

Verizon was among the companies to take part in that round, signifying its first foray into the blockchain space.In statements, those backing the IoT-focused startup – particularly JetBlue, the sixth-largest airline in the US – suggested that their involvement could impact the way their respective companies do business.Bonny Simi, president for JetBlue Technology Ventures, said:“We continue to back innovators that will transform the travel experience, and Filament’s technology has the potential to unlock a new world of smarter, more efficient operations for airlines and beyond.”As part of the deal, Intel Capital’s Patrick Walsh will gain a seat on Filament’s board of directors. In a statement, Walsh echoed Simi in remarking that his firm’s work with Filament would tie into the blockchain efforts being pursued at Intel.“Intel is creating transformative technologies to enable large-scale Industrial IoT deployments, and our investment in Filament will help support that vision,” he said.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Filament. "

but just weeks later, the digital asset has fallen off the pace.","Apr 1, 2017 at 09:30 UTC",,"Bitcoin turned heads this month when its value exceeded the price of gold, but just weeks later, the digital asset has fallen off the pace.The digital currency surpassed the per-spot ounce price of gold on 2nd March, when it traded for $1,238 and gold was listed at $1,237 on the XAU/USD spot exchange rate provided by Bloomberg Markets.The event marked the second time in history bitcoin was worth more than gold. This time round, bitcoin was trading high amid optimism that the SEC could soon approve a bitcoin ETF for retail investors.Still, bitcoin didn’t enjoy this superior position for long. According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), prices have fallen sharply since the eventual rejection – a trend that continued amid uncertainty about the future of its technical roadmap.Overall, bitcoin’s price managed to trade higher than gold until 7th March, when prices fell below $1,200, BPI figures show. Gold prices, in comparison, closed at $1,215.86, according to Bloomberg data.Bitcoin once again surpassed gold on 10th March, the day of the SEC decision, when its price surged to an all-time high of more than $1,300.However, as the SEC rejected the proposed fund, bitcoin prices plunged, nearing $1,000. As a result, bitcoin once again traded south of gold, which closed the day at $1,204.64.Bitcoin again popped up to surpass the precious metal on 12th and 16th March. The digital currency didn’t stay north of gold for long, and it fell below its precious metal counterpart later on 16th March.With the prices diverging, it may be that this ends the latest attempt for the digital currency to live up to its often-used descriptor, ‘digital gold‘.In fact, though, bitcoin and gold have frequently shown little relationship in terms of their price movements.While the two assets have frequently displayed a strong price correlation during times of economic crisis, this relationship has often deteriorated once economic conditions calmed down. (A prior analysis of gold and bitcoin prices conducted by ARK Invest’s Chris Burniske failed to reveal a strong relationship between bitcoin and gold.)Still, today there are several retail products that investors can use to trade gold. Bitcoin, on the other hand, lacks such securities.As a result, the bitcoin-gold price relationship could change quite a bit going forward – and remains one to watch.Gold bars image via Shutterstock"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Apr 25, 2017 at 07:59 UTC",Swift has officially selected Hyperledger’s Fabric codebase for use in its most prominent blockchain project.,"Designed to simplify the nostro-vostro accounts banks held to facilitate international transactions, the trial includes participation from BNP Paribas, BNY Mellon and Wells Fargo, as well as three other global financial institutions.As a founding member of the Linux-led Hyperledger project, it’s perhaps not surprising Swift has decided to base its trial on the technology, though it lauded the final work for functionality including user-tailored access to data and other privileges.If the blockchain proof-of concept (PoC) is successful, Swift’s head of the global payments innovation (GPI) initiative, Wim Raymaekers, went so far as to say it could save as much as 30% of the reconciliation costs associated with cross-border payments.Raymaekers told CoinDesk:“We’re really looking to see if banks can gain better visibility on their information; to optimize the liquidity that they have on one end, but also to reduce the cost of reconciliation.”Other banks participating in the PoC include the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) and RBC Royal Bank, which were already working with Swift on GPI.These partners will be joined by 20 other institutions during the test phase of the implementation.Notably, the trial will also attempt to capitalize on existing standards used by Swift members. The data stored on the blockchain and the APIs used to query and update that data will conform to Swift’s ISO 20022 message formats.If successful, the blockchain PoC could be incorporated into Swift’s GPI solution.“When it comes to exchanging data between nostro and vostro data in accounts, there are solutions today,” Raymaekers said. “We are looking to see if DLT is a better solution.”To facilitate international transactions, banks typically store money all over the world in what are called nostro accounts. Yet settlement times can take weeks depending on the complexity of the transaction.While nostro accounts are designed to save time by moving money closer to where it’s needed, before it’s needed, that money lies dormant when not in use, collecting less interest than if it was applied in a more active way.To test if a distributed ledger could minimize the reliance on correspondent banks, Swift divided the trial into two parts, according to Raymaekers.First, there’s the technology itself. Swift’s Fabric PoC is being built to leverage the bank messaging platform’s existing GPI resources. While launched in February with 12 members, 30 banks are now in some stage of implementation of GPI, with more expected to go live soon.Using more traditional technology on the GPI toolkit, Raymaekers said Swift has already improved the speed and transparency of its services and now wants to see if blockchain can take it even further.“Several hundreds of thousands” of messages have been sent since GPI’s launch, he said.The second part of the PoC centers on business. On top of the blockchain implementation itself, Swift’s developers plan to build and run a smart contract that could help automate the transfer process.“We are using DLT to exchange the debits and credits,” said Raymaekers. “We are building value added on top through a smart contract application that will show to a bank in real time what it’s position is.”Still, the test also occurs within the wider narrative surrounding Swift, since earlier on in the frenzy surrounding blockchain tech and its possibilities, the financial messaging provider was identified as one of the middlemen most likely to be disintermediated.Along with the DTCC and others, supporters of the existing legacy financial infrastructure were targeted by startups built from the ground up to capitalize on the efficiency of distributed ledgers.Yet, this year Swift has established itself as open to the idea of evolving its own business model for possible integration with blockchain tech.While some skeptics persist in doubting Swift’s willingness to let go of its market position and adapt to a new paradigm, Raymaekers asserted that its receptivity to changes goes beyond this project alone.He said:“Maybe there’s a completely new way where you don’t need to hold money at accounts with your correspondent bank. But that is a complete rethinking of the correspondent banking paradigm.”Image via Swift"

reproduces via bitcoin micropayments at a conference earlier this year.","Apr 18, 2017 at 12:30 UTC",“I went into the blockchain and I never left.”,"As a researcher at CERSA/CNRS and Harvard Primavera De Filippi is perhaps most well-known for blockchain ideas that sound as if they come straight out of a sci-fi novel. Case in point, De Filippi presented a robotic flower that lives and reproduces via bitcoin micropayments at a conference earlier this year.Of course, there are plenty of big ideas swirling around in the industry, but whether or not all or any of these are viable is still up for debate. And that hangs heavy on De Filippi, too.She sighed heavily when The DAO – the most prominent example of a leaderless organization functioning on blockchain that unravelled after an attacker exploited the code last summer – was brought up.But even with that misstep, De Filippi is still inspired by the potential for smart contracts to create decentralized companies and governance systems with blockchain technology.To really dig in, De Filippi has to look at humanity a little bit differently.“It actually changes a little bit the way we go about society, when you use technology as opposed to regulation,” she said.She’s been studying the advantages and drawbacks of governing through technology (as opposed to regulation) for some time. For example, in the context of blockchain, she’s been trying to work out how smart contracts could change laws and regulations.And her findings have eventually led her to the mantra: “From competition to cooperation.”“So, I think we need to come up with different governance structures which are not market-based, but which will ensure some sort of decentralized power within the community,” she said.That might turn some heads in the blockchain industry, which has historically been made up of libertarian-leaning free market supporters. But, in her mind, building a decentralized system within the confines of a market-based economy doesn’t make sense.“It’s kind of funny because there’s such an obsession with creating a decentralized system. But, if you use a market-based mechanism to govern that system, obviously it’s going to centralize itself, you know? So, what’s the point? Why are you building a decentralized system in the first place?” she said.Instead, she’s trying to engineer a type of cooperative system, all on top of blockchain technology. As part of her research at Harvard and CNRS, De Filippi has been working, for many years, on the elaboration of new governance systems for decentralized organizations, including the Backfeed protocol.Another problem for decentralized blockchain-based systems, a more technical one that she’s been exploring solutions for is a Sybil attack.Effectively, if it’s easy for users to create identities then it’s possible to exploit that with one user creating hundreds of accounts, then using them to, say, vote, acting as 100 unique users.“When you’re in a model where you don’t identify who is a part of the system, then it’s really complicated to avoid people creating fake identities in order to cheat,” De Filippi explained.Bitcoin addresses this with proof-of-work, in which miners need to use some energy (in bitcoin’s case, computing power) in order to create blocks of transactions and earn block rewards. Ethereum aims to resolve this issue in future with a different system called proof-of-stake.The Backfeed team, however, is working on its own solution called proof-of-value. The security of the proof-of-value system is supposed to be based on the reputation of users, and while users can create as many accounts as they want, it’s not quite so easy to impact the system with them.“My reputation, my influence within the system only depends on the perceived value that the community has given to the contribution that is associated with this identity,” said De Filippi. “So instead of being based on this objective amount of hashing power, it’s based on this subjective evaluation of the contribution that I have made.”However, it’s still hard to say whether the experiment will pan out.Photo via Primavera de Filippi"

Already, Deloitte is testing Mercury with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), as well as a slew of partner banks in Asia.Still, as Deloitte principal Eric Piscini articulated, the idea is to grow the Mercury platform even further, to encompass more participants along the global supply chain.Piscini told CoinDesk:“This is the expansion on that foundation. We need participation in Europe, Asia and to expand the platform.”In the months ahead, Piscini said Deloitte will be working to send real transactions on the platform, which to date it has not done as part of its work with HKMA. Despite the increasing work on the use case, only a few trade finance trials have yet graduated to this point.Deloitte believes that adoption is around the corner, however, given that the platform can reduce costs and open up new revenue opportunities.Elsewhere at Consensus 2017, Deloitte showcased a number of other technical platforms built on blockchain tech, including ‘Regchain’, a regulatory reporting platform it believes could become a significant tool in its arsenal.Also demonstrated were technical builds focused on know-your-customer regulations, real estate leasing and mutual fund administration.Sea freight image via Shutterstock; Mercury logo image via Deloitte"
