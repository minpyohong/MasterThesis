the ...","May 28, 2017,03:47pm EDT",The Bitcoin symbol.,"The money you've been using all your life is backed by a government of some sort, and it exists in a tangible way. Bitcoin is neither tangible nor backed by anyone, but it's still worth a great deal to some people. This digital currency began circulating on the internet in 2009 with each Bitcoin worth just a tiny bit of ""real"" money, but right now a single Bitcoin is worth more than $2,000. Bitcoin is fascinating from a technological standpoint, but it's also fueling online crime and violence because of the anonymity it offers. Here's how Bitcoin works and why you should care.What is Bitcoin?Bitcoin is what's known as a cryptocurrency, a digital asset that exists only as data. You probably have money in the bank that is digital, but those digits equal physical currency. Not so with Bitcoin. Bitcoin also has no centralized regulation nor innate legal framework. As such, the value of Bitcoin is dictated entirely by the market, and the market is hot right now. Bitcoin is stored in a digital wallet, which you can save locally on a hard drive or phone, or online with any number of Bitcoin exchanges. Saving your Bitcoins locally is like keeping all your money under the mattress. If something happens to the digital wallet, all your money is toast. Sending and receiving money is handled by pointing your Bitcoin client or web exchange toward a Bitcoin address, which every wallet has. A few minutes later, the Bitcoin will leave your wallet and show up in another. Websites that accept Bitcoin are rare, but they are out there. Spending it in real life is considerably more tricky, but again, there are a few system in place to manage it.Is Bitcoin really anonymous?Transactions are at the heart of Bitcoin -- it's powered by what's known as a blockchain. You can view blockchain information for any wallet address, too. You don't necessarily know whose wallet is whose, but you know what's in them because it's a public ledger. Perhaps you've heard about ""mining"" Bitcoin? That's when you use a computer to crunch numbers for the blockchain. This is how transactions are verified, and in return you get some Bitcoin. It used to be easy to mine Bitcoins, but the difficulty increases substantially over time. Now, you need a server farm to earn much this way.The blockchain info for a WannaCry wallet with $41,000 in Bitcoin.The ""proof of work"" model for the blockchain has been of great interest to organizations that want nothing to do with Bitcoin. A blockchain database is by its very design resistant to tampering and can be managed in a distributed manner. Both Senegal and Tunisia use blockchain-based national currencies. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation also hopes to use blockchain technology to help poor people without access to banking save and spend money.How is Bitcoin involved with Ransomware?So, Bitcoin could do a lot of good things, but you often hear about it in negative contexts. The anonymous aspect of Bitcoin has drawn cybercriminals to the digital currency. Ransomware attacks started occurring a few years ago as the price of Bitcoin shot upward, and the WannaCry ransomware made news just a few weeks ago. When your computer is infected with ransomware, it encrypts your important files and demands a Bitcoin payment to a specific address in exchange for the key. It's not like criminals can ask you to wire some easily traceable money to their bank account, so Bitcoin is the perfect solution. After a few hops in the public blockchain, the money is essentially clean.The WannaCry ransomware alert.Bitcoin is very much the wild west of international finance. Security firms have reported that some cryptocurrency from ransomware attacks ends up in the hands of North Korea, which is barred from many traditional financial markets by international sanctions. The same has been said about terrorist groups and organized crime, which risk having assets seized in traditional banks. All those ransomware payments are just the tip of the criminal iceberg, too. Numerous Bitcoin exchanges have also been the victim of hacking and fraud, which has led to Bitcoins being stolen from users. That money is just gone—there's no FDIC to refund people when Bitcoin is stolen.What does Bitcoin mean for the economy?Despite all these issues, Bitcoin is surging in part because more people are using it. Bitcoin fans believe steadfastly that it's the future. Regular people are becoming interested in cryptocurrencies, but it's still too complicated for mainstream adoption. If that ever happens, we could see a lot more highs and lows in the global economy as Bitcoin's value swings. And it does… a lot.The value of one Bitcoin over the last few years.If you'd bought $1,000 of Bitcoin in 2010, you'd be worth $35 million right now. However, if you bought $1,000 worth of Bitcoin in early 2014, you'd have only had a quarter as much buying power a year later. Imagine being paid in Bitcoin, and then finding your money was only worth half as much a few days later. Economies with that kind of inflation are not stable, but Bitcoin has the advantage of operating alongside regular government-backed money. Almost no one has all their assets in Bitcoin.Is Bitcoin going to last?As a backdrop to all this, programmers are arguing over how best to manage Bitcoin going forward. There are calls to ""hard fork"" the currency, which could lead to two competing standards. That would cause even wilder swings in price. Whatever the long term ramifications of these decisions, Bitcoin (or whatever cryptocurrency it becomes) isn't going anywhere. "

They are safe, anonymous and utterly decentralized.","Apr 21, 2017,10:09am EDT",Bitcoin: Image Courtesy of Coindesk,"There’s a number of reasons why cryptocurrencies are so inherently popular. They are safe, anonymous and utterly decentralized. Unlike conventional currency, they are not controlled or regulated by some singular authority, their flow is determined entirely by market demand. They are also nigh impossible to counterfeit, thanks to the paranoidly complicated code system that encrypts each and every transfer, ensuring complete anonymity and utter safety to each and every user. They even make for a genuinely rewarding, if risky, investment endeavor, despite the fact that any financial advisor in their right mind will caution you against them. Therefore, despite the admittedly high stakes that this sort of dealing entails, not to mention the lack of any government agency to lend credence to them, cryptocurrencies can only thrive and multiply.If I were to tell you of the history of cryptocurrencies, I would have to begin with cryptographer David Chaum, who in the 1980s devised an extraordinarily secure algorithm that allowed for the kind of encryption required in electronic fund transfers. Chaum’s “blinding algorithm” laid the groundwork for the future development of all types of digitalized currency transactions, be it alternative currencies like Bitcoin or just plain old digitalized cash transfers. “I am personally excited for the future of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in general. Current innovations such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others are just the beginning for this technology that can help revamp many industries. There is plenty of opportunity in this space.” - Chalmers Brown, ForbesIn the later part of the 1980s, Chaum relocated to the Netherlands, and, with the help of a few fellow enthusiasts, laid the foundation of DigiCash, a for-profit cryptocurrency network based on his “blinded money” algorithm. Unlike newer cryptocurrencies, DigiCash exercised full monopoly over its supply, a far cry from being a decentralized mode of transaction such as Bitcoin. While DigiCash was founded with the idea of trading directly with individuals, the Netherlands government imposed severe restrictions on the company, forcing it to sell only to licensed banks. This seriously curtailed the company’s profits, and after a decade of struggling and being partnered with by Microsoft, the company finally closed doors in the 1990s. Chaum did go on to try his luck on a few similar cryptocurrency startups at the time, though none of them were really successful to begin with.Fast forward to 2008, when a whitepaper was released under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto, detailing what would be widely regarded as the first modern cryptocurrency initiative. The idea combined concepts such as decentralization, perfect anonymity, finite supply and blockchain technology to pave the way for what we know as Bitcoin. Nakamoto, a pseudonymous individual or individuals operating under a fake name, released Bitcoin to the public in 2009. This idea was soon taken up by a gazillion different startups such as Litecoin. In 2010, Bitcoin received recognition as a proper currency after merchants such as WordPress, Expedia and Microsoft began accepting it as a mode of payment. “Cryptocurrencies can better adapt to the prevalent challenges of both funding and the emerging digital economy in addition to being a way to engage communities through P2P tech and crowdfunding platforms. There are over 2 billion people without access to the financial economy and even basics of modern civilization. Here at Humaniq, we are a blockchain fintech startup aiming to tackle some of these challenges by tapping into the power of digital currencies to leverage social impact. Approaching these issues from the angle of Initial Coin Offerings, we have so far managed to secure over 10,000 investors and $4M in investments in the last two weeks.” - Dinis Guarda, CEO at HumaniqSpeaking for 2017, we’re still far from Bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency initiative, being officially recognized by a state government as a preferred mode of currency. Mere months ago, Bitcoin saw a 35% fluctuation in price range after a proposed exchange-trade fund by the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust was denied by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission due to concerns that the currency could be used for illegal purposes such as black market trading. However, hope is anything but out, and 2017 will be a year to watch out for as far as alternative currencies are concerned.While Bitcoin experienced a drop in its prices, a cheaper cryptocurrency by the name of Ether reached its all-time highs at $40 a unit. While Ether’s current setup prevents it from being used as a direct method of payment, the cryptocurrency still seems to have a bright future ahead thanks to the concept of smart contracts. In the meantime, more privacy-concerned cryptocurrency alternatives are starting to gain prominence in favor of institutions such as Bitcoin, which despite their vigilant security measures, continue to have loopholes that could be exploited for access to personal data. “In a reminder of just how fickle the market for such newfangled assets can be, just after 4 p.m. Friday, the Bitcoin price took a U-turn and plummeted to lows not seen in months, dipping below $1000 to as low as $980, after Bitcoin investors received some bad news from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.” - Jen Wieczner, Fortune MagazineAnother interesting turn of events is the acceptance of Bitcoin in the educational industry, what with the University of Ohio hosting classes about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a part of its MFE curriculum. Several colleges have even begun to accept Bitcoin as a means of payment, a move which will clearly help bring this alternative currency to the mainstream. The acceptance of Bitcoin, in general, has already led to a few companies considering genuine investment opportunities in the currency, further fueling its journey to mainstream.Will cryptocurrencies be the new norm after 2017? Perhaps it is too soon to tell. But if there is one thing we know for sure, it is that the currency seems to have a wide appeal with a particular section of technologically-savvy individuals, a point that is sure to soon work in its favor."

[+] Images),"Over the past year and a half Bitcoin has been on a spectacular run, rising in value 140% in 2016 and now an additional 49% in just the past month. This surge in value has invigorated Bitcoin backers convinced this boost in value makes Bitcoin a more credible currency, that it is a sign of the cryptocurrency’s strength. Yet the wild swings, both up and down, in the value of Bitcoin do not make it a more plausible substitute currency; they make it a speculative asset, a get-rich-quick scheme.Is Bitcoin the currency of the future? No.  There are two big problems with bitcoin as a currency: its value is unstable and its transaction processing is too slow.The most important feature of a currency is that it be a stable store of value. This credo, ably explained by Steve Forbes here (among many places), is vital for a developing country economy to attract the investment it needs. Even in developed countries, as John Tamny explained here on Forbes.com, a stable currency value is the key to investment because those who invest are expecting a stream of future earnings to earn back their investment plus some profit. Instability in currency values mean that an investor cannot accurately predict the value of those future earnings. This uncertainty makes investments less valuable; thus, less investment happens.Over the past month the value of a Bitcoin has experienced an average daily change of 2% in value, sometimes down but mostly up. For comparison, over the same month, the exchange rate between the euro and the U.S. dollar had an average daily change of less than 1% and only changed 3% over the entire month. While Bitcoin was rising 49% in the past 30 days, it had seven days where its value changed by over 3%, more than the value of the dollar changed in the entire month. People don’t want investments or debts denominated in a currency whose value can change by 50% in a month.Another basic feature of a currency, beyond being a stable store of value, is to facilitate transactions. Barter’s big drawback is it is inconvenient. It’s hard to make change and you must find two people who want to exchange goods; three or four way trades get complicated. Currency solves those problems meaning I can buy groceries without having to sell economic services to the supermarket. This convenience is why people moved from barter to currencies (and then from metal to paper, from paper to plastic, and from plastic to electronic bits).Yet, to protect the security of the blockchain that makes cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin so secure, processing of Bitcoin transactions is very slow. In fact, because of a limit on the number of transactions which can be completed in a day, it sometimes takes days to complete a simple transaction. Resistance to changing these rules from people who mostly like the anonymity and untraceability of Bitcoin mean that Bitcoin cannot become a widely-used currency. Its very security negates its value in everyday use.Given these drawbacks, the only reasons to own Bitcoins are not to use them as a currency, but to either speculate on their asset value or use them to shield transactions from others. Without a stable value Bitcoin cannot truly be a currency. Rather it is a commodity asset that one trades, like gold or silver, in hopes that its value will rise and yield a trading profit. There is nothing wrong with speculation; the actions of speculators help to add market liquidity and to determine the market value of assets. However, usually the asset being valued also has an actual underlying use: you can invest in gold or use it to make jewelry or electronic components. Bitcoins have no uses other than allowing people to hide wealth, conceal (often illegal) transactions, and make and lose money by trading them.Clearly, from the popularity of Bitcoin, those limited uses still have quite a bit of value to a nontrivial number of people. I have no objection to these people’s use of Bitcoin for those purposes. However, people should stop expecting it to become a currency that ordinary people use for ordinary transactions. It is destined to stay in its niche as a way to hide things or speculate.  A currency, Bitcoin is not, nor shall it be."

The virtual currency bitcoin is no exception.","For those living off the grid, bitcoin is a digital currency. Its value, not backed by any government or central bank, is determined by software that few people truly understand.Since few know how bitcoin really works, there have been endless opportunities for chicanery. Social media has provided fertile ground for numerous frauds.Naturally, those who want to speculate in bitcoin want to believe that the currency's value will do nothing but go up in value, but that hasn't been the case. The currency is very volatile and few understand why.ShutterstockAccording to a recent report by Zerofox, a digital risk monitoring company, there's a considerable dark side to bitcoin. Here are some ways to spot scams:-- Malware downloads.  Bitcoin is often used as ""bait"" to get you to download some nasty software that will mess up your computer. According to Zerofox:""Fake bitcoin 'wallets' hiding malware downloads: Attracting users to click through URLs posted to social media is a technique that ZeroFOX has observed in a variety of attacks.This one uses the promise of bitcoin to lure the user into following a URL that subsequently attempts to download a malware-laden app. We also discovered that fake bitcoin surveys are often used to distribute malware, and we advise caution when encountering any social media URL that is either shortened or not secured with an HTTPS connection.""-- Bitcoin phishing impersonators. ""Impersonators run rampant on social media, and impersonating the bitcoin brand itself is a tactic that can be used to gain a victim’s trust and credibility.A phishing website allegedly offers a search service enticing users to enter in their private bitcoin key to see if it exists in their database. Once entered, the private key will simply be phished, allowing the scammer to spend directly from the curious bitcoin owner’s wallet.""-- Bitcoin-flipping scams. ""These scams could be an offer to instantly exchange bitcoins for money after paying an initial startup fee or a promise to double your initial investment overnight.The other end of the bargain is never held-up, and bitcoins are stolen immediately. Scammers succeed because they’re able to broadcast their scam to thousands of unsuspecting targets through social media.""-- Bitcoin pyramid schemes. These scams are harder to recognize than the more egregious bitcoin-flipping examples described above, but the end result is the same; the scammer eventually makes off with the victim’s stolen bitcoins.This tried and tested idea relies upon high yield investment programs and multi-level marketing. In these ethically grey schemes, a low initial investment can be multiplied by signing up additional members using referral links. Before long, hundreds of victims have joined the scheme. At a later point in time, the original scammer walks away and the pyramid collapses.""How Can You Protect YourselfLike any get-rich-quick scheme, bitcoin scams thrive on the gullibility of its victims. Just because it's a digital currency doesn't mean you can acquire wealth quickly. Here are some more warnings from Zerofox:1. Don’t trust anyone claiming they will give you or help you mine bitcoin. Again, cryptocurrency is valued by cybercriminals for a reason, and nefarious behavior related to bitcoin runs rampant on social media and digital channels.2. Avoid URLs associated with social media profiles advertising too-good-to-be-true bitcoin offers.3. Be vigilant when engaging with the social media accounts of legitimate bitcoin brokers or trading platforms, as they are frequently victims of convincing impersonations.4. Never engage in any financial transaction, bitcoin or otherwise, via direct message on social networks.If you have already been scammed, report the crime to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center, but do not expect to see your bitcoins again."

(It didn't hurt that Sunday, the popular Tim Ferriss podcast released a two-and-a-half-hour episode on the subject.)","But its meteoric rise belies a fact apparent to anyone active in the space: The bitcoin community is at war with itself and at greater risk of splitting apart than ever in its history. Already, the impasse has been a drag on its value.The power struggle — over the seemingly simple question of how to upgrade the network to handle more transactions — is pushing fees so much higher that, for certain types of transactions, bitcoin is nearly unusable. Transactions that should take 10 minutes are taking days or not going through at all, and the average fee costs $4.75 — a negative development for a network whose proponents once touted the fact that it was cheaper than Visa.Even more foreboding is the fact that, even as new money flows into crypto assets, businesses are pivoting away from bitcoin to build on other blockchains. That means countless transactions that could be processed with bitcoin, pushing up its price, will now take place on other blockchains, instead boosting their prices. Accelerating that trend is the fact that non-blockchain companies are now creating their own cryptocurrencies — but not on bitcoin. For instance, Kik, which plans to launch a new cryptocurrency called Kin, is building it on Ethereum. The factors above combined with the full speculative frenzy in non-bitcoin tokens and the civil war in bitcoin finally pushed its market cap as a percentage of all cryptocurrencies below 50% for the first time a few weeks ago; for years it had been at 80-90%. It hasn’t recovered since.Noting that the community has been trying to avoid certain technical upgrades that run the risk of causing a “split” that would create two versions of bitcoin — one with a higher value and the other lower — Mike Belshe, chief executive officer of BitGo, a cryptocurrency security company that supports bitcoin, says that because of the inaction, “In a lot of ways, bitcoin already has split. A lot of people aren’t using bitcoin anymore. People are moving their coins out of bitcoin, converting it to another coin.… If bitcoin were performing and executing on all cylinders two years ago and meeting the demands of all its constituents, would we have these other coins at all? Bitcoin had all the market share. Today it doesn’t.”ShutterstockWhy Bitcoin Is Unlikely To Find A Solution SoonTo understand what has escalated the two-and-a-half-year-long controversy into all-out war, one first needs a little background in the game theory of bitcoin, which I outlined in this previous article. As I wrote then, “The magic of bitcoin has been the ability for various players with opposing interests to engage in a system that has so far led to an optimal outcome for all of them.” As one would expect, however, when groups with opposing interests have to interact with each other, tensions arise. While, in previous open source projects, parties with opposite aims could part ways, in bitcoin, neither wants to leave what has so far been a highly lucrative game for each of them. (Hear two long-time bitcoin players explain this in my podcast.) While bitcoin has many constituencies, one of the most important are the developers, who are like the designers of the game. Another crucial group are the entities that run the bitcoin network on their computers (called miners) who are sort of the operators of the game.A year and a half ago, in what became known as the Hong Kong agreement, some of the developers/game designers and the miners/game operators forged an agreement on how to enable more transactions on the network at any given time. It had one element that the developers wanted, called SegWit, and an additional element that the miners wanted, called a 2MB cap. (SegWit organizes transactions more efficiently, enabling more on the network at any given time, while increasing the cap from 1MB to 2MB just lets more in even if they aren’t organized more efficiently.)After that agreement, the developers/game designers as a whole disavowed the agreement, saying certain individuals but they as a group had not approved it. They then proceeded only to prepare the design change that they wanted — SegWit. However, they need the miners/game operators to run it, and one miner in particular, Bitmain, which also manufactures mining equipment and is headed up by Jihan Wu, has held its implementation hostage, trying to force the developers to also raise the 1MB limit.Last month, 58 companies across 22 countries brought together by one of the biggest investors in the space, Digital Currency Group, led by Barry Silbert, forged a compromise that was, essentially, the Hong Kong agreement all over again, just with a fresh timeline. However much economic might may lie behind what is now being called the New York agreement, none of the core developers have signed on. Bitcoin core developer Eric Lombrozo says Silbert’s “heart is in the right place,” but that ultimately, “I don’t think the New York agreement is way to go about these things at all.” This past weekend, Lombrozo finally wrote a Medium post in which he declared, “At this point I have zero trust left for Jihan Wu and Bitmain.”While the developers and miners still haven’t found a way forward, this brings us to the third, and most important group in the game theory of bitcoin: the users. This group has the ultimate control in bitcoin. If bitcoin split into two coins, the users would determine which one is the “real” bitcoin simply by choosing to hold and transact more with one of them, thereby boosting its price. However, the bitcoin developers and miners have no way of determining in advance which version of the coin users would support. While one might say that the 20.5 million wallets represented by the companies who signed the New York Agreement represent a significant percentage, for now, some users who support the core developers and are angry that Bitmain has thwarted the adoption of SegWit are aiming to wrest control from the miners. They are attempting a “user-activated soft fork,” a sort of declaration of war on the miners. A video about UASF that featured bitcoin “maximalist” Tone Vays — someone who believes that in the future, there will only be one dominant blockchain, and it will be bitcoin — begins with a shot of him standing in the woods wearing a flannel shirt and a camouflage UASF baseball hat, a Bitcoin bandana masking his face except his eyes, his arms crossed over his chest and a machete raised in one hand and an axe in the other. While more ideologically driven bitcoin users may support this idea, it’s not clear whether they will garner the support necessary to pull it off. It currently has only 22% support from companies in the space and a deadline of August 1. Opening shot of the Bitcoin UASF videoA couple other proposals for enabling more transactions on the network have been put forth, but because they are newer, the timeline for vetting them and preparing the code is even longer than the proposals described above, so it is unlikely any of them will be adopted any time soon. But the main reason none of these seems likely to move forward is that, as Paul Sztorc, a bitcoin developer and economist at Bloq who proposed one of these alternatives, put it, “Bitcoin can’t succeed unless the developers and the miners work together at some point” — and so far no proposal has gotten support from both.Startups Leaving, But Impact UnclearThe delays and high fees are already prompting companies to leave the bitcoin blockchain, or not build on it. Coinbase, the top startup in the space and potentially a soon-to-be unicorn, started out as a safe and easy place to buy and store bitcoin. A couple years ago, the San Francisco-based company, which is backed by the likes of the New York Stock Exchange and Andreessen Horowitz, signed on to an effort meant to help increase the number of transactions the network could handle. After that failed, cofounder Fred Ehrsam, who has since left the company, wrote a blog post entitled, “Ethereum is the Forefront of Digital Currency.” So it was not a surprise that, this spring, when Coinbase, which has 7.5 million users, unveiled its latest product, Token, which it names as the third in a three-prong strategy, the company had chosen to build it on Ethereum. The fees in bitcoin were too high.Some of the initial coin offerings (Kickstarter-like crowdsales of crypto-tokens) that have so far raised half a billion dollars for new blockchain-based projects intended to build on bitcoin but had to launch on other blockchains instead. For instance, the Brave browser started on bitcoin, but to launch its Basic Attention Token last week, it moved to Ethereum. Social network Yours was driven from the bitcoin blockchain to Litecoin’s because of high fees. BitCart, an Ireland-based gift card company that used to accept payments in bitcoin had to abandon the cryptocurrency last week — it now exclusively accepts Dash — due to the network issues despite volumes of only about $100,000 in sales a month. A year ago, the company began experiencing huge delays in payments. For instance, a user might buy $1,500 worth of gift cards on BitCart and the company would deliver them within 24 hours. But the customer’s payment might actually arrive 2.5 weeks later. “I can’t use something that takes longer than 24 hours if my service itself is only supposed to be 24 hours,” says CEO Graham de Barra.As for the impact the departure of this economic activity will have on bitcoin, it’s not clear. While on the face of it, it seems incongruous that bitcoin should be reaching all-time highs at the same time that the community is in a civil war with no end in sight, Chris Burniske, blockchain products lead at ARK Investment Management, the first public fund manager to invest in bitcoin, says that the price is reflective of the problems the network is facing. “Although bitcoin is hitting new highs, it is dropping precipitously in its dominance of the overall crypto asset markets,” he says. “So on a relative basis it is underperforming the asset class.”Chart showing how quickly bitcoin's dominance has erodedBurniske surmises that the reason it has risen at all has to do with the fact that the amount of new bitcoins being minted every day was halved last summer. The bitcoin software cuts the amount of new bitcoins produced per day by half roughly every four years. The previous halving in 2012 was also followed by a bull run the next year. “We’ve cut the annual rate of supply inflation in half but nonetheless, demand for bitcoin globally continues to go up,” he says. “I was just on this bitcoin cruise with people from 20 different nations. In Venezuela, they don’t care about Ethereum. They just want bitcoin. Everyone in the west is really charged up about Ethereum, but when you go back to explaining this on a worldwide basis, bitcoin is at least two orders of magnitude more well-known than Ethereum.” His view on the high transaction fees is that it proves how much people are willing to pay to use the network.However, Jake Brakeman, cofounder of crypto-asset investment vehicle CoinFund, worries that high fees contradict bitcoin’s original purpose or advantage: “If the fees are super high, then you’re essentially in the exact world you built bitcoin to avoid. You were trying to bring this technology to every individual consumer in the world and giving them the freedom to transact, but that’s not going to happen if the fees are $100. What’s going to happen is you’re going to have an upper class or oligarchy of people who can use it for transactions, which is the opposite of its mission.”But this outcome may not bother some community members who see either path as a tradeoff. The transaction fees aren’t the only costs in the network. There’s also a cost to starting up a computer or miner that will support the network, and the developers fear that moving to a 2MB cap will increase that upfront cost, thereby concentrating mining power in even fewer hands. Sztorc says, “The people who make a lot of transactions — the business and exchanges — feel the urgency is immense. If anything, they almost have post-traumatic stress disorder at this point, because they get support calls all the time from people saying, My transactions aren’t going through. But these other people are just as serene as they can possibly get. They’re just like, This is how it’s supposed to work. People who can pay the appropriate fee will get it through. They’ll say these lesser transactions are just spam … So for some people, it’s wreaking havoc on their blood pressure and others are just as cool as a cucumber.”Only time will tell if panic or calm is justified.Update, Wednesday, June 7, 11:50am, EST: The UASF video was not created by Tone Vays, as originally stated, but only featured him.Update, Thursday, June 8, 10:15am, EST: The original version of this post misspelled Jake Brukhman's name as Brakeman; it has been corrected. "

It’s people looking for a rate of return. It’s in the bubble phase. [Bitcoin] goes through this periodically… it rises several hundred percent, and then collapses.” In December 2013, Bitcoin ran up to over $900 and subsequently collapsed to below $250… it would take three years for the price to again reach those highs.Source: Coin DeskExponential Moves Always Blow Up Pal, speaking in an exclusive interview with Mauldin Economics, made ten-times his money on Bitcoin and thinks now is a good time to get out. “This is the most exponential move we have seen. I don’t know how far it goes, but I sold out last week… and I’ve [owned Bitcoin] since it was $200. Anything that moves exponentially, always [blows up].” However, Bitcoin’s meteoric rise isn’t the only reason The Global Macro Investor exited his position.Only 21 Million Bitcoins? Not necessarily.“Bitcoin was supposed to be a store of value, you couldn’t mess with the formula… and now they are talking about a ‘hard fork’ changing it?”A feature that has attracted many investors to Bitcoin is its built-in scarcity. It’s widely thought that only 21-million Bitcoins can ever be ‘mined’ into existence.However, senior developers and miners are now contemplating a ‘hard fork’ which would split Bitcoin in-two and allow for the creation of more Bitcoins.“Even if they don’t change the formula, the fact that they could? That’s enough to say it’s not a long-term store of value.” Pal says a recent development in India also changed his views on the crypto-currency.Could “India Stack” Replace Bitcoin? “India introduced a frictionless payment system, [something] that everyone in Bitcoin was working on… this was [Bitcoin’s] great project and India went and did it for 1.1 billion people, fifty-times faster than Bitcoin and its rolled out and working now.” Pal is talking about “India Stack,” which will soon process more transactions than Bitcoin ever has.India Stack allows users to open a bank account, mobile phone account, or share medical records at any hospital or clinic in India with your fingerprints or by retina scan.In the March edition of The Global Macro Investor, Pal said of India Stack:“This revolutionary digital infrastructure will soon be able to process billions more transactions than Bitcoin ever has. It may well be a Bitcoin killer or at best, provide the framework for how blockchain technology could be applied in the real world.”What About Blockchain and the Future of Finance? For Raoul Pal’s thoughts on the technology behind Bitcoin, the financial system, cashless societies, and more, watch the full interview below.Download a FREE Bundle of Exclusive Content from the Sold-Out 2017 Strategic Investment ConferenceGet access to exclusive interviews with John Mauldin, Neil Howe and Pippa Malmgren from SIC, an ebook from renowned geopolitical expert George Friedman and bonus SIC 2017 content…Claim your SIC 2017 bundle now!"

Just as ...","Mar 28, 2017,02:19pm EDT","Bitcoin has long been the transaction currency of choice for drug dealers and extortionists, but this month, the IRS has upped the game. Just as tax evasion finally took down Al Capone, now the IRS is looking for tax evaders and other tax cheats who have been using Bitcoin in an attempt to hide their tracks.","The IRS recently subpoenaed customer records from Coinbase, a leading Bitcoin exchange. However, the subpoena is but the latest skirmish in a years-long war against criminals who have been leveraging Bitcoin for a wide variety of nefarious purposes.The specifics of the IRS subpoena, however, make one thing clear: the majority of Americans who trade in Bitcoin are likely breaking the law.Coupled with Bitcoin’s popularity among ransomware extortionists and all manner of other cybercriminals, we must now face a chilling realization: the underlying value of Bitcoin really has little if nothing to do with its artificial scarcity or popularity as a medium of speculation.On the contrary – the only reason Bitcoin has value to anyone is because of the underlying value as a medium of exchange for lawbreakers. If we could flip a switch and eliminate all illegal uses of Bitcoin, there would be nothing left of the cybercurrency.Bitcoin: Strength in NumbersThe ‘John Doe’ SummonsThe most recent order from the IRS to Coinbase is a ‘John Doe’ summons, which means that the IRS isn’t naming any particular Coinbase customers, but is rather issuing a blanket request for information about a large number of individuals – even though the IRS may not have any suspicions about all of them.In response, Coinbase says that while it has a policy of complying with all legal orders (of which this is one), it believes this one overreaches, and is thus fighting it in court. “Suffice to say, we feel the IRS’s subpoena is overly broad and incorrectly implies that all users of virtual currency are evading taxes,” writes Coinbase Cofounder and CEO Brian Armstrong in a blog post. “Asking for detailed transaction information on so many people, simply for using digital currency, is a violation of their privacy, and is not the best way for us to accomplish our mutual objective.”The IRS, however, is on firm ground with the John Doe summons. “The IRS uses John Doe summonses to obtain information about possible violations of internal revenue laws by individuals whose identities are unknown,” the agency says. “The IRS not only has a suspicion that the John Doe class includes U.S. taxpayers who are not complying with the law – it knows that the class in the past included such violators, and very likely includes others,” it continues.Such noncompliance, in fact, may not always be intentional. It’s likely many Bitcoin enthusiasts are inadvertently running afoul of IRS’s guidance that Bitcoin is property, not currency. As a result, every Bitcoin interaction is potentially taxable individually, leading to a paperwork headache for active Bitcoin traders.Be that as it may, the IRS has reason to suspect virtually all Bitcoin traders have fallen into this trap. According to the IRS, it “searched the MTRDB [Modernized Tax Return Database] for Form 8949 data for tax years 2013 through 2015.” Form 8949 is the one that Bitcoin traders must use to report their activity. “Those results reflect that in 2013, 807 individuals reported a transaction.” Furthermore, the number for 2014 is 893 and for 2015, it dropped to 802 individuals.Given the number of US citizens to conducted at least one Bitcoin transaction in 2015 probably numbers in the tens or hundreds of thousands, 802 is a mere drop in the bucket. The IRS is quite justified in presuming, therefore, that the vast majority of American Bitcoin traders are breaking the law.Rationalization to the Rescue?Armstrong’s exhortation that the IRS summons implies that all users of virtual currency are evading taxes is thus an overstatement. More worrisome, however, is his opinion that taking a legal action to enforce tax law is a violation of privacy.The blogosphere, in fact, is rife with related rationalizations. The most extreme Libertarian proponents of Bitcoin are against taxes and the IRS in general, and even for those individuals who allow for the necessity of taxation, many believe that they are justified in using Bitcoin to evade more onerous legal constraints like the ‘Bitcoin is property’ guidance.Another fallacious line of reasoning: the IRS is overstepping because they’re looking for a needle in a haystack. “It amounts to nothing more than asking for large amounts of hay in the hope they might find a needle,” opines Michael Beckerman, President and CEO of the Internet Association, a trade group whose members include Coinbase as well as companies like 
 
Alphabet

Amazon.com
.Such arguments, however, do not sway the IRS. “The IRS not only has a suspicion that the John Doe class includes U.S. taxpayers who are not complying with the law,” the agency says. “It knows that the class in the past included such violators, and very likely includes others.”Charles Stross, popular author and blogger, summed up the situation nicely. “Bitcoin is pretty much designed for tax evasion,” he quips.Tax Evasion Merely the Nail in Bitcoin’s CoffinRunning afoul of the IRS, however, is merely the focus of the latest news. The fact remains that Bitcoin is enormously popular for all manner of criminal enterprises, from illegal drug dealing to extortion cons.The most popular con, in fact, is ransomware. The US Justice department reports that ransomware attacks quadrupled in 2016 to an average of 4,000 per day, with extortion amounts ballooning to $209 million for the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $24 million for all of 2015.While there is broad agreement that most of today’s ransomware extortionists demand payment in Bitcoin, there remains disagreement as to whether Bitcoin is the primary cause of the rapid growth in ransomware attacks.Is Bitcoin in fact tied to the growth of ransomware? “It’s helping. I think that’s definitely true,” says David Emm, Senior Security Researcher at Kaspersky Lab. “The existence of effectively anonymised payment mechanisms definitely plays into the hands of cybercriminals.”Maya Horowitz, Threat Intelligence Group Manager at 
 
Check Point Software
 Technologies agrees. “It makes it much easier to avoid law enforcement,” she says.And while it’s true that Bitcoin is not fully anonymous, many criminals are simply using a Bitcoin-based money laundering operation known as a ‘mixing service.’ “If you want your money in one wallet but you don’t want anyone to be able to trace it back and know how you got it, then you take it though a mixing service – like money laundering – and then it all eventually gets back to you after being mixed with other money,” Horowitz says. “It’s pretty standard for Bitcoin.”Cue the Rationalization AgainOnce again, however, there are a number of voices seeking to diminish the connection between Bitcoin and ransomware – or criminal enterprise in general.One argument: if it weren’t for Bitcoin, bad guys would simply use something else. “The reality is cybercriminals will always use what is available to them,” explains Greg Day, VP and CSO, EMEA at Palo Alto Networks. “In many ways they’re inherently lazy, so if Bitcoin wasn’t there they’d find a different process to channel funds through.”Another argument: paper currency is just as bad, so why all the fuss about Bitcoin? “The U.S. government should find it awkward to regulate bitcoin on the grounds that it facilitates illegal transactions,” opines William J. Luther, Assistant Professor of Economics at Kenyon College and an adjunct scholar at the Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives at the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank. “Its own currency — and the $100 bill in particular — has done so for years.”And then there’s the argument that Bitcoin isn’t really anonymous in the first place. “If you catch a dealer with drugs and cash on the street, you’ve caught them committing one crime,” says Sarah Meiklejohn, a computer scientist at University College London. “But if you catch people using something like Silk Road, you’ve uncovered their whole criminal history. It’s like discovering their books.”Silk Road, of course, was the Bitcoin-driven clearinghouse for illegal drugs and stolen credit cards (and other contraband) that law enforcement shuttered in 2014. Bitcoin – and Bitcoin-related crime – have only flourished since.Bitcoin-centered ransomware is so popular among the criminal element, in fact, because it is dead simple. Any modestly skilled bad actor can simply download the software off the Dark Web, create a Bitcoin wallet, and send out phishing emails to find gullible targets. The number of such extortionists and the typically modest ransoms are usually sufficient to avoid law enforcement investigations – a gamble such criminals are obviously willing to make.Is that Bitcoin in Your Wallet? Didn’t Think SoFor the readers of this article who are law-abiding citizens, the cold reality is that there is little reason to get involved in Bitcoin in the first place. “Bitcoin transactions are not very useful in casual purchases, thus there has been little mainstream consumer adoption,” admits Mikko Ohtamaa, CTO of Gibraltar-based cybercurrency trader TokenMarket. “Bitcoin shines in anonymous online payments and most day-to-day and/or point-of-sale payments don’t require this level of anonymity or the complexity it brings along with it.”The final question for law-abiding, tax-paying citizens who may be interested in speculating in Bitcoin: does the fact that the cybercurrency is primarily used for criminal purposes taint it for other uses, a la blood diamonds?Such a question of morality is beyond the scope of this article, but important food for thought for anyone interested in using Bitcoin for legal purposes.Intellyx publishes the Agile Digital Transformation Roadmap poster, advises companies on their digital transformation initiatives, and helps vendors communicate their agility stories.

Both were early disruptors, both have gotten a tremendous amount of negative PR, and both might wind up as cautionary tales.","(Photo credit: ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/Getty Images)Disclaimer: I'm an avid crypto-enthusiast, advocate, supporter and former trader. I used to be an avid trader years ago, and my co-founder is as hardcore of a crypto-anarchist as they come. I would love nothing more than for bitcoin to succeed, but I believe it will die a slow and painful death and something else will come along to be its successor.The Good Old DaysBack in the MT-GOX days, I would find patterns when trading. When the Chinese would go for lunch, roughly 9-11 p.m. PST, you'd see massive buy-and-sell orders. That's when I would find arbitrage opportunities and trade bitcoin. Nowadays, you've got a better chance of finding a unicorn out in the woods than recognizing patterns for how bitcoin might perform. It's completely volatile, its tech not being maintained as it should, and it has some new competitors. Much like Uber.Nobody is denying that bitcoin was disruptive. It was the first cryptocurrency of its time and has made a humongous splash – and that’s putting it lightly. Every super-government tried to shut it down and none of them could. J.P. Morgan tried to file patents for the exact technology of bitcoin and failed. Bitcoin is (or was) the cool kid at school that everyone wanted to be friends with but no one was sure how to ask for their number.A Dark Past (And An Uncertain Future)Today, bitcoin is trading around $1,000 per coin. When I was actively trading BTC, I remember it being less than $200. I had accounts with almost every exchange from BitPremier, to MT-GOX, to Coinbase and local wallets. After all the time I put into it, I can definitely -- if reluctantly -- say that bitcoin turned out to be a zero-sum game for me. And while it wasn't that way for everyone, I think the ethos around bitcoin will always have something of a dark mark.Bitcoin will forever be associated with the dark web: Silk Road, money launderers, drug rings, Anonymous, Julian Assange and the list goes on. The metadata around bitcoin is not positive. There was never a real ""promoter"" or known face, only a mysterious one named Satoshi Nakamoto with origins straight out of a William Gibson sci-fi novel. That's not to say bitcoin won't go down in the history books forever. The underlying tech, blockchain, has already proven to be incredibly useful for cyber security and many other use cases outside of cryptocurrency. Just as Uber was the disruptive creator of the ridesharing economy, bitcoin was the disruptive creator of the blockchain ecosystem and instrumental to helping it thrive. But just because it was instrumental in blockchain's past doesn't mean it has a role in blockchain's future.New Kid On The BlockchainNow there's a new kid on the block. Ethereum, or ether (ETH), has made massive gains in a short period of time. Major financial institutions and enterprise giants have shown support for it, including Intel, Microsoft, J.P. Morgan and Accenture, and it will likely cooperate with legislation when the time comes. That's what makes this product the likely successor to bitcoin.While the Feds did recognize bitcoin as a form of currency, the community was fervently anti-establishment from the start. I was in those private IRC groups and other chat channels with the hardcore traders, and was a member of LocalBTC and all the rest. I also belonged to several nonprofits in the BTC community and was its biggest cheerleader for years. It was always fun having suits at the Soho House in L.A. overhear my conversations on bitcoin and ask me to explain it to them. I always pointed them here.When Coinbase.com sent me a newsletter stating it now had ether, I knew the time had come. Bitcoin would start to see its final days soon or start the path of fading away into the ether. Major players in the market are starting to influence ether, and I expect to see it continue to climb in value and importance. At the time of writing, it's already trading at $50 per coin. Largely, we've seen the same with Uber. Controversy after controversy and embattled competition with rivals are starting to show their mark, and Uber's autonomous vehicle wing -- which is probably the most important arm for the future of the company -- is bleeding its best talent.Is Silicon Valley's $70 billion baby going to fall on its face, or will it eventually grow into profitability? Is ether another bubble or the bitcoin 2.0 we’ve been waiting for, ready to replace our fiat currency once and for all like an episode of “Mr. Robot?”Only time will tell. "

Also, that my expertise is in the world of physical cash, so I’m not an expert in bitcoin.There are a variety of ways to think about the relative safety of different means of payment. When you use a credit or debit card, for example, there are laws and regulations that specify the rights and responsibilities of each party to the transaction. So, if someone gets your credit card information and uses it fraudulently, your liability is limited by the legal framework of the transaction. Your bank accounts are protected by deposit insurance. And you have options for recourse if you don’t receive the goods or services in return for many types of payment.Bitcoin was designed to operate independently of any regulatory structure to facilitate anonymous transactions both locally and across international borders. These features make it attractive to some people for certain types of payment, particularly international exchanges. At the same time, because it operates outside the mainstream payments’ legal and regulatory structure, transactions made using bitcoin do not have the same consumer protections that are built into many other types of payments.When considering the safety of any payment, I think it’s important for consumers to understand the rules that govern that payment to avoid disappointment if something goes wrong. I think there is sometimes a tendency to focus on the convenience of certain payments types, without fully considering the issues, risks, and alternatives to any particular type of payment.This question originally appeared on Quora. - the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.

for just under 70% of overall market capitalization today, the boom ...","Apr 12, 2017,09:12pm EDT","Where’s the cryptocurrency market heading? Well, a prediction made in January over a boom in market capitalization of cryptocurrencies - and particularly in the altcoin market - by the founder of a crypto-market intelligence start-up that raised over 10,000 Ethereum (ETH) in a pre-sale financing round, has fully come to pass.","Maksim Balashevich, the Belarusian CEO and founder of Santiment based in Germany, which collects and sells live markets data feeds to crypto traders, predicted such a boom in altcoin cryptocurrency capitalization last quarter on January 5, 2017.And, even though bitcoin is the ‘Big Daddy’ of cryptocurrency and accounts for just under 70% of overall market capitalization today, the boom predicted would “outpace bitcoin by a wide margin” according the crypto-market platform’s CEO in Frankfurt Am Main.Based on the Elliott Wave theory, his prediction posited that the cryptocurrency altcoin markets would increase to over $6 billion (bn) in market capitalization. This has already come true and gone a fair way beyond. Fast forward and the combined altcoin market cap today stands in excess of $8.4bn. Some going and much aided by the recent strong performance of Ethereum (ETH), ranked the number two crypto currency behind bitcoin.A stack of bitcoins stand on top of U.S. dollar bills. (Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg).The Elliott Wave theory (or principle), which is named after professional accountant Ralph Nelson Elliott who developed the concept in the late 1930s, is a form of technical analysis that traders apply to analyse financial market cycles and forecast market trends by identifying extremes in investor psychology. The theory claims that markets enter periods of mass pessimism (negative/depression) and euphoria (positive/hype) that drive prices.The driver of this latest growth in the crypto space was cited as the increase in smart contract awareness and anonymous blockchain technologies.Digging a little deeper into the Elliott Wave theory, the move in the direction of the main trend is made of five waves, with corrections always being in three waves, and patterns repeat themselves on any time scale due to the fractal nature of the waves.Fear & GreedBalashevich, who has over a decade of experience in financial markets analysis, argued that the crypto markets are driven by fear (i.e. selling in panic almost at the bottom), greed (i.e. Buying close to the top in fear of missing out) and ignorance (i.e. entering an asset/project with weak fundamentals), with altcoins exhibiting particular “sensitivity to collective emotional impact as participants fear potentially missing out on rapid gains and extreme risks.”And, having good information at your fingers should help to spot the potential danger signs.The Minsk-born CEO who came to Germany in 2000, predicted that market sentiment in the altcoin market, which encompasses all digital coins except bitcoin, remains extremely bullish. He claimed that 2017 would see a “dramatic boom”, and that this boom is just getting started.‘Third of a Third’ WaveOn his blog from January, Balashevich wrote: “The altcoin market is entering the ‘third of a third’ wave in the Elliott Waves theory.""This represents a moment the crowd realizes that the main trend - either up or down - is occurring. “Following the recent rise in bitcoin, we believe the altcoin market is set to experience a similar bull market over the course of the next six to twelve months as cryptocurrency investment enters the mainstream conscious,” he contended at the time.Applying such wave analysis to the altcoin market since May 2013, Balashevich showed using graphs that the combined altcoin market capitalization (ex-bitcoin) was entering the so-called ‘third of a third’ wave. This point is regarded as something special in the Elliott Waves theory.Also at the time he stated: “It represents the capitalization of the entire crypto market and we have just had a decisive breakout to new highs. This means we are most likely entering the next wave of crypto acceptance and would not be surprised to see continually rising prices for most or all major crypto assets.”As an aside he noted that “it is, by the way, the only time the crowd is right about price direction” and the trend gets accepted by the majority. [Thereafter] the good news keep coming and the price steadily climbs higher.For practitioners of the science of waves patterns, looking at the whole crypto market at the start of this year it was noted that the pattern was slightly different and “close to the middle of wave 3”. It still required “a few sequences of up and down to finish this wave”, the CEO suggested. That said, moves in the latter would not be “as volatile and intense” as those in the alts-only market.By comparison at the time to the whole crypto market and based on the analysis presented, Balashevich asserted: “We can comfortably expect the alt-crypto market to rise substantially more in percentage terms than the bitcoin market over the next 6-12 months.”He added: “We might see ‘alts’ capitalization reach somewhere around $7bn. This figure is based on a typical Elliott Waves Fibonacci projection, where wave 3 is either 1.61 or 2.61 the size of wave 1. We saw wave 1 rise from $0.5bn to $2.8bn (a move of around +$2.3bn). So based on the next wave pattern, we could see an increase anywhere between $3.5bn and $6bn in the next move.” This has proven to have been exceeded.Smart Contracts & AnonymitySantiment, which is aimed at traders and investors that touts a network giving participants an ""information edge"" over the competitors thanks to machine learning and the wisdom of the crowd, predicts that areas focused on smart contracts and anonymity are set to benefit most from the next wave of investment in the cryptocurrency sector. This is given that these are areas that bitcoin has ""failed to innovate on"", according to the Belarusian.“Smart contracts could potentially have the greatest effect on the way we use the internet in the not-so-distant future,” Balashevich elaborated. “One way, which already exists now, is ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) and tokenized economies. ICOs have had their share of problems already - not all funded projects will deliver what they promise - and we might see an ICO bubble pop at some point.""Adding a caveat he stated: “Yet, ICOs are by far the most democratic, transparent, and frictionless ways to fund and run modern digital companies. I have little doubt that strong communities will be able to establish proper open-source environments to get the most out of this trend.”Noting at the start of 2017 that Ethereum appears to be the “de-facto platform of choice” for developing smart contracts and the rise of the ICO, Balashevich remarked: “Most ICOs are created here and we expect the trend to continue. The openness of Ethereum platform allows many teams to work together on building the many needed components , such as decentralized exchanges, mobile clients, CDNs (content delivery networks), oracles, prediction markets and stable cryptocurrencies…for running the modern digital companies.”The upshot - as predicted by the German-based Belarusian - was that ETH (the cryptocurrency behind Ethereum) alone, with all incorporated Ethereum blockchain companies, “could bring in a significant portion of this additional valuation.”Ranked number two cryptocurrency behind bitcoin, some have dubbed Ethereum ‘Bitcoin 2.0’. Trading at $46.43 today (April 12), its market cap currently stands at over $4bn. This is significantly up from just over $8 a pop at the start of this year with a then market cap of around $722 million. It rose to the $30 mark by middle of this March before reaching a peak at the end of last month - touching $53. But even with the recent dip in price, it has still added to the overall altcoin market capitalization.Still, one has to question if the altcoin market's performance overall is heavily dependent on the contribution of Ethereum for its market cap, what happens if there is a reversal in its price? On that score, only time will tell.But with hundreds of cryptocurrencies on the market one has to figure that there is junk out there amongst the winners. A point in fact, which Jack Tatar, CEO & President of Research at GEM Research in New York and co-author of 'What's The Deal With Bitcoins?', underlined in an engaging presentation ('Blockchain Assets & Investing In The Future') during a Coinsbank-hosted event last October in Turkey. As I recall his precise words at the time were ""some real garbage out there."" So it pays to pick wisely and do your research.Crowd SentimentSantiment’s crowd sentiment platform claims that it enables users to access “sentiment data that cannot be found anywhere else.” The theory and sales patter goes that this should enable faster and more profitable crypto-trading decisions.Furthermore, it can be used to earn tokens - Santiment Network Tokens - in ‘crypto-financial’ games or spend them to access what are described as “exclusive market insights.”By using their platform users are able to receive clear market analyses, chart trading data, visualize and compare sentiment data with friends to ""turn weaknesses into strengths"", and, benefit from a 'Battle-test' simulator.Earlier this year on February 13, Santiment raised 12,000 Ethereum (ETH) in an initial crowdfunding campaign in a matter of  2.5 hours, which is the equivalent today to around $525,000. The start-up, which had been a fair while in planning, stated after reaching its pre-sale goal that the venture would go to work on its white paper and MVP (Minimum Viable Product). It has also forged a number of partnerships that includes universities in Germany.Predicting The MarketOne might well ask is it possible at all to predict the market and the cryto market come to that? On that notes and as Balashevich noted in a separate blog at the back end of last year: “The truth is, no one can make predictions with 100% accuracy. It’s just the nature of the beast. I’ve come to accept that if no one can absolutely predict the market, it means we’re all in the same boat, guessing what will happen next.” Phew, so we are not alone on that front.But whatever investors in the crypto space do, it should go without saying don’t forget to store your crypto assets securely. Any gains built up over a sustained period of time in a cryptocurrency could be wiped out if this aspect not addressed properly."

He figured out that all bull cycles are made up of five waves, and once the five waves are complete, we will experience a correction that will bring the price down in three waves. The first wave is counted from a significant low, as shown here. The first and third waves are often related to each other by a standard ratio. And one of the three waves going upwards is extended to travel a distance that is much longer relative to the other two.Bitcoin's Wave 3 was extendedYou can see here that we started the wave count from a significant low posted in 2015, and the first wave was corrected by Wave 2. After that, we got one more upward thrust, the third wave, which went up quite a distance, 361.8% of the first wave.Once Bitcoin's third wave was completed, we got one more correction. Elliott Wave practitioners often look for this correction to relate to the prior impulse wave by a  Fibonacci ratio. In this case, wave 4 reached the 38.2% measure of wave 3.Bitcoin's wave 5 was related to wave 1 by 138.2%. Once the five waves were completed, a huge sell off has commenced.You might be wondering if we could have anticipated the end of the fifth wave before the price got there. Actually, it was possible, and the next few charts demonstrate this.We examine the fifth wave carefully and are able to see the Elliott Wave patterns quite clearly in the sub waves.It is indeed possible to anticipate the approximate area where the bull cycle is likely to finish, and take suitable action to lighten up one's position. Elliott Wave analysis thus gives the trader a powerful tool to plan his or her strategy well in advance. Numerous other examples of this technique is available both in the author's blog Wavetimes.com as well as his contributions to Forbes's Great Speculations column."

Bitcoin Assets",https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogeraitken/2017/05/19/disruptive-blockchain-backed-salt-loans-platform-in-launch-to-leverage-bitcoin-assets/,"Explained as “traditional lending secured by non-traditional collateral”,

It could have its merits.Specifically, what is being launching by SALT today is the concept and the ability to sign up for their waiting list along with being first in line to become members of their platform for membership.With the aim also to broaden blockchain technology’s global reach, the move comes as traditional banks are “currently under-serving their clients” by not recognizing the wealth inherent in blockchain assets, as the founders behind this initiative pointed out.When canvassed for evidence to support this, SALT told me at Forbes it had a “waiting list of borrowers” who want to use their loans service. According to conversations with these borrowers the project revealed that many of them have expressed this issue as “being a pain point.”(Image: Shutterstock).Explained as “traditional lending secured by non-traditional collateral”, with a SALT a borrower’s assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum can be fully acknowledged and used as collateral. In essence SALT seeks to streamline every step of the loan process, facilitating a new blockchain-backed lending market.The new lending platform, which is built on Ethereum ERC 20 smart contracts, enables borrowers access to what is described as “capital-on-demand” through its network of lenders. The upshot is that this helps preserve the value of investor holdings.Just imagine for a moment selling out your entire bitcoin holdings last year only to see the price shoot up to new record highs in 2017 and losing out on all that gain in the intervening period. That would have translated to a considerable loss in hundreds of dollars per bitcoin – unless one had bought the dips in between.So, if an investor has collateral they wish to retain, via SALT’s platform they can borrow in an asset they prefer to spend - regardless of credit history or geographic constraints. In so doing, the project’s Members can maintain a long position in a chosen blockchain asset as well as plan tax events.Shawn Owen, CEO of SALT, commenting in the wake of the launch with the platform slated for later this year, said: “Currently, if you are a holder of blockchain assets, a large piece of your financial wealth is not being recognized by lenders. With SALT, we see a future where virtually all of the world’s value is on blockchains, and lending is reflective of our globally-connected, digitized lives.”Blockchain Assets as CollateralAs to the suitability of blockchain assets as collateral, a section on the SALT website stated: “Blockchain assets are an ideal form of collateral because they are inexpensive to transfer, store, and liquidate when compared to traditional forms of collateral like real estate or stocks.”It further stated their FAQ section on the project's site: “The key innovation of the blockchain is its distributed, peer-to-peer ledger. The blockchain allows for the highly efficient management of collateral in a transparent and publicly viewable manner. This eliminates fraud, and greatly lowers transaction costs.”The claimed too that they “can offer more competitive interest rates to both our borrowers and lenders” since SALT Lending is built to capitalize on the advantages of the blockchain.How The System Works* Collateral remains the property of the borrower and any price appreciation or depreciation belongs to the borrower.Loans made through the platform are both denominated in and repaid with traditional currencies, while blockchain assets are only provided by borrowers for use as collateral to secure their loans. Borrowers can elect to pay off their loans early without being charged a prepayment penalty.Members are not required to have blockchain assets to become a lender on the platform. Lenders must be accredited investors under Regulation D of 17 CFR § 230.501 et seq. in the United States under the Securities Act of 1933 and the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission, and have passed SALT’s Lending Suitability Test. SALT indicated it planned to license the technology to existing lenders and regulated entities such as Broker Dealers, Private Equity funds, family offices, etc.By focusing on the value of the borrower’s assets instead of their credit score, SALT has asserted that it is able to “dramatically reduce the complexity and costs of the loan process.”During the life of the loan, the platform monitors both the value of the underlying collateral and keeps it securely stored in a fully-audited smart contract architecture.The historical limitations of liquidating, transferring and storing assets has forced lenders to focus on the creditworthiness of their borrowers, which restricts the amount of capital that lenders can deploy. The result is the simultaneous increase in the cost to borrowers in the form of higher interest rates, and a decrease in the supply of available capital, according to SALT.Credit history clearly becomes very important as income is typically used as the primary source of repayment, followed by assets such as real estate and other forms of physical assets as a secondary form.Owen pointed out here: “Tangible assets are typically not used exclusively for a primary form of repayment due to the cost and burden associated with perfecting, taking position of, and liquidating. As such we are highlighting the ability to do the reverse when dealing with blockchain assets.”It was back in around 2008 that the Bitcoin blockchain established a new paradigm for transferring and storing value through distributed ledgers. This evolutionary leap allows lenders to recognize the value of a borrower’s assets and completely eliminates the need for credit to play a role in lending decisions.Erik Voorhees, Shapeshift’s CEO and founder and a member of SALT’s board of directors, posited that: “SALT’s disruptive innovation is an important project for broadening the usefulness and global reach of blockchain technology.”The BorrowersThe initial step to becoming a borrower on the platform is to purchase a SALT Membership, which has varying levels depending on the features that are intended to be used. Subsequent to that they must create an account with SALT Lending within the financial ecosystem.SALT pointed out that it does not perform a credit check on borrowers, but undertakes full Anti-money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) verification checks. Once a Member is verified as eligible to transact with SALT, a loan can be requested and processed.Prior to the full live launch of the platform, which is anticipated during the fourth quarter of 2017 but with no specific date being given, SALT membership will be made available to the public at a deep discount.Ultimately the success of SALT will depend on ‘buy-in’ from lenders and borrowers. Of course time only will tell in this endeavour that is facilitating a new market for loans that is held up as “cost-effective, fair…protecting the investments of both lenders and borrowers.”But given that lately a wall of money has been thrown at crowd funded initiatives and initial coin offerings (ICOs) in the rapidly growing crypto asset class space prospects might appear - bar a force majeure - to be set pretty fair. Others may argue the jury is out for now until concrete signs of traction are seen. In the interim further updates will be communicated directly to SALT's member base over the next two months."

Once a ...","Apr 4, 2017,09:00am EDT","The Great Recession of the mid-2000s forced us to view economics, banking, wealth and security in new ways. The concept of asset protection, already a growing area, saw an explosion in popularity, which has given rise to an ever-evolving cat and mouse game between creditors and debtors and their respective advisors. Meanwhile, distrust in banks and governments fueled the creation and rise of Bitcoin, which spurred interest in new digital currencies relying upon similar technologies.","My firm practices asset protection, catering to professionals, entrepreneurs and investors who seek both domestic and international asset protection strategies. In this article, I will discuss the technology underlying virtual digital currencies and how it might play a role in asset protection.What is cryptocurrency?Virtual digital currencies (or “cryptocurrencies”) operate on decentralized databases called blockchains. Blockchains function as publicly distributed ledgers, verifying and permanently recording asset transfer transactions between buyers and sellers without the need for a trusted third party. These technological breakthroughs are enabling the new, digitized economy.Blockchain introduced technology that solved a long-standing computer science problem, known as the “double-spend” problem, eliminating the potential for an unscrupulous or unknowing buyer to spend the same money more than once. A “trustless” ledger system employs public key cryptography to ensure transaction inputs are not duplicated. There is no need for third-party intermediaries. Transactions are grouped and recorded in blocks, then linked to the last block in the chain. A system of consensus and cryptography validate each of the transactions.In the Bitcoin protocol, transactions are validated by “miners” who receive Bitcoins as a reward (or premium) for their processing efforts. Once a sufficient consensus of miners has validated the cryptographic hash of a transaction, the information is recorded in a “block.” Successive blocks of transaction data are built upon previous blocks to form a chain – hence the name “blockchain.” The process of recording transactions in interconnected blocks creates an immutable, time-stamped ledger that is not subject to manipulation by any person, company or government.With the absence of a middleman and by existing on a distributed ledger in cyberspace, digital currencies are effectively borderless and can represent stores of value in all parts of the globe. Bitcoin, the most recognized digital currency, is not controlled by any centralized government entity or organization, but instead by willing participants (generally the miners) that build and maintain the chain.Blockchain transactions are semi-anonymous – or “pseudonymous.” Each transfer of value on the ledger is publicly viewable, but parties to the transaction are known only by a string of numbers serving as a public key address. (Bitcoin transactions are publicly viewable in real time at www.blockchain.info.) Anonymous users manipulate ownership and transfer of Bitcoin with their private key, a separate string of numbers generally kept secret. This ability to engage in transactions pseudonymously (coupled with the absence of intermediaries) makes Bitcoin the currency of choice for gray and black market transactions. The infamous Silk Road website relied upon Bitcoin payments and, more recently, Bitcoin has become the preferred payment for cybercriminals, such as those engaged in the rising epidemic of cyber-ransom.What is legitimate asset protection?The pseudonymous (and borderless) nature of digital currencies inevitably leads to a discussion of using Bitcoin for asset protection. The assumption is that, with anonymity, ownership of cryptocurrencies could be an effective and efficient means to hide wealth. There are a couple of flaws with this assumption, the first of which is what constitutes legitimate (and defensible) asset protection.Legitimate asset protection involves strategic planning to protect against unknown future claims. This point is lost on misinformed debtors who seek protection after they’ve defaulted on a debt, been sued or face divorce. Reactionary transfers – those made with intent to avoid a creditor – are subject to being unwound by courts as “fraudulent transfers.” For maximum effectiveness, implementation of an asset protection plan must begin before creditor clouds start to form.A key but often overlooked element of effective asset protection is transparency. If you are sued and become subject to a money judgment, you will be asked about – and required to disclose – details about your assets, including bank accounts, investments, and real and personal property ownership. Digital currency ownership would be subject to complete disclosure. The inquiry would not be limited to a current snapshot. An effective creditor’s lawyer will look at account histories and title chains and scrutinize transfers made during and immediately before a lawsuit to flush out potential fraudulent transfers.ConclusionIn the digital currency world, transactions are forever documented on the blockchain. The blockchain’s immutable, time-stamped ledger renders manipulation of transfer and ownership data practically impossible. Since the timing of transfers is a key component to legitimate asset protection, a blockchain record of transfers can be critical in either validating or undermining the legitimacy of strategic asset transfers.Could Bitcoin and other digital currencies be useful in asset protection? Sure, but like cash hidden under a mattress, failure to disclose such ownership may constitute perjury and subject a debtor to contempt proceedings. Using cryptocurrencies with the intention of concealing ownership is not legitimate asset protection. It is simply lying and fraud, which can and should lead to harsh consequences.This is not to suggest cryptocurrencies have no place as one component of legitimate asset protection. In fact, Bitcoin’s unique nature, as a store of value existing on a public, immutable, time-stamped ledger, coupled with its relative ease of use (particularly across borders) and the high speed at which transactions are settled, offers promise for incorporating cryptocurrency ownership into comprehensive asset protection planning. The intent, however, should not be to hide assets and fly under the radar, but instead to document the occurrence and timing of transactions. In this manner, blockchain transactions might validate legitimate planning with legally defensible transparency.The information provided here is not legal advice and does not purport to be a substitute for advice of counsel on any specific matter.

Listen to my whole interview with Bobby here or on Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher or TuneIn Radio.","Bobby Lee is chief executive of BTCC, one of the world’s longest-running cryptocurrency exchanges.He got into bitcoin early through his brother, Charlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin, the cryptocurrency often called digital silver, as opposed to bitcoin, the digital gold.Before that, Lee was Walmart’s vice president of technology in China, and an engineer at Yahoo. (And before all that, he was in my freshman dorm at Stanford — just for the record.)“Truth be told,” he says, “in 2011, six years ago, I did not fully understand the impact and fundamentals of bitcoin.” He mined a few coins that summer and fall — about 20 coins — but when his wife asked him what the computers were for, he replied, “just some servers,” and when the heat they were generating became too great, he shut them off.However, he did promise himself at the time that if he ever did a startup, he would do one in bitcoin, which is how he ended up becoming a cofounder of BTC China, which is now under parent company BTCC.In the latest episode of my podcast Unchained (Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher or TuneIn Radio), Lee recounts how, back when he started in bitcoin, whenever he would ask people in China if they had heard of bitcoin, no one had. Then, within a year, it became a worldwide media sensation and a hot commodity for traders. He also tells the story of how his experience working during the early days of the internet gave him the idea for no-fee trading, which was driving huge trading volumes in China — an estimated 95% of transactions worldwide — until early this year.Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCCIn addition to the exchange, BTCC runs a mining pool in which it gathers together people who have mining equipment but want to be part of a group to even out their earnings in bitcoin into a steady paycheck rather than a big payday every few weeks or months. Recently, the company has begun offering services more in line with its ambitions to be an international cryptocurrency company. For instance, its wallet, Mobi.me, an iOS and Android app, supports 100+ currencies and comes with a debit card. Its BTCC Mint creates physical bitcoins made of titanium that contain the private key for a bitcoin account. And in a creative combination of BTCC’s many services, the bitcoins in the physical coins are freshly mined, never-before-used ones from BTCC’s mining pool. Despite BTCC’s new international focus, Lee’s location in China does give him some insight into the Chinese perspective on and activity around bitcoin. He does admit “People always, always come and ask me about it — how do I use bitcoin to evade capital controls?” (Those are the limits the Chinese government imposes on sending Chinese yuan out of the country.) However, Lee says, “I haven’t seen that happen on any scale. People may do that with $100 or $1,000 but we have not seen any evading capital controls on anything in excess of $100,000 or $1 million.” Tune in to hear why he believes many fewer people are using bitcoin to evade capital controls than you might think.Lee gives the lowdown on the Chinese government’s attitude toward bitcoin, which hasn’t officially changed since late 2013, plus the changes that China-based cryptocurrency exchanges have been making after a visit by Chinese government regulators in early January that caused bitcoin’s price to take a dive.The upshot has been a dramatic shift in the trading of cryptocurrency in China, where, due to higher demand, exchanges for the last few years have sported higher prices than exchanges in other geographies. Now, Lee says, prices within China have diverged — on Chinese exchanges, the cost of a bitcoin is a bit lower, but prices in China’s over-the-counter (OTC) market, in which people buy directly from each other without using an exchange to facilitate the trade, are higher, closer to what a bitcoin costs in U.S. dollars.Tune in to the episode (Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher, TuneIn Radio, web) to hear how Lee believes Chinese people view bitcoin differently from Westerners; what Chinese opinions are of Ethereum, another blockchain-based network focused on smart contracts; and what the beleaguered Bitcoin Foundation, where Lee is a board member, is up to.He also discusses what developments he expects in bitcoin this year, plus why millennials and the comparison to gold make him optimistic for bitcoin’s future. “We’re on a multi-decade mission,” he says of his expectations for further adoption and price appreciation in bitcoin. But he finds the industry especially exciting now: “It’s never a boring day in the bitcoin space.”Update, Wednesday, March 22, 1:40am EST: This article has been corrected to say BTC China is now a subsidiary of BTCC and that Mobi now supports 100+ currencies.Thursday, April 6, 2017: The original article incorrectly reported the number of bitcoins Lee mined in 2011. It was around 20.These are the show notes for the Unchained podcast, sponsored by OnRamp. Listen to my whole interview with Bobby here or on Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher or TuneIn Radio."

Some U.S. states may find the concept of self-settled trusts anathema to public policy and thus choose to ignore the trust and treat the grantor/beneficiary as the de facto owner of trust assets.Offshore limited liability companies are similarly exposed. Consider, for instance, a Florida resident who forms a Nevis, single-member LLC to shelter assets in a Florida bank account. If that individual is sued, Nevis law limits the judgment creditor’s remedy to a lien on LLC proceeds (called a “charging order”). The charging order would not entitle the creditor to take control of the LLC in Nevis. If the creditor were to sue in Florida, however, a Florida court might ignore Nevis law (as it would apply to ownership of the LLC) and permit the creditor to foreclose on the LLC interest. As the new owner, the creditor would have direct access to the LLC bank account and any other assets owned by the LLC. Farfetched? This is essentially what happened in Wells Fargo v. Barber.
As highlighted by the Barber case, effective implementation of offshore asset protection requires that assets be transferred to a safe location outside the reach of U.S. courts. Assets must also remain outside the direct control of members and beneficiaries. Courts have mechanisms, via contempt orders, to impose sanctions, fines and jail time to compel a debtor to disclose and turn over assets unless it is truly impossible for the debtor to comply. (While there are colorful examples of jailed debtors under contempt, bona fide impossibility is a valid defense.)Digital Asset ProtectionDigital assets, like cryptocurrencies, offer a way to keep assets safely away from potentially hostile U.S. courts because they exist entirely on a decentralized digital ledger known as the blockchain.Cryptocurrency transactions are executed on the blockchain via a two-key system. The keys include an address (public) key and a secret (private) key. Think of the address as a transparent envelope. Anyone can see inside the envelope, but only the secret key can open it to access the contents. Keys are simply a sequence of numbers and letters. The secret key remains under the owner’s control and provides the ability to transfer the asset. “Transfer” is somewhat of a misnomer, as assets don’t actually move. Rather, the blockchain ledger is updated to reflect the transfer of ownership. The right to spend digital currency is granted to the holder of the secret key corresponding to the address posted in the blockchain. Additionally, an address can be created to require a combination of multiple secret keys (multiple owners) to be spent (transferred).A critical point is that anyone with the appropriate secret key(s) can execute the transfer of the asset. Keys are often kept on a computer or mobile device, but they can also be stored on detached storage devices (such as a USB drive), a sheet of paper in a safe (referred to as “cold storage”), or even memorized (although relying on so-called “brain wallets” may not be advisable). In the most simplistic terms, using cryptocurrency in asset protection may simply involve the transfer of a private key to an offshore trustee (or manager).Properly selected offshore trustees are unlikely to become subject to the jurisdiction of a court where a defendant may be sued. Absent jurisdictional authority, a court is powerless to compel the trustee to turn over assets. An added benefit is that blockchains are decentralized. This means they are not subject to any central authority (such as a bank or other financial institution) that might be legally compelled to provide a court with access or control over assets in its possession. Without the complete private key, no court or legal authority can manipulate ownership of a blockchain asset.Worries about a rogue trustee or manager can be allayed by requiring multiple keys, such that two (or more) parties are required for access. Those parties could be co-trustees, a trustee and trust protector, co-managers, or a manager and member of a board of directors. A trustee acting alone would have no ability to unilaterally access that portion of trust assets requiring multiple keys. Cryptocurrency assets could also be divided, such that a small portion of currency remains under a single trustee’s control whereas a larger portion is restricted and remains in cold storage subject to joint-key access.Because cryptocurrency transactions are semi-transparent and are time-stamped on the blockchain, ready proof is available to legitimize the timing and propriety of protective transfers. Transfers made well before assertion of a claim are far less likely to be challenged by creditors and courts. Such proof and transparency may be particularly useful when facing the threat of a contempt order, as mentioned above.The Future Of Digital CurrencyAdditionally, unique potential exists for digital currencies as programmable money. It is not beyond the realm of possibility that digital currencies may one day be programmed to respond to pre-defined duress situations and to execute certain functions in the form of so-called “smart contracts.” For instance, assets under control of a trustee who reports being summoned to appear in a hostile court might be programmed to immediately transfer to a successor trustee. Similarly, a trustee who fails to account to beneficiaries at pre-designated times might be effectively removed in a similar fashion by self-executing currency. As the technology develops and becomes more refined, smart contracts and the concept of programmable money will inevitably be integrated into asset protection planning.The possibilities are utterly astonishing and as these financial technologies further evolve, so will additional use cases. This is just the very tip of the asset protection iceberg. Even now, cryptocurrencies, with their unique digital properties, transparency and decentralization, offer exciting, leading-edge opportunities as effective and legitimate modern asset protection tools.The information provided here is not legal advice and does not purport to be a substitute for advice of counsel on any specific matter.

Of that over $18 billion is represented by the over 16 million circulating bitcoins which are worth, as I write this $1,130.72 each.  Two other currencies, Etherium and Ripple, have more than a billion dollars in market capitalization.  There are six others with capitalization over $100 million.To compare all this to another form of currency that allows confidential transactions and holds value pretty well there are over one trillion dollars worth of hundred dollar bills in circulation. So Benjamin Franklin is holding his own for now. Bitcoin has already topped pictures of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson combined.  It tops the $14 billion worth of pictures of Abraham Lincoln and is close to old Alexander.  Maybe there will be a Broadway musical called Bicoin in a couple of centuries. Of course the actual dollar money supply is more complicated than all that green paper floating around, but I will leave it to an economist as to whether the proper comparison to cyrtocurrencies is M0 or M1 or M2, etc.The two most important concepts to understand if you want to understand bitcoin are the blockchain and mining.  I want you to make a study of them and then explain them to me.  As tax preparers go, I'm pretty good at math.  As it happens, though, you learn all the math you need to do tax work by the fourth grade.  Here is the important part for you and me to know in order to evaluate dibcoin. Bitcoin ""mining"" which somehow insures the integrity of the blockchain (thereby making sure that each bitcoin is only owned by one ""wallet"") requires the expenditure of significant computer resources.  It is hard and scheduled to keep getting harder which is what insures the scarcity of bitcoins.  That and people losing the keys to their wallets which is kind of like all those Spanish ships full of doubloons that have sunk reducing the hard money supply.What Is Special About Dibcoins?I spoke with Honson Luma, VP of Sunshine Capital, Inc and DIB Funding, Inc who is the creator of  Dibcoin.  He did his best to explain to me the concept of ""Omni Layer"".  It was a little like me trying to explain the 704(b) regulations and the concept of ""partners interest in the partnership""  to my son's dog.  At any rate according to its website Omni Layer is an ""open-source, fully decentralized asset platform on the Bitcoin Blockchain"".  It goes on to further elucidate:Omni is a platform for creating and trading custom digital assets and currencies. It is a software layer built on top of the most popular, most audited, most secure blockchain -- Bitcoin. Omni transactions are Bitcoin transactions that enable next-generation features on the Bitcoin Blockchain. Our reference implementation, Omni Core is an enhanced Bitcoin Core that provides all the features of Bitcoin as well as advanced Omni Layer features.Got that? Good.  We can meet up at Carl's Diner in Oxford and you can explain it to me.  At any rate, the important point is that the  Omni Layer allows anybody who wants to to set up a new crytpocurrency without investing a lot in infrastructure. Dibcoin is number 89 on the Omni platform.There is no mining of Dibcoins.  They are pre-mined. All 5 billion of them started out being owned by Dib Funding Inc.  Here is the genius part.DIBCOIN will be the first cryptocurrency to be used by a public company to acquire existing profitable private companies. Sunshine Capital will use DIBCOIN as a monetary instrument, to acquire companies and assets, building its portfolio with no debt.About Sunshine Capital?Dib Funding owned most of Sunshine Capital Inc, but if you want a piece, you can buy some on the OTC.  As I write this Sunshine is priced at $4 per share.  Not that I was going to buy it, but when I asked my investment adviser who works for one of those big outfits, he told me that I probably couldn't buy it through his firm.  They consider anything under ten bucks a share to be a ""penny stock"" and way too volatile.Sunshine Capital, Inc's unaudited financial statements do not appear all that impressive with just over $20,000 in gross income in 2016 for a net loss a bit over $30,000.  Assets consist of about $2,500 in cash.  Among the liabilities are notes payable of $5,500 to James Scheltema, a recent president of Sunshine who pleaded guilty to filing false tax returns and tax evasion in January.  Here is where the genius comes back in.In February, most of Sunshine's stock was cancelled leaving 16,977,000 shares.  President Adam Petty commented:""The controlling shareholder has canceled their shares to guarantee the success of this Company and to increase the book value of all remaining shares outstanding,"" Stated, Adam Petty, President and CEO of Sunshine Capital, Inc. ""With the cancellation of these shares, every penny ($.01) DIBCOIN trades at, once trading commences in the near future, will instantly provide Sunshine Capital, Inc. access to nearly $40,000,000 in capital and results in a net asset value, of Sunshine Capital, Inc., stock by approximately two dollars and thirty-five cents ($2.35) per share.""With the commencement of trading of Dibcoin on Livecoin, Honson Luma exclaimed:""In months, we have done something that takes other companies years to achieve!"" exclaimed Honson Luma, Vice President of Sunshine Capital, Inc. ""What the investment world needs to understand is that for every penny DIBCOIN trades at, it gives our Company approximately $40 Million Dollars in liquid assets. So, a single penny should increase Sunshine Capital, Inc.'s book value approximately $2.35 a share.""According to Livecoin, the last Dibcoin transaction was at 0.00087 BTC, which works out to about a dollar.  Dibcoin at a buck, seems to be what they were shooting for when they retired all corporate debt with Dibcoins at a dollar.  According to the financial statements Sunshine had less than $12,000 in liabilities at 12/31/16, so maybe that is not so dramatic.Nonetheless, Dibcoins at a buck means Sunshine is worth $235 per share.  And you can get it for $4 if you have a broker without a picky compliance department.That's the compelling story I get from Ernie Land and Honson Luma.  I really like Ernie, but he can sometimes get carried away.  When I gave him a hard time about how his fellow Hovindicator was bad mouthing Jesuits, I told him that I had eight years of Jesuit education (Xavier High School 1970, College of the Holy Cross 1974).  Somehow, that got translated into me having been a Jesuit for eight years, which would be equivalent to my four years as a JROTC cadet in the late sixties making me a Vietnam veteran. Ernie believes that the world is about six thousand years old and dinosaurs existed contemporaneously with humans. Honson Luma emphasized to me that Rx Smart Coffee is just one of Sunshine's potential acquisitions and they are not staking their credibility on Ernie's endorsement.  Ernie, himself, has not claimed a big role in Sunshine.  He does see this as his chance to make up for missing out on the bitcoin run-up.The Tax ProblemIn my discussion with Honson Luma he seemed to be of the opinion that virtual currency only generates taxable income when it is exchanged for US dollars.  The guidance issued by IRS in Notice 2o14-21 indicates that virtual currency is property.  Generally when property is exchanged for other property gain or loss is recognized.  If we assume that Sunshine has zero basis in its Dibcoins, that means it will recognize gain on each acquisition.  That might mean that it only has $3 billion to work with after tax, give or take.  But it could be worse. Consider this from Notice 2012-21Q-8: Does a taxpayer who “mines” virtual currency (for example, uses computer resources to validate Bitcoin transactions and maintain the public Bitcoin transaction ledger) realize gross income upon receipt of the virtual currency resulting from those activities?A-8: Yes, when a taxpayer successfully “mines” virtual currency, the fair market value of the virtual currency as of the date of receipt is includible in gross income. See Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income, for more information on taxable income.Was the listing on Livecoin a taxable event equivalent to a bitcoin miners success?  I actually don't think so, but it would cause me to lose a bit a sleep. The demand for dollars to pay taxes from the gains recognized on the acquisition do, in my mind, pose a threat to the structure, as the need to convert dibcoins to dollars could drive their value down.You will likely to be able to buy some of the Rx Smart Coffee Gentlemen's Blend for dibcoins before long, in the event you are having issues with your male vigor.  I expect you will have to use dollars to pay your taxes for the foreseeable future, though.We'll see if the whole enterprise lasts long enough for taxes to be a problem.  I do have my doubts.Other OpinionsI got some thoughts on the future course of Sunshine Capital Inc from Alma Angotti, Managing Director, Global Investigations & Compliance, Navigant Consulting.  She wrote me:Securities regulators will likely have concerns about the accuracy of the company’s disclosures, particularly if and when they start to invest in other companies. This reminds me of a blind pool or blank check offering in which the company offering securities does not identify a specific acquisition target or line of business. Those kinds of investments can be risky. The stock price of Sunshine Capital has been very volatile.As for the Dibcoin, regulators and law enforcement will focus on the anonymity, cross border / cross currency capability and lack of regulatory oversight. Because of these attributes, the product could be used to commit tax evasion, money laundering and fraud. Although they say that Dibcoin is built on top of the bitcoin blockchain, that does not necessarily mean that it is tied to the price of bitcoin. Since there is no mining of Dibcoin, and there is already a certain amount in circulation (5 billion), the price of Dibcoin is set by the issuer. Regulators will likely closely scrutinize the transactions executed through the exchange of Dibcoin.Most of the ""coverage"" of dibcoin has been press releases from Sunshine Capital, Inc or Dib Funding, Inc.  A post on beyondbitcoin expressed extreme skepticism.Wouldn't It Be Great If This Could Work?More than anything else Dibcoin reminds me of a short story by Poul Anderson titled Fairy Gold which is nicely summarized here. A young man is rewarded for helping an elf with fairy gold.  Fairy gold is just like real gold at night but turns into trash when the sun rises.  A series of transactions occur.  The last one is by the hero's former girl friend who sells her grandmother's business, before the coin goes poof, but it is fine because now she can live happily ever after with the hero.  I'm sure a feminist critique of the story would find it problematical, but that's not going to bother Poul Anderson who died in 2001.It also reminds me a bit of the real story of Alfves dos Reis, chronicled in The Man Who Stole Portugal.  Reis convinced the British bank note company working for the Bank of Portugal to print 200,000 500 escudo notes for him and his crew.  His plan, which almost succeeded was to use some of the money to buy control of the Bank of Portugal, which would have retroactively made his notes valid.Of course everything that Adam Petty and Honson Luma and Ernie Land are doing is in the open.  The only thing I find a bit disingenuous is the notion that somehow having a public company hold all the dibcoins makes them more valuable.  Particularly a public company that based on its own financial statements does not otherwise appear to be worth the powder to blow it away.  I might also add that even after all this time,  I'm still not a believer in bitcoins, more or less the gold standard of cryptocurrencies, as a long run store of value. In the MIT Technology Review Jamie Condiffe wrote""Why Bitcoin's $1,000 Value Doesn't Matter"".  Quoting the Financial Times we get:For context, the Central Intelligence Agency put the planet’s stock of broad money—notes, coins, and various forms of bank account—at $82tn as of the end of 2014. On the CIA figures, the value of bitcoins hashed into existence is similar to the broad money total for Uzbekistani soms. With apologies to Tashkent, the value of soms and bitcoins, and the number of people for whom they are relevant pieces of information in the world of modern finance, both round to zero.So maybe the Dibcoin believers will be able to mock me in a couple of years.  I can take it."

Inclusion Issue",https://www.forbes.com/sites/chynes/2017/04/21/virtual-currencies-could-spread-financial-inclusion-one-mobile-phone-at-a-time/,"The “across borders” benefits have led to the launch of Bitcoin startups in 
places like the Philippines, where remittances from overseas Filipino ...","Apr 21, 2017,08:51pm EDT",(Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images),"In 2016, staff members within the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggested that virtual currencies could promote financial inclusion. The IMF issued the standard cautions about how virtual currencies (VCs) might be used for money laundering, terrorism and other nefarious purposes. But it also wrote that, “VCs offer many potential benefits, including greater speed and efficiency in making payments and transfer--particularly across borders--and ultimately promoting financial inclusion.”The “across borders” benefits have led to the launch of Bitcoin startups in places like the Philippines, where remittances from overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) contribute more than $26 billion to the economy. Such was the case with Coins, a mobile-first, blockchain-based platform that facilitates remittances, bill payments and mobile airtime top-ups. “I was initially looking for a way to solve the issue of expensive cross-border payments, which lead me to blockchain technologies and how they could be used to provide widespread financial access in general,” said Justin Leow, head of business operations for Coins. Since its launch in 2014, Coins has signed up half a million users and partnered with retail outlets, banks, and other financial service institutions to create a distribution network of more than 22,000 cash disbursement and collection locations in the Philippines. In late 2016, the company raised $5 million in a Series A fundraising round. “Our mission is to make sure our customers are able to access the financial services that they need, and building our platform on top of the blockchain has been an important component of that effort,” Leow said via email. “As long as people will continue to need cheap remittances [and] money transfers and access to financial services, we see blockchain technology as a growing area that would be able to affect positive change.”Leow said Coins has been able to lower remittance costs from 7-8% to about 2-3% for its customers, including those who use it for bill pay and remittances, as well as merchants and service providers who accept bitcoin. The company’s ultimate goal is “to increase financial inclusion by delivering financial services directly to people through their mobile phones.”Experts see remittances as an area that could be ripe for VC disruption. The Philippines is not the only country with a high population of overseas workers whose families depend on their remittances. High transaction fees and slow or inconvenient transfer services create extreme hardships on people who who can’t afford to spend hours claiming one payment, or who live far from banks or shops that manage remittance payments. “The costs of these transactions – which can average as high as 12% in Sub-Saharan Africa – hit the poor the hardest. Technological advances like cryptocurrency and distributed ledgers may offer a solution,” Dr. Garrick Hileman, a cryptocurrency researcher at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, told Phys.org. ""It would be surprising to me if in 30 years from now we aren't looking back and saying yes this was a watershed moment for financial inclusion, and that cryptocurrency and distributed ledgers played a significant role in opening up access to the financial system in developing economies.""A 2016 KPMG article indicated that more than 70 percent of the population in Southeast Asia is unbanked, leaving hundreds of millions at steep disadvantages for achieving financial security. Not having a bank account excludes people from a range of financial products, but fintech companies see mobile technology as a means of closing that gap. Startups like Coins, which use cryptocurrencies behind the scenes to offer fast, low-cost services to their customers, may be on the front lines of improving financial inclusion in Southeast Asia and the rest of the world. Thanks to growing mobile phone penetration, even low-income consumers can take advantage of their services. “One of the important ways to increase financial inclusion is facilitating the transition from people being purely cash-based to be able to access and use [their] money online. In this regard, cryptocurrencies work very well as railways for seamless fund transfers and being able to pay for services,” Leow said. “The advantage that cryptocurrencies provide relative to other closed-loop systems is that anyone can be connected to the payment network very easily and services can be made available to anyone else on the network.” Remittances and mobile payments aren’t the only ways blockchain technology facilitates inclusion. “I think payments will continue to be a key functionality for blockchain technologies with adoption continuing to increase as more businesses recognize its advantages,” Leow said. “At the same time, I think that there are also a lot of application-specific solutions using the blockchain for purposes such as digital identity management and smart contracts that are actively being explored that are causing us to rethink how many (typically expensive) business processes are being done.”For instance, Acudeen, a Filipino fintech startup that helps small businesses by streamlining the invoicing process, uses blockchain technology to ensure that its clients’ contracts are secure. If cryptocurrency does become mainstream, it will likely do so quietly, at least as far as the average consumer is concerned. Luis Buenaventura,  chief technology officer of Bloom Solutions and author of Reinventing Remittances With Bitcoin, told me for a previous article that Bitcoin is “probably best off as a backend technology."" Similar to the protocols behind email systems, blockchain technology may drive common services, but users won’t ever interact with it. Leow shared a sentiment similar to Buenaventura’s. “The challenge from a financial inclusion standpoint is how to facilitate access to these technologies in such a way that easily transitions people from using purely cash,” he said. “We should remember that at the end of the day, people want to get things done and generally care less about the actual implementation of how that happens.”"

In recent years, the necessity of this “go-it-alone” approach to daily life has led to first-in-the-world technological strides.","Ukrainian bank notes in 2014. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Ukrainian frustration with the corrupt status quo boiled over in 2014, leading to the Euromaidan revolution and the ousting of Kremlin ally Viktor Yanukovych. But beyond the photo-ready scenes of violent confrontation, ensuing economic instability saw a digital revolution silently take hold in the form of an almost unparalleled adoption of digital “crypto-currencies,” such as bitcoin.Bitcoin is based on so-called “blockchain” technology, a “centralized but decentralized” concept that helps the currency simultaneously balance security, anonymity and fiscal stability. The blockchain is “centralized” in that it serves as a ledger by which digital transactions—say, sending a single bitcoin to an online vendor—are tracked to ensure that, for example, the bitcoin is actually yours and not a digital copy. But the ledger is also “decentralized,” in that it’s distributed widely and open to the public, allowing no single party or group to game the system. The result is an ostensibly open, transparent system of currency.Watch On Forbes: Meet The Ukrainian Hackers Targeting The Kremlin's Master ManipulatorUkraine has been nothing short of passionate in its embrace of bitcoin, with many citizens using the currency as a hedge against extreme inflation and an unstable hryvnia that has lost 80% of its value amid ongoing turmoil. In 2014, nearly 5,000 BNK-24 ATM terminals nationwide began offering the option to buy bitcoins for cash as effortlessly as one would conduct any other automated banking transaction. Last year saw one Ukrainian bitcoin-selling service report a five-fold increase in demand, and the country also became the first regulated market in the world to begin offering futures on bitcoin contracts.But perhaps most notably, the Ukrainian government has sought to apply the promising technology’s tell-tale transparency to its process of auctioning state property. In 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed, Ukraine underwent a sort-of “revolution without a revolution."" The same basic, established power structures remained in place, despite an ostensibly more democratic government that had, in reality, done little more than change the titles on its business cards.As Ukrainian historian Dr. Serhy Yekelchyk writes in Ukraine: Birth of a Modern Nation: ""The new elites were essentially the old Soviet bureaucrats in Ukraine who came to power as a result of imperial collapse rather than revolution and thus felt no need to develop either democratic institutions or a market economy.""With former party elites maintaining their positions of power under a different banner, the process of auctioning off state assets to the private sector became a lucrative target for the unethical. With a small group of elites controlling the auction process, access could be used to curry favor and to line the pockets of the country’s entrenched oligarchs. Both ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko—nicknamed the “gas princess” for the fortune she amassed in the natural gas industry—are among the high-ranking officials alleged by court documents to have benefited from such practices.Last July, at a blockchain-related conference in Odessa—one of two Ukrainian bitcoin conferences held in 2016, both of which drew sellout crowds—Minister of Finance Oleksandr Danylyuk laid out plans to move the auction process from a paper-based system to the new blockchain-based “Auction 3.0” system, thereby ensuring transactions would be public and fully transparent. The efficiency of the system—which represents one component of a “Cashless Economy Project” undertaken by the National Bank of Ukraine slated to run through 2020—promises a number of additional benefits, including significant cost savings and a dramatic decrease in the bureaucracy needed to run the system.The timing of this dramatic rush toward digital currencies is not without a certain sad irony. Ukraine is perhaps the nation most singularly affected by the foreign policy shifts following the election of President Donald Trump. Trump’s unabashed willingness to cozy up to Russia, whose ongoing military presence in Ukraine underlies many of the nation’s economic woes, represents a waning opportunity for Ukrainians who had hoped for a more hard-line stance from the United States. With a long history of Westward-reaching diplomacy, even under Soviet rule, the country became the third-largest recipient of American foreign aid by the end of the 1990s, despite only achieving independence in 1991.Thus even as the idealized ally upon which Ukraine modeled its very constitution finds itself rushing headlong into that which Ukraine has long sought to flee, Ukraine’s commitment to blazing new trails in the name of transparency represents a commendable example for an American political sphere increasingly marked by intentional obfuscation and “alternative facts.”Mr. Carnes previously served as communications director for Rep. Trent Franks (R-AZ) and Rep. Darrell Issa (CA-49)."

price.","Jun 12, 2017,07:32am EDT",This is the first article of a two part series on ICO’s. The second article is a guide on how to run your own ICO.,"Market Capitalization Of All Digital Currencies.The digital currency ecosystem has had a crazy year. The Bitcoin market capitalization has grown from $11 billion on June 5, 2016 to almost $47 billion USD on June 5, 2017. Negative news during that time included a 120,000 BTC heist from Bitfinex, worth $65m then and $350m now. The Winklevoss twins sought to create an exchange traded fund dealing in Bitcoin, but they were denied. Positive events were much broader, including Japan recognizing the coin as a legal payment method, Russia reversing their prior stand against Bitcoin, and Australia adjusting its policies to remove a double taxation problem for those accepting digital currencies.Now a new phenomenon is sweeping the market, the Initial Coin Offering. As of May of this year, over $380M has been invested into ICOs. Many of these companies are raising millions of dollars with nothing more than a white paper and a cryptocoin dependent on a small network of nodes running their blockchain. A year ago Bitcoin was 80% of the entire market capitalization of cryptocurrencies, and now it's less than 50%, despite its meteoric rise in price.Something is clearly happening here, so I spoke with Michael Terpin, a pioneering investor in the space, James Prestwich of Storj, a company that has offered ICOs on two different blockchain platforms, the co-founder of Ethereum, Anthony Di Iorio, and Ted Livingston, the CEO of KIK, the first $1 billion company to announce an ICO.But first, what is an Initial Coin Offering? This phrase, like cloud and blockchain before it, is becoming overloaded as the market seeks to explain new concepts.The idea around an ICO is that you create a digital coin or token and then you offer this coin or token for sale in an initial offering. An ICO is in some ways similar to an initial public offering. Both are done to raise funds, but, instead of stock, your ICO purchase gets you a new type of coin or token, an asset rather than a security.The token can represent some sort of value or be of value itself. An ICO might involve attributing equity to a token so that ownership gives you voting privileges and access to dividends, which is what the now infamous fund raising effort of The DAO did. Their use case for a token is the most similar to that of an IPO, however, the majority of use cases are for something different. The typical use case of a token issued in an ICO is the creation of an asset that gives you access to the features of a particular project. Instead of having cash or Bitcoin as the way to pay for goods and services from the ICO offerer, you use their token. You can think of these tokens as being similar to a store specific loyalty point, something you purchase with a general purpose digital currency and use at a specific location.Ok great, now you have digital store specific loyalty point, why are these loyalty points so special? The reasons are tradability and use in decentralized applications.  Because these tokenized loyalty points are put onto a public blockchain, the points are not limited to being traded in exchange for services within the platform, but instead can be traded anywhere. If there is enough activity within a given ICO's environment, their tokens will become globally traded on the various exchanges that handle cryptocurrencies. Successful ICOs are the product of careful thought on economics and game theory, and as a feature they intend that their tokens will increase in value as the volume of the activity on their platform rises. As such, these loyalty points now have a variable value, based off of market perception and growing use of the platform. This creates a very interesting incentive mechanism because now the users of the platform who are receiving the tokens have incentives to bring other users to the platform in order to increase the value of their tokens.Anthony Di IorioI spoke with Anthony Di Iorio, co-founder of Ethereum, the most successful ICO to date with over a $35 billion market cap, on the benefits of combining a token with a crowdsale. ""Part of the goal of the [Ethereum] crowdsale was to create a community of ambassadors for the Ethereum project. We managed to grow our base of ambassadors by attending meetups around the world, targeting groups and leaders in certain communities. Once they got on board, these communities would become advocates for our project. In addition to being able to conjure up a massive community behind the project, about 9,000 people participated in the crowdsale, we were able to sell across the world.”  Combining a token with an initial offering through a crowdsale allows you to build an international network of early adopters and investors who will actively work to educate and spread awareness of your project. Unlike a traditional crowdsale on a system like Kickstarter, where the users who invest typically only have an incentive to invite others to enjoy the product with friends and family, the users who participate in a token crowdsale have the additional incentive of a gain on the value of their asset.  So what about the use case for decentralized applications? This is not as easily applied for typical companies. This assumes that you want to create an application that, instead of being centrally hosted by a company, is hosted in a decentralized manner. The main value of this is that, since there is a reduction in intermediaries, users have more control of the application and it can be faster and cheaper to use the application for certain use cases. A perfect example of a decentralized application is Bitcoin.Bitcoin represents a decentralized monetary system, whereby users have direct control of their money and can send money to one another in a peer to peer fashion. No one company owns Bitcoin or verifies the legitimacy of transactions, instead, this is done in a decentralized way by stakeholders called miners, and to a lesser extent, user nodes. Everyone is incentivized to maintain the system through transaction fees directly from the users and the creation of new tokens, which in this case is the mining of Bitcoin. This mix of incentives and decentralization make it such that, for the first time, users no longer need to rely on a third party to issue, hold or transact with funds digitally.But there are additional layers of complexity that a token can add to a decentralized application. I spoke with James Prestwich, co-founder of Storj, a pioneering decentralized storage platform, to learn more.Storj“Storj is a distributed network where machines can autonomously sell their storage space and bandwidth. Any computer can join the network and they pay each other with Storj. Storj Labs is a company built on top of this infrastructure. No one wants to learn how to use a distributed network and cryptocurrencies to push & pull data, so Storj labs inc builds the tools to make it easy.  Shawn Wilkinson ran the initial crowd sale in the middle of 2014, selling 500k USD worth of Storj coin in exchange for Bitcoin. Storj executed a second crowdsale ending May 25th, where we raised $30m USD worth of tokens.  The coin is used to buy and sell storage space on the network. Micropayments to the users hosting storage space will be a lot easier than with Bitcoin or Ether itself, since the coin is built with the Storj use case in mind. But the reason for the token goes beyond payments. It is necessary for the system to have everyone on the same token to ensure that people are following the protocol rules and behaving fairly. This will be done through network specific smart contracts that will incentivize people to behave fairly and punish users who try to cheat the system.”The Storj system is a bit complex, as it handles two commodities – spare storage space and unused bandwidth of those providing that storage. Unlike Uber, where there is a central company organizing everything, Storj is completely decentralized and all the funds go directly to the storage holders. Lacking a centralized service ensuring that everyone is behaving correctly, there has to be some means of enforcing the agreed upon behavior. This is where smart contracts enter the picture.The easiest way to think about a smart contract is allowing for the movement of money, without a third party involved, based solely on data input that is defined when the contract is made. Since Storj coin is built atop Ethereum they have access to a Turing Complete programming language for smart contracts, which is the computer scientist's way of saying it's a full featured language.Storj smart contracts require that funds be held in escrow for users to participate in the system, either as storage providers or renters. If a user tries to cheat the system in some way, the smart contract can drain the funds from the escrow account of the cheater and return it to the user affected by the cheating. By leveraging the Storj coin, the value of these smart contracts become more predictable and correlated to the Storj platform, instead of being subject to the volatility of general digital currency markets such as Bitcoin or Ether.Storj’s approach to building a company working on top of an infrastructure that is built with a team of Storj Labs developers in addition to the open source community is a very common approach for decentralized applications. This is done to create a more transparent environment for the infrastructure and to create an open platform that encourages other companies to build on top of and contribute to the system.While Storj & Ethereum participated in crowdsales for the initial offerings of their tokens, they are careful to never use the term ICO, fearing that it is too closely associated with an IPO. Alan Cohn, co-char of Steptoe & Johnson LLP’s Blockchain and Digital Currency practice and head council to the Blockchain Alliance, explains that by calling an ICO a token crowdsale, it helps investors understand that they aren’t purchasing equity or a security, but an entirely new asset class. This is important for protecting investors in addition to protecting the startups themselves so that the SEC does not confuse their tokens with an asset that does not pass the Howey test. That being said, there are many ICO that intentionally act as securities, the most popular of which being Blockchain Capital, which raised $10 million in six hours.So why are investors so excited about the new technology? I asked Michael Terpin, who invested in the original ICO, Mastercoin, and has advised 30+ ICOs, including top ICOs such as Ethereum, Factom, Augur, Golem and Gnosis, either personally or through his company Transform Group.Michael TerpinTerpin explains that “as a angel investor, you can put 25k into company equity, then the company goes through many more rounds of funding, and perhaps sells for $300m, but your stake has been diluted to almost nothing if there's a down round anywhere along the way. With tokens, you can do the same kind of analysis of team and technology, but because it's a trading token and not private equity, you can get out whenever you want. Even though tokens are typically not securities, they act more like gold or public stock from day one in terms of liquidity. This alone, coupled with the current bull market for ICOs, means a lot of investors are saying ‘I’ll take my chances with tokens’. Investors like it. Companies like it. Companies don’t give up any equity, just tokens, which in most cases are their product. Because it's a product, it's more akin to wine futures than stock. It’s a product with a resale value.”Ted LivingstonAnother unique sign that ICOs are becoming mainstream is Kik’s upcoming Kin coin. Kik is a chat platform popular with U.S. teens with over 300 million users. Ted Livingston, Founder & CEO of KIK, explains, “A cryptocurrency creates a new way to economically align a large group of developers to work together to create a new ecosystem of digital services that are compelling for consumers, and fair and lucrative for developers. Doing an ICO is a new and exciting idea, and it took some time to run experiments like the Kik Points pilot program to prove that we could build an economy inside of Kik…[T]his was a new and viable way to monetize a community – instead of showing ads or selling items to our users, we could grow the value of a cryptocurrency with a larger community.”Instead of relying on an ICO to raise money in order to build a product, Livingston sees this as a way to reduce friction for goods and services that already change hands via Kik, as well as creating the foundation for exciting new projects. However, a token doesn't have to be about raising money. My company, Bitwage, leverages the Bitcoin blockchain to help workers receive their wages faster and cheaper when working across international borders. We are looking at ways to leverage a token to create momentum around a new peer to peer recruitment platform we are launching. There will be no initial offering or selling of the token, we're going to provide a method to earn tokens in a way to incentivize users to refer others and create a community.If you are thinking of running or investing in an ICO yourself, make sure to check out my next article on the “dos & don’ts” for running your own ICO and how investors should evaluate potential ICOs and tokens to invest in."

IBM
 is betting the farm on the technology. Pundits around the globe are calling for blockchain to reinvent everything from equities trading to charitable giving.And yet, aside from Bitcoin itself, real-world implementations of blockchain are few and far between. Has the hype exceeded the reality? Let’s see what a number of skeptics have to say.Secure ledger from an earlier centuryBlockchain is a Solution Looking for a ProblemAs blockchain exploded from its cryptocurrency roots, it quickly took on new life, as proponents rushed to figure out what else it was good for. “‘Blockchain is a solution looking for a problem’ is a sentiment that we heard several times while conducting this research—a fair representation of the reality,” says Axel Pierron, founder and managing director of financial consulting firm Optimas LLC. “Rather than investing in ‘catch all’ blockchain-related initiatives, the industry should focus its attention on evaluating the various solutions that can address the issues that need to be solved.”The Open Data Institute also warns about selecting the ‘right tool for the job.’ “We think that the government should go further and think about how it can convene sectors (such as finance, agriculture, or health care), identify common challenges in those sectors and then determine which technology approaches – whether blockchains or not – are the most appropriate in helping to address them,” the ODI blogs. “Blockchain technology is a new tool in our toolbox. We need to use it when it is the right tool for the job at hand.” (Emphasis in both paragraphs is theirs.)End-Users Don’t Really Want to Use BlockchainIt’s difficult enough to use Bitcoin for any day-to-day task, let alone blockchain. “But still, eight years after Bitcoin launched, Satoshi Nakamoto remains the only creator to have built a blockchain that an appreciable number of ordinary people actually want to use,” opines software engineer Jon Evans, principal at HappyFunCorp and columnist for TechCrunch. “No other blockchain-based software initiative seems to be at any real risk of hockey-sticking into general recognition, much less general usage.”Perhaps a proof of concept would help? Blockchain aficionados have implemented an online trading card game they call the Rare Pepe Game to explore the potential of the technology.Even this simple example, however, proves wanting. “[The Rare Pepe Game] also shows how a game can be built on a blockchain with virtual goods and characters and more,” explains Fred Wilson, managing partner at Union Square Ventures. “And it shows how clunky this stuff is for the average person to use. Just playing around with this over the last few days showcases to me all of the technical challenges that blockchain technology still has to overcome before it can become mainstream.”Blockchain Will Increase Transaction CostsBy disintermediating financial institutions, so the reasoning goes, multiple parties can conduct transactions seamlessly, without paying a commission. However, cost savings are dubious. “Moving cash equity markets to a blockchain infrastructure would drive a significant increase of the overall transaction cost,” Pierron continues. “Trading on a blockchain system would also be slower than traders would tolerate, and mistakes might be irreversible, potentially bringing huge losses.”Unlikelihood of Sufficient AdoptionThe promise of blockchain in large part depends upon enough parties using the same implementation of the technology – a classic example of the network effect. However, it’s unclear any particular blockchain solution (other than Bitcoin itself) will ever be able to reach this threshold.Without such universal adoption, blockchain’s practicality is questionable. “It’s obvious that a credit union-only distributed ledger system will require universal adoption to be of any use,” says John San Filippo, cofounder and principal at OmniChannel Communications. “It’s my experience that trying to achieve universal adoption of anything in this industry is an act of pure futility.”Blockchain is Too ComplicatedThe technology behind blockchain is complex enough. Add it to the complexity of a heavily regulated business environment, and blockchain may not even get out of the gate. “Blockchain is thus also turning out to be more complicated than most of us thought,” warns Kris Henley, communications manager with the Centre for the Digital Economy at the University of Surrey. “Its tremendous potential is mitigated by its steadfast resistance to being a ‘magic’ solution, and its need for regulation like so many game-changing technologies of the Digital Economy.”Optimas’ Pierron chimes in as well. “Processing trades via blockchain would not simplify the capital markets, but rather move the complexity around,” he adds.Performance IssuesBecause of its inherently distributed, peer-to-peer nature, blockchain-based transactions can only complete when all parties update their respective ledgers – a process that might take hours. As ledgers grow, furthermore, people question whether they will bog down. “Blockchain has a lot to prove in its performance,” says Peter Hiom, deputy CEO at the ASX trading exchange.The transaction delay may also be a deal-killer. “The delay before the final assurance that a transaction has been recorded ‘for good,’ that can be up to a couple of hours, would create too much uncertainty for market participants, especially during time of high volatility,” continues Pierron.Blockchain Ledgers’ Immutability Isn’t Always a Good ThingOne of blockchain’s most touted benefits is the immutability of its ledgers: once participants record a transaction, no one can change or delete it. Such immutability prevents the correction of mistakes to be sure – but there are other issues as well.In fact, immutability may cause blockchain to run afoul of regulation. “Digital ledger technologies must be chosen based on user needs and legal requirements,” writes the Open Data Institute. “For example; tamper-proof and immutable data stores prevent the modification of stored data, but this may not always be an acceptable property. The EU ‘right to be forgotten’ requires the complete removal of information; if that data is in an unchangeable system like a blockchain, this could be impossible.”Blockchain is a ‘Trojan Horse,’ Sent by Radical Libertarians to Undermine the Global Financial SystemTake this one with a large grain of salt to be sure – but at least one Bitcoin entrepreneur has stated this position. “I have no problem with the financial industry inviting the Trojan Horse of blockchain technology into their walled garden, because I know how powerful the technology is,” says Erik Voorhees, CEO and founder at cryptocurrency startup ShapeShift.io.I’ve warned about the Libertarian context for Bitcoin before, but if any members of this devoted but misguided group believe that blockchain alone will disrupt the financial industry, they are out of touch with how cautious the industry is.In fact, the more likely blockchain is to disrupt the global financial system, the less likely it is to succeed. For disruption to be a positive business force, it must drive new competitive advantage, not simple chaos. Blockchain may be disruptive, but it’s still an open question whether it’s too disruptive for its own good.Intellyx publishes the Agile Digital Transformation Roadmap poster, advises companies on their digital transformation initiatives, and helps vendors communicate their agility stories.

bitcoin app spent eight months to get it to work, whereas a ...","May 19, 2017,08:19pm EDT","“Digital currency right now is having its Netscape moment” declared Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong at the Ethereal Summit, in Brooklyn, in a presentation about the cryptocurrency company’s most recent product, Token, “a messaging app with money baked in.”","Speaking at the Ethereum-focused day-long conference featuring players in the decentralized web, Armstrong said that the Ethereum-based Token, in developer preview and unveiled a month ago, has four main features that show off the potential for innovation in blockchain-based products. First, it enables payments “in every country in the world from day 1,” he said. Plus, the payments are international. The users themselves, as opposed to financial institutions, are in control of the money they put in it. And the platform has its own reputation system, which Armstrong compared to a FICO score, “so you know who and which applications and people you can trust.”Finally, Token can be used to make payments to apps. For instance, a Mechanical Turk-type app could enable users to do discrete tasks for small payments, but the workers could then be paid in actual money instead of in Amazon gift cards, which is how non-U.S. workers on Mechanical Turk are paid.Armstrong also envisions that Token, which is based on Ethereum, will host apps ranging from currency exchanges to marketplaces, remittance services to lenders, advice services to cell phone top up providers.Coinbase's latest product, TokenArmstrong’s bold comparison of Token to Netscape, the first widely popular web browser, indicates the company’s hope that Token gains widespread consumer adoption. To begin, Coinbase, which so far has offered its services in developed countries such as the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia and Singapore, plans to promote Token in the developing world. Later this year, Armstrong will travel to Nigeria to foster development on the platform.The comparison to Netscape also suggests Armstrong’s hope that Token ushers in a new stage of evolution in the industry, to a phase in which more consumers interact with blockchains and cryptocurrency but are not necessarily aware that they are doing so.Coinbase’s timing has historically been right. The startup began attracting a following in 2012 in what was then the tiny bitcoin community for making it safe and simple to buy bitcoin with your bank account. In 2015, responding to growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency, it launched Coinbase Exchange, since renamed Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX), for professional traders.Now the company is trying to help the industry mature beyond these basic building blocks of a blockchain-based world to have more consumer-facing offerings. In its development of Token, the company created a new protocol called Simple Open Financial Application that makes it easier for developers to build apps for a platform such as Token. In the past, a well-known bitcoin developer who attempted to build a simple bitcoin app spent eight months to get it to work, whereas a developer using SOFA got an app up and running in eight hours.“If it’s that much easier to build these applications, we’re going to see several orders of magnitude more applications being created,” he said, comparing SOFA to the development of simple web programming languages like html and Javascript. He then invited developers to participate in a hackathon beginning June 3 to build applications for Token.Because Token is more like a web browser than an app store, Armstrong says Coinbase will not be vetting apps that list on Token, though it will be choosing which ones to feature. When asked how the company would deal with apps that are, say, stealing people’s money, he compared it to how the web browser Google Chrome will warn a user if it thinks a site they’re trying to visit has malware or otherwise looks suspicious.“I’m not saying we have zero responsibility,” he told Forbes, adding that Token is not like an app store. “We want to educate users about what they’re using, and if they’re going to do something dangerous, make sure they really know what they’re doing.”The company, which has raised $110 million from investors incumbents such as the New York Stock Exchange, USAA and BBVA, does not currently have plans to make money from Token though Armstrong said it could lend itself to some possible business models down the line, such as charging for pro features or for usage above a certain number of transactions a month.In his presentation, referring to a popular Chinese messaging app, he called Token “a WeChat for the other 180 countries in the world” and said that it would be like putting a bank in the pockets of every person in the world, which, according to McKinsey, said that financial services on mobile phones could add $3.7 trillion to the GDP of emerging economies within a decade.It's an ambitious goal, but a fitting one for a company whose mission is to ""create an open financial system for the world."""

in ...","Apr 3, 2017,05:47pm EDT","Sasha Ivanov is the founder of Waves Platform, a powerful new blockchain application that is already attracting the interest of businesses and entrepreneurs. But what does it take to create a cryptocurrency, and why would you want to in any case? What follows may intrigue you.","Back in 2008 an anonymous developer pulled together a series of ideas circulating in the decidedly niche world of financial cryptography and sent his concept to the Cryptography Mailing List - a collection of individuals who shared ideas about privacy, surveillance, communications technology and much more besides on the web.His proposal did not gain much traction there. But not long afterwards Satoshi Nakamoto, as he was known, launched bitcoin. The rest is history.Nakamoto’s identity is still unknown, yet in the subsequent years many other developers have launched their own cryptocurrency protocols. Most are copies of bitcoin with few substantive differences, and most have sunk without trace.Only a handful offer any real innovation, and only a subset of that number have found meaningful adoption by the wider world. Ethereum, which launched in the autumn of 2015 is one of them. A year earlier it had crowdfunded $16 million (m).Fast forward eighteen months after that launch its market capitalization has soared to the dizzying heights of $4 billion (bn), representing a whopping 250-fold increase. And, probably as a potential inverstor you would not want to have missed out on that uplift.The brainchild of Russian physicist Sasha Ivanov, Waves is another platform that, whilst still in its infancy, appears to hold similar promise according to some crypto pundits. Last June, the Waves Platform crowdfunded about $16m (29,445 bitcoins (BTC)) from around six thousand people. In so doing, 100m Waves tokens were distributed to investors after the crowdfund. I recently met up with this crypto pioneer at a blockchain event in London, so I was interested in finding out more and delving deeper.Blockchain technology concept with businessman holding a smartphone. (Image: Shutterstock).Smart ContractsEthereum implements what are known as ‘smart contracts’: computer code, stored on a global network of servers, that executes automatically and can never be stopped or erased.It sounds scary, but it offers benefits of transparency and security over the use of traditional data centres. No one can knock a service offline when it is run by computers all over the world. It is a bold, complicated idea that has been very successful, but that is not without its issues. And, it may take years for businesses to grasp fully the opportunities posed by smart contracts.Waves, by contrast, aims to meet the market where the need is right now: in the very simplest of blockchain functions, namely the ability to create your own tokens quickly and easily.Any time a business wants to launch a loyalty token or voucher, crowdfund a project, send money abroad frictionlessly - and a hundred and one other applications - blockchain tokens enable them to do that outside of the existing financial and administrative systems.“We are convinced that this will be the frontier of blockchain adoption,” asserted Moscow-based Ivanov. “Allowing any business to access the benefits of speed, cost, transparency, reliability, security and independence that the blockchain offers. And, we know this because it is already happening.”From Ripples to WavesPlatforms similar to Waves had existed for some time. Ripple, a decentralized platform, was one of the first, a kind of distributed ledger a bit like a blockchain that allows users to send money between each other.“And, it is now fully controlled,"" noted Ivanov. ""So it loses the advantages of the open blockchain in terms of financial freedoms and trust.” Ripple, a ,  is used within the banking system today, but according to Ivanov ""can barely be considered"" part of the same stable of projects that arose from Nakamoto’s idea. Banks around the globe are partnering with Ripple to improve their cross-border payment offerings.A theoretical physicist by background, Ivanov graduated from Moscow State University in 2001 having studied in the Theoretical Physics faculty and subsequently at Leipzig University. He was involved in programming automated trading ‘bots’ for the international forex markets and took an early interest in electronic currencies. He was learned about bitcoin in 2012 and soon became involved in the Nxt community.Nxt, like Waves, was an early ‘2.0’ platform. It allowed anyone to create their own blockchain tokens, trading them on a ‘peer-to-peer’ exchange. “It was trail-blazing, remarkable really and well ahead of its time. Unfortunately, it also had some problems.” reflected Ivanov, CEO and founder of Waves.Nxt was indeed ground-breaking, but suffered from a series of issues. One was simply that it was of its time, like MS-DOS versus the later Windows, or MySpace versus Facebook.Ivanov said: “Its features were powerful, but not always user-friendly. It was possible to create your own blockchain tokens - much like launching your own bitcoin - and trade them directly with other users on the built-in exchange, with no assistance or interference from third parties. But it was slow - it was impossible to guarantee that a trade would occur in real-time - and it cost the user to place an order, not just when one was executed.”He added: “Moreover, everything traded against the platform’s own internal currency, NXT, rather than one asset trading against the other. It was as if a forex platform forced a trade to take place in two stages, via a third currency: USD-GBP, GBP-CNY [Chinese Yuan/RMB], rather than USD-CNY.”Ivanov built several businesses on Nxt, and integrated another he had created. This was an instant exchange service, which would swap one digital currency for another without the need to sign up and use a regular exchange.“Cryptocurrency was complicated, and it needed tools to make it easier to handle,” he said. Coinomat, as the service was called and launched in 2013 by Ivanov, was the first instant exchange of its type, though the idea was later popularised by ShapeShift.The dealbreaker came when a series of changes was made to the Nxt platform that broke backwards-compatibility, forcing those who had built businesses on it to fix their software to accommodate the updates.“The developers were visionary, but they did not always understand what businesses needed. We could not risk impacting end-users like that,” he said. “It also had limits in terms of transaction volumes…there was only so much the system could handle, which meant businesses would not be able to grow on it.”Nxt ultimately evolved into the coming Ardor platform, which solves many of these problems, but by then Ivanov had moved on - recognizing that the only way to find the ideal blockchain platform for mainstream business use would be to create it himself.The Big Splash: Waves PlatformIn his years in the cryptocurrency world, Ivanov had built up a solid reputation through the businesses he had launched. And, it seemed that the obvious way to fund his new blockchain platform was to leverage this through a crowdsale - the standard way of kickstarting a project in the crypto world.Ivanov named the platform Waves, a nod to his background as a physicist and the recently-discovered gravitational waves predicted by Einstein a hundred years earlier.Waves would focus squarely on mainstream adoption. Its interface would be as straightforward and familiar as a mobile banking app; it would take only a few clicks to launch your own tokens; it would be as lightweight and fast as possible, and would not impose any unnecessary technical hurdles upon users. Well, that was the theory and the blurb.Like Nxt, it would have a peer-to-peer exchange, but it would be possible to trade anything against anything, with no delays.The idea was to create the perfect platform for crowdfunding, and for moving fiat money - dollars, pounds, euros and other currencies - onto the blockchain, so that it could be used more efficiently than the banking system currently allows.As Ivanov put it: “We already have money. USD, GBP, EUR - even bitcoin. Unlike other cryptocurrency platforms, we are not looking to recreate or replace money. Rather we are looking to enable existing forms to work better.”CrowdfundingWaves’ ICO, the crypto term for an Initial Coin Offering or crowdfund,  came on the heels of several other major projects. The most recent, called Lisk and headed and led by CEO and tech visionary Max Kordek in Berlin, had raised $5.5m in bitcoins. We had incidentally met last November in the German capital after I attended an event in a hotel beside Berlin's amazing Zoological Garden for a face-to-face meeting near the iconic Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial church.“We hoped to match that. And, at the time, it was pretty optimistic. Ivanov remarked. But the cryptocurrency community grasped the potential of the Waves platform and as the ICO progressed, the bitcoins kept coming in. By the end of June, Waves had collected almost 30,000 bitcoins, then the equivalent of $16m. Only Ethereum had collected a comparable amount.Money does not solve everything of course, and the software behind the Waves platform was hit with delays in its early stages.As Ivanov explained: “We were building on an existing piece of software that was designed to make it easy to launch blockchain applications. Unfortunately, it turned out it wasn’t fit for purpose. We had to rewrite it from scratch.’ What compounded the problem was that Waves was written in Scala.”He added asserting: “It is the best language for this kind of application, very powerful and it enables us to create something that scales to large transaction volumes but is still fast.”But Scala developers are in short supply and even $16m could not produce the required developers from out of thin air. “There are some problems you cannot fix just by throwing money at them,” he said.Riding The WavesWhilst a small proportion of the 6,000-strong community who had invested initially in Waves reacted by trolling the bitcoin forums and spreading misinformation, legitimate businesses were already taking an interest and soon building products around the increasing functionality that the platform offered.Incent, a Sydney-based outfit that realized the blockchain was the perfect solution for the ineffective loyalty sector, crowdfunded $1m and launched its tokens on Waves last year.A team of international scientists who had developed a technique for recovering zirconium dioxide, a key industrial commodity, from waste materials, created ZrCoin, the first ever commodity-backed blockchain option.There has also been a Russian political party, spearheaded by the billionaire Boris Titov, chairman of Partiya Rosta and Russia’s business ombudsman, launched Upcoin - a tool to engage the party, reward contributions and even to vote securely at a distance.“We have hit the point at which we can see blockchain adoption going mainstream in the coming years,’ posited Ivanov, adding: “The technology is more and more mature, the economic circumstances are right, and people are starting to realize that this is about far more than the geeks and drug markets that were part of the early bitcoin world.”And, as Ivanov confidently remarked: “Of course, the better we do our job and the easier it is to use, the less people will realize they are using it. It will just be there - under the surface - making life easier.”Blockchain enthusiasts are constantly claiming that these technologies will hit mainstream use cases in the near future. And, 2017 is the year that many pundits contend that the blockchain and its associated technology will go mainstream. Based on the growing adoption by businesses of the Waves platform, this year looks set to be the year they are at last right. Here's hoping."

With a market capitalization of around $300m one might consider this latest initial coin offering as uber exuberant.News of the record-breaking fund raising token performance, which involved sending Ether to the token sale contract and receiving GNO tokens back within one week of sale’s conclusion, follows two years of development on the platform that started in January 2015.Since that time there have been multiple iterations over the core parts of Gnosis. This has included smart contracts powering the framework, the general web interface and the gnosis.js library. Several integrations of Gnosis with other projects such as uPort, MetaMask or RealityKeys have also been tested.Further, it has been developing other products such as the Gnosis multisig wallet, which is used by several projects (Golem, Weifund, Stable).(Image credit: Shutterstock).Prediction MarketsIt is claimed that prediction markets, also known as information markets, decision markets, idea futures, event derivatives or virtual markets, are poised to become one of the most disruptive innovations in capital markets and data science since the start the Information Revolution.Unlike a traditional financial market, prediction markets frame themselves in terms of questions about the future, typically with binary outcomes.Initially proposed back in the early 1990s, prediction markets have however yet to attract mass attention in the area of forecasting and decision-making despite their documented efficacy for information aggregation. This is attributed largely due to over-regulation in many of the world’s leading financial sectors.In terms of how it works, one could have asked last year: ‘Which presidential candidate will win the 2016 election?’. Shares are divided among pre-defined options (e.g. Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton,), with corresponding share prices equalling $1. Each option’s share price then reflects its probability of occurrence.“With the invention of powerful, peer-to-peer computing technologies such as Ethereum and Bitcoin, the scientific exploration of market-based forecasting can proceed uninhibited and at a rate and scale previously unimaginable,” a statement contended in Gnosis’ recent whitepaper published earlier this month.It added: “Our team believes undoubtedly that prediction markets will disrupt some of the largest existing industries in the near term. Looking forward, we expect that the Gnosis prediction market platform will form the basis for machine information economies on a global scale.”That said, it was acknowledged that for a prediction market platform to “become truly disruptive”, it must be universal and draw from a global liquidity pool”. And, the platform “must be decentralized, permissionless, and trustless for such a liquidity pool to exist.”Founded by Martin Köppelmann, who has been an entrepreneur in the blockchain space for over three years, and Stefan George, who has worked at tech companies in Silicon Valley and at Berlin-based start-ups, the two Gnosis co-founders have previously created and sold the largest Bitcoin prediction market, Fairlay.Gnosis is also dubbed the first project founded within blockchain venture studio ConsenSys, a production studio and custom software development consultancy building decentralized applications (DApps), enterprise solutions and developer tools for blockchain ecosystems. These are primarily focused on Ethereum.By deploying Ethereum blockchain technology, Gnosis is said to provide an open platform for anyone to predict the outcome of any event, and claimed it can “drastically simplify” the creation of customized prediction market applications for both individuals and enterprises.World of PossibilitiesSomeone, for example, could create a market on the outcome of a political election or a company’s earnings forecast. People around the world could then predict the likelihood of outcomes, and Gnosis will aggregate predictions and make real-time market adjustments. Then when the event occurs, the market rewards participants who accurately predicted the particular event.Köppelmann asserted: “Gnosis is part of a new wave of decentralized platforms, key to which is permissionless innovation. Having an open platform with verifiable behaviour introduces an incredible opportunity to bring a wide range of applications onto Gnosis, many of which we never anticipated.”Unlike traditional polling, Gnosis collects information by financially incentivizing good information and disincentivizing bad information. While standard polling asks what participants want to happen, prediction markets ask what participants expect will happen.By creating efficient markets for forecasting, the prediction platform aggregates all information sources “optimally and creates data layers for probabilities” as its founders described it, thereby giving each future outcome a quantified probability of occurring. It is revealed that this data feed can be utilized for any third-party application and can power Artificial Intelligence.Auction MechanismThe team spearheading the decentralized platform for prediction markets created a new auction mechanism, effectively a Dutch auction process in order for the GNO token sale to take place.Through this mechanism the price of the token was to be determined by how long it took for $12.5m USD in Ether (ETH) to be sent to the Gnosis sale contract. The theory went that ad it taken longer, the price per each GNO token would have been incrementally lower until the cap was reached.And at the end of the sale, everyone would receive tokens at the lowest price a Gnosis token is sold for. While GNO tokens will only be sold for Ether, a Shapeshift integration will enable other crypto tokens to be used.While the Gnosis sale was completed in swiftly fashion today, it is perhaps worth looking at some pointers from their recent whitepaper, which covers use of proceeds, the roadmap and future developments amongst other areas. There is much scheduled over this year and next.The hefty 49-page document revealed that platform development will include “building upon and securing core smart contracts, additional frameworks such as a comprehensive oracle market, trading and management interfaces, service level app templates and customization tools, and integrations with future Ethereum infrastructure such as state channels and stablecoins.”As to legal costs, legal requirements include “corporate set-ups in at least three locations for crowdsale, operations, and gaming licenses.” It was also disclosed that work was undertaken before Gnosis’ token launch with a US law firm to develop a legal opinion of the interpretation with US law.It was revealed that “ongoing resources” will be required for gaming and possible financial use case legal work. As such a legal contingency fund will be “reserved in case of future issues.Future DevelopmentsThe paper outlined various developments going forward to the third quarter (Q3) of 2018. For instance, reference is made in the Q2 this year for an additional office in Berlin. “Parts of the team will join the vibrant Ethereum community in Berlin, working out of the ETHDEV office,” it stated.During Q3 2017 Gnosis will host a hackathon to support developers building apps on top of Gnosism. And, listed under a heading ‘CryptoEconomic’ experiments, it planned run a series of experiments to test the viability of Futarchy with support from the Ethereum Foundation.The fourth quarter of 2017 is slated for the Gnosis AMA DApp with Twitter integration. Gnosis AMA (ask me anything) DApp allows anyone to ask the market for an estimate, for example: “Will Bitcoin hardfork?”, “When will Ethereum switch to Proof of Stake”. It is revealed that a “Twitter bot integration will make it possible to participate by tweeting.”It is indicated that during Q2 2018 Gnosis will offer a standalone application based on Electron, while for Q3 reference is made to Gnosis mobile standalone client alpha and that a “fully decentralized prediction markets on mobile” will be provided.Köppelmann, commenting after the record breaking token that had strong financial support from the Ethereum community, said: “We now have the resources to create a platform where anyone in the world can create, run and monetize their own prediction markets, from sports betting to financial markets, weather prediction/flood insurance to politics.”Gnosis’ Advisory board includes Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin, the latter being an Ethereum co-founder and founder of ConsenSys as well as a former VP of Technology at Goldman Sachs in their Private Wealth Management Division."

But the rise of blockchain is pushing that war to a whole new height as giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and IBM rush to bring Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) to the cloud environment. Will BaaS become the key differentiator in the competition—or will a whole new technology race in to disrupt the digital landscape? Below, I offer some insights.What Is Blockchain?In case you’ve been too overwhelmed with cloud, fog computing, and other tech advancements tearing through your industry, here’s a quick overview: Blockchain is the technology behind Bitcoin, a type of encrypted digital currency. But unlike Bitcoin, Blockchain is not a strictly financial tool. Although it is designed as a general ledger, in its simplest sense, it’s a way to move and store blocks of cryptographically validated data that users can’t corrupt. In other words, it creates a transparent paper trail that anyone can access, but no one can alter. That makes Blockchain far more than a financial tool—it makes it the latest way of sharing, validating, or otherwise endorsing almost any kind of value point, be it “money, titles, deeds, music, art, scientific discoveries, intellectual property, and even votes.”Why Add Blockchain To The Cloud?Setting up your own Blockchain is not easy. It requires heavy infrastructure and development capabilities that most businesses aren’t savvy enough to manage. Enter BaaS. As more companies discover the power of Blockchain and what it can do for their businesses, there will be even greater demand for making this technology more easily accessible. According to Harvard Business Review, Blockchain is the next great disruptor, even more likely to change the next decade of business than big data or artificial intelligence (AI). Says the writer, just as the internet was the first native digital medium for information, Blockchain is the first native digital medium for value. Some 65 percent of banks are expected to implement a Blockchain solution in the next few years—and that’s just on the finance side. The technology is set to see a massive explosion throughout the business landscape.
How Can Blockchain Be Used?The easier question to answer may, how can’t it be used? Just like with any new tech disruptor, you might have to get creative to get your head around how the technology will play out in your industry. But the following are a few examples of how Blockchain could change businesses across the board.It can eliminate the middle man. Because it validates transactions—and the value of the property being transacted—Blockchain can reduce the middle man, be it the art dealer, real estate agent, music agent, or estimator. The same is true for creative licensing. With Blockchain, artists can go straight to the people, rather than through music labels, to protect their own music and royalties. Move over, Spotify. Artists may once again be able to make money for their music.It can manage “smart contracts.” You think digital signatures are the wave of the future? Think again. With Blockchain, smart contracts will not just facilitate the gathering of signatures, but the enforcement of a contract’s performance.It provides a non-bank for the un-banked. For those who don’t have a bank—or don’t believe in them—Blockchain can help manage and certify their own financial value without the need for working with a banking institution. It can keep track of their “money” digitally, and allow them to process payment by phone or app.It can validate—and secure—almost anything. From voter authentication to government processes, health information, and proof of intellectual property, Blockchain can serve as a secure process to validate almost anything of value, and to keep it safe. Indeed, because of the Blockchain structure, it’s far safer than standard cloud environments.It will serve as a springboard for the IoT. Many have concerns that the cloud—and even fog—will not be secure, fast, or large enough to handle the influx of information created by the Internet of Things (IoT). Blockchain picks up where cloud technology leaves off by creating highly secure venues for information sharing—far better than cloud alone.It’s transparent. Perhaps one of the best arguments for incorporating Blockchain into government is that it is completely public. Even better, it prevents history from being re-written by allowing information to be extended, but never appended, which ensures complete integrity of all involved.Though it is early in the development of Blockchain on the wider commercial market, the potential for incorporating the technology into almost every industry is endless—from sharing college research papers to inventing the cure for cancer. Perhaps a better name would be Blockchange—because of the promise it holds for transforming businesses around the world.Addition Resources On This TopicHow Blockchain and Bitcoin IoT Will Fuel the Industrial IoTBlockchain: 2017’s Superstar on the Rise"

applications using the blockchain system today. Today In: Pharma & ...","May 8, 2017,12:08pm EDT",Shutterstock,"The blockchain concept is still widely misunderstoodBlockchain technology is making headlines everywhere. If you have recently attended any tech events it is highly likely that you came out of them having heard just that bit more about it. Everybody is talking about blockchain--from the President of the United States to the Nigerian government. Despite all the hype, for many people (across different industries) the blockchain concept still seems difficult to grasp, which makes it one of the most misunderstood technologies of 2017. This confusion around blockchain can be attributed both to its contentious origin (Satoshi Nakamoto, the “unknown” who designed Bitcoin and its original reference implementation) and equally to the absence of any standard definition of blockchain technology. Nevertheless, the perceived (if not yet fully understood) disruptive nature of blockchain and its possible impact on businesses across industries makes it crucial first to understand blockchain and then to distinguish the hype from the reality. Today we are going to try to unpack blockchain at a basic level and understand its implications for the healthcare industry.What is blockchain technology, and how can we separate the hype from reality?So what is blockchain? If we filter out all the hype and technological jargon, blockchain technology is, at its simplest, a distributed and immutable (write once and read only) record of digital events that is shared peer to peer between different parties (networked database systems). In essence, the fundamental strengths of a blockchain system lie in its data integrity and networked immutability. Having said this, there is always scope to build application layers on top of a blockchain system and enable additional functionalities such as public or private keys, or self-executing mechanics (e.g. smart contracts), but this isn't the core functionality of blockchain technology.To put it even more simply, let’s flash back to the 1990s, when “internet” was the buzzword. People misunderstood the internet with a tunnel vision around its early use cases (e.g. internet = email, or internet = Web). Similarly, today’s confusion around blockchain technology is not because of its fundamental properties at the protocol layer, but rather because of hype around as-yet-unproven use cases at the application level, which are often mistaken for the integral part of core blockchain technology. For example, today many people commonly identify blockchain with Bitcoin, by far the most commonly known implementation of blockchain technology. But in fact Bitcoin is only the tip of the iceberg of several hundred applications using the blockchain system today.Translating this analogy for the healthcare industry, the concept of blockchain technology and systems is undoubtedly disruptive, but it will not act as a magic bullet to solve emerging business problems in the fast-changing and highly interconnected digital health ecosystem. Rather, it will be an evolutionary journey for blockchain-based healthcare systems or applications, where trust and governance within a blockchain network or consortium will be the critical success factors for implementation.Blockchain technologyWhat are the most promising blockchain-based use cases for the healthcare industry?Beyond blockchain technology’s utopian moment in the fintech industry, in the healthcare industry it has just started to inspire both relatively easily achievable and more speculative potential applications. Healthcare authorities, governments and the provider community globally are equally excited about the new possibilities presented by blockchain. Nevertheless, the industry needs to focus on establishing blockchain consortia to foster ecosystem partnerships and create standards or frameworks for future implementation on a large scale across healthcare use cases. The Hyperledger Foundation, an open-source global collaborative effort created to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies, is one great example among many developing small blockchain consortia models in the healthcare space.Despite the current euphoria, we need to understand and decode the hype cycle for blockchain technology and its realistic healthcare applications. By doing so, we believe that, among several hundred use cases, the five blockchain-based healthcare use cases mentioned below demonstrate more convincing opportunities, albeit at varying degrees of adoption across countries and health systems.If you would like more insights on blockchain in the healthcare industry, please connect with us!

Token Summit Marks Cryptocurrency's Revitalization,https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/05/26/bubble-so-what-token-summit-marks-cryptocurrencys-revitalization/,"Assuming that the bitcoins turn over five times a year, bitcoin would need 
to store $10 billion in value to facilitate 10% of remittances. Burniske ...","May 26, 2017,02:52pm EDT","It was cold. It was raining. And it was the final gathering in a week of back-to-back cryptocurrency and blockchain conferences. Attendees should have been inclined to flake or tempted to sell their tickets for a tidy sum. Instead, rumor was that, for the $349 ticket, scalpers were charging a bitcoin — about $2,500 these days. The morning of, 70 ticketed guests, some of whom had flown in from foreign countries, had to be turned away, raindrops pelting them as they went.","Inside, the 560 who remained -- about half of whom were entrepreneurs, with investors and ancillary service providers such as lawyers making up the other half -- mingled over coffee and pastries. They then filed in to an NYU auditorium to fill every seat, each outfitted with a folding desk. It was a conventional setting for what would be a day of unconventional thinking. Thus began the wildly anticipated Token Summit.That morning, despite the legitimate claims of scams and a bubble in the space, bitcoin was reaching a new high, nearing $2,800, Ether was trading in its highest ranges — around $200 — and the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies was trading near the all-time high it hit the day before, $91 billion. (It hadn’t hurt that a couple days before, Fidelity CEO Abigail Johnson had expressed her “love” of Bitcoin.)But in a day of 15 sessions with 40 speakers, the euphoric prices came up only briefly. Business models, fundamental price analysis, regulations and ways of governing blockchain-based projects were on the agenda, and meetings outside the packed auditorium initiated deals in what everyone was comparing to the dot-com revolution.
“This is not about the price of tokens and the price of cryptocurrency. This is a conference about the business models behind the cryptocurrencies and tokens. That is what we’re here to explore,” said organizer William Mougayar, a venture capitalist and author of the book The Business Blockchain, in his opening remarks. His cohost Nick Tomaino, principal at Runa Capital and author of the blog The Control, about the token economy, said, ""The price of these tokens is the most interesting thing for people outside of this ecosystem to talk about, but the long-term success of this ecosystem is really about what the entrepreneurs and investors are building right now."" (Both were recent guests on my podcast.)A panel on business models at Token Summit. From left, William Mougayar, organizer, Muneeb Ali of... [+] Blockstack, Juan Benet of Protocol Labs, Shawn Wilkinson of Storj and David Vorick of Sia CoinBut the attendees, who came from 44 countries including Brazil, Estonia, Japan, Belarus, France, Colombia, Croatia, and Singapore, were only at the earliest stages of building their vision of a blockchain-based world of multiple tokens that power decentralized businesses. When Mougayar asked who owned cryptocurrency or a token, such as bitcoin or Ether, everyone raised their hands. When he queried who was using them in a utility (meaning who was using them not just for speculative purposes but because they were the central function of a service), only a dozen or so hands went up.The recognition that the few hundred people in the room had barely started their journey was reflected in remarks by NYU Stern Business School professor Luke Williams. “It takes a long time for people’s thinking to catch up to the technology,” he said. “One of the reasons we’re here today is to allow our thinking to keep track with the mechanism of technology. Thinking changes much slower because we’re dealing with really well-established concepts like money.”The data showed that something new was afoot. In a panel on data about the industry, Brian Lio, CEO of industry data site Smith and Crown, showed that the amount raised in “initial coin offerings” — crowdsales of new crypto assets — in 2017 has already eclipsed the total from 2016. It also already surpasses seed and Series A venture funding in the space. The average project raised $2 million, and while more than half of funds went to the top 10% of projects, a massive long tail of shows that even smaller, less well-known projects are raising money this way.While those numbers seem impressive, the comparisons to venture capital are not entirely apt. A significant portion of the ICO money likely went to projects that would not have gotten venture capital anyway — whether due to lack of access or quality of project or another reason. Plus, in many cases, because the token is integral to the functioning of the network and would need to be widely distributed for the ecosystem to work, it wouldn’t even make sense to give a venture capitalist a substantial cut. “You generally need an ICO just for distribution,” said Sid Kalla of Smith and Crown.Also, despite the amount of money flowing in the space, the audience fueling the trend was decidedly niche. According to a survey by CoinFund, a blockchain technology research investment company, 91.5% of respondents were male, two-thirds were between ages of 25-40, 60% worked in technology and 26% had participated in equity crowdfunding, suggesting they’re accredited investors. “It’s still a very niche market. It could probably have a few more women in it,” said CoinFund cofounder Jake Brukhman to the almost entirely male audience, which erupted in laughter.The mostly male audience at Token SummitCoinFund survey respondents also seemed to be a highly (and dangerously) risk-tolerant crowd. The average respondent had invested 50% of all their investment capital in blockchain assets, and one out of three had more than 75% of their investment capital in blockchain.The same foolhardy thinking has also created a bubble in tokens, the existence of which attendees widely recognized. Explaining that companies receiving seed funding typically get valuations around $5 million, and firms raising series A funding are valued on average at $15 million to $20 million, Alex Sunnarborg, research analyst at industry trade publication CoinDesk, said, “This morning when I logged into Coinmarketcap” — a resource for data such as price and market cap of the top cryptocurrencies — “every single coin on the top 100 page had over a $10 million valuation. That’s pretty crazy. A seed round is hard enough to raise. A series A requires you to have a decent traction and revenue model.”But others in the space are already thinking up better ways of evaluating the assets to make smarter financial choices. Chris Burniske, blockchain products lead at ARK Investment Management, the first public fund manager to invest in bitcoin, explained, “It’s important for us to figure out what’s utility and what’s speculative, because in times of correction, we will likely compress through speculative value until we hit utility value.” He walked through an example in which one might project, say, that bitcoin will someday account for 10% of the $500 billion remittance market, which would require bitcoin to facilitate $50 billion of transactions. Assuming that the bitcoins turn over five times a year, bitcoin would need to store $10 billion in value to facilitate 10% of remittances.Burniske said the current value of any token, which he refers to as network value, would take into account the current utility value, the expected utility value out to the year the investors plan to make their investment, the annual rate of inflation for the number of tokens, and the discount rate, which, for his example of privacy coin Zcash, he estimated at three to four times that of tech stocks. He also described a metric created by cryptocurrency investment analyst Willy Woo, that he called the crypto equivalent of price-earnings (P/E) ratio: market cap divided by daily transaction value. He then emphasized the financial value of developers contributing to the code, which can be estimated by dividing the market cap by the number of code repository points, a proxy for developer activity on that token.But the majority of the day was focused on other issues such as what business models are enabled by tokens, how these open source protocols should be governed, and how the laws and regulations around these tokens are developing, among other subjects.Many companies are willing to blaze the trail. The biggest news of the day was an announcement by chat service and unicorn Kik, which as 50 million monthly users, that it would be launching a token, and a number of other well-known projects took the stage to present their efforts, such as smart contract system Tezos, peer-to-peer exchange 0x, decentralized court system Aragon, and identity startup Civic. Fireside chats were held with luminaries of the space such as Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong (who was also the subject of my magazine feature on the company), Erik Voorhees, CEO of Shapeshift, and Fred Wilson, managing partner at Union Square Ventures.In that last session, fielding an audience question about why a startup would go for an ICO in which it would raise a lot of money but also give away much of the company with a low probability of being able to get more funding, Wilson responded, “If you think about it as just a way to finance your company, you’re not thinking about it properly. The way to think about it is that the token is also the native monetization model for your business, and if you execute your business well, the value of that token should rise as the utility of the product you ship goes up in value.” Then, he said, though you’re giving away a lot of the tokens right away, the value of the tokens you keep should rise substantially and net you a tidy profit. For example, he and Mougayar speculated that Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin had a half percent of all Ethers, which at that moment was about $90 million.The crowd seemed largely to agree that despite the current scams and price bubble, the tokens were mostly about a new business model — one that could someday prove highly valuable. “The ICOs are highly unstable, but … I can imagine the utility value,” said Catherine Wood, CEO of ARK. Noting how far these projects are from pulling off their vision, she said, “but you have a few of these networks showing the network effect. It’s going to be boom-bust-boom-bust, I think. It’s going to be unstable but very exciting. I was there at the beginning of the internet, and this is more exciting than that.”As for the current irrational exuberance, Wood noted that the internet bubble popped at about $3 trillion, which would be $5 trillion in today’s dollars. But today, the network value of all crypto assets is less than $100 billion.One prominent skeptic, Tone Vays, of the CryptoScam podcast, reflected the stance of much of the world outside: “We are standing at almost the pinnacle of the dot-com bubble.” He put tokens in the same category as tulip mania, the South Sea bubble and the dot-com bubble, and asserted that after this flourishing of multiple tokens, many would fail, leaving only bitcoin.But as people exchanged cards and email addresses over wine and beer in the post-conference reception, Olaf Carlson-Wee founder and CEO of hedge fund Polychain Capital (and a recent guest on my podcast), which has backing from Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures, summed up the most common sentiment. As the first employee of Coinbase, and as someone who spent the greater part of the last several years earning and spending almost exclusively cryptocurrency, he had a long-term perspective.“This is my favorite conference since the San Jose Bitcoin conference in 2013,” he said, referring to the first bitcoin conference ever. “This is the same buzzy energy.”As the event came to a close, the attendees convened again at a separate reception a few blocks away. They were eager for more face-to-face time before they would each fly back to their homes around the world, from which they would keep building the decentralized web."

[+] infected with the WannaCry ransomware.,"In the midst of the WannaCry maelstrom last week, researchers found clues that tied the massive ransomware outbreak to a hacker crew called the Lazarus Group, long believed to be an offensive cyber unit working out of North Korea. Now security experts at Symantec believe they've found more proof, enough to say there are ""strong links"" between WannaCry and Lazarus.The first analyses linking Lazarus, believed to have been responsible for a massive $81 million bank heist in Bangladesh and the 2014 Sony Pictures hack, said there were similarities in slices of code used by the group and the WannaCry ransomware. That came after Google security researcher Neel Mehta posted links to two malware samples: one the WannaCry ransomware, the other Lazarus' Contopee cyber weapon.Overnight, Symantec said its researchers had found evidence that earlier versions of WannaCry, almost identical to those involved in this month's pandemic, were used in a small number of targeted attacks. Looking at systems compromized by those early WannaCry samples, Symantec determined there were ""commonalities in the tools, techniques and infrastructure used by the attackers and those seen in previous Lazarus attacks, making it highly likely that Lazarus was behind the spread of WannaCry.""But, the security giant noted, the attacks did ""not bear the hallmarks of a nation-state campaign but are more typical of a cybercrime campaign."" WannaCry infected as many as 200,000 computers, including a vast number of U.K. hospital systems and some medical devices, as the perpetrators demanded users pay $300 in Bitcoin or their locked-up files would be deleted. They've so far earned just over $100,000 in Bitcoin but it's unclear if they'll cash out.New cluesOne significant clue was that two variants of Destover, a disk-wiping tool used in the Sony Pictures attack, was discovered on an early WannaCry victim's network, Symantec said. Another tool called Volgmer - malware used by Lazarus in attacks on South Korean targets - was also found on PCs at the hacked organization. That attack took place on February 10th, when 100 computers were swiftly infected with WannaCry. The name of the victim has not been released.Furthermore, a backdoor called Alphanc was used to help spread WannaCry during attacks across March and April, the victims of which have also not been revealed. Alphanc turned out to be a modified version of software previously linked to Lazarus, dubbed Duuzer, according to Symantec's blog post.The earlier versions of WannaCry did not use the same leaked NSA tools as the May attacks did. But, Symantec added, the passwords used to encrypt .zip files in WannaCry were similar across the different samples. They included ""wcry@123"", ""wcry@2016"" and ""WNcry@2ol7"". That provided further indication ""that the author of both versions is likely the same group,"" Symantec added.Evidence ""can't be ignored""According to the head of BAE Systems' threat intelligence team, Adrian Nish, the Symantec findings chimed with his own. Nish and his colleagues have long been tracking Lazarus and recently provided evidence the group is sponsored by the North Korean regime. Talking about Symantec's findings, Nish told Forbes: ""This is the digital equivalent of finding fingerprints at the scene of a crime - it doesn't mean the case is closed, but it is significant evidence which can't be ignored,.""The only plausible explanations for this are that it is either the same actors or someone planting the evidence to frame the Lazarus Group... Faking such evidence is technically hard and other circumstantial findings point to Lazarus being the culprit."""

But as a number of criminals have found out, transactions in Bitcoin can be tracked.","So when Zcash, a so-called privacy coin, launched last October, it raised questions about who would want to use such a currency that had the option to function as a true digital equivalent of cash, leaving no fingerprints behind.It turns out banks just might want that feature.Monday, the company behind Zcash, the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company (ZECC) announces a partnership with JPMorgan Chase to add Zcash’s privacy technology to Quorum, an enterprise blockchain platform JPMorgan built on Ethereum, a network similar to bitcoin's but focused on smart contracts.Quorum, which already features private smart contracts, will now be able to ensure private settlement of digitized assets on a distributed ledger.Zooko Wilcox, ZECC chief executive, expressed his enthusiasm for the deal: “I'm excited that our first enterprise customer is the most valuable bank in the world."" ZECC also announced last night that it has joined the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, of which JPMorgan Chase is already a member. “By adding the Zero-knowledge Security Layer into Quorum, we are able to explore how state of the art cryptographic privacy technology will enhance the next generation of financial services applications,” said JPMorgan executive director and blockchain center of excellence lead architect Suresh Shetty in a statement.""Quorum is designed for the institutional financial markets, and commercial confidentiality is a key requirement for companies that trade in those markets because they don't want their competitors to be able to see what they're trading, what positions they're taking, or who their counterparties are,"" said Zcash chief operating officer Jack Gavigan via email. ""Until now, blockchain technology's lack of privacy and confidentiality has been a major obstacle to adoption. By combining the the zero-knowledge security layer (ZSL) with Quorum's private smart contracts, that obstacle is removed for many use cases, ranging from simple equity trades to complex derivatives.""Lack of privacy and confidentiality in blockchain technology has caused hesitation among banks. But enabling privacy in smart contracts could help facilitate the use of blockchains in transactions such as simple equity trades and complex derivatives.So far, only 18% of transactions in Zcash appear to have chosen the privacy option, but Wilcox maintains that banks feel privacy is necessary so as not to expose the details of their transactions to competitors on the distributed ledgers that underly the technology that makes cryptocurrencies possible.Zcash isn't the only privacy coin. Monero offers less perfect privacy technology but greater speeds, which could be relevant for transactions, say, on a mobile device.As of press time, Zcash is the 20th-most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization, at $173 million, and a price of $128 per coin. Its investors include Naval Ravikant, the CEO and cofounder of AngelList, blockchain venture firms Digital Currency Group, Pantera Capital and Fenbushi Capital, as well as top entrepreneurs in the space such as Adam Ludwin of enterprise blockchain firm Chain and Fred Ehrsam, the cofounder of Coinbase.Update Monday, May 22, 2017, 6:17pm EST: This article originally misstated the percentage of transactions that choose the privacy option, and then, issued a correction that was itself incorrect. The correct figure is 18%."

Unfortunately, some bad actors have utilized digital tokens as an adjunct to their nefarious activities. However, those incidents are outliers.","Many businesses and individuals use digital tokens to transmit value – the blockchain is referred to as “the Internet of Value” for a reason – to conduct perfectly legitimate business and personal transactions more securely and efficiently.An example of the abuse of this perfectly legitimate medium of exchange appears in the case of United States v. Anthony Murgio. The defendant reportedly has pled guilty to several crimes. Within the laundry list of charges, however, there is one that is deeply inappropriate.Prosecutors allege that Mr. Murgio facilitated the exchange of bitcoin on behalf of ransomware victims. Exchanging bitcoin on behalf of ransomware victims should not be construed as criminal activity by the exchanger, not as a matter of law nor as sound policy. Such an interpretation would set a precedent that would surely cause real harm to the public, to the blockchain ecosystem, and to the financial services industry as a whole.For victims of ransomware schemes, paying the ransom is often a last resort. Given the difficult situation victims of such schemes are in, the law recognizes that paying a ransom is not a crime. Indeed, law enforcement agencies themselves have paid ransoms when ransomware attackers have targeted their files.The FBI advises that there are serious risks to consider before paying a ransom. These include the possibilities that payment does not guarantee the attacker will release ransomed files and that attackers will be emboldened to perpetrate further ransomware attacks. That said, the law does not prohibit victims of ransomware from paying ransoms. Neither the FBI nor any other legal authority has yet even suggested that facilitating payment of a ransom in a ransomware attack would constitute criminal activity. For good reason!Ransomware attacks are harmful and disruptive. They are a crime under federal law and should be. The law does not, nor should it, support the notion that someone who assists a victim in obtaining payment for a ransomware attack is party to criminal activity. A bitcoin exchanger has done nothing more than engage in the business of exchanging bitcoin on behalf of a customer. To find otherwise would be akin to indicting a bank teller for providing the funds with which a father seeks to ransom his kidnapped child.Applying criminal law to the exchange of bitcoin on behalf of ransomware victims would create a morally shocking result of re-victimizing a victim. All lawfully operating digital currency exchanges would thereafter refuse to exchange bitcoin for ransomware victims for fear of criminal culpability. From local police departments to the FBI to your neighbor, no innocent victim who decides that the lesser evil is to pay the ransom would be able to obtain bitcoin from a lawfully operating exchange. That outcome would only add insult to injury.Taken to its illogical conclusion, no financial institution could process a transaction for a customer if it had reason to know that the transaction’s purpose was to pay a ransom. That outcome would be irreconcilable with guidance to financial institutions published by FinCEN concerning cyber threats. It would be bad law and bad policy.FinCEN directs financial institutions to file suspicious activity reports (SARs) to inform law enforcement of certain types of cyber-enabled crime. As the agency charged with protecting the United States from financial crime, FinCEN’s guidance does not deem financial institutions who process such transactions to be involved in a criminal activity.  Nor should it!Likewise, those exchangers who process an exchange of bitcoins for dollars (or dollars for bitcoin) in this context assuredly should not be implicated in a crime. Nor should they be threatened with criminal penalties for a fundamentally innocent action.In addition, Kidnapping and Ransom (K&R) insurers are adapting their incumbent kidnapping policies to ransomware-related claims. K&R insurers are modernizing coverage by setting up bitcoin accounts for clients to make ransom payments. A ransomware attack potentially can be more catastrophic to a company than the kidnapping of a key employee.A judicial ruling criminalizing the processing of victims’ payment of ransom would have a dramatically negative effect on the insurance coverage that companies otherwise would be able to obtain. It also is very likely that imposing criminal penalties on the purchase of bitcoin to end a ransomware attack would quickly eliminate this perfectly legal, and legitimate, service.Ransomware attacks are reprehensible. The law provides a remedy, charging those who threaten a victim’s data for the purpose of extortion. Extending criminal liability to innocent third-party digital currency exchangers, or any other third-party financial institution, would be an utterly unwarranted and unjust misinterpretation both of law and policy."

If there was ever an industry where mobile is not just first but full-steam ahead, it’s the financial services industry, where FinTech — a.k.a. financial services technology — is finding new ways to make spending, managing, and investing our hard-earned money even easier than ever before. From Venmo to Apple Pay, we’re seeing more and more consumers moving to digital currency — digital deposits — even digital investing. And it’s forcing the entire industry to rethink its concept of both brick-and-mortar stores, and everything that goes along with them.If it feels like this change is fast and furious, you’re right. I can still remember the days of waiting in long shopping lines while folks pulled out check books and the numerous required forms of ID that went along with them. Today’s transactions rarely need a signature, let alone a valid driver’s license. In fact, in new stores like Amazon Go, there aren’t even any checkout lines. Customers simply walk out the door and wait for AI to do the dirty work.Clearly, the rise of FinTech has huge implications for the financial services industry, and all of us who use any form of money. The following are a few of the trends currently impacting the industry.
Goodbye, BanksReports show 40% of Americans have not stepped through the doors of a bank or credit union within the last six months. In fact, if you’ve had a difficult time finding a local branch lately, there’s good reason. The number of physical banks has dropped by almost half from 1995 to 2015 — largely due to the rise of online and mobile banking. On the surface, that might seem like good news. With so many users going online (or on phone) to do their banking, banks no longer have to foot the bill for physical space. But the fact remains that many users aren’t just going online, they’re going elsewhere — finding mobile “financial wellness platforms” that allow them to budget, bank, pay, and crowd-fund, all without leaving their homes. In other words, banks are no longer the only game in town when it comes to financial management. There are lots of other companies that save, lend, and invest faster, easier, and cheaper than the former financial giants.Hello, BlockchainBlockchain might best be known as the technology behind digital currencies like Bitcoin. But the technology holds much more promise than digital payments. Blockchain essentially allows for safe and secure trading of almost anything—be it money, ideas, copyrights, or royalty fees — while also eliminating the middle man formerly needed to facilitate or manage the transaction. Blockchain can be used to manage investments, real estate — literally almost anything of value. And the best part is, it can all be done virtually, with limited security risk.New Rules — And ExperiencesI remember the first time I deposited a check from my cell phone. The freedom! Little did I know how much more I’d soon be able to do. FinTech has a huge benefit over traditional banking organizations in that FinTech firms are not subject to the same federal regulations. As such, they have far more freedom to create user experiences that make customers’ lives easier. They aren’t just eliminating the need to deposit your paycheck or send in your mortgage payment. They’re offering opportunities for crowd-sourced investments, the chance to refinance or borrow — the chance to purchase your home or car, entirely via phone! In effect, FinTech is empowering users not just to bank — but to completely rethink their financial well-being. They’re encouraging them to be active participants in their financial lives.Eliminating The Need For MoneyOkay, maybe not money, but physical currency. I remember the first time I went to Europe. My fanny pack was full of traveler’s checks in the local currency. And whatever I didn’t spend, I had to exchange — at a lower rate! — when I got back home. Thanks to bitcoin, that is no longer the case. Bitcoin is a form of purely digital currency, not backed by any nation or government. And while the mysteriousness that surrounds bitcoin might cause some companies to be wary of using it, the fact remains that the digital currency genie is officially out of the bottle. Bitcoin has proven that currency no longer needs a government backer to exist or work in the financial world. That’s huge as we consider the strides FinTech is already making in other areas of the financial services market.Enhanced SecurityAfter the financial collapse of 2007, I’m guessing many people started to reconsider the age-old idea of hiding their money under the mattress, rather than in a traditional bank. Fast forward 10 years, and technology like blockchain has not just eliminated the need for banks in financial transactions, it’s made those transactions even safer than ever before. For those looking to buy, sell, or trade anything of value, the technology exists to do so with complete peace of mind—not to mention, the removal of a middle-man who could be tempted to skim from the top of the profits. While blockchain is not yet available widely as a consumer product, it undoubtedly will find its way further and further into the financial marketplace, allowing many of us to experience financial peace of mind, perhaps for the very first time.Any time money is involved, there will always be intense interest on the part of venture capitalists to keep the ball — er, bitcoin — moving. The changes we’ve seen thus far are nothing compared to what the future holds, largely backed by blockchain’s potential and increasing consumer excitement and demand.Additional Resources On This Topic:How Blockchain and Bitcoin Tech will Fuel the Industrial IoT Blockchain: 2017’s Superstar on the Rise To Market to Millennials, Banking Institutions Must Build a Better Customer Experience

Ali believe a token will help insulate Blockstack from the volatility ...","May 23, 2017,08:50am EDT","Instead of Google, Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn owning your data, imagine a world in which you control the data about yourself and reveal only what is minimally necessary when required. It would be the web equivalent of proving to a bouncer only that you're older than 21, instead of also handing over your birthdate, address and whether you've elected to be an organ donor.","Instead of people in North Korea typing CNN.com into their browser and being redirected to a website of North Korea’s choosing, imagine a world in which North Korea would have to take over, say, the bitcoin network in order to keep someone from seeing the actual CNN.com.This is the world some people are calling Web 3.0 -- and it's built on blockchains.Tuesday, at the main blockchain industry conference, Consensus, one of the companies working on this new decentralized web, Blockstack, which has $5.5 million in funding from Union Square Ventures and AngelList cofounder Naval Ravikant, released a browser add-on that enables that and more.“What’s different is that it comes out of the box with all these decentralized services — decentralized name, decentralized identity, decentralized storage,” said cofounder Ryan Shea. “I can’t think of any browser that’s come out that does all these things and allows the developer to just be plugged in and build an application without having to worry about any servers, worry about any databases, worry about building any identity management system. Just 400 lines of code — boom — you have a decentralized Twitter.”Blockstack homepageThe first version of the Mac and Linux/Windows add-on, which works with any browser such as Chrome, Safari or Firefox, is for developers to use these tools — decentralized identity, storage and payments — to create consumer-facing apps. While other blockchain startups are tackling each of these areas individually, Blockstack has a stack of solutions composed of each of those major parts.“This platform is a full stack, and it’s ready,"" said Muneeb Ali, cofounder. ""It’s not an idea, this is the moment where developers can actually start deploying decentralized applications right now, today, and we’ve made it simple for them to work with the stack so they can focus on the user experience."" In six months, Blockstack plans to release something more targeted to users. The add-on enables a browser to store the user's identity information by a local key on the consumer’s device. (If they lose their key, they can get their identity back via a backup phrase, plus there are other protections such as requiring multiple keys to change the identity.)“Imagine going into the profiles application, and boom, you’ve taken back your identity and data,"" said Shea. ""Now, every user who does this, they have now taken back their identity and data. Every application that wants to build on Blockstack has one user they can sign up with one click — and boom, they have a user.”It also uses a data layer that enables a user to store other kinds of data in traditional data services like Dropbox but in an encrypted form so the service has no visibility into the data. Also, users can prove whether or not the service has tampered with the data. (For those of you who understand the jargon, the cryptographic hashes of the data are stored on the blockchain.) While other decentralized data storage systems actually have pieces of the data stored on multiple computers, Shea and Ali believe that architecture can slow down the system, whereas their system still gives users the performance of a centralized data storage system with the decentralization, privacy and user control benefits of blockchains.In another part of its stack, the company has already gotten 72,000 new domains to register on its system, called the Blockchain Name System (BNS) (as opposed to the Domain Name System, DNS, currently used to manage domain names). In the Blockstack white paper, Shea and Ali write, “Anyone can create a namespace or register names in a namespace, as there is no central party to stop someone from doing so.” The names of stores on OpenBazaar, a kind of decentralized eBay-like network where buyers and sellers connect directly to each other without a corporate entity in the middle extracting fees on either side, use Blockstack names. Blockstack, which has so far resisted incorporating a token, has now changed course and will launch a token as a mechanism for spam protection and for access to the network. While the current network uses the bitcoin blockchain underneath, Shea and Ali believe a token will help insulate Blockstack from the volatility of the public cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin. The use of a token makes BlockStack the latest in a slew of existing blockchain companies who, as the trend toward crowdfunding via token sales has taken off, have belatedly decided to add tokens to their platform. Shea says by adding their own token, not only do they separate their system from the economics of the underlying blockchain (they currently use bitcoin), but they also make it easier for Blockstack to switch to other blockchains if need be. For instance, right now, big fees on the bitcoin blockchain have made it a less attractive option to other companies. However, Blockstack is able to batch transactions so as to keep its costs down. Shea and Ali said they would release more details on their token, such as its name, when or how they would sell it, at a later date. Blockstack isn’t the only effort to make the web more decentralized. Other projects that have also gotten some traction include the Interplanetary File System, or IPFS, which will launch a token for its storage layer, Filecoin, in the coming weeks."

He eventually got $80 million in investment led by Goldman Sachs because, as he puts it, he was managing more markets than their currency trading desk.This experience set him up to appreciate the virtues of bitcoin, which now, along with other cryptocurrencies, is a main focus of Blockchain Capital, the venture capital firm he cofounded with brothers Bart and Brad Stephens. It is the first venture firm to issue shares in a fund in the form of a trade-able digital asset called the BCAP token.It also naturally leads him to make a joke that puns on the ""proof of work"" rule used to append new transactions to bitcoin's ledger: “When we talk about proof of work in video games, it has a whole new meaning,” he says in the latest episode of my podcast, Unchained (Google Play, iTunes, iHeartRadio, Stitcher or TuneIn Radio).Brock Pierce, cofounder and managing director of Blockchain Capital, and Stan Miroshnik, CEO and... [+] cofounder of the Argon GroupThe firm’s third fund, the Blockchain Capital III Digital Liquid Venture Fund, raised $40 million in the traditional way, from limited partners, but $10 million via what it called a BCAP token, which was released in a type of crowdsale called an initial coin offering (ICO) on April 10 to 1,000 investors — 99 wealthy investors in the US (restricted due to regulation), and 901 overseas investors who did not have to meet an income or net worth requirement but did have to submit documents to satisfy “know your customer” regulations.Tune in to find out how Blockchain Capital’s three funds have evolved over time and reflected the direction of the industry, why he missed out on the opportunity to get his investors 40-50x returns in one day, and why his cell phone account is in the hands of T-Mobile’s president’s office — all thanks to me. (Hint, it has to do with this.)Also learn about the Argon Group, a new investment bank focused on the cryptocurrency and token-based capital markets. CEO and cofounder Stan Miroshnik describes how, with his background in investment banking, corporate finance and equities, he saw that a number of entrepreneurs doing ICOs needed an institutional player to help them navigate regulations and serve as a bridge between them and the investors. “You had very deep technical teams taking effectively a break from their product road map for three or four or five months to dig into securities law to try to understand, What jurisdictions can I do this in? Can I not? Do I need to set up a foundation? Should I do this in Switzerland? I’m sitting in the US — can I do this in the US and does the SEC have jurisdiction? And each of these companies was doing this over and over in addition to each of them individually trying to find investors, each individually trying to find and build a platform for the distribution of the  ICO, each of them individually writing their own smart contracts,” he says. Now Argon Group helps these groups with all these issues, and Blockchain Capital was its first client.For its part, Blockchain Capital’s decision to offer the BCAP token was gutsy. “VCs invest in innovation and disruption, but how often do they innovate themselves?” says Pierce. “The VC industry has benefited greatly from technology and the internet, so I see how the VC industry is going to get disintermediated, decentralized, disrupted, so I can sit around and wait for someone to disrupt ourselves, or we can choose to disrupt or cannibalize ourselves.”Tune in to Unchained (Google Play, iTunes, iHeartRadio, Stitcher or TuneIn Radio), to hear our wide-ranging discussion, which touches on everything from why they chose Singapore as the jurisdiction for the token-issuing entity, whether the word “securities” is appropriate to describe the many new cryptocurrencies being offered, and why Pierce thinks everyone doing an ICO from this point forward should follow know-your-customer laws.

Investment terms of their crowdfund campaign have also improved the sponsorship terms to get the project over line and reach its target.","Timing is everything. And, while the move might also reflect investors in the crypto and blockchain space are becoming a bit more discerning about what they actually support, if Snap Inc. - essentially an app - managed to have an IPO value topping $3o billion (bn) on day one of its flotation, just imagine the amount that an app market ITO (initial token offering) could have with a potential blockbuster such as this listed in one of the future portfolios of apps.All apps on Apptrade’s marketplace, which are compared by the founder behind the concept as akin to other marketplaces like the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ or the Nikkei and not other apps, would be showing as the app before they could become the next Snapchat, if you like. It’s surely a thought, no?.Powered by the digital token APPX, Apptrade creates portfolios or groups of apps, whereby if one of those apps becomes the next Instagram or Angry Birds, then the value of the portfolio rises. Well, that’s the theory at least.Apptrade, whose crowdfund that runs for 61 days is now capped at $5 million (m) and presented its concept to the CoinAgenda bitcoin and cryptocurrency conference in Las Vegas last October, will let users select apps to be listed.Specifically, each portfolio will vote in new apps to their respective group. New apps will be listed in a waiting area until selected by a portfolio. App publishers will be able to decide to launch their own portfolio if they think they can attract funding and other apps to their group.It is envisaged that the Apptrade site, which is expected to go live early in 2018 after testing, will bring together app publishers to new financial supporters. Apptrade will be more like a crowdfunding marketplace of app portfolios instead of behaving like venture fund that is a centralized gatekeeper. The difference is that the profits are the perks and each campaign are backed by a portfolios of apps.(Image: Shutterstock).The Apptrade crowdsale, which commenced late this February, is currently being run on the Danish digital currency exchange OpenLedger. For every 1 bitcoin (BTC) a sponsor will receive 2,009 APPX tokens and in stage 2 receive a 25% discount. Tokens can be bought in fiat currencies - Euro, US dollar and Japanese Yen - as well as other crypto currencies including Ethereum (ETH), Waves, DASH and BitShares.Ronny Boesing, CEO of OpenLedger at the decentralized crypto exchange with both fiat and crypto gateways, explained that Apptrade’s ITO changed its valuation in the middle of its crowdsale in response to community feedback over its preliminary offering.The U.S.-educated Dane said: “The Apptrade platform is much too important to not succeed, and it was clear that we needed to adjust the valuation to make it more appealing to anyone deciding to participate. In addition, we wanted to show our belief in this project, and felt that there was no better way to show this than putting our money where our mouth is.”As such OpenLedger will be adding a total of $100,000 (209,464 APPX tokens in return) to Apptrade’s crowdsale over the next seven days. The minimum fundraising goal is set at $1m with a cap of $5m and there are a total of approximately 8.25m APPX tokens on offer to investors.OpenLedger's Apptrade ApS will back these tokens with 20% - representing an increase of 10% - of future revenue from the Apptrade platform, which is expected to go live as a beta version between July 20 and early August later this year before being tested and becoing a fully functional site by next January.Any unsold tokens will be distributed proportionally to all participants. For all early bird participants - as well new participants to date - they will receive the extra tokens according to the published Stage 1 structure detailed on Apptrade's ITO page, plus benefit from the additional tokens to be divided.Revised ValuationDaniel Pineda, founder of Apptrade based in Santa Monica, California, commenting said: “It might seem odd to change valuation in the middle of the crowdsale, and we might even be the first to ever do so. However, we feel that is the right thing to do to ensure a satisfactory outcome.”He added: “We firmly believe that our platform with its legal framework based on Danish jurisdiction, and built on the ecosystem of OpenLedger with its high-tech BitShares financial trading platform is one of the best things to ever happen in Blockchain development and will be one of the key future success stories.""Apptrade’s final valuation - slated between $5m and $25m) - will be based on the amount raised, whether that is $1m as its threshold or money back guarantee. Should the minimum threshold not be reached, funds used to sponsor the project will be returned in full, or indeed the maximum of $5m. Ultimately, the valuation of the Apptrade platform will be determined on what is raised.Boesing elaborating said: “This approach and change of valuation resulted from requests from within the cryptocurrency community, and we hope to accommodate many more participants. But one thing is clear to all of the early bird investors - this is your lucky day!”From a sponsor’s perspective, it is understood that any previous talks about offering up to 100m tokens per year and a total of 1bn tokens, has been dropped completely. Instead a total of 8.25m APPX tokens is what will be available - and no more.Previously all participants were to receive a 10% ‘wholesale’ revenue from all future results on the Apptrade platform. This has now been increased to 20%. Add to that any unsold tokens will be dropped for all participants proportionally, and its valuation is set at a $25m ceiling instead of a previous figure of around $600m.All these factors should help improve the future value of the APPX master token as well as the present stage 2 price with a 25% discount should allow all to feel the potential benefits. The price per token has not been changed but the potential outcome would seem to have been positively shewed.Now this is in an industry that equates to upwards of $30bn (revenue/earnings only) and a growing app market. Just take the Apple Inc.’s App Store that this Janaury was reported to have generated revenues that reached an eye-popping amount of around $28.5bn in 2016 (2015: c.$20bn).A temporary token APPX.WARRANT will be distributed to all participants in Apptrade from the first day that the minimum threshold has been reached. Then it will be possible to buy, sell and trade this token on OpenLedger's decentralized exchange.As to comments passed on the previously set terms under Apptrade’s ITO and why the crowdsale was revised, one community member at BitShares wrote: “With a potential of 1 billion tokens, and a valuation of $600m with a 10% revenue I find it hard to see when I will ever reach breakeven or even start making money, where is the ‘What's in it for me?’” So it would seem notice has been taken.Apptrade’s InspirationOf course potential investors may wish to know more about the brains and concept behind Apptrade, which defines ‘apps’ as intangible goods that span  mobile apps, music, ebooks, 3-D asset libraries, blogs, photos and other digital-based properties, as well as the major obstacles and issues that led to it being developed.On this note Pineda told Forbes “I found a niche market where developers are buying and selling apps in a B2B setting. Where one developer would buy app from another, similar to how real-estate investors bought and sold real estate.”He added: “Only instead of fix and flipping houses...its apps and other private digital properties. Big publishers would shop these markets looking for ready-made apps that they can leverage.”Explaining his journey and thinking in terms of coming to that view, app broker Pineda, who went to school for video game design and partly paid for that working at a class action law firm, explained: “I stumbled upon this market place out of a frustration of having a previously failed app launched years ago. It was an obsession to answer the question of ‘What makes an app go viral?’” It was at the law firm that he was exposed to the protocol of law and accountability, which has no doubt come in handy.His work experience of app brokering and app publishing started years after working as a UX freelancer having collected valuable media and branding skills. While his friends worked for studios, Pineda took what he described as the “unprofitable route of indie app publishing.""After sharing the same experiences with some of his colleagues, they learned that mobile app marketing and fundraising can be “brutally Darwinian” according to the Californian-based fintech pioneer.“Rarely would you see a developer with tens of thousands of monthly average users (MAUs) trade traffic with smaller apps,” he added. And, when reaching out to investors, it can often be at times a challenge to encourage investors to take a risk with non-proven intellectual property. Why blame them?”But what his peers did not understand is that it goes both ways. “Investors have so many eggs in too many baskets out there and the odds still stand at 1/10 business success ratio, as it goes. Apps were no different in probability,” he asserted.Pineda said that what was missing from the wholesale digital goods markets was a way to “incubate apps during their listing."" Reflecting he revealed that it was back in 2006 - before apps - that he had a brush with researching real-estate investment trusts (REITs).“REITs were an asset class that grouped capital into larger real-estate projects that either participants could not undertake individually,” he noted. “What stood out was the idea of diversifying the capital into various real projects and real-estate investment strategies. Investors big and small would share in the dividends from this fund.”He added: “What struck me was that before REITs, only commercial banks and state parties were able to invest in such projects. Nothing like this existed for digital properties (IP). We heard of some indie app publishers that were selling to hedge funds, yet no marketplace existed for larger private deals. Bingo!”A search for a better way to market Pineda’s apps then turned into a method for funding a growing inventory of apps designs. As he put it: “The theory shifted to answer how do we have a group budget for marketing, development through bundling cash flow? What medium would we use to show accountability within a group?”That journey took him and fellow associates from grouping promissory notes to possibly forming series LLCs. Until early 2015, after sticking with the search for a solution and going full time on refining our model of collaborative funding, efforts paid off.He said further: ""Timing had Blockchain technology brewing in the background. A proven system for the transfer of value. And, a level beneath the money aspect was what gave this tech its true meaning. It was the ability to bring together strangers to reach a consensus on a shared platform that piqued my interest. The very philosophy of a participatory model was crystallized in an actual technology.”By this time it was 2016 and the blockchain and related technology was already blossoming into other expressions and new decentralized applications. Now enter the smart contract and bitshares.“That was the final answer for an app portfolio profit sharing,” he said. “A system for controlling these mini funds. Each portfolio would be its own decentralized application.” This was where sponsors support a group of digital goods by purchasing a token. And, a decentralized exchange was he described as ""the grand medium"" that would once again pivot the trajectory of their commercial pursuits.Pineda argued that: “If the Internet shaped the 21st century, Blockchain could make it possible to peg an economy to assets backed by digital goods and individual digital brands. As more people become their own digital empires, there is no need to lose control of ownership and direction like before when only the big publishing houses media outlets, and music labels were the gatekeepers to finance and distribution.”Concluding he said: “The vision for Apptrade is for more digital publishers to keep control of their projects, have access to resources. If the universe allows, that they coordinated promotional efforts with other digital makers.”Note: A strategic overview on Apptrade covering the company’s structure, the app portfolio marketplace, the start-up’s portfolio expansion and plans, its APPX master token and revenue distribution can be viewed via this link.

transactions. Property And Title Transfers. Another type of transaction

Is it a niche hobby for tech geeks? Is it the same thing as bitcoin?Blockchain is the technology that underlies bitcoin — the cryptocurrency — but it is not synonymous with bitcoin.At its core, blockchain is a ledger of transactions similar to a database. Everyone in the financial industry is familiar with ledgers. This is just a more high-tech kind of ledger.A blockchain ledger is a distributed ledger, meaning no one party has control over (and therefore the ability to manipulate) the ledger. Blockchain technology is open source and decentralized. All transactions are locked in, and the “blocks” are essentially immutable.So why does this matter, and what are the future implications of this technology on the finance and accounting world?I’ll go through some of the biggest accounting-related implications.Movement Of MoneyCurrently, the movement of money is still pretty slow given all of the technology we have available. Transactions still take a few days to process, and bank accounts rarely reflect exactly how much money is actually in the bank.One of the biggest potential implications of blockchain technology on finance and accounting is for instantaneous movement of money, or real-time financial transactions. That means no more waiting for transactions to hit your bank account or for checks to go through before seeing your financials.Status: Happening now. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin allow for real-time, peer-to-peer transactions.Property And Title TransfersAnother type of transaction that could be greatly improved by incorporating blockchain technology is property and title transfers. The ability of blockchain to lock original agreements and documents into the ledger would make disputes between parties later down the road incredibly difficult and therefore less likely to happen.The blockchain community refers to these types of agreements, verified by the blockchain, as smart contracts. They argue that smart contracts have the potential to remove middlemen from agreement procedures entirely in some cases.Status: Happening now. Some state, local, and even national governments, like Cook County, Chicago and the Republic of Georgia, have already begun using blockchain technology to verify and lock in property transfer documents. Real estate fraud, which can happen if someone forges a signature on a title deed and sells a home to an unsuspecting buyer, will be much more difficult when legal systems are using blockchain to verify deeds.Financial Statement AuditsAnyone with an internet connection can download the entire history of public blockchain transactions. Transactions that are recorded in real time and can’t be altered can be audited daily, eliminating the need for the expensive audits public companies are required to have every quarter.What bookkeeping and financial transactions come down to, in the end, is trust and transparency. The ability to go back and alter transactions, “cook the books,” or post falsified sales or profits creates an inherent lack of trust for an investor in a business. Mathematical proofs and a decentralized database can virtually eliminate the mistrust that sometimes comes with unaudited financial statements.According to Deloitte, “At the end of the road, fully automated audits may be reality.”Small businesses will benefit greatly from this, since most cannot afford to have their financial statements audited on a regular basis and therefore having multiple investors is difficult. Giving millions of small businesses in America reliable, accurate, trustworthy financials will empower them to do many of the things only large enterprise businesses could do previously.Status: Not there yet. More companies will have to use a private blockchain ledger to record financial transactions before this technology becomes widely available.Triple-Entry AccountingBitcoin enthusiasts have already dubbed the blockchain bookkeeping revolution ""triple-entry bookkeeping,"" because records of transactions between debtor/creditors would be recorded in the blockchain network as well as on the debtor/creditors’ private accounts, creating a third record instead of the traditional double-entry method of bookkeeping.This would revolutionize bookkeeping, making it instantaneous, unchangeable and more reliable and trustworthy than it ever has been.Status: Happening in the near future. Companies like ConsenSys are currently working on making triple-entry bookkeeping a reality.Document VerificationBlockchain technology would allow companies to certify the accuracy and legitimacy of documents. A hash string can be created of a file, creating a unique identifier for that particular file, and then that hash string is embedded and timestamped into the blockchain. That transaction cannot be changed, so when that hash string is searched for again, you can have complete confidence that the document has remained unchanged and the timestamp is accurate.Status: Happening now. Companies like Microsoft have already begun to use services like Stampery to validate their documents.What This Means For YouLike any technology, it is impossible to predict the exact timing and effect that blockchain will have on the accounting industry. As an accounting professional, you do not need to be an expert in blockchain today. As stated, most of the potential impacts have yet to materialize at scale. You should, however, be ready to quickly learn and utilize the new technologies when they hit traction in the marketplace.The rate of technological change in finance and accounting is increasing. I'm confident that when a change toward blockchain for accounting begins, it will move even faster than the change to the cloud did in the past."

A veteran of Microsoft, Intel, Turner Broadcasting and InStadium, a Chicago marketing company that works with sports venues, Khaund, 45, became interested in ticketing when he realized how easy it was for resellers to print fake tickets from PDFs. He got the idea to use blockchain technology, the technology behind Bitcoin, to create one-of-a-kind digital tickets. Since his software can collect data on individual ticket holders and communicate with them directly, it also allows event owners to target fans with pitches for products or additional tickets. In March 2016, he launched Upgraded Inc. in Walnut Creek, CA. In this interview, which has been edited and condensed, he explains why it’s been a struggle to recruit customers and why he’s not trying to put ticket reseller StubHub out of business.Susan Adams: Where did you get the idea for your company?Sandy Khaund: I’m a huge sports fan and when I was working for InStadium, I started to hear from our customers that there was a problem with ticketing.Adams: What was the problem?Khaund: Tickets are static. If the game time changes from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m., there’s no way to tell ticket holders. The other problem is it’s easy to fake tickets. If you buy them on Craigslist, you don’t know if the seller printed out a dozen PDFs of the same ticket and sold them to other people.Adams: How common is ticket fraud?Khaund: It happens a lot. Last year at game seven of the NBA Western Conference championship between the Golden State Warriors and the Oklahoma City Thunder, 86 people got rejected at the gate with tickets they’d bought from StubHub. At least StubHub has a money-back guarantee but those people didn’t get to go to the game.Adams: How did you figure out you could solve those problems?Khaund: The issue is that ticket sellers don’t have a digital asset that’s singular. We realized one way the tech world has overcome this is with Bitcoin, which uses blockchain technology. It works like a huge ledger with debits and credits. If I give you a Bitcoin and then try to give a duplicate to someone else, the ledger says I can’t. I thought, we need that for tickets.Adams: How difficult was it to create your software?Khaund: We made a prototype but then we discovered a new technology called Ethereum. Ethereum is to Bitcoin what a credit card is to a dollar bill. It’s a programmable set of code. It makes the ticket much more than a dumb token. You can set price restrictions. We can also hide the bar code until two hours before the event. And we could make it so that you have to be within one kilometer of the venue for the bar code to appear. The biggest challenge was working with nascent technology. There are not a lot of people who can answer your questions.Sandy KhaundAdams: Did you hold onto your day job while you were developing the technology?Khaund: I left InStadium in January 2016 and went with my family to India for two weeks. I thought if I’m still interested in the ticket idea when I get back, I’m going to throw myself into it. If I’m not, I’ll go get a real job. When I was in India I couldn’t shake the idea.Adams: How did you finance your startup costs?Khaund: I had savings so I bootstrapped. I spent $50,000 of my own money and we’ve raised $300,000 in angel money.All the trials and triumphs of building a business – delivered to your inbox.Adams: How did you get your first customer?Khaund: We talked to a half dozen major league teams and one of them said it would give us 100 tickets to one of its less popular games to see if the technology would work. It did. We did that test for free.Adams: Why would a sports team want to pay for your product?Khaund: Altruism is one reason. Teams want to prevent fraud. But more important, they want to know who’s going to their games. Typically, I’d buy three tickets and give two to other people. The team doesn’t know who those people are.Adams: Why does the team care who uses the tickets?Khaund: Since the ticket is interactive, it can become a conduit between the team and the fans. The ticket is then a way to do targeted marketing. If the team knows you’ve gone to 14 Yankees games this year, it may want to sell you an Aaron Judge jersey. The team could also try to sell you more tickets.Adams: That seems promising. Have you struggled to sign up more teams since then?Khaund: In April, we ran a test with an NBA team, with more features that delivered richer data back to them.Adams: Who was your first paying customer?Khaund: The Dream Bowl, a college football game held in January.Adams: How much did you charge?Khaund: A flat fee of $2 to $4 a ticket, plus a percentage of the ticket fee. The fans pay the fee.Adams: Don’t fans already resent how much more they pay over the cost at the box office to a service like Ticketmaster?Khaund: We have to prove that we provide extra value. The market will tell us how much we can charge.Adams: Are you trying to compete with Ticketmaster?Khaund: No. My goal isn’t to replace Ticketmaster or StubHub. It’s to be the Intel chip inside of ticketing. When you go to Ticketmaster, you get a drop-down that says PDF, postal service or will call. In the short term, I want to be the fourth option. In the long term, I want to be the only option. The other three options should not exist.Adams: Why would ticket buyers choose your option if it means they have to pay more for their tickets?Khaund: That’s our long-term vision. When PDFs first came out, sellers charged $3 or $4 more for them. Right now, we’re focusing on ticket brokers who make such a significant margin on each ticket, the idea of throwing a portion of the cost back to us is no big deal. Tickets to the NBA final went for $4,500. StubHub already charges fees of something like 10% to the buyer and 15% to the seller.Adams: Is your goal to make Ticketmaster your client?Khaund: Yes. We can help them market more tickets and provide valuable information to their clients.Adams: How many ticket brokers are using your product?Khaund: We have a partner who is going to give us access to those value-added resellers. We’re a startup so we don’t have the resources to go from broker to broker. We could cold-call them but they wouldn’t take our calls.  We already have the first broker lined up and we expect to see revenue in July or August."

So far AI works great when it is set to focus on a single task, like forecasting bitcoin fluctuations, but it's less reliable when it has to deal with a number of simultaneous, interwoven factors.One of the current constraints of artificial intelligence is called ""catastrophic forgetting"", and researchers have been struggling with it for a while.In short this means that an AI system needs to forget the skills and knowledge it has learnt in the past, in order to learn new ones.ShutterstockIn other words, to add a single object or a single task, while keeping the same overall amount of information, a neural network would have to be retrained on all of the objects, which is usually done using powerful servers located in the cloud.Google's Deep Mind researchers have demonstrated recently that this is not a insurmountable challenge. Today Neurala, which recently closed a whooping $14 funding round, will be demoing its own solution at the GPU Technology Conference in San Jose, California.According to sources from the company, Neurala’s breakthrough solves the “catastrophic forgetting” problem for deep learning neural networks instantly at the computing device, without the need of being connected to a server.“The ability to learn on the fly and at the edge means that the Neurala approach enables learning directly on the device, without all the drawbacks of cloud learning. In addition, it eliminates network latency, increases real-time performance, and ensures privacy where needed. Most importantly, it will unlock the development of a sea of cloud-less applications,"" Versace says.Industrial machines, for instance, could be updated in the field for specific tasks; drones could learn how to identify problems at the tops of cell towers or solar panel arrays, anything from ""smart"" toys to self-driving cars could be personalized by the owners according to their whims, without having too much to worry about privacy issues (as the data would not be shared externally).Neurala’s neural network software uses a bio-inspired approach to mimic the way the human brain learns and analyzes its environment. Dubbed the ""Neurala Brain"" approach, it was recently published as U.S. Patent No. 9,626,566, under the name “Methods and Apparatus for Autonomous Robotic Control.”Instead of the current stove-piped processing that parses discrete inputs, as Versace describes it in a guest post on Venture Beat, in the future AIs will be able to leverage integrated deep learning frameworks that work simultaneously toward the same goal. Just like the human brain does, when it takes into account multiple and simultaneous factors before making a decision.The ""Brain"" was originally developed for the NASA, to help its rovers navigate and investigate other planets autonomously, overcoming constraints of limited processing power, scarce battery life and limited communications. Current customers of the startup include Parrot and Teal Drones."

Many of them are some of the most well-known blockchain and crypto companies today — Coinbase, Xapo, Chain, Ripple (all 2016 Forbes Fintech 50 awardees) — and up and comers such as Bitpesa, Netki, Axoni, Abra, Blockstack, Protocol Labs and others.A lot of the credit for cultivating this group of blockchain all-stars goes to DCG’s director of development Meltem Demirors. DCG’s number two talked about how the company’s investment strategy has changed over time, makes predictions about the future development of the space and tells regulators what would helps companies in the space in the latest and final season 2 episode of my podcast, Unchained (Google Play, iTunes, iHeartRadio, Stitcher or TuneIn Radio).Meltem Demirors, Digital Currency Group's director of developmentShe lays out DCG’s methodical strategy for creating a better financial system that begins with developing the blockchain technology itself — the blockchain protocols like bitcoin, Ethereum, Zcash, Ripple, Rootstock — and then moves to building exchanges that could move fiat money into and out of digital currency in countries around the world such as India, the Philippines, Argentina and Kenya. On top of the exchanges, DCG began helping payment companies, such as Wyre and Veem, two business-to-business blockchain companies. “Then on top of payments, we started asking, Okay, we have digital currencies. We’re digitizing assets. What about identity? How do we deal with digitizing identity? Then, we started seeing use cases around distributed ledgers. So if I have this digital asset, and a digital identity associated with it, how do I track that asset through its life cycle?”In terms of blockchain applications that she expected to take off but haven’t, the first she names is bitcoin — that a lot of people envisioned it as a global currency used by merchants and individuals, but it hasn’t been used that way by as many as people as originally anticipated. The other surprise she cites is “how much enterprise blockchain product is out there and how willing enterprises are to engage with this technology … But it’s really amazing to see our largest institutions working on projects that actually touch their core business.” However, Demirors does concede many institutions that may feel comfortable with blockchain still feel a tension about blockchain-based digital assets.Speaking of tension, we also discussed why it is that DCG has thrown its considerable weight, particularly with investors, behind Ethereum Classic, the coin which currently trades at a lower value to Ethereum. The company has created an investment vehicle similar to the Bitcoin Investment Trust offered by its subsidiary Grayscale called the Ethereum Classic Investment Trust. “I want to separate the protocol from the token,” she says. “We see a lot of value in people building on top of Ethereum, but from a financial perspective we’ve chosen to invest in Ethereum Classic because of immutability. What happened after the DAO hack was concerning. The fact that you could fork a network and make a major economic decision — as an investor, looking at this through the investor lens, I think it’s very hard as an institution to get comfortable with that idea.”We also cover the token/“initial coin offering” (ICO) craze (which I’ve covered in a several previous podcasts with Olaf Carlson-Wee, Coin Center and the organizers of Token Summit, William Mougayar and Nick Tomaino). Demirors says, “A lot of people who are buying these tokens don’t actually know what they’re buying. A lot of these projects that have gotten funded have no product…. The developers walk away with millions of dollars. and what’s their incentive then to build the platform or the product? It’s a weird timing mismatch issue. We see digital currencies worth hundreds of millions and massive market caps but there’s no product, there’s no network, there’s no protocol, there’s nothing.” She also worries that negative events in ICOs could harm the industry overall: “We already have a perception issue that we’ve been battling now for four years to overcome. … I would hate to see ICOs contribute to that negative narrative.”That is part of the reason she is skeptical of crypto hedge funds. “Right now, we’re in a bubble. … Everything has been up and to the right, but there will be a correction at some point. What happens when there’s a correction?” Plus, she isn’t so sure that many of them have experience managing portfolios. “I wish people the most success in what they do, … but being a regulated financial entity is very different than buying cryptocurrencies in your spare time. I just don’t know that people who are getting into that space know what they’re signing up for. It’s not easy being an investor that manages other people’s money.”Tune in to the full episode (Google Play, iTunes, iHeartRadio, Stitcher or TuneIn Radio) to find out what Demirors’ greatest wish is from regulators to help the space — I was certainly surprised — and what she thinks best practices are for new tokens and ICOs. Plus, she explains why she started a Women in Blockchain series in her spare time, gives us a sneak peek into her potentially far-reaching work with blockchain at the World Economic Forum and tells us what tokens she’s most excited about.Regular listeners, just a heads up that this will be the final episode of Season 2. Season 3 launches Tuesday, July 11, with another 12 great episodes. Thanks for listening!"

what does it have to do with protecting genomic data? A: It has become ...","May 8, 2017,08:00am EDT","Genomic testing is ushering in a new age of medicine, as we get closer to the $100 genome. Patients can be treated with much more precision, tailored-made to their own individual genetic makeups for more effectiveness. But radical change, even for the better, often brings ethical and societal issues we also need to watch.","One major concern is over privacy and security of genomic data. For instance, policymakers in Washington recently threatened to make genomic data necessarily available to employers. Complicating the privacy issue is the fact that there’s no clear legal owner of genomic data; that data was found to be unpatentable and, because it lacks authorship or a creator (legally), cannot be copyrighted.It seems the only way to have any control over your genomic data is to simply not get tested, keeping that data hidden “in” one’s own body. But this defeats the entire point of most modern medical genomic technology.Credit: ShutterstockPhilosopher David Koepsell has been pushing the frontiers of ownership and protection of genomic data for nearly a decade. In 2009, his book Who Owns You foreshadowed the lawsuit, a couple months later, by the ACLU and other parties against Myriad Corporation based on its patents on the BRCA genes. Those patents would have allowed Myriad to effectively monopolize the testing market for breast and ovarian cancer.Myriad eventually lost their patents; the US and Australian Supreme Courts invalidated them on the grounds that the patents were improperly applied to naturally occurring things rather than inventions. But these cases still left something critical unresolved, which Dr. Koepsell has been working on: Given that individuals do not legally “own” their genomic information today, how can we best ensure the security and privacy of our personal genomic data?Recently, Koepsell and his long-time collaborator and partner, Dr. Vanessa Gonzalez—having together authored many publications about genomic data and privacy—started a software company to solve the problem. It’s unusual for academics, especially a philosopher, to stray this far outside their comfort-zones, but they have a plan to build a technical solution based on blockchain technology.In the interview below, Koepsell elaborates on the ethical problems, which have been a roadblock to scientific progress:Q: What made you decide to leave typical academic work and start a software company?A: I’ve been an academic for more than a decade and became familiar with the typical academic trajectory of research and publication about issues both abstract and practical. I got very lucky that a book I wrote—about what I considered an interesting abstract and metaphysical problem—came out very shortly before a lawsuit was filed to actually address what many considered to be injustices relating to gene patents. I was thrust into the world of policy as a result, and the outcome was extremely satisfying, as well as an educational experience in itself.When the non-patentability of genes was resolved by the US Supreme Court’s unanimous Myriad decision, there were still a number of unresolved issues that promised to hinder genomic science and medicine. I did as usual: I wrote about them, gave lectures and courses, and little more. But during that research and teaching, I realized that I had also discovered a rather exciting solution, one that was not dependent upon policy, and one that could be solved with blockchain technology.At first, I considered the usual academic route: to apply for grants and hire postdocs, then write articles and books. I found some collaborators, including my wife, and we began researching and writing. But we quickly realized we could not create the solution without a lot of grant money, which would take at least a year and was by no means certain. Meanwhile, the architecture of the solution we imagined was clear to us. So we found seed money, hired a developer, and got to building it. To do this in a reasonable way, we needed to form a company, which we did: Encrypgen, LLC, incorporated in Florida.Q: How much of this current work is informed by your academic work?A: At my previous job as a professor at the Delft University of Technology in Holland, our section on technology and values was deeply involved in research on “designing for values” sometimes also referred to as “value-sensitive design.” The traditional engineering idea that ethics and technology are two entirely separate fields is mistaken. When we design objects and services we are always incorporating some value of some kind into them.Blockchain cooks in the values of privacy, security, and ownership. This is the insight that economist Hernando de Soto had when he began to embrace blockchain solutions for tracking land titles. We realized we could use the same technology already built around privacy, security, and ownership—the values that are also necessary for genomic data protection—without blocking scientific progress. Indeed, blockchains can safely hide your genomes from prying eyes and, at the same time, allow scientists to gather anonymized information about large populations—and only then use that data with the donor’s permission.Q: Why should we be worried about genomic data privacy or security?A: Genomic data is extremely sensitive. Most people are not aware that your DNA contains information about your life expectancy, your proclivity to depression or schizophrenia, your complete ethnic ancestry, your expected intelligence, maybe even your political inclinations. Within a decade or two your genome will likely reveal even more.For example, you may be denied health insurance because you carry genes linked to breast cancer. Or maybe eventually you may be denied promotion because, according to your DNA, your skills set does not fit with the expected job profile. Your genomic data can be misused by potential employers, unscrupulous corporations, and governments in any number of unexpected ways. It must therefore be kept private.But anonymized genomic data is also vital for scientific progress. Personalized medicine became possible only by analyzing genomic data from thousands of donors. Genomic data help scientists create better treatments for specific groups, understand the role of genetics in diseases and immunities, and do some important research. Personalized medicine may be possible when we know a person’s genetic makeup, meaning we can tailor our treatments to an individual specifically. This cuts costs and increases efficiency, and targets the treatment to the person in the best way possible.The apparent conflict between privacy and scientific progress makes the promise of genomic science and medicine particularly tricky. This conflict will intensify as costs go down and more secrets are unlocked. The question will soon be very pressing: How can we store our data for personal, medical use safely and without risking its misuse, especially as hackings of sensitive data are so common? Luckily, blockchains tailored to these values can reconcile this conflict.Q: Blockchains are usually linked to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.  So, what does it have to do with protecting genomic data?A: It has become increasingly apparent that blockchains offer powerful applications well beyond cryptocurrencies, which is where much of the public attention is presently focused. The reason bitcoin is so useful and valuable is that the blockchain creates a distributed ledger: an immutable, distributed record which is also nearly impossible to hack. The owner of a bitcoin account has absolute control over their asset. This is a perfect solution for storing any kind of highly sensitive data, and there is a great deal of interest in applying the tech to applications other than cryptocurrencies.For example, DARPA is looking into using blockchain for protecting nuclear weapons data. Blockchain solutions are being developed for tracking diamonds, intellectual property rights, and for real-world logistics. People have been thinking about using blockchain for genomics for a while; we just wanted to do it a certain way and first to maximize the ethical safeguards we think are most important. The major obstacle for everyone has been dealing with such large datasets, and keeping the functioning of a large blockchain above a slow crawl given how the processing of blockchain data typically works.Q: So what can a genomic blockchain do? A: Well, for individuals, it will be a safe place to store their genomic data. If you get tested and want to always be able to access that data, then store it on the Gene-Chain free of charge. Your data will be more secure than most other solutions, including carrying around a USB stick which you could lose. On the Gene-Chain, your data is virtually unhackable, encrypted, and you can provide a time-limited key to your doctor or others with whom you want or need to share the data.  You can also choose exactly what part of your genome to share. We can also track misuse of that data, which has a unique signature.For scientists, they will have access to the metadata—the data about the data, such as age, ethnicity, gender, etc.—and can search for potential subjects whose data might be useful and interesting for their studies. That search reveals nothing specific or personal about the donor, and it does not give them access to the genomic data itself. But they can make a request to the donor, who can then choose whether to allow its use, negotiate terms for getting paid for that use (possibly), and finally go through the ethical consent procedure necessary for their particular jurisdiction.All of this will mean a real revolution in genomic science, as well as provide donors of data with greater protection than ever. Blockchain also enables a lot of that functionality because one of its strengths, besides extremely strong encryption, is managing transactions. Research institutes and companies with large amount of genomic data can purchase licenses to store their data without worrying about the ethics, which is baked into the product and its transactions, allowing them to instead focus on the science.Q: How do we know that blockchain is unhackable? Aren’t blockchains just a hyped version of good-old-fashioned encrypted databases?A: Your bank has an encrypted database containing the authoritative and only copy of your current balance. Although the bank backs up and secures the data, it can still be hacked or manipulated—which happens a lot more often than banks care to reveal. The TV series Mr. Robot tells how a group of determined hackers can cause a major financial-data Armageddon. That is virtually impossible on a blockchain, such as the one that supports bitcoin. Hack one node and the remaining tens of thousands of nodes will immediately reject the manipulated records.This is why Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Santander, Royal Bank of Canada, PwC, and many other banks, insurers, and other financial institutions are conducting intensive research in blockchain technology. It’s because blockchains are much more difficult to hack.A mathematical theorem, the Byzantine Generals theorem, proves that it takes coordination between at least one third of the nodes to successfully attack a blockchain network. It doesn’t mean that data is 100% secure, but to attack the chain itself successfully requires orders of magnitude more time and resources than any other security measure. That’s another reason military and banks are interested in blockchains.Another benefit of this parallelism is that blockchains are essentially built as a peer-to-peer technology: available everywhere, always. Blockchains have limitations too, mostly relating to size and speed, but they offer unprecedented levels of privacy, security, and ownership.Q: Genomes are very big. Are you expecting difficulties with storing genomic data?A: Absolutely. Storing and sharing genomic data is a technical problem that many are trying to solve, and computation has been a great boon for the research. A raw genomic data file is about 5 to 6 gigabytes of information given that the human genome is 3 billion base pairs long, and there is a lot of important associated tagging of that data done when a genome is sequenced.So far, doing whole-genome sequencing has been very expensive, and so the amount of such data has been pretty unmanageable. The 1000-Genome Project has put the results of their full genome sequencing on the web, and you can download those sequences and play around with them for free, but managing and sifting through the data is unwieldy. They use a reference-file method to compress their data, because human genomes are 99.5% similar, so we can basically ignore all the stuff that is the same from person to person and just focus on the differences, which is a really good way to make the useful datasets smaller and easier to work with.Even so, once you get a lot of these files, you are still talking about a significant amount of data to process, so we have to come up with better ways to compress the data without loss. In our case, we are using “deep learning” techniques, which essentially use artificial agents to do the math for us.Q: The law solved questions relating to gene patents; why not press for legal protections for genomic data?A: Legal protections for genomic data mean two things: ensuring the greatest possible form of protection for the data by data curators, and punishing those who misuse the data. Ensuring the greatest means of protecting the data is largely a technical problem, and so far the solutions out there are inadequate. There may well be a social need to punish those who hack and misuse the data, but until the technology is adequate to the task given the risks, we cannot expect the law alone to properly protect people.Also, because the Myriad case made owning genomic data more or less impossible, a technical solution may be the best way to give some sort of property protection to people for their data. The law and technology can work hand-in-hand to solve these types of problems, but sometimes technology may have to lead the way.Q: How is genomic data stored now, and should we worry about it?A: Some is stored publicly, like the 1000-Genomes Project data, although it is de-identified to the extent that names have been removed. But a recent Harvard study showed that public data could be pretty easily re-identified and the donors could be determined for about half the data. That should definitely concern people who thought their donated data would aid science without revealing sensitive data about themselves.Commercial entities and research institutes relying on privately storing data use anything from cloud-based Oracle databases to locking hard-drives in safes or filing cabinets, which may satisfy current ethics guidelines but certainly won’t remain state-of-the-art as blockchain surpasses it, nor are they ideal for use in science. We should certainly demand better solutions for all our important personal data, and genomics, if it is to achieve its scientific and medical potential, should be at the forefront of our privacy and security demands.~ ~ ~"

So this head-to-head is out of date, see the latest Assistant Vs. Alexa score here. Both Amazon and Google are rushing to add new features to their respective home voice-assistants. But do these new features mean they can answer more complex questions?I put 45 reasonably difficult questions to Home and Alexa, below is how they fared. If you missed the first round of head-to-head questions, check them out here. An easy one that both got right. Home answered comfortably. I had to enable a bitcoin skill on Alexa to get the right exchange rate, and I had to ask in the way the skills recommends you ask. It got there, but with a fair bit of effort that largely defeats the point. Update: someone pointed out to me that Home can flip a coin. After asking several more times, it did manage to flip a coin eventually. I'm not sure why it struggles - perhaps it's a diction issue - but it got there. Alexa did this first time. Home couldn’t answer, Alexa gave me listings for “films on near London” which is equally as useless. Home named Arrival, Deadpool and Star Wars. Alexa didn’t “know that one”, whatever that means. Home listed out some episode names by random, Alexa couldn’t answer.Alexa has a string of Uber options, unfortunately it doesn’t recognise my home address - and has steadfastly refused to since I bought it months ago - so this is useless. Home has no Uber functionality. Home delivered a helpful b-flat. Alexa just played tracks from Spotify. So Home can’t reserve tables at restaurants, despite that functionality being available with Assistant on your phone. Alexa can’t do it either. Home gave me: Showtimes for Baahubali 2: The Conclusion, Legend of the Sword and Alien: Covenant. A strange mix that omits blockbusters like The Fate of the Furious and Guardians of the Galaxy 2. Alexa gave me…...tumbleweeds. Neither can change their voice. Or, in other words, Arnie won’t be taking my commands any time soon. Neither device could answer. Google Home took me through some options for flights to popular destinations, asked when I wanted to go and gave me prices. It then tracked prices and sent me updates via email. But there was no option to actually book the flight. With the Sky Scanner skill enabled, I asked for the same flight options that I queried Home about (a return trip to New York in two weeks). It takes a lot longer to go through the questions and after answering every question, Alexa went looking for flights for about 60 seconds and returned with an error message. Home did this on first go, as did Alexa after I enabled a translation skill. A nice concept from Amazon that, in practice, doesn’t work very well. Firstly, not many books are supported. And every time I tried a different book, Alexa said “sorry, The Girl on the Train isn’t available for reading”, despite me never asking for The Girl on the Train. When I settled on Cloud Atlas, it quickly became clear Alexa’s voice isn’t suited for reading books. The pacing and intonation are off, as are pronunciations. Home has no similar functionality. Home listed options of places that aren’t nearby, but still in London. And they weren’t even good places. After I input a different address, Alexa found some pizza restaurants. But I don’t know if they’re local or not because Alexa just read out names of chain restaurants with no details on location. Both got it right.Both handled this easily enough, as you’d expect.Home recognised the follow up question and added it to ‘my playlist’. Alexa said it can’t edit playlists. I got a detailed breakdown of different prices for different size options, plus a little tid-bit about how much it costs Apple to make an iPhone 7 - all taken from a top Google search result. Alexa couldn’t answer. Neither could answer. Neither could answer. Alexa replied with ‘would you like to shop?’, which I assumed meant shop on Ebay. But actually meant shop on Amazon (of course) - sneaky. Home had nothing. Incredibly, neither had an answer for this. Home, hilariously, didn’t know the answer to this. Yet it had a bucket load of pricing options for Apple’s iPhone 7. Alexa had nothing. Home read out from a search result. Alexa had nothing. Home doesn’t know where to buy Amazon Fire TV. Google recently added a feature for Home to take you through a recipe step by step, but it doesn’t seem to be available yet. That or it isn’t working for me. Alexa has lots of cooking related skills on the store. I tried out Jamie Oliver’s and it just sends a recipe to you in email form, which defeats the purpose. I also tried the AllRecipes skill that’s advertised, but it’s not available in the UK. I had to ask this question a couple of times to get the right response from Google, at which point it said “here are the business hours for your local Waitrose” and then did nothing. Alexa answered correctly with the original question. Neither has the ability to do this, another massive own goal. Home gave me three parties and then suddenly rounded off with “and more”. Alexa couldn’t answer. Neither could answer. Home gave me the numbers, how much is in the jackpot and how many raffle winners there were. Alexa had nothing. After finding out what the correct command is by dipping into my enabled skills, Tube Status told me there’s a good service on the Jubilee line. Home had nothing. Home gave me directions from Moorgate, which is a five minute walk from Liverpool street, so…. kind of correct. Alexa’s Tube Planner skill also gave me the correct answer. Alexa gave me a list of films on this weekend, Home gave me nothing. Both struggled with this one. Alexa started reading out films on in London - again - and Home thought I was trying to cast something to my TV. A probability test that didn’t end well as neither understood the questions. The answers is: 0. Home gave me a list of possible alternatives in lemon juice and baking soda. Alexa couldn’t answer. Both answered, but Alexa’s answer was more detailed and came with examples. Both answered this easily, but Alexa also gave me business hours. Home gave an answer from a search result, Alexa had nothing. Alexa has had this functionality since day one. Home, however, still can’t set reminders. A long and detailed answer from Home that any gardening enthusiast would be satisfied with, Alexa didn’t know.

[+] portraits depicting them as iconic historical figures, a cheeky gift from employees at the company's 10th anniversary. (Photo by James Horan for Forbes)","Fresh off the red-eye from San Francisco, Mike Cannon-Brookes enters a rented office space in Midtown Manhattan to seal the biggest deal in his company's history. Dressed in a Detroit Tigers T-shirt and blue baseball cap, he greets the room in an undulating Australian twang. Seated around a conference table are executives from his collaboration-software firm, Atlassian, which is in the final push to acquire Trello, a smaller competitor whose founder, Michael Pryor, is also present. For four hours, Cannon-Brookes relentlessly sells the importance of achieving scale and the benefits of uniting their rival firms.Pryor is convinced. One month later, in January 2017, Atlassian will officially acquire Trello in a $425 million deal that will help send company shares up 47% in four months and add $820 million to the fortunes of Cannon-Brookes and his cofounder, Scott Farquhar. The 37-year-old Aussies, who dress more like off-duty surfers than top-flight executives, are worth $2.6 billion each.That ascent has vastly outstripped the pair's humble objective when starting Atlassian in 2002: dodging a lifetime of corporate IT drudgery. ""Our aspirations were literally just to not get a real job,"" Farquhar admits, ""and to not have to wear a suit."" Those aims thoroughly satisfied, they have managed to reach a few extra milestones as well: a blockbuster IPO in 2015, annual revenues approaching $600 million and status as one of the most successful technology startups in Australian history.The founders, who serve as Atlassian's co-chief executives, freely acknowledge the improbability of their meteoric rise. ""I think we're completely under-skilled and under-experienced for the job that we're in,"" Cannon-Brookes deadpans. But despite the self-effacement, they have unquestionably built a highly disciplined business with a continually expanding global footprint. What began as Jira, a bug-tracking tool for software developers, has since morphed into over a dozen collaboration products used by many of the world's most prominent innovators, including NASA, Snapchat, Twilio and Spotify.In all, Atlassian has 85,000 customers who pay as little as a few dollars per person per month for access to its software. Confluence, its knowledge-sharing app for teams, is its most popular after Jira. Other products include Bitbucket, an online repository for storing code; Bamboo, a technical-workflow interface; and Hipchat, a messaging service that competes with Slack. Trello, the latest addition, is a project-management tool that helps Atlassian further appeal to individuals and smaller, less technical teams.In essence, Atlassian has taken on the unsexy mission of bridging organizational and communication gaps. If the back-end seems dry, the applications are anything but. When developing the software underpinning Tesla's electric car, Elon Musk turned to Atlassian. SpaceX is using its software to coordinate coding teams and rocket scientists, and NASA relied on it to help plan the Curiosity Rover 's mission to Mars. The customer list extends further: Airbnb, BMW, BlackRock, Sotheby's, Paypal, all eight Ivy League universities and 85% of the 100 largest companies in America.That success has come despite Farquhar and Cannon-Brookes' insistence on skirting industry norms. Atlassian has no sales staff, unheard of in the hypercompetitive world of enterprise software. And in an era when some tech leaders helm more than one multibillion-dollar venture (Jack Dorsey, Elon Musk), the cofounders are the conspicuous duo leading a single entity.Growth has come easily so far, but the pressure is on for Atlassian—which posted just a $4.4 million profit last year—to prove it deserves its $8 billion market cap. And as it ventures further from its technical core competency, competitors are anything but idle. Smaller startups like Slack and Asana are nibbling away at market share, while industry giants like Microsoft pose a persistent threat from above.Cannon-Brookes (L) and Farquhar started Atlassian with the simple goal of avoiding ""real jobs."" Now... [+] roughly half of Australia's computer science majors apply to work at their company. (Photo by James Horan for Forbes)Farquhar and Cannon-Brookes, unified in their drive to fend off such dangers, began their lives on disparate trajectories. Cannon-Brookes, the son of an English investment banker, spent much of his youth jetting between Sydney and a ritzy British boarding school. He bought his first computer using airline miles and decided to pursue a career in technology on a whim after being accepted into a prestigious business and computer science scholarship program at the University of New South Wales.Farquhar, meanwhile, was raised in a home with far more modest means. His mother worked at Target and later McDonald's, his father at a service station, and he acquired his first computer—a barely functional Wang model—after his dad's business threw it away. He too landed at UNSW as part of the same scholarship cohort, one of a few dozen standout students offered an annual stipend of roughly $9,000.Despite their differences, the pair developed a fast affinity. ""He just seemed like a really good bloke,"" Cannon-Brookes recounts with signature nonchalance. Nevertheless, they spent most of their college years working on separate projects: Cannon-Brookes on a couple of mildly successful startups, and Farquhar, like many of his classmates, as an unhappy intern at a technology consulting firm.They finally teamed up during their last year as undergraduates after Cannon-Brookes sent an email to a handful of classmates seeking partners for a new startup. The company would provide third-party support for a Swedish software firm. Farquhar, eager to avoid another consulting stint, was the only person to sign on.After graduating, they huddled in their respective bedrooms, working to cultivate clients under the banner Atlassian—named for the Greek titan Atlas, who holds up the heavens. But the third-party-support model proved difficult to scale, so they test-drove a number of other projects: a mail-archiving tool, a knowledge-management product and Jira, designed to help coders track bugs.Jira was the first to gain traction, so they scrapped the other ideas and went all in. There was only one possible business model. ""Our software didn't do very much to start with, so we couldn't sell it for much money,"" Farquhar explains. ""If you aren't going to sell it for much money, you need to sell a lot of it. To sell a lot, it needs to be sold globally. And if you sell globally, it's got to sell itself online.""So Atlassian put Jira on the Web and largely let customers find it on their own. Among their first clients was American Airlines, which bought a thousand dollars' worth of software without ever speaking to the Atlassian team. ""American Airlines was the first company that just sent us some money and said, 'We want the software,' "" Cannon-Brookes says. ""That was a pretty big moment. Obviously, we've continued to see that model.""That low-cost approach gave the company a positive cash flow from the get-go, allowing Cannon-Brookes and Farquhar to make outsize investments in research and development and to pay early hires in cash rather than forfeit equity.Buoyed by organic growth, Atlassian took no outside capital until 2010, when Accel Partners invested $60 million at an estimated $400 million valuation. By the next funding round—a $150 million infusion led by T. Rowe Price in 2014—its valuation had soared to $3.3 billion, and its unassuming, shaggy-haired co-CEOs were billionaires. The following year, the company went public with a $4.4 billion market cap, and their fortunes swelled yet again.The founders downplay their riches, citing job creation as a more meaningful metric. But belying their low-maintenance public personas are some decidedly ten-figure trappings. Cannon-Brookes speculates in Bitcoin and invests in sci-fi passion projects like nano-satellites. In March, he sought to alleviate South Australia's power crisis with the help of Elon Musk, engaging in a round of high-profile Twitter diplomacy in a bid to import a 100 megawatt-hour Tesla battery farm (a plan that, for myriad reasons, has so far gone nowhere). For his part, Farquhar recently paid $52 million for a 154-year-old seven-bedroom New South Wales estate that features a harborside tennis court, reportedly Australia's priciest home purchase ever.With a lifetime of cash already stockpiled, the two are focused on making Atlassian an indispensable tool of enterprise that will catalyze many of the next generation's most profound innovations. The Trello acquisition, then, is simply phase one of a master plan. ""In ten years' time we'll still be very young and doing the job at 47,"" Cannon-Brookes says.  ""We think about the world in decades.""FINAL THOUGHT""If you create a piece of software that's essentially free to reproduce, you can keep getting paid over and over perpetually."" —Markus PerssonFollow Noah on Twitter @Noah_Kirsch"

has chosen a private solution. While individuals are using ...","Apr 28, 2017,10:07am EDT",Decentralized IOT Identity,"The popularity of technologies like the self-driving car and Amazon Echo are rising; it’s not hard to imagine a world where your coffee maker knows when to summon your morning Uber to work, and it arrives with groceries and laundry detergent, ordered directly by your refrigerator and washing machine, as they have recognized that they were low on supplies.This future will be powered by a set of inanimate objects connected through an emerging network known as the Internet of Things.  However, just as the security around the transfer of data between humans and companies is required to safeguard humans from identity theft, the same will be required for objects within the Internet of Things.Identity protection is an emerging area for the The Internet of Things. Millions of inexpensive consumer devices ship with a default username and password, but some of them end up in your house. Last winter a piece of software called Mirai herded hundreds of thousands of home routers and cameras into the most potent botnet ever, which then generated the first terabit scale distributed denial of service ever seen.What if there were a solution that permitted companies to reliably identify their customer’s devices without putting them in the position of holding customer data? What if there were a way to ensure IoT devices only accepted configuration from their legitimate owners? I talked to HYPR CEO George Avetisov about their biometrics and UniquID CEO Stefano Pepe about their device identity work to get a better feel for how blockchains will be used to solve these problems.HYPR LogoThe service HYPR provides is a framework for passwordless authentication via biometric encryption. They don’t develop biometric devices, the focus of their innovation is creating a distributed, secured system based on existing, tested technology.We've covered the concept of cryptographic fingerprints here previously. Any digital item can be subject to some sort of cryptographic hash, then the hash can be used to check the validity of a digital item without the validator needing to have a copy. As an example, your phone's fingerprint reader does something involving a scan and a company that has access to a hash of your fingerprint's digital representation can validate you, but they don’t have the ability to impersonate you.Digital fingerprints are just the start. HYPR supports all types of biometric data, from simple authentication algorithms for facial and voice recognition to more complex algorithms such as the way you type on a keyboard, the rhythm when you text on your phone, or how you walk on the street. Your home, your car, and your office all have access requirements and there is probably some degree of smarts already included. HYPR positions IoT vendors to include biometric authentication without a huge investment in expertise, money, or time to implementation.A big part of HYPR's innovation is complete distrust of the internet for transmitting biometric data itself, which never leaves the user's cell phone. A single phone might get cracked and the biometric data used, but there is no path to hitting millions of victims in a single event.Where does the use of a blockchain fit in all this? It will serve as a distributed, trustless store of biometrics validation data. There are several implications and not all are obvious.A blockchain based system is resistant to denial of service attacks that cripple centralized businesses.  Why?  Because instead of bringing down a single server farm hosting with the authentication data, a DOS attack would have to identify and bring down many blockchain nodes hosted by several parties within the same permissioned blockchain environment.Equally important to DOS protection is business process interoperability. Avetisov explains, “We are building use cases around associative forms of identity through the blockchain.  Right now you can not authenticate between two different corporate entities, such as a bank and a car insurance company, because there is not a shared identity between the two companies.  Each company has a different identity stack that is not interoperable.  By using a blockchain, you can have an interoperable ledger for identity between multiple entities without a complex infrastructure.  An insurance company can prove your identity to a bank or a credit card can prove your identity to a streaming service all through biometric data.”How does it all work?  While the exact mechanics have not been finalized, it would involve each company acting as a validator of the data within the network running nodes that are constantly accepting biometric data. When a company that is not running a node wants to authentic a user, they would look to the network and the nodes would provide data on the last time stamp that a particular user could have been identified with a particular device accepting biometric data.  If the user can prove they had a device that the network has agreed is associated with their identity within a recent timeframe, the user is then authenticated.The value here is that different companies can identify users based on their specialized identity stack and provide authentication to others without sharing any of their personal data.  Converting your customers to use biometrics is a complex, expensive project. But if 70% of your customers are already using a system from another company, and that system has been built with an eye on assisting third parties to make the jump to biometrics, the barrier to entry is dramatically lowered. Cost savings begin in quarters rather than years.What sort of benefits accrue if diverse businesses authenticate their users with the same biometrics system? Here's a scenario Avetisov offered that's a nightmare today, but which would have a happy ending in a biometrics enabled world. Children don't typically have identity information until their later teen years when they start driving, so there is a three to five year window where they are allowed to roam widely without a formal ID. If they're brought to a hospital injured and unresponsive there is a delay while they are identified, wasting some of that golden hour in treating shock and trauma. A biometric solution accelerates that process and a blockchain allows that medical institution to authenticate through the identifying information collected from other companies.These use cases could be implemented using Bitcoin's blockchain, but HYPR has chosen a private solution. While individuals are using biometrics to authenticate, they do so with large entities, and HYPR has focused on serving the needs of banks, health care, and insurance providers.  For these enterprises, regulation around data security is a great concern.  While a public blockchain with hashed or encrypted data provides high levels of data security, it is still unclear how managing data in such a way would fit within the current regulatory framework.  As such, private or permissioned blockchains are the fastest way to market without the need to educate regulators.While HYPR is focused on how to build an interoperable environment for humans to be authenticated via various IOT devices, UniquID is building technology that identifies the devices themselves while they are offline through a very clever use of blockchain technology and smart contracts.UniquID LogoPepe offered an interesting example of how an offline smart contract might work, “If you want to rent a Zipcar, what happens if neither your phone or the car cannot connect to internet.  You can’t unlock the car with your smart phone unless the owner of the car comes with the keys in his pocket, drives the car out, and brings the car to a place to download a certificate. This is the only way for the car to establish a secure connection with your phone.  However, with UniquID there is a very different scenario.  Both the car and the smartphone have a UniquID wallet on the blockchain. Zipcar creates a smart contract on the blockchain that unlocks the car for a specific smartphone when a token is received in the car’s wallet.  The smartphone downloads [all or a portion of] the blockchain with the smart contract already executed.  Then when you go to the car without internet, your smartphone uploads the missing blocks of the blockchain that the car does not have, with the executed smart contract, and the car unlocks for the person with the correct smartphone.”Through this innovative use of blockchain technology, devices do not have to be connected to the internet in order to communicate, identify and authenticate with each other in a secure way.  This is an important mechanic for devices to be able to capture real-time data and communicate with one another in real time.  Unlike HYPR, which can be built on either a permissioned or public blockchain, this use case relies on the security provided through the proof of work mechanism of a public blockchain.  A private blockchain environment, particularly a small one, may have vulnerabilities that a motivated attacker could exercise, modifying data in ways an offline node could not detect. A public blockchain’s security mechanism, proof of work consensus, costs the same amount to fraud, whether online or offline. Global bitcoin mining capacity is 3.75 million terrahashes per second. Translating that to something you can visualize, an AntMiner T9 will do 12.5 terrahashes per second, costs $1,140, weighs twelve pounds, and consumes 1576 watts. You’d need 300,000 of those to match current global Bitcoin capacity and theoretical attacks could be done with 10% of the total - a hundred and twelve tons of gear consuming 37 megawatts of power costing $34 million.If you’ve got a $20,000 vehicle but it would take the purchase price of a 220’ yacht to steal it, such attacks are going to remain at the proof of concept stage. However, it is important to note that a downside to the current layout of this plan may require a device to download an entire blockchain, which would be cumbersome for a small IOT device.UniquID has very ambitious plans on how to improve device identity and communication through a new type of secure network that will act as alternatives to SIM networks and certificate authorities that I call decentralized certificate authorities.  Unfortunately, UniquID has not yet released a white paper describing their service, so we’ll save that for another article.You can see how these technologies will be required for a future with an Uber ordering coffee maker, a grocery ordering refrigerator, or laundry room that makes sure you’re always ready to do the next load. Humans will be identified by biometrics, devices by unique attributes like MAC addresses, likely in combination with the unique attributes of the human that first uses them, imprinting to their new owners the way some newborn animals do with their mothers.  When a service needs to leave a message for a device that isn’t always on, if it’s small it’ll be placed directly on a blockchain, while larger data, say a software update, will be left as a URL on the blockchain and a cryptographic fingerprint of the file.We’ve had robotics on factory floors for two generations, lines of carefully laid out systems assembling goods. That sort of automation is going to spread from within a single organization to across multiple enterprises, reaching out to consumers, and eventually imbuing the entire supply chain with situational awareness, speeding deliveries and reducing the need for human interactions. "

Turns out, in today's topsy-turvy world, it is.","When the NSA cyber weapon-powered WannaCry ransomware spread across the world this past weekend, it infected as many as 200,000 Windows systems, including those at 48 hospital trusts in the U.K. and so-far unnamed medical facilities in the U.S. too. It wasn't just administrative PCs that were hacked, though. Medical devices themselves were affected too, Forbes has learned.A source in the healthcare industry passed Forbes an image of an infected Bayer Medrad device in a U.S. hospital. The source did not say which specific hospital was affected, nor could they confirm what Bayer model was hacked. But it appears to be radiology equipment designed to help improve imaging. More specifically, it's a device used for monitoring what's known in the industry as a ""power injector,"" which helps deliver a ""contrast agent"" to a patient. Such agents consist of chemicals that improve the quality of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.A Bayer MedRad device used to assist in MRI scans infected with the WannaCry ransomware.A Bayer spokesperson confirmed it had received two reports from customers in the U.S. with devices hit by the ransomware, but would not say which specific products were affected. ""Operations at both sites were restored within 24 hours,"" the spokesperson added. ""If a hospital's network is compromised, this may affect Bayer's Windows-based devices connected to that network.""Bayer said it would be sending out a Microsoft patch for its Windows-based devices ""soon."" The firm recommended hospitals work with their IT security teams and contact Bayer's Technical Assistance Center ""to ensure continued support of contrast-enhanced radiology procedures which use Bayer power injectors.""As noted by Beau Woods, deputy director of Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council, ransomware infecting such a device shouldn't necessarily threaten patient safety directly, other than stopping scanning machines working. ""I seriously doubt Windows is controlling any of the safety functions,"" he said.But on Twitter, Woods explained the real impact of such attacks: ""Medical device outages increase resource needs, delay care, trigger more clinical mistakes. The harm can go unseen unless you look for it."" Multiple U.K. hospitals reported that their radiology departments were completely knocked out by the ransomware outbreak.North Korea + NSA exploits = infected hospitals?Whatever the impact on patient health, the Bayer infections represent the first known instance of ransomware directly affecting the operation of a medical device. They've also provided the first evidence that the WannaCry outbreak hit U.S. healthcare bodies, showing that America's own powerful intelligence tools have been turned against some of its most sensitive institutions. Not to mention that clues indicate possible North Korean involvement in the attacks.Cybersecurity firms are developing increasing levels of confidence of North Korean involvement. The WannaCry hackers used tools first leaked by a shady crew called the Shadow Brokers, combining them with code linked to North Korean cyber operations. BAE Systems, a government arms contractor and cyber specialist, said it had found ""multiple overlaps"" between the WannaCryp malware and that controlled by the Lazarus Group, which the firm associated with North Korean activity.The similarities included common source code that was previously unique to Lazarus, use of the same code compiler, unusual ""leetspeak"" (a kind of internet language popular amongst certain hacker communities), and both focused on Bitcoin, ""presumably for stealing funds and money-laundering,"" said Adrian Nish, BAE's head of threat intelligence.Healthcare tech industry on alertMeanwhile, in the last 24 hours, some of the world's biggest healthcare tech companies have rushed out warnings about WannaCry and its impact on their products. Much the same as Bayer, they're still developing adequate patches to protect systems from another similar attack.The Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST), a privately held company that provides a cyber threat exchange platform for the healthcare industry, said it had reports of both Bayer and Siemens equipment being affected by the outbreak.Siemens told Forbes it couldn't confirm or deny reports its Healthineers technologies had been affected. But it publicly stated has been working with the U.K. National Health Service (NHS) to help get systems back online, with engineers deployed across the country to assist.""Select Siemens Healthineers products may be affected by the Microsoft vulnerability being exploited by the WannaCry ransomware,"" the firm wrote in an advisory. The firm is developing patches or remediation solutions for systems running the vulnerable version of Microsoft's SMB v1, a component in Windows which was originally exploited by an NSA hacking tool known as EternalBlue before the WannaCry perpetrators abused it. It released multiple warnings for different healthcare products, warning they could be susceptible to attacks.Another major healthcare tech firm - Becton, Dickinson and Company - put out its own warning: ""At this time, we are actively monitoring the situation and working closely with customers to ensure the appropriate measures are taken to help safeguard our products.""Woods said it was likely a wide range of medical systems were taken down by WannaCry. ""Many of the bigger machines run the Windows operating system - X-ray, cat scan, MRI,"" he said. But, importantly, the parts that actually control the heavy gear that generate the scans aren't normally controlled by Windows PCs. Many of the pharmacy systems that dispense drugs also run potentially-vulnerable Windows systems, Woods added.Numerous NHS hospitals are continuing to operate a limited service as of Wednesday. Barts Health Trust, the biggest such trust in the U.K., said it was having to cancel some operations and turn some patients away from the five hospitals it was managing, though some systems were coming back online.Industrial control systems hit tooAs for other critical IT infected during the WannaCry pandemic, the U.S.-government funded Industrial Control System Computer Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) reported late Tuesday that alongside the healthcare providers, companies including ABB, Rockwell Automation and Schneider Electric had put out their own WannaCry advisories to assist customers.Robert M. Lee, CEO and founder of the industrial cybersecurity firm Dragos, said his team were ""aware of infections that occurred in the industrial control system community and had impact."" Victims included small utilities and manufacturing sites in the U.S., he added, also pointing to previously-reported infections at Nissan and Renault car manufacturing plants, as well as the attack on Russian Railways. ""Although no one's been hurt and no safety was at risk.""Ralph Langner, founder of German control system security consultancy Langner, said that in a typical industrial environment there were ""lots of Windows boxes of which a majority is not up to patch."" Attacks on those Windows boxes shouldn't halt production, however, because industrial machines work autonomously, he added.But WannaCry has provided ample evidence of vulnerable critical infrastructure. And that's why Langner's outlook for the future if grim: ""For a competent attacker it would be possible to use the encryption vector specifically against industrial targets and force a production halt. We haven't seen that on a large scale yet but I predict it's coming, with ransom demands in the six and seven digits."""

Bitcoin, ...","Apr 18, 2017,09:55am EDT",What is a legal tender law?,"Over the years, there has been some discussion about “legal tender laws” in the United States. I talked to a legal expert about it, and discovered – as I suspected – that it doesn’t mean quite the same thing as many people think it does. Here is my (non-expert) explanation.The present legal tender law in the U.S. is Section 5103 of title 31, United States Code, which reads:United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues. Foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts.Contrary to popular imagination, this does not ban people from using other forms of currency. It simply defines what a “dollar” is, in a contract or obligation that is denominated in dollars. You could make a contract denominated in Bitcoin, if you want to. You could make a contract denominated in euros. You could even make a contract defined in “gold dollars”, or something of that sort. But, if the contract is simply for “dollars,” then this statute defines, for legal purposes, whether you have made payment in an appropriate medium of transaction.One effect of the legal tender law is that it allows debts and obligations to be discharged in a cheaper form of “dollars” than coins made of gold and silver. Thus, it in effect enables floating fiat Federal Reserve notes and deposits to be used in payment of “dollar” debts. If a “dollar” was exclusively defined as a gold coin of a specific weight, then floating fiat Federal Reserve notes would be useless, just bits of colored paper. They could not be used in payment, any more than the “dollars” which are included in the board game Monopoly.It is doubtless true that the U.S. government suppresses and blocks use of alternative currencies – especially those based on gold – through various means. This could be through regulatory burdens, taxes, and many other forms of harassment. They have to do it this way, because it is not actually illegal to transact business in whatever form of “money” the parties to the transaction agree upon.Beginning in 1998, a private businessman, Bernard von NotHaus, began to issue a warehouse receipt currency called “Liberty dollars” based on gold and silver. In 2007, the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided the vaults of the Liberty dollar, and confiscated $7 million of gold and silver bullion. The seizure warrant was for money laundering, mail fraud, wire fraud, counterfeiting, and conspiracy.Note that none of these charges have anything to do with “legal tender,” or any restrictions on people to transact in the currency of their choice.In 2009, von NotHaus was arrested and charged with: one count of conspiracy to possess and sell coins in resemblance and similitude of coins of a denomination higher than five cents, and silver coins in resemblance of genuine coins of the United States in denominations of five dollars and greater, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 485, 18 U.S.C. § 486, and 18 U.S.C. § 371; one count of mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1341 and 18 U.S.C. § 2; one count of selling, and possessing with intent to defraud, coins of resemblance and similitude of United States coins in denominations of five cents and higher, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 485 and 18 U.S.C. § 2; and one count of uttering, passing, and attempting to utter and pass, silver coins in resemblance of genuine U.S. coins in denominations of five dollars or greater, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 486 and 18 U.S.C. § 2.Prosecutors actually argued in court that the 90% silver Liberty dollar coins were a counterfeit of the common twenty-five cent piece. The Associated Press reported: ""Federal prosecutors successfully argued that von NotHaus was, in fact, trying to pass off the silver coins as U.S. currency. Coming in denominations of 5, 10, 20, and 50, the Liberty Dollars also featured a dollar sign, the word ‘dollar’ and the motto ‘Trust in God,’ similar to the ‘In God We Trust’ that appears on U.S. coins."" A jury actually found him guilty of the charges, which suggests the degree of influence brought to bear upon the legal system to get the outcome that the prosecutors desired.Obviously, we have a de facto prohibition on any gold- or silver-based currency that poses a significant challenge to the dominance of the floating fiat Federal Reserve “dollar.” The government seems to be terrified even of rinky-dink operations like the Liberty dollar. Just as obviously, there is no actual legal prohibition on such, or there would be no need to resort to laughable “counterfeiting” arguments. (You might also conclude that Bitcoin is not considered a great enough challenge to bother with.)"

It’s a pretty smart move since it sets up the potential future for the mass adoption of this new type of currency.","ShutterstockAlthough the game already has in-game currencies that mimic cryptocurrency, this is the first of its kind where the players can take their money from the game and then use it in the real world for other things. There still will be the need for these players to convert their money through a bitcoin exchange, which must verify identity and approve transactions, but this is the first of its kind to be available to those under 18.Other companies have also branded their own cryptocurrency as a move to set themselves apart from the competition, also believing in the ability of the digital currency to change transactions forever. To date, these branded digital currencies have yet to really catch on, but there is a lot to be said for this strategy, seeing that major companies like Microsoft and those behind ""Minecraft"" are aggressively working toward greater acceptance.Since it is too late to be the first mover in creating your own cryptocurrency, you can still jump on this opportunity as a business owner by creating a niche digital currency that offers features that are attractive to your audience or that illustrates the benefits of using it.Benefits And Best Practice Of Becoming Your Own Digital CurrencyWhile some refer to it as vanity money creation, it’s an idea that has marketing value -- plus, it offers a way to reach an audience that may be looking for a new way to pay for goods or services. You’ll be able to offer significant benefits, including helping users avoid the risk of fraud, enjoying complete anonymity to purchase what they want and not having to worry their currency will be taken away by any government institution.It’s also something that sets you apart from your competition and intrigues your target audience, which may be slowly catching on to the idea of digital currency. For example, as a CTO for an online payments platform, the development of our own digital currency can be of benefit to our small business customer base and set us apart from other payment processors. Plus, we’ll have control over the payment process because we will have built the actual currency in use and know everything about it rather than relying on any third-party provider.However, before you jump right in, there is a certain skill level that is necessary to create your own cryptocurrency brand. You’ll definitely need some technical expertise on your team in the form of a developer that has some working knowledge of how digital currency works and the blockchain technology behind it. Although the code is open source with cryptocurrency, it’s not as simple as writing a few lines of code. More thought and technical know-how are needed to develop your best practices approach to branding a digital currency.Here are some recommendations:With more stability coming to the overall cryptocurrency environment and larger brands coming on board with offering and accepting digital currency as part of the global transaction environment, the option of branding your own digital coin is an exciting opportunity to stand out and serve your target audience with new options that help them become a part of this digital age."

Venture",https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogeraitken/2017/05/02/dubai-trading-platform-onegram-in-500m-gold-backed-crypto-venture-sharia-compliant/,"... Al Maali Consulting Group and an Islamic financial adviser, Adam 
Richard, CEO of Volt Markets, and founder of the Houston Bitcoin Meetup.","May 2, 2017,12:34pm EDT","Islamic financial services and technology company OneGram is partnering with GoldGuard, a Dubai-based online gold trading platform, that is building one of world’s largest gold vaults inside the Dubai Airport Free Zone, to create the first completely “gold-backed digital currency” globally. Each token represents a gram of gold and redeemable.","With Sharia scholars on OneGram’s board it ensures that the company is fully compliant with Islamic finance requirements. Advisers listed include amongst others Sheikh Abdulkader Amor, CEO of Al Maali Consulting Group and an Islamic financial adviser, Adam Richard, CEO of Volt Markets, and founder of the Houston Bitcoin Meetup.Currently the Islamic finance sector is responsible for managing around 1% of global GDP and growing at nearly 20% per year.With there being an estimated 1.8 billion (bn) Muslims worldwide according to a study in 2015 - equating to around a quarter of the global population of c.7.5bn today - OneGram is seen as a “Sharia-compliant method” for them to keep gold in a digital format that is both secure and digitally transferable, including across borders.And, given that the number of Muslims in the world is expected to grow to 2.2bn by 2030, the new joint venture between OneGram and GoldGuard was being outlined today at The Ritz-Carlton, Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), in terms of its impact on “opening the doors for cryptocurrency trading to the Islamic world.”Gold bars beside blocks of euro banknotes. (Image credit: Shutterstock).Crowdsale CampaignA maximum total of 12,400,786 OneGramCoin tokens (OGC) will be sold in OneGram’s upcoming initial coin offering (ICO) on May 21, with accounts able to be opened next week on May 8 when the gold can be purchased. At the current gold spot price, a sold out crowdsale would raise over $554 million (m), which would make it the largest cryptocurrency crowdsale goal in history.Ibrahim Mohammed, the CEO of OneGram, commenting from Dubai said: “In recent years, the Middle East has seen incredible growth in fintech innovations including digital tokens and smart contracts.”He added: “With OneGram we are providing an opportunity for investors who care about Islamic financial markets and the security of commodity-backed investments to benefit from rapid technological advances in the blockchain industry.”Islamic Markets & CryptocurrencyExisting cryptocurrencies it should be noted have not been designed with Islamic markets in mind. Despite Muslims making up around 25% of the global population today, many Muslims simply cannot use cryptocurrencies due to their restricted legal status and high barriers to entry in many countries in the Islamic world.According to OneGram it aims to solve these issues by using blockchain technology to create a “new kind of cryptocurrency”, where each coin is backed by one gram of gold at launch. In terms of the joint venture, the  team at OneGram team will manage the OGC protocol while GoldGuard will run the vault for physical gold.Each transaction of OGC generates a small transaction fee, which is reinvested in more gold (net of administration costs), and thereby increases the amount of gold that backs each OneGram. Therefore, according to the pitch each OGC increases in real value over time, and is touted as “making OneGram unique among cryptocurrencies.”Gold Investments & Sharia LawHistorically gold investing has been problematic under Sharia law. While there is currently limited guidance for gold coins and bars, there is virtually no guidance on gold elsewhere in the financial sector.In most cases trading gold futures contracts is forbidden by Islamic law as gold futures contracts are not backed by physical gold and one can end up paying or receiving interest on your trading account. The upshot is that most people who wanted to buy gold as an investment have purchased gold in its physical form through for example coins or jewellery.New StandardThings are changing though. Back in December 2016, the Sharia Gold Standard, which OneGram complies with, was introduced by the Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI), the World Gold Council and Amanie Advisors.As a result of this new standard, Muslim investors will now be able to take advantage of an increasing range of gold-backed investment opportunities, which hitherto had been non-compliant.OneGram's ICOThe OneGram ICO will take place on the GoldGuard gold exchange, which trades and regulates precious metals, and is licensed by the Dubai Airport Free Zone (DAFZ) in the United Emirates (UAE), and one of the fast growing Free Zones in the region.The DAFZ is the governing body, which administers trade licenses and visas to international companies wanting to do business from Dubai within the freezone.In order for investors to participate in the ICO, the initial step is to register with GoldGuard and purchase gold at live spot rates. Then the gold can be redeemed for OGC for a 10% premium.This premium is expected as by purchasing OGC, the investor is not only purchasing an asset that offers the spot value of gold but also the future value of additional gold to be purchased from transaction fees.The ICO in OGC tokens will end when all coins are sold or after a maximum period of 120 days. If all the tokens do not sell out, there will be a new total supply of OGC equal to the amount of OGC sold in the ICO. It understood that subsequent to that no more coins will ever be issued.At any given moment, an investor in these tokens is able to see the amount of gold backing their coin in the official OneGram wallet app and through the GoldGuard website. Your coins for gold or equivalent fiat currency can be redeemed through GoldGuard’s platform.Following the ICO, OneGram Coins can be bought and sold through any cryptocurrency exchange that lists OGC.The RoadmapAccording to OneGram’s roadmap, next month on June 30 the test network for OGC transactions is slated for launch. Following that in early July the intention is to launch multiple implementations of OneGramCoin block explorers, being described “with complete REST and websocket API’s, allowing our users insight into transactions propagated on the blockchain.”On August 7, the main network for OGC transactions is set to be launched, before OGCs will be distributed to investors in the ICO and listed on popular crypto exchanges on August 15.Ibrahim Mohammed, CEO, OneGram, along with GoldGuard and leading Islamic finance scholars including Sheikh Abdulkader Amor were speaking today at a press conference hosted at The Ritz-Carlton, DIFC, to highlight the joint venture."

[+] Bitcoin payment before time runs out.,"In less than 24 hours, the WannaCry ransomware borrowed from leaked NSA exploits to spread across at least 75,000 PCs. But, for now, the ransomware outbreak has been curtailed.That's because a U.K.-based researcher going by the name of MalwareTech shut the operation down, albeit by a stroke of good fortune. As he researched the spread of WannaCry, which hit 48 NHS hospitals across Britain particularly hard, the 22-year-old saw that one of the web domains used by the attackers hadn't been registered. So he registered the site, took control of the domain for $10.69 and started seeing connections from infected victims, hence his ability to track the ransomware's spread.But in doing that he also took down the WannaCry operation without meaning to. Whoever was behind the ransomware included a feature designed to detect security tools that would fake internet access for quarantined PCs by using a single IP address to respond to any request the computer made. This is a feature of a ""sandbox,"" where security tools test code in a contained environment on a PC. When MalwareTech registered his domain to track the botnet, the same IP address was pinged back to all infected PCs, not just sandboxed ones. ""So the malware thought it was in a sandbox and killed itself. Lol,"" MalwareTech said. ""It was meant as an anti-sandbox measure that they didn't quite think through.""I will confess that I was unaware registering the domain would stop the malware until after i registered it, so initially it was accidental.— MalwareTech (@MalwareTechBlog) May 13, 2017Security companies including Cisco's Talos division confirmed WannaCry had stopped spreading thanks to MalwareTech's work. Talos also confirmed the malware's use of exploits leaked by a crew called the Shadow Brokers, who're widely believed to have dumped hacker tools belonging to the NSA. The company, in a blog post, said WannaCry (also known as WannaCrypt) would attempt to install via a backdoor leaked by the Shadow Brokers called DoublePulsar. If the backdoor wasn't resident on a target Windows PC, it would then attempt to abuse a flaw in the Microsoft operating system's Server Message Block (SMB), a network file sharing protocol. ""This is the cause of the worm-like activity that has been widely observed across the internet.""The attackers remain unknown. Looking at the attackers' Bitcoin wallets - the addresses of which were hardcoded into the malware - they've made as much as $17,500 and rising in the form of 10.4 Bitcoin from 52 transactions, with payments continuing to trickle in today. But victims have been advised not to pay the $300 ransom requested by the hackers, who've threatened to wipe PCs of those who don't cough up in a given timeframe.WannaCry will return -- so patchFor those already infected, it's a little too late for MalwareTech's efforts to save them. As with multiple NHS organizations, many will have to rely on whatever contingency plans and backups they have in place.And while MalwareTech confirmed the malware was still out of action Saturday, he warned the attackers will likely alter their code to remove the somewhat bizarre error and restart their ransomware campaign imminently. ""This sample may have been stopped, but I'm 100 per cent sure they will learn from the mistake and try again monday. people need to be prepared,"" he added.""They might start a new campaign today.""The advice, then, is to patch all Windows PCs with the latest update, as it prevents attacks using the NSA's exploits following a Microsoft update in mid-March. In the meantime, Microsoft and anti-virus companies have added detections for WannaCry, so users should update those systems too.The tech giant has also issued an advisory for concerned users, in which it confirmed it's releasing a patch for the out-of-support Windows XP.  It's also recommending businesses disable the SMBv1 protocol, while ensuring the SMB protocol cannot be directly accessed from the internet will go some way to preventing this worm from causing havoc again."

Products and capabilities beyond the wildest dreams of innovators just a decade ago are now commonplace realities -- and the rate at which technology develops only seems to be getting exponentially faster.,"(Martin Leissl/Bloomberg)Tech advancements have significantly influenced the business and consumer spheres over the last several years, from 3-D printers to self-driving cars. Ten members of the Forbes Technology Council each shared what they believe to be the most impressive piece of technology from the past five years.1.Self-Driving VehiclesI've been a car enthusiast for most of my life, and the past several years have been an exciting time for the intersection of technology and personal transportation. Having personally experienced a self-driving Tesla along with the accident avoidance features in my own car, I would be remiss not to appreciate the minor and major artificial intelligence accomplishments in the car industry. - Tim Maliyil, AlertBoot2.Voice Interface TechnologyVoice recognition is changing user experience and how we operate our daily lives. For example, I use Google Home every waking hour. That is what the power of a new and drastic shift in user interface and user experience can do to help users complete the simplest tasks. -Tyler Shields, Signal Sciences3. BlockchainBlockchain is the technology underlying Bitcoin. Since Bitcoin's launch in 2009, no one has been able to counterfeit it. This shows the robustness of Blockchain technology. Blockchain provides a network that enables various stakeholders to transact with trust, security and anonymity. It provides a single source of truth. -Ravi Chamria, Biz2Credit 4. 3-D PrintersI've been most impressed by the rise of consumer 3-D printers. We have gone from complex, costly, single-purpose industrial devices to inexpensive, general-purpose desktop machines that anyone can use. Being able to design and fabricate parts in your own home/shop is liberating and has spawned a resurgence in the DIY movement, encouraging young tech hopefuls to pursue a career in STEM. -Chris Kirby, Voices.com 5. Microservice ArchitecturesMicroservice architectures, based on container technology, have dramatically changed the app lifecycle. Rather than taking months or years to build monolithic apps, developers can now rapidly build them using containers to create manageable microservices and deploy them across private and public clouds. This significantly improves the pace of app rollouts and supporting infrastructure options. - Ranga Rajagopalan, Avi Networks6. Infrastructure-As-A-Service (IaaS) It's astounding to consider the breadth, depth, low cost and accessibility of infrastructure-as-a-service tools. Infrastructure expertise and scalability have become commodities, not differentiators, thus fostering competition and the creation of better products and services. - Aaron Rankin, Sprout Social7. Big Data ToolsSome impressive technologies are the NoSQL databases and the MapReduce model, both widely used in big data. NoSQL solves the problem of storing gigantic amounts of data. MapReduce provides an algorithm for its efficient analysis. Big companies use these pieces of technology to store and analyze huge data and use it for precise user targeting, machine learning, optical recognition and more. - Ivailo Nikolov, SiteGround 8. Artificial Intelligence From facilitating semantic data extraction in legacy digital assets to aiding the customer experience with more tailored information, artificial intelligence is the single biggest revolution in technology over the past five years. We've sat on enormous stockpiles of data for the past several years. AI will drive how we consume, learn and execute on this data. - Peter Shankar, Mission Capital9. Machine Learning Although machine learning has been around for many years, it's only been over the last five years that it has become available and democratized to all. ML is completely changing the way we process and understand data, from self-driving cars to recommendation systems to intelligent diagnosing tools and advisors to natural language processing. - Paulo Marques, Feedzai 10. RFID Tags I am a big believer in RFID (radio frequency identification) tags that store information and transfer it to a nearby reader through radio-frequency electromagnetic fields. There are multiple applications for this in virtually every industry, from offshore drilling to retail. - Jeff Bell, LegalShield"

unlike ...","Apr 4, 2017,12:28pm EDT",Image via Shutterstock,"News flashes and sound bites are constantly calling our attention to the latest hacks or threats to our cybersecurity that seem to be filling our social media news feeds and television reporting circuits. While there are plenty of bad actors out there hell bent on doing us harm, symbiotically living in the digital ethers and layers that make up the vast web, there are companies and organizations working in the background to protect and remediate any potential disasters.Some of these online threats pose significant harm to our lives, our businesses and our finances. Some of them are easy to detect, while others have become increasingly challenging and more sophisticated over the years. They sometimes involve massive bot-nets of millions of devices all acting in concert with one another, and sometimes they're far more individualistic in nature, with specific high-value targets that involve social engineering and location tracking to ensure that their cryptic intentions are fulfilled.If you've ever been the victim of a phishing scam online or you've ever had someone hijack your profile or social engineer you or your employees to gain access to critical corporate information and infrastructure, or to steal any amount of money from you through methods such as Instagram money-flipping, then you know just how painful this process is. Oftentimes, we search for ways to exact our revenge, usually falling flat on its face due to the anonymity of the World Wide Web.So, how do you go about protecting yourself from these online threats and cyber criminals who are determined to extra money and valuable information from you?Clearly, there is no full-proof method to protect yourself. As technology evolves, so do our methods for combating these online threats. However, that doesn't mean that the threats stop. They also evolve. They get smarter, more efficient and more scalable as the near-limitless reach of the web gives them unfettered access to potential billions of dollars in crimes against unassuming individuals and businesses from across the planet.What Are The Top Online Threats In Cyberspace? While there are numerous threats that exist at every turn on the internet, there are 10 very significant threats that pose malicious harm to us. Understanding what these threats are that exist on the web and learning how to combat them is integral to conducting any semblance of business or personal activity these days. Falling for these is painful to say the least, but even more so when you didn't even see it coming from miles away.One of the biggest and most challenging uphill battles here when it comes to online threats to our security is actually determining whether or not a visitor is human. Bots that crawl the web, or that are designed to somehow infiltrate systems and drop malware generally don't behave like humans. However, this isn't always something that's straightforward. How companies go about detecting automated software and threats in cyberspace has a lot to do with their potential to fall victim to these scams.Not only is it important to institute a good set of habits when it comes to dealing with online threats like this, but it's also important to stay in-the-know. The more informed you are, the better off you and your employees will be. It's important to note that whatever you do, threats are always evolving. Locate reputable companies that you can work with to help alleviate some of the stress that failure might cause in this arena.#1 -- RansomwareOne of the biggest ongoing concerns and threats to our digital existences has been the proliferation and exponential rise of ransomware. You know, the type of thing that locks you out of your computer with an impending countdown that signals the digital death of your entire virtual existence. As it counts down, threatening to encrypt every last shred of data, you realize the peril that digital criminals can inflict on their unassuming victims.Your choices? According to Tod Beardsley, Director of Research at Rapid7, a firm dedicated to thwarting these types of attacks through some of their wildly-popular software platforms such as Nexpose and Metasploit, you should never pay the criminals because you don't know the outcome of whether your information will in fact be restored, or simply vanish into thin air.Redundant backups should be a priority for you. Backup to an external drive somewhere on your network and to the cloud through DropBox or another provider. Rapid7, which oftentimes stress tests other corporations by hacking in an effort to expose security loopholes, working to ensure that networks are safe from potential attacks, knows a thing or two about this. Companies rely on their teams to ensure that they're protected, and they're often the first phone call many make when an attack like this and others do actually happen.#2 -- Phishing schemesA large majority of people get caught up in phishing schemes. Phishing schemes are engineered to get you to click on things and oftentimes they seem harmless. Simply click on a link and it will go to some URL. That's it. However, as harmless as they seem, phishing schemes can lead to to a number of major online security breaches if you're not careful. By paying close attention to what you're clicking on, you'll better be able to mitigate these types of attacks.Once you're ensnared in this type of scheme, it's hard to untangle yourself. There are phishing schemes for bank accounts, email accounts, big e-tailers and other service providers that have massive footprints. The goal? Gain access to the consumer's account to do the most damage. If you think you were the victim of a phishing scheme, and you entered in your username and password somewhere online and things didn't seem right, immediately change all your passwords.Another important thing to note is that most people use the same (weak) password across a variety of services such as Gmail, Facebook and online banking as one example. Never do that. Always use different passwords and ensure that they're not simple passwords to begin with. If a cybercriminal gains access to one service, you don't want them gaining access to the others. You should also be changing up your passwords every few months or so.#3 -- Man-in-the-middle (MIIM) attacksOne of the most sophisticated threats that exist online are man-in-the-middle attacks. I've seen these threats firsthand and know just how malicious they can be. Everything seems okay all the way to the final point of entry (even when using 2-factor authentication). This malware sits on your computer and waits until you've entered in all your credentials, then it actually swaps out the server that receives the communication and even communicates back to you.Throughout all of this, everything seems fine. Nothing seems amiss. That's why it's such a sophisticated online threat. You almost don't know that anything is happening when it actually is happening. You have to be very wary of what you download to your computer and what reputable sources they're coming from. Virus software is not going to help you in most cases here because these threats are always evolving.Oftentimes, MIIM attacks are a result of phishing schemes that installed latent software on your computer that sits dormant for some time until you begin accessing the proper network or until its recorded the right keystrokes. It then substitutes its own intercepted server right when you submit your credentials to login.#4 -- Ad fraudOnline ad fraud is far more widespread than anyone could possibly imagine. This is likely one of the biggest cyber-threats that seems to go under the proverbial radar. Few people know that they've been scammed by sophisticated ad fraud systems after it's occurred. Publishers simply see views increasing and most ad platforms don't provide high specifics as far as direct views on every single ad impression or click, leaving most people in the dark.In a recent conversation with Tamer Hassan, CTO of WhiteOps, a firm deeply entrenched in the fight against automated ad fraud, they've taken this fight to a new level by developing a platform that actively measures 500 to 2000 technical metrics to determine whether the person viewing the ad is in fact a human or a robot. This software analyzes several layers at a time and its the leading platform amidst the largest publishers in the world.This impressive system developed by Hassan and team runs silently in the background, with no impact on the speed or latency of ad serving or delivery. In fact, most publishers are now building White Ops' software into their contracts, stating that violations in ad clicks and views from bots will result in non-payment of revenues. This human verification on the web is potentially one of the most lucrative types of fraud that so many cybercriminals are working to exploit and companies are working to protect against.#5 -- Social media schemes Instagram (IG) money-flipping schemes and many others social media scams have surfaced in recent years. Considering that IG is one of the most popular social media platforms in the world, it's no wonder that unscrupulous cybercriminals are targeting individuals who are in desperate situations, looking to make a few hundred or a few thousand dollars quickly. These IG money-flipping schemes have become so widespread that the company can only take down 1 money-flipping scam for ever 3 that are being created.In a recent conversation with Evan Blair, co-founder of ZeroFox, a firm specializing in social media security, he tells me that 70% of companies are using social media for business but that a large majority of those companies are uninformed about potential impersonations of customer service representatives or duplication of accounts and impersonation of profiles, until it's too late. In fact, there's little that many of the most popular platforms like IG can do to safeguard against the windfall of social engineering and phishing that is constantly occurring against companies at any given moment.However, this isn't just a risk to digital security; cybercriminals are now using IG and other social media sites to physically track and harm well-to-do executives, celebrities and other high-profilers such as athletes and even politicians. Without a good system to thwart such attacks, most businesses and individuals are completely left lost in the dark. That's likely why so many of the world's leading companies and affluent individuals rely on ZeroFox's groundbreaking platform to thwart and mitigate such attacks. #6 -- Bitcoin scamsBitcoin scams have been on the rise recently, especially since the cryptocurrency leaves little in the way of traceable information and unlike with the banking sector, the transactions are irreversible. For those particular reasons alone, cybercriminals have been flocking to the Bitcoin platform. In fact, a large part of their criminal activity is dealt with in Bitcoins for a great majority of their malware attacks that include ransomware and other hacking initiatives.Considering that Bitcoin valuations have been fluctuating and that there is little in the way of current regulations in the marketplace, this will only continue to get worse. Be very wary of paying for things in Bitcoin and in clicking on any URLs that look deceiving. Read the URLs thoroughly enough to ensure that it's not a variation of a popular domain name, something that hackers and cybercriminals tend to do often.If you feel like you've been the victim of a Bitcoin scam, it's best to contact the FBI or your local law enforcement agency. Bitcoin does have built-in protections such as wallet backups and multi-signatures, but that doesn't mean that scams don't happen. Cybercriminals are getting more sophisticated by the day so be careful and avoid anything that looks suspicious.#7 -- Social engineeringSocial engineering isn't a new threat. In fact, criminals have been using social engineering hacks in person for ages now. However, when it comes to fraud and other crimes occurring online, this threat is certainly on the rise. With the layer of anonymity that the internet affords, it's no wonder that social engineering works so well in this medium. Most aren't that careful about who they interact with or what type of information that they give out or expose online.It's not inherently difficult for a criminal to Google the web to find information about a person in an effort to social engineer a scam against them. They can discover their occupation on LinkedIn, their family members or children on Facebook, where they are through Instagram or what they're talking about on Twitter. They can then work to infiltrate those profiles and take over a person's entire social media presence, and use that control to take over email accounts and eventually bank accounts and so on.It's important to be very careful about who you interact with and what information you expose to the general public. Utilize the privacy features on platforms like Facebook or Twitter and be sure not to share too much personal information on platforms like Instagram. If you do, make your profiles private so that not everyone can track your every movement.#8 -- Targeting employees to compromise corporate networksAnother major online threat involves directly targeting employees to compromise corporate networks. Since some employees act as the gatekeepers into their corporate networks, there's no surprise that this is on the rise. For example, a large part of the wire fraud that occurs happens because cybercriminals successfully target the right employees to compromise the company's corporate network, allowing them almost unfettered access and approval to steal millions of dollars with ease.Vulnerable employees also act as a gateway into a corporation's email servers, files and databases, where these cybercriminals can do massive amounts of damage. Employees need to be very careful on social media networks about who they interact with or through what phishing schemes that they click on and unknowingly provide credentials to. ZeroFox's game-changing software helps to alleviate a large part of this worry for most large companies, but not everyone is proactive enough to engage in their services.Without using a company like ZeroFox, most corporations have no idea about what threats exist out there to their employees or their networks, and it really is one of the most revolutionary platforms that exists out there. Either way you cut it, employee education is a must here to ensure any potential attacks are thwarted before they even begin.#9 -- Tracking movements for physical targetingOne massive online threat that exists, which can also help put your physical safety into peril, is the tracking of movements through social media and other channels. For consumers, this is an enormous risk, especially for those individuals that aptly portray a lavish lifestyle, traveling around the world. When cybercriminals know that you aren't home, it's simple for them to break into your home and steal your belongings.You don't need to be uber-wealthy in order to be targeted. Criminals will target all types of individuals through social media channels, able to see when they're home and when they aren't. If you go on vacation, be careful of what information you're sharing and whether or not your profile is public or private. If you don't have home security systems installed and don't want to be a victim of a crime, be very wary about what you share.Much of this remains common sense, but our physical security can also be put at risk if criminals know where we're going and learn what our routines and schedules might be. They can use that information to do all sorts of bad things to us, virtually and physically, so be very careful.#10 -- Customer service interceptionOne of the gatekeepers to any company are their customer service representatives. They are one of the most proliferous category of employees who are interfacing with the clients on a daily basis. However, as skilled as they might be at their jobs, they are often unaware of the online threats that most cybercriminals pose when interacting through a number of mediums. In fact, cybercriminals are known to replicate profiles and post throughout social media to draw attention to unassuming individuals.They do this in an effort to gain access to accounts, alter the awareness of the general public and to funnel or filter payments and other inquiries that might otherwise alert companies to something that's amiss. This is an enormous threat to businesses, and those without a system like ZeroFox or something similar, will most likely be unaware until the very last moment that a crime actually occurs.Not only is this bad financially speaking, but it's also bad for a company's reputation. When a customer is angry, they often don't care whether they were speaking to an imposter or the actual company's representative themselves. At that point, it's usually too late to put out the fire. If you're a business and you're serious about your company's online security through social media channels, it's important to invest in a platform to help you mitigate such attacks."

used for the cryptocurrency bitcoin. MetaX today is unveiling adChain, ...","Mar 21, 2017,08:01am EDT",MetaX CEO Ken Brook,"Ken Brook has worked in advertising technology for years, so he knows what advertisers have to deal with on the Internet: Digital advertising is plagued with fraud, from phantom ads that no one ever sees to adware that infects people's computers.Brook's new self-funded Los Angeles startup, MetaX, aims to solve that problem using blockchain, the technology most popularly used for the cryptocurrency bitcoin. MetaX today is unveiling adChain, which it says is the first protocol using the distributed ledger technology to coordinate the digital ad supply chain.Fraud and the lack of transparency that enables it are big problems in display advertising, with marketers considering pulling budgets out of online advertising and governments from France to the United States mulling restrictions on digital ad practices.Brook, an ad tech serial entrepreneur who is still CEO of video ad tech firm VidRoll LLC, says adChain could provide a lot of benefits to the fragmented digital ad business, but fraud is the first target. ""Fraud prevention is a natural first application,"" he said, not least because the display ad ecosystem remains murky, with advertisers often unsure where or even if their ads ran, especially outside the walled gardens of Google Inc. and Facebook Inc., generally regarded as more trustworthy than the dozens of ad networks and other middlemen in display ads.AdChain provides a blockchain, or database, that is shared among parties in an ad campaign, storing data such as impressions and audience segments. A brand or retailer buys ad impressions through a real-time buying platform that finds target audiences in ad exchanges that provide access to online publishers' inventory. The impressions are encrypted and broadcast to each participant in the blockchain, who approve the impression. The block becomes part of the permanent ledger and the impressions are verified.The adChain protocol is now in production in a private beta test with a few companies, which Brook won't name. MetaX plans to make it not-for-profit to encourage more use. MetaX provides a dashboard to access adChain and is building applications on top of it, such as a blockchain bidder with what it says is better targeting and security. It plans to make money from subscriptions to those applications.None of this will be easy for MetaX. For one, it essentially needs to get pretty much the entire display advertising industry to go along, a tough road for a little startup that didn't exist before last November.Some marketers appear willing to give it a try. Fred Askham, associate director of data analytics and decision sciences at the ad agency IMM, said his clients will appreciate the transparency. For his part, he looks forward to better data for targeting ads and gauging their impact.Another challenge: The two biggest players won’t be part of the initiative. Google and Facebook already run their own mostly self-contained display businesses, and they can afford to invest in better ad technologies marketers want. But even they are facing new challenges. Ads from some large brands in the United Kingdom ran alongside YouTube videos of jihadists and neo-Nazis, causing some brands and the large agency holding company Havas to stop spending on YouTube and the Google Display Network in the U.K. Facebook in recent months has had its own issues with inaccuracies on its ad metrics.So despite the steep odds, Brook's bid to remake the display business could prove timely.Here's a video from MetaX on what it aims to do:"

Sitting in the same uncomfortable chair since 9.10am, he's now told he can't get what might be a crucial check up thanks to faceless hackers who launched a huge attack on Friday that left computers at 48 National Health Service (NHS) Trusts out of action. Those cybercriminals have now earned more than $50,000 in Bitcoin in a few days. Twice what the average person in the U.K. earns in a year.This is the sad reality of the WannaCry ransomware outbreak that's hitting doctor's surgeries across the U.K. today. Though the outbreak has been contained, multiple general practices warned patients Monday that many of their systems were inaccessible and they should either wait or seek assistance elsewhere. Brits are receiving text message from their doctors, such as this from St Stephen's Health Center in East London: ""We are running limited services - we are prioritising emergencies, you can still be seen by a GP. We can still process prescriptions. We have NO access to results, x-rays, blood tests or hospital letters. We will update you as soon as we can.""Over at Mile End Hospital, run by one of the worst affected organizations, the Barts Trust, things are quiet, eerily so. Asked if they know where the nearest pharmacy is and if they're affected by the attacks, staff say they're unsure. Most likely they've been told the same as the surgery staff: limit computer use and don't use email until the IT gods at the NHS deem it safe.The problem is hitting multiple surgeries across the U.K. in different ways. In Nottingham, staff were told to turn all their PCs off Friday to prevent any further infections and they remain off. They, like many others, are now turning to pen and paper.Doctors at this GP's surgery in Bulwell, Nottingham have no computers and are relying on pens and paper and a whiteboard pic.twitter.com/nfvEnnK7fL— Sky News (@SkyNews) May 15, 2017Up in Northumberland, NHS facilities warned patients that doctors did not have access to medical records, including any results, previous consultations or medications.

A stark warning on the surgery website read of complete uncertainty:A stark warning about the impact of the ransomware outbreak from one British surgery.Dr Irfam Malik from Elmswood told me patients had been very understanding. ""But no medical records, results, prescriptions... We can only provide a skeletal service. [There's been] no major effect on patient's health as yet - but risks are increased.""This is the outcome of a cyberattack launched by coders considered average at best, who exploited systems that could have been upgraded to avoid being attacked.

the potential to broadly affect financial markets, but the most ...","Apr 12, 2017,09:14am EDT",By Thomas Olsen and Frank Ford,"With all the noise surrounding distributed ledger technology (DLT), you’d expect participants in financial markets to be racing full-bore to get ready for it. But many are not. Presented almost daily with new claims about DLT’s disruptive and revolutionary potential, some executives have begun to wonder when they’ll actually begin to see some benefits from the technology.Financial market participants know DLT is coming. About 80% of executives at financial institutions surveyed by Bain & Company believe the technology will be transformative, and a similar percentage expect their organizations to begin using it before 2020. Yet, at the same time, they’re hesitant to commit resources now. Among the market participants Bain surveyed, 38% said they’ve adopted a wait-and-see approach to DLT.What’s holding them back?First, uncertainty. It is hard to predict exactly which DLT applications will reach scale. It’s also unclear how the regulatory environment will evolve in different markets. Second, getting ready for DLT requires substantial investment at a time when many firms are facing financial constraints, and it can involve working through tricky and expensive issues with legacy IT systems. Third, some firms, in an attempt to preserve near-term competitive positions, are trying to delay industrywide adoption of DLT.Yet companies that are willing to be proactive and strategic about DLT, even in such a challenging climate, can gain an edge.Related: Distributed Ledgers In Payments—Beyond The Bitcoin HypeDLT has the potential to broadly affect financial markets, but the most significant near-term impact is likely to be on settlement and clearing. While a trader can now execute a transaction at lightning speed, it can take as long as three days for that transaction to settle. With DLT, execution, clearing and settlement could occur simultaneously, minimizing cost and credit risks. Bain estimates that across global financial markets, annual expense and capital cost savings from DLT could amount to 1 to 3 basis points of total global assets under management, or about $15 billion to $35 billion.Certain asset classes and activities are ripe for early DLT adoption. For example, Euroclear and Paxos have piloted a DLT settlement service for gold bullion trading in London. The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation and a consortium that includes IBM, Axoni and R3 have successfully tested a system using DLT and smart contracts to manage post-trade services in the $11 trillion OTC market for cleared and bilateral credit derivatives.DLT can eventually also play a role in improving reference data, including benchmark interest rates like Libor, replacing existing survey processes that are opaque and subject to abuse. A DLT-based benchmark-setting mechanism, possibly administered by trading venues and industrywide utilities, could directly capture data from spot transactions.Beyond trading, DLT has the potential to change the way firms interact with their clients in areas such as proxy voting, digital identity management and Know Your Customer (KYC). Broadridge, a global leader in proxy communication services, is developing a system to help make US proxy voting more efficient, secure and transparent. Regulators are also actively working on DLT solutions: The state of Delaware is developing legislation that would allow the use of DLT to manage corporate records.As financial markets evolve with respect to DLT, companies will face game-theory-type decisions. If they promote the early adoption of DLT across the ecosystem, they may benefit, but they may also end up disrupting their own economics and competitive positions. Yet if they’re slow to embrace DLT, they run the risk of being left behind.The most valuable DLT innovations can’t be developed in isolation; they require collaboration among participants, exchanges and regulators. With so many participants involved across so many jurisdictions and asset classes, the adoption process will be messy and piecemeal—and this is the heart of the challenge. It may make more sense to share the costs as well as the benefits through industry utilities.One way or another, firms that want to reap the benefits of DLT will have to make significant changes to their processes, policies and IT architecture. As part of their efforts to make their IT systems ready for digital, leading companies are taking some of the preparatory steps that will be necessary for DLT.Once a company has a perspective on how DLT is likely to evolve in the areas in which it does business, it can develop a systematic approach and a multiyear roadmap.Whether a company prospers or flounders in the DLT-dominated markets of the future will depend, in large measure, on strategic decisions it makes today. Once a firm defines a DLT-readiness posture and a high-level roadmap, its next step is to outline specific no-regrets initiatives. Many of the investments a firm makes, especially in IT, can bring benefits regardless of the pace or shape of DLT adoption.Those market participants that thrive with DLT will spend less energy on making excuses for inaction and more on developing a strategic and longer-term approach that’s consistent with who they are, what they do and where they operate. They’ll focus on driving themselves and the entire industry toward a more efficient ecosystem. The winners in DLT will be those that push the pace of change, rather than resist it.Read more: Blockchain In Financial Markets—How To Gain An EdgeThomas Olsen is a partner with Bain & Company in Singapore in the Financial Services and Strategy practices.

particular their use of shared Bitcoin wallets to cash out.","May 15, 2017,04:21pm EDT","Ransomware has caused carnage of late. Is it possible North Korea was behind the attack? It's too... [+] early to say, but an intriguing clue just landed. (Photo credit: DAMIEN MEYER/AFP/Getty Images)","As law enforcement and security experts from across the world start investigating who was behind the massive outbreak of the WannaCry ransomware, one clue has got them salivating. It points to North Korea.The clue lies in the code. Google security researcher Neel Mehta posted a mysterious tweet linking to two samples of malware: one was WannaCry, the other a creation of a gang of hackers called the Lazarus Group, which has been linked to the catastrophic 2014 hack of Sony and a record $81 million cyber theft from a Bangladeshi bank. Lazarus was also said to be North Korean, according to previous analyses by numerous security firms.After Mehta's post, Kaspersky Lab probed the code, as did Proofpoint security researcher Darien Huss and founder of Comae Technologies Matthieu Suiche. All have been actively investigating and defending the web against WannaCry and were intrigued at the possible link to North Korea.All believe that Mehta's find could provide a clue as to the possible creators of WannaCry, which borrowed from an NSA hacking tool to infect as many as 200,000 systems, causing serious delays and downtime at hospitals in the U.K. and taking out Nissan and Renault car factories, amongst other issues. But, they all note, it could be a false flag purposefully lodged in the code to lead everyone down the wrong path.What code was copied?Mehta and the researchers who pounced on her find said that a chunk of WannaCry was 100 per cent the same as a slice of Contopee, the malware used by the Lazarus Group. WannaCry was from February 2017, Contopee from the same month in 2015. The apparently copied code was used in both malware samples for a random code generation feature; it would generate a random number between 0 and 75. That would be used to encode data, putting some obfuscation around the malware's operation to help it avoid detection by security tools.Based solely on the copied code, Kaspesky Lab said it was ""the most significant clue to date regarding the origins of WannaCry."" Director of the global research and analysis team at Kaspersky Lab, Costin Raiu, told Forbes the malware Mehta was investigating appeared to be the same as that found by BAE Systems, linking the Bangladesh bank heist group with Lazarus. ""Of course, more research is required at this time, but Neel might have found the WannaCry Rosetta Stone,"" Raiu added.Suiche agreed: ""It would also subscribe to the Lazarus Group narrative... They are known for targeting financial institutions like banks. The fact they did ransomware to steal money over cryptocurrency would subscribe to the same modus operandi.""What makes the clue especially intriguing is that the code might be unique, linked only to Lazarus and no one else. One researcher, who asked to remain anonymous, said there were very few matches when comparing the code to malware in a vast virus repository he had access to. It appeared likely the WannaCry hackers borrowed from a very limited set of tools used by the Lazarus Group alone and no other malicious actors, he said, making it a little more likely the two were associated.Security giant Symantec, which has tracked the Lazarus Group over recent years, said it had found some interesting links too. Its researchers found earlier versions of WannaCry in April and early May that weren't widely distributed, but were uncovered on systems shortly after being hacked with known Lazarus tools. ""However, we have not yet been able to confirm the Lazarus tools deployed WannaCry on these systems,"" the firm qualified. WannaCry also used forms of web encryption ""that historically was unique to Lazarus tools.""Vikram Thakur, technical director at Symantec, said his team had been investigating possible links to major cyber groups since Friday. He also noted some slightly odd behavior from those behind WannaCry, in particular their use of shared Bitcoin wallets to cash out. By including those in the malware code, it'll be easy to follow the money if they ever decide to draw out. This left Thakur wondering: were the attackers just trying to cause global damage rather than make money? From the Sony attacks and destructive hacks on South Korea that have been linked to Lazarus, it wouldn't be out of the question for the crew to be involved in the massively troublesome malware outbreak that led to possibly life-threatening situations in British hospitals.Far from definiteAll of this should be taken with a sizeable pinch of salt, however. The clue is far from clear and the information could have been planted to mislead researchers and law enforcement as they investigate, security experts said.The anonymous researcher said he had looked at the code for hours and was ""not sold."" ""There is overlap but the functionality doesn't appear unique.""Similarities in code do not mean they're owned by the same hacker. As noted by Huss, the Lazarus Group is known to create tools based on open source code. ""My main concern is that the overlapping function in question may have been ripped from some code somewhere,"" he added. ""We should be cautious as there's a real possibility that this is just some code overlap from something that was copied by two different groups.""Hackers all too regularly borrow code. Indeed, it could also be that a group found the Lazarus Group's tools and re-used them. Or, as Thakur noted, there could be 2,000 malware samples that have been kept secret on some underground forum where criminals are sharing tools.But in a case with few leads, where the $60,000 in Bitcoin stolen from WannaCry victims hasn't been traced back to any perpetrator, it's at least something."

and cryptocurrency space on payments as well as cashless ...","Mar 29, 2017,04:41pm EDT","Who wouldn’t want to live like Croesus, the last King of Lydia, a country in western Asia Minor corresponding to modern-day Turkey from 560-547 BC? It’s surely is something most of us would like to aspire to. He was so wealthy that the expression ‘as rich as Croesus’ derives from him.","However, very few people are familiar with the historical Lydian kings, who inhabited the Mediterranean coast between Troy and Miletus in what is now present day Turkey. The Lydian kings are considered the inventors of money, producing the first coins in around 600 BC.Historians cite that it was either during the reign of Croesus or just prior to that the Lydians became the first people to mint coins of gold and silver. Shortly afterwards, the Greeks also began minting coins, resulting in a severe decline in the popularity of the bartering system by 400 BC.There was, however, still no standardized system of coinage with each region having its own set of coins with their own specific values. Around the same time, the Romans also began to create coins, first of copper or bronze, and then later of gold, silver and brass.The Midas TouchCroesus’ huge wealth is said to have come from the sands of the River Pactolus, where the legendary King Midas washed his hands to rid himself of the ‘Midas Touch’, which turned everything he laid hands on into gold. According to the legend this turned the sands of the river rich with gold.It was Croesus who financed the building of the great Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, one of The Seven Wonders of the ancient world. So, he was not short of a few bob.The Middle AgesDuring the Middle Ages, Charlemagne - aka Charles the Great or Charles I - in particular, considerably influenced the history of money. He united much of Europe during the early Middle Age period and laid the foundations for modern France, Germany and the Low Countries (what is now known as Benelux).The coin known as the denier - or penny - was a medieval coin introduced in the late seventh century as the standard method of payment in the Carolingian Empire (800-888), now modern-day Europe. The denier also served as the model for a number of Europe's currencies, including the British pound, Italian lire, Portuguese dinheiro and the Spanish dinero. Charlemagne’s currency reform in 793 AD also replaced the hitherto gold coinage with silver.In the first millennium of its history, cash existed only in the form of coins. Around the year 1,000 AD, however, China began issuing paper money. But it was not until 500 years later that Europe did the same.The major problem with this concept was that, unlike coins, the material value of paper money was not equal to the value printed on it, and people of all cultures and countries struggled to recognise and accept it. At the time of the French Revolution, many people had their money paid out in coins for this very reason, a trend which caused a scarcity of coinage at the banks.Cash & Scriptural MoneyIt was not until the nineteenth century that banknotes, alongside coins, became a recognized method of payment. Although cash, as we know it, has a long history, its current forms haven’t been around all that long.Almost at the same time, cashless payment transactions were launched, initially in a form known as scriptural money. This concept is closely linked to the development of paper money.In this type of transaction, the borrower fulfils his or her monetary obligations to the lender without using cash. For example, in 14th century Italy, full-value coins or precious metals were deposited with bankers, who issued promissory notes for them.These claims against the bank were recorded in an account. As accounts back then were kept in handwritten ledgers, this type of transaction being known as scriptural money. Over the years, these ledgers evolved into the databases and cashless payment transactions, which are now standard in many countries.(Image: Shutterstock).e-Money: Today & TomorrowThe latest stage in the technological evolution of money is e-money. Here, monetary values in the form of claims are stored either decentrally on data carriers such as smart cards, or centrally on servers.However, gift cards traditionally issued by retailers are not included in this category, as e-money cannot be accepted only by its original issuer. Instead, it must be more widely valid.Prepaid credit cards, which do fit the definition of e-money, are currently very popular. They are loaded with a flexibly definable amount and can be used securely by consumers at all credit card acceptance points - both online and offline.Many payment apps are also based on e-money. They work by transferring sums of money from one e-money account to another.“When, for example, someone uses the Cringle app to send money to a friend via text, the amount is debited from the sender’s current account before being credited to his or her e-money account,” remarked Tobias Schreyer, co-founder and chief commercial officer at PPRO Group, a fast growing European fintech and cross-border e-payment specialist that has been in business for a decade.From there, it is transferred to the recipient's e-money account and finally to the recipient's current account. The app turns an otherwise complicated-sounding process into child’s play, allowing users to transfer money via a simple text message.Schreyer, who has been kept busy of late after the UK’s Brexit vote in establishing a Luxembourg office alongside the firm’s London headquarters and Munich processing hub, explained: “The main difference between these transactions and traditional money transfers is that users no longer require access to their current accounts or online banking: the need to contact a bank has been removed.He added; “e-money providers, which are combinations of fintech companies and traditional online banks, are working at top speed to develop innovative and convenient payment offerings.”The aforementioned prepaid credit cards for both individuals and companies are just one of many options. Contactless payments, using NFC (near field communication) stickers, for example, are another.The concept of storing money centrally on servers belonging to regulated e-money institutes is becoming increasingly associated with security and convenience.Founded in 2006, PPRO is an EU-certified financial institution with an e-money license issued by the UK’s regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, that offers an extensive range of alternative payments methods for merchants through PSPs and also issues Visa and Mastercard prepaid cards for B2B and B2C. This is across the EU both as physical cards and as virtual e-wallets.Security of e-Money & ConvenienceIn assessing the security of e-money, there are two different perspectives to taken into account - from the point of views of the user and the provider.Schreyer, who holds holds a BA in Business Administration and studied at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München in Germany, pointed out: “E-money institutions, like PPRO, can implement a variety of innovative payment services very quickly and easily. Despite this, the customers do not have to compromise on security.”E-money institutions cannot begin operating until they have received approval - in the form of an e-money licence - from the appropriate financial regulatory authority.He explained further: “They must fulfil a number of security requirements, such as ensuring the safety of their customers’ money, putting in place risk management procedures, and appointing an AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance officer. In general, all of these measures are comparable with those required of banks. After all, e-money and the services on which it is based were created with security in mind.”Prepaid credit cards are a good example. E-money accounts based on prepaid credit cards are initially unfunded and can be loaded with the desired amount.Holders can then use their prepaid credit cards to make purchases, just as they would with any other credit card - up to the pre-loaded amount. The cards incorporate multiple security features, including, for example, chip and PIN.Prepaid credit cards do not offer advance credit. If a card is lost, the cardholder can simply block the card and receive a replacement card with the correct balance. Cardholders are also informed of every transaction, thus making unauthorised payments immediately obvious.“This is just one-way e-money can be used,” said Schreyer, who these days is mainly responsible for issuing operations at PPRO with a focus on sales activities and business development in the prepaid cards segment.It can also be used to make payments via apps. “Here, too, there are a variety of options for securing transactions. Data is encrypted for secure transfer, while all transactions must also be approved by the user,” he added.Currently, PPRO is focusing investment on hiring talented and motivated employees to ensure customers will receive a high quality and tailored customer service, which simultaneously addresses the needs of international merchants. To enable fast paced growth, they have expanded their offices in multiple locations.In addition, the fintech made an early decision last year to begin the process of relocating headquarters to Luxembourg in order to comply with EU regulations, due to the uncertainty surrounding Brexit.Schreyer revealed to Forbes: “This will cost us an additional £1m (c.$1.25m/€1.15m) per year before the UK formally leaves the EU in having to maintain dual regulatory licences. But this is now a necessary cost.”The FutureAlthough many people still regard technological advances in electronic payments with scepticism, there is no longer any doubt that electronic money is set to become the predominant payment method of the future. And, now of course we have rampant developments in the bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency space on payments as well as cashless society endeavouurs.With e-money, security is a clear priority. FinTech companies like PPRO continue to be innovative in this area and are creating money and payment products that meet their customers’ expectations. And, for Schreyer their aim is: “To develop e-money as the electronic payment method of the future…but even faster.” "

with an estimated $1 billion in VC funding since 2014.","Mar 28, 2017,08:00am EDT",Shutterstock,"I am among those enthusiasts who believe that blockchain technology can be a valuable corporate finance tool outside of the banking sector. Airline industry CFOs and finance executives throughout the travel sector belong on the growing list of beneficiaries as well.As the backbone of digital currency, blockchain is already revealing its value in areas such as transparency, data security, logistics and process simplification, and even regulatory compliance. Recently, Walmart and IBM announced a pilot project to apply blockchain technology to Walmart's global supply chain management system.Of course, not every company is a candidate for blockchain applications: A recent Wharton analysis concluded that a company must determine whether blockchain is suitable based on multiple factors. The rationale for embracing blockchain technology will make the most sense -- and take on a degree of urgency -- if the business structure involves any number of parties that need trust and inter-party data access and management.As a provider of mobile commerce and payment solutions for travel companies, this makes the travel sector an ideal candidate in my book.More Business Equals More Revenue The travel business is complex and fragmented – ask any travel sector CFO or technology vendor. In addition to operational and financial challenges connected with protecting and growing their business, travel executives face distinctive challenges in their efforts to protect their customer base. Among the most pressing is identity management as security concerns persist and passenger numbers grow exponentially.As the Walmart pilot suggests, there is growing evidence of blockchain's value on an operational level. But its potential benefits, including security features, extend to ""soft"" yet vital airline success factors, such as customer satisfaction and retention.For example, with blockchain processes serving as the underlying authentication layer for biometric-equipped mobile and wearable devices, a passenger's experience becomes easier, faster and more satisfying. They can verify their identities, purchase travel products and ancillary services before, during and after their trips. They can communicate with airlines in a variety of new and engaging mobile formats without pulling out IDs and exposing personal financial information every single time.To extend the vision from a passenger's perspective, imagine going from home to the airport for a flight, then from the destination airport to your hotel and straight to your room without standing in a single line or sharing your personal data. Managing frequent flyer and loyalty programs and tracking baggage can also be a piece of cake, using blockchain technology as the information ""connector.""The beauty of this vision is that it serves as a genuine win-win for both the airline and its customers. And by contributing to customer satisfaction, an airline is much more likely to retain and grow that source of revenue, not to mention the range of ancillary purchases that become easier with blockchain technology.From Visionary To CommonplaceAirlines and governmental bodies are already investing in the idea of a universally accepted blockchain ID, to both simplify travel and make it safer. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security are important players, yet airlines and other travel companies must wrestle with the fact that innovation is being driven outside of their industries by companies such as IBM, Google and Apple. Venture capital continues to pour into the bitcoin and blockchain world, with an estimated $1 billion in VC funding since 2014.As the blockchain universe evolves within the travel sector, it holds the potential to integrate new products and services without excessive investment costs or overly complicated implementation efforts.Granted, this will not happen overnight. It will likely take another three-to-five years before blockchain technology matures to the point of widespread adoption, and perhaps even longer before many airlines and travel-related businesses understand out how to embrace and monetize blockchain. Only then can they affect change throughout the enterprise.Factors like performance pressures, mobile proliferation, rapid third-party innovation, growing customer expectations and uncertain marketplace economics will force airlines and travel companies to reconsider their business models and find a place for blockchain if they are to build and keep a durable, market-leading brand. Just as companies in the financial services and retailing sectors are already starting to discover today."

","You may not know much about The Shadow Brokers - a secretive and mysterious...no-one is quite sure but let's say...group of hackers with alleged NSA data but you probably will over the coming days. While some believe the group to be a disgruntled intelligence agent, others say Russia and others say a collection of hackers. We may never know but that's looking increasingly unlikely per Edward Snowden who said via Twitter: ""NSA should be able to instantly identify where this set came from and how they lost it. If they can’t, it’s a scandal.”The leak dump is an intriguing story with some big ramifications, mainly because this isn't the full list of NSA tools per Snowden. In brief, the group released a large collection of files on Saturday that gives further insight into the NSA's hacking methods. This wasn't an altruistic dump, the group had previously put the data up for auction but nobody bought it for the requested $7,070,300 in bitcoin. Instead, the group revealed a password that unlocks an encrypted cache of documents in a short Medium post that reads a lot like a poorly translated open letter to President Donald Trump (see later).In the post, the group say they voted for President Donald Trump before launching into a laundry list of errors it believes President Donald Trump and his administration is accountable for, specifically calling out recent Syrian activity.""Good Evidence:#1 — Goldman Sach (TheGlobalists) and Military Industrial Intelligence Complex (MIIC) cabinet#2 — Backtracked on Obamacare#3 — Attacked the Freedom Causcus (TheMovement)#4 — Removed Bannon from the NSC#5 — Increased U.S. involvement in a foreign war (Syria Strike)""Security researchers and hackers are already analysing the contents of the leak and have revealed [per IBT]; a list of servers that NSA allegedly hacked into and even may have launched malware attacks on, a new set of tools used to hack into servers like PITCHIMPAIR, the password for an encrypted file containing many of the Equation Group surveillance tools dumped in 2016, and a framework called TOAST that is used to clean server logs and clear the NSA's tracks.Edward Snowden has publically said that this leak is ""nowhere near the full library [of Top NSA Tools].""Taken 9/4/17 @10:38am GMTAs with most hacking and leak stories - the identity of the perpetrator or perpetrators is highly contested and scrutinised. Much of the chatter surrounding the latest data breach pertains to the language used again (Motherboard suggested in 2016 that the group may be English speaking after linguistic analysis). The Reuters op-ed by cybersecurity expert and Foreign Policy Magazine columnist James Bamford, agrees with Motherboard, the group is most likely not a group but a disgruntled employee much like Edward Snowdon was. If so, that's a ticking bomb waiting to go off for the NSA.Bamford - also the author of 'The Shadow Factory: The Ultra-Secret NSA From 9/11 to the Eavesdropping on America' believes; ""But we now have entered a period many have warned about, when NSA’s cyber weapons could be stolen like loose nukes and used against us. It opens the door to criminal hackers, cyber-anarchists and hostile foreign governments that can use the tools to gain access to thousands of computers in order to steal data, plant malware and cause chaos."" A little alarmist possibly but one thing is for sure this leak is unlikely to end well for either party. "

Sunshine trades over the counter and is currently priced at $6.00 per share making it, in the view of my stick in the mud investor adviser, a ""penny stock"" too volatile for his firm to get involved with.  A recent press release from Sunshine obliges me to clarify a piece I did that discussed the company.  The title of the press release give its essence ""Sunshine Capital Inc. Announces That The Company's Use of 'DIBCOIN' Was Described as 'Genius' in a Forbes.com Article"".  It goes on:","""It's an honor to be mentioned in a financial news icon like Forbes.com,"" stated Adam Petty, President and CEO. ""The real genius of our business plan is Sunshine Capital, unlike the majority of public companies who use their stock as 'currency,' ours is structured in such a way that DIBCOIN will be used as a currency and that our shareholders' ownership will never be diluted.""ShutterstockSome ClarificationThere are two problems with that statement.  One is that there is an implication that in my piece with the hardly laudatory title of Florida Man Goes From Multilevel Marketing To Cryptocurrency - What Could Possibly Go Wrong?  I am somehow endorsing Sunshine Capital Inc and Dibcoin.  I am not endorsing Sunshine Capital Inc and Dibcoin.  I don't want to knock them.  I figure I have a pretty smart readership and that you can form your own conclusion.Also what Adam Petty states as the genius of Sunshine's business plan is not what I see as the genius of Sunshine's business plan.  Mr. Petty emphasizes that Sunshine's shareholders will not have their ownership diluted when it acquires new companies.  I suppose that is a good thing, but it is not what I see as genius.  What I see as genius is something that as far as an investor is concerned is not a good thing.  The genius of Adam Petty, Honson Luma and Ernie Land is to  take three things that by themselves have negligible credibility - a penny stock, a new cryptocurrency and multi-level marketing  to create a credible seeming narrative.To Be FairA couple of things in the ""to be fair"" column before I continue.  Honson Luma, the VP of Sunshine and originator of Dibcoin told me that Rx Smart Coffee is just one of Sunshine's acquisitions and that they are not staking their credibility on Ernie Land's endorsement.  Further, I have no reason to doubt the sincerity and integrity of Adam Petty, Honson Luma and Ernie Land.  I never did manage to speak to Mr. Petty.  I had a nice conversation with Mr. Luma.Ernie Land and I have spoken and been in correspondence for several years.  Mostly it has been about the trials and tribulations of young earth creationist Kent Hovind, who served a long term in federal prison and who was spared an additional long term by sharp legal work for which Ernie gets a lot of credit.  I believe that Ernie is about as sincere as a person with a sales related career can be.  On the other hand, Ernie seems to sincerely believe many things that I find preposterous.  And visa versa. Kent Hovind's innocence narrative , evolutionary biology, the age of the earth and a variety of conspiracy theories are among the things that Ernie and I  agree to disagree on, while maintaining a cordial relationship .  Sunshine Capital and Dibcoin will now join that list.The Sunshine StorySo let's start with the Sunshine narrative, which does not include multi-level marketing.  It has two components Sunshine Capital Inc, a publicly traded company and Dibcoin, a cryptocurrency now traded on the Livecoin exchange.Sunshine Capital's unaudited financial statements are underwhelming.  When I look at the financial statements of public companies, the numbers are usually rounded to the nearest million.  Sunshine's statements include pennies.  In the first three quarters of 2016, there was less than $20,000 of revenue and no revenue at all in the fourth quarter.  The largest expense item in the thirty odd thousand of expenses is $5,500 paid to Livecoin for Dibcoin expenses.  For assets there are two bank accounts.  The account at Harris Bank has $29.00 and the one at Bank of America has $2,543.99.  That's it for assets. There are were over 68 million shares outstanding on 12/31/16.  However in a restructuring in February, most of those share were cancelled leaving 16.997,000.  Still the implied market capitalization of $100 million at $6 per share seems a bit high for a company with no assets and no revenue to speak of.The Dibcoin StoryThen there is Dibcoin.  Dibcoin's credibility is based on its listing on the LiveCoin exchange.  I asked the people at LiveCoin how hard it is to get a coin listed.  The response was:The rules for new coins are quite simple, you can read it following this link: https://www.livecoin.net/en/coin-listingSo we would say that the listing procedure and requirements aren't difficult.Regardless, Dibcoin is trading on LiveCoin.  According to CryptoCurrency Market Capitalizations, as I write this a Dibcoin goes for $1.10.  Here is the rub though, the total volume traded in the last 24 hours is $241.  And there are 5 billion dibcoins.When You Put Them TogetherThis is where the genius, or perhaps ingenious narrative, comes into play.  If I say that Sunshine Capital does not seem to amount to very much, the response is - ""But it has 4 billion dibcoins.  And dibcoins trade on the LiveCoin Exchange at $1.10 each"".  If I say dibcoins don't seem to have very much in the way of transactions supporting their $1.10 valuation, the answer is - ""But there is a publicly traded company that will be using its dibcoins to acquire other companies making Dibcoin unique and revolutionary""That's the cake baked by Adam Petty and Honson Luma.  The icing on the cake is Ernie Land out there spreading the word with his multi-level marketing passion.  There is soon to be an affiliate program with nine levels. We'll see how that goes.When you really boil it down you have two things that objectively have negligible value with a linking narrative that creates purported billions in value out of thin air.  The only way I can think of to improve this is to use the new expedited Form 1023-EZ to get 501(c)(3) status for the Future of Money Foundation (I just made that up for illustrative purposes) .  Then you could have FMF give its innovator of the century award to Sunshine emphasizing that FMF has been approved by the IRS.  I'm really surprised they hadn't thought of that.  Maybe next time they order Rx Smart Coffee , they should go with the Beautiful Mind blend that enhances mental agility instead of Gentleman's Blend. Male vigor can be a great thing, but my experience is that it does not support clear thinking.How I Got On ThisI declared the Kent Hovind story or L'affaire Kent Hovind done as far as my forbes.com coverage was concerned in August 2015 when his co-defendant Paul Hansen received a below guideline sentence for contempt of court. I have kept up with the story on my alternate tax blog, which has lower standards and no rational editorial supervision at all.  That has kept me in touch with Ernie Land, Kent's consigliere, as Kent rebooted his ministry with speaking, a youtube channel and the prospects of a bigger better Dinosaur Adventureland in Lenox, Alabama.I would never have imagined that my Kent Hovind coverage would cross over with my coverage of virtual currencies, but Ernie Land and Dibcoin have made it happen.  I found the combination irresistible.  Ernie's response to my skepticism is that people were skeptical about Bitcoin and look how that has done.  As it happens it I remain skeptical of Bitcoin, but have to admit that its attractiveness to techno nerds of a libertarian bent will give it staying power.  I'm not buying any bitcoins, but I'm also not trying to figure out how to short them.  If Dibcoin catches on, as it may, with young earth creationists, it might really take off.  You be the judge.UpdateYou won't be able to buy Sunshine Capital on the OTC for at least a couple of weeks.  This release just came out from the SEC.The Commission temporarily suspended trading in the securities of SCNP because of questions regarding the accuracy of assertions by SCNP in press releases to investors concerning, among other things, the liquidity and value of the company’s assets, namely DIBCOINS, a cryptocurrency.I spoke with Valerie Sczepanik, Assistant Regional Director of the SEC New York Regional Office.  She told me that the SEC cannot comment beyond what is contained in the release."

IBM
 InterConnect conference this week, over 20,000 of Big Blue’s fans packed Las Vegas’s Mandalay Bay to hear about the company’s transformative, three-pronged strategy.","The bet-the-company story for IBM: Cloud, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Blockchain.While IBM still maintains numerous other business lines ranging from mainframes to middleware, these three Big Bets are truly Vegas-worthy – yet as with most of the bets in Sin City, the odds may very well be against the vendor.Rometty Throws the DiceIBM Chairman and CEO Ginni Rometty laid out IBM’s strategy at a packed keynote. “The IBM Cloud is the platform for the next era of business,” Rometty said, expressing the central theme of the keynote.The IBM Cloud combines the Cloud Foundry-based Bluemix Platform-as-a-Service environment with SoftLayer, IBM’s public Infrastructure-as-a-Service Cloud.But the key to IBM’s Cloud strategy is its reliance on AI. “IBM Cloud is cognitive at the core,” according to Rometty. “You’re going to want a cloud that has a full range of cognitive capabilities.”IBM has dubbed its AI offering Watson – a powerful cognitive computing engine that pervades everything IBM is bringing to customers. Not only does the IBM Cloud provide APIs to many Watson-based services, but the Cloud’s security infrastructure depends upon Watson as well.David Kenny, Senior Vice President of IBM Watson and Cloud Platform, laid out IBM’s strategic ONE Architecture consisting of four layers: Cloud, Data AI, and Applications, as the image below shows.David Kenny, Senior Vice President of IBM Watson and Cloud Platform, explaining the ONE ArchitectureThe ONE Architecture is remarkable in two ways: first, AI (in the form of Watson) represents an entire layer, indicating the breadth of IBM’s bet on the technology. The second remarkable aspect of the architecture is what it’s missing: most of the traditional layers of a strategic technology architecture, like databases, middleware, and the like – now all rolled into the Cloud.Data themselves, however, remain an integral part of the architecture. “Our strategy is data first: data diversity across public, private, and licensed data,” Rometty explained. “The other thing we uniquely do is data control: controlled access, data locality, and data isolation. We can guarantee you that your insights are your insights.” (Emphasis hers.)IBM: Peddling a Box of LEGO Blocks?IBM realizes that if it weren’t for Watson, much of the IBM Cloud would consist of commodity offerings that would struggle to compete with services from the likes of 
 
Amazon.com
 and 
 
Microsoft
. What, then, does Watson truly bring to customers of the IBM Cloud?The answer: essentially a box of composable tools, exposed via APIs. “The remit of the IBM Cloud is to provide APIs and a bundle of cognitive insights,” explained Tom Eck, Chief Technology Officer of Industry Platforms at IBM. “We have an API-first philosophy.”However, IBM faces two enormous challenges with this ‘box of LEGO blocks’ approach.First, immense effort is required to prepare Watson for use, belying the simplicity of such plug-and-play cognitive capabilities. Secondly, it’s not clear whether most of IBM’s large enterprise customers really want Big Blue to deliver components they have to assemble for themselves.Watson: Right Race, Wrong Horse?The key to Watson’s impressive Jeopardy!-winning capabilities is the fact that people must train the engine: a complex, laborious, and data-intensive process – not to mention expensive. Furthermore, once a particular Watson instance has been trained on a particular ‘corpus,’ or body of information, that instance is now only good for making sense of questions relevant to that corpus.Nevertheless, for problems that Watson is well-suited to solve, the approach unquestionably yields impressive results, whether it be for winning game shows, supporting cancer diagnoses, or saving people money on their taxes.In fact, 
 
H&R Block
 is a notable success story, just in time for tax season: notable, perhaps, because of the joint IBM Watson/H&R Block Superbowl ad last month.Watson supports tax advisors in the company’s retail locations, helping them to find the most deductions for customers. However, getting Watson up to speed was a significant effort. “Watson has ingested about 600 million data points before we started,” explained Bill Cobb, CEO of H&R Block. “It also learned the tax code.”This enormous commitment of person-hours from highly qualified professionals as well as vast quantities of data makes Watson more of a consultant’s tool, best suited for selling the time of IBM consultants, more so than a modular, LEGO-block style plug-in for customers to incorporate directly into their own applications.IBM tried to downplay this drawback at InterConnect, but compared to many of the more innovative AI technologies on the market today that don’t require the same kind of labor-intensive training, Watson comes across as being an earlier generation of AI technology. After all, its famous Jeopardy! win was in 2011.AI, therefore, may be a good bet, but it’s not clear that Watson itself is. “IBM is betting on the right race,” quipped Glenn O’Donnell, Vice President and Research Director at Forrester Research, “but they might be betting on the wrong horse.”IBM’s Longshot Bet: BlockchainThe most surprising third of IBM’s bet-the-farm strategy, however, has got to be its bet on Blockchain. First, a definition: “Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger for recording the history of transactions,” according to the IBM web site. “It fosters a new generation of transactional applications that establish trust, accountability and transparency.”The original Blockchain forms the backbone of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, but IBM’s Blockchain effort has little or nothing to do with Bitcoin. Instead, IBM predicts that Blockchain will be an essential tool for “financial services, supply chain, and global logistics,” according to Rometty. “I believe Blockchain will do for trusted transactions what the Internet has done for information.”Powerful words, considering IBM can count the number of Blockchain customers on one hand, and the industry at large is still unclear on how best to apply the novel technology.Nevertheless, IBM is doubling down on Blockchain, contributing to and supporting the Hyperledger open source Blockchain project. “It’s the fastest growing open source project the Linux Foundation has ever had,” Rometty points out.The technology already runs on the IBM Cloud, as well as IBM’s z Systems mainframes. Blockchain on the mainframe, in fact, is where IBM is able to deliver the technology’s best performance. “We’re already talking about ten thousand transactions per second, or maybe more,” Rometty says.While IBM is too circumspect to claim that Blockchain will actually drive mainframe sales, it is hoping that the technology will become mission-critical to its current mainframe customers, in particular in financial services.And the Winner Is…It’s clear that Rometty has taken the lesson of the Innovator’s Dilemma to heart, and is willing to jeopardize existing revenue streams in order to place large bets on innovation. Only time will tell how good those bets are, of course – and we can all argue over the odds.The big picture here, without question, is business transformation – most notably for IBM, but also for its customers. Such disruption drives IBM’s bets. “We want to give disruptors tools so that they’re disrupting with IBM technology,” explained Suzanne Livingston, Watson Financial Services Offering Management Strategy & Operations for IBM.The CEO summed up her vision for IBM succinctly. “Our job is to help prepare you for what you will become,” Rometty explained. “In my mind, you will become a cognitive enterprise. It will separate the winners and losers.”Which of the two characterizations will apply to IBM remains to be seen. You pays your money and you takes your chances.Intellyx publishes the Agile Digital Transformation Roadmap poster, advises companies on their digital transformation initiatives, and helps vendors communicate their agility stories.

Many of these owners, who have had decades-long careers in business and investing, are looking to leverage their knowledge and experience to build out a successful team both on the court and in the front office.","The forward-thinking owners try to give their team an advantage by adopting and implementing technology before their competitors. They seek out advancements in sports analytics, player performance and fan engagement technology. Some go as far as building state of the art arenas from the ground up to have complete control of the game day experience.Some franchises seem to have developed a proven model, while the verdict is still out on others. Some of these ownership groups may never change the fortunes of their teams but they are certainly shifting the landscape of the NBA and professional sports ownership—and making a fortune while doing so.Golden State WarriorsThe Warriors have arguably become the most forward thinking franchise in all of professional sports since the current ownership group bought the team in 2010. The defending Western Conference Champions are led by an ownership group of venture capitalists, technologists and businessmen. The owners have set the tone for a culture that accepts technology and encourages innovation.  The adoption of the Silicon Valley mindset has proven to be fruitful as the Warriors have become one of the best teams in the NBA.They have done this by taking advantage of the proximity to Silicon Valley by tapping into the tech and talent of the Bay Area. They will be getting even closer in 2019 when they move into the Chase Center—the state-of-the-art sport and entertainment complex equipped with emerging technologies.Joe Lacob – Lacob is the Chief Executive Officer and majority owner of the Golden State Warriors. He is a Partner and Strategic Advisor of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, where he has spent decades working as a venture capitalist.

Cuban has been one of the league’s most outspoken and recognizable owners—regularly sitting courtside and sometimes getting involved in the action. Under the watch of Cuban, the team transformed from a lottery team into a championship contender—ultimately winning the Larry O’Brien trophy in 2011.Off-the-court, the franchise has leveraged its billionaire owner’s background in tech to transform the experience of the players, fans and personnel. The franchise is often ahead of the curve by being the first team to implement a new technology before the rest of the league follows along. In 2015, the team debuted an immersive shopping experience by partnering with Tixsee to provide a virtual tour of American Airlines Center and provide fans a new way to purchase tickets and merchandise. Other than Tixsee, Dallas has partnered with other companies such as MuscleSound, Minecraft, SportsVU & more.The Mavs and technology have become so synonymous that Cuban has referred to the franchise itself as a “technology product.” Mark Cuban – Cuban is a serial entrepreneur and angel investor. His first venture MicroSolutions, a computer consulting service, was sold to CompuServe for $6 million dollars in 1990. He later co-founded one of the world’s first interest radio websites, Broadcast.com, and sold it to Yahoo four years later for $5.6 billion dollars. With the influx of capital he purchased the Dallas Mavericks for $280 million dollars in 2000 and turned it into one of the most valuable franchises in sports.Today, he actively invests in tech startups and companies from various sectors and is a “shark” on ABC’s hit TV show Shark Tank. Some of Cuban’s investments include: Synergy Sports, a web-based analytics platform; Catapult, an Australian company that makes motion-tracking devices for elite athletes; and Axon Sports, a cognitive training tool.Sacramento Kings On May 16 2013, an ownership group, led by Vivek Ranadivé, purchased the Sacramento Kings from the Maloof Family, saving the Capital City from losing its sole professional franchise. Collaborating with the city of Sacramento, this ownership group developed the high-tech, state-of-the-art Golden 1 Center. The $507 million arena is equipped with one thousand Wi-Fi access points, an 84-foot-long 4K video board and an app that acts as a remote control for fans. “The Highest Tech Stadium in Sports” has already hosted NCAA March Madness men’s and women’s games, the California state high school basketball championships and will play host to major eSports tournaments.

The Investing Team at Forbes has you covered. Here's our handy guide for your getting your financial house in order:What should you do with the records that you opt to toss? When you're ready to toss your old records, don't simply throw them into a recycling or trash bin. Your financial and legal records may have personally identifying information, as well as details about your accounts, that you want to keep private and away from potential identity thieves. Consider purchasing a sturdy home shredder to shred as you toss. You can also shred up to five pounds of records for free at Office Depot and OfficeMax retail stores through April 29 (see officedepot.com/shredding for more details and to print a coupon).And what about those records you opt to keep? Shironda Smith, a spokesperson for Office Depot, recommends keeping current documents - those that you need to get your hands on quickly - in a desktop filer with labeled tabs for the file categories you use most often, or choose a hanging file folder to make use of vertical space. You can also use colored file folders to quickly find files at a glance. For archived files, such as tax returns and legal documents, Smith recommends a compact file cabinet that combines safe storage with ease of access (she suggests something like the Realspace Mezza Mobile File). To stay organized, Smith advises that you label each file drawer, and make locating files even easier with hanging file pockets. Assign a category for each pocket using colors, or have each pocket correspond to a letter of the alphabet or calendar month.Records and documents that you don't need to access quickly may be stored in banker boxes or larger filing cabinets. Since accidents can (and do) happen, avoid spots which are prone to flooding or attract pests or rodents. Your attic or basement may be out of sight but those rooms may also be humid, increasing the likelihood that your records could mold or otherwise be damaged. Ditto for storage in outdoor sheds. If you store your records outside of your home, consider a climate-controlled space with the individual records in a fire-proof file or safe.Some financial professionals recommend that you keep certain original documents - like marriage or birth certificates, old stock certificates or savings bonds, and legal documents - in a safe deposit box at your local bank. It's a secure way to store important documents but use care when storing legal documents like an original will in a safe deposit box: depending on where you live, your executor could have difficulty accessing the box after your death.Today, most banks, law firms, and financial institutions allow you to receive bank statements and important documents via e-mail (check with your institution because you likely have to opt in to this service). The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) advises that this is an ""outstanding way to secure financial records."" Important tax and financial records such as W-2s, tax returns, and other paper documents can be scanned and stored electronically.

As it celebrated its 20th anniversary as a public company, investing sites started singing its praise.","It's hard to blame them.According to one of my favorite columnists, Jason Zweig, Amazon's stock has risen 49,000%. A $5,000 investment in the online retailer in 1997 would be worth $2.4 million today. That would buy a lot of Echos.An Amazon logo sits on a collection cart for customer orders on the opening day of the new...

By the year 2018, 2,000 permanent and 3,000 seasonal workers will find a job at the warehouse which already now has 1,500 permanent employees. Photographer: Martin Divisek/BloombergThe meteoric rise of Amazon's stock price gives us an excellent opportunity to examine the tenets of value investing. I find the best way to do that is to consider whether buying the entire company would be a good deal.Today, Amazon's market cap is about $465 billion. Let's compare Amazon with another public company, Berkshire Hathaway (Disclosure: I own shares of Berkshire Hathaway). It seems like a good comparison since Berkshire is run by famed value investor, Warren Buffett. Berkshire's market cap is a bit less than Amazon's, coming in at $400 billion.Now let's imagine we have $465 billion in cash burning a hole in our pocket. We have two choices:What would you do?Many investors would buy Amazon without a second thought. It's a technology company with a bright future. Its stock price has risen far beyond what Berkshire's stock has done lately. And Berkshire is a stodgy old company that invests in railroads, utilities, and other boring industries. It's no contest, right?Not so fast.There is one itsy, bitsy problem with Amazon--earnings. In the last annual report, Amazon reported about $136 billion in revenue. Of this amount, Amazon earned just $2.4 billion. In contrast, Berkshire reported revenues of $223 billion and earned over $24 billion.At the current rate of earnings, it will take Amazon nearly 10 years to equal just one year of earnings at Berkshire. And remember, Berkshire is $60 billion cheaper than Amazon.There are some other problems with Amazon. It's operating margins are a paltry 3%. Its net margin comes in at 1.7%. Berkshire sports an operating margin of about 14%, and more than 10 cents from every dollar in revenue finds its way down to net income. Berkshire's free cash flow is double Amazon's. The list could go on.As a value investor, these numbers matter. A lot. For those who have made a killing investing in Amazon, these numbers matter not a lick.Imagine you're at a party. The topic of investing comes up, and the guy who came to the party in a Lamborghini starts talking about all the money he's made in Amazon stock. The crowd noise dies down to listen in, and Mr. Lamborgini turns to you, the value investor, for your take on Amazon.You're toast.Don't even think about mentioning operating margins, price-to-earnings multiples, or CAPEX (Berkshire's is more than Amazon's, for what that's worth. Railroads and utilities hog capital.). A company's financial statements don't matter to most when a stock is on the rise any more than they would if we tried to value tulips.And Amazon is no tulip. It's one of the most innovative companies in existence. It's unquestionably an extremely valuable enterprise with a bright future. It's just not worth $465 billion. And therein lies the challenge. Value investors must hate what everybody else loves, and love what everybody else hates.Most people can't do that. It's not in our nature. We take comfort in crowds.Amazon is a great company selling at a bad price. That's not to say you can't make money on the stock if you time your trades correctly. Investors have made money on everything from tulips to Bitcoin. Why not Amazon?Value investors, however, must ignore Wall Street. We need to recognize that the value of an investment is driven by a company's earnings and what it does with those earnings. If we must rely on the future sale of an investment to make the investment worthwhile, we are no longer investing. We are speculating.Now I'm off to evaluate whether I should add to my investment in Ford."

[+] the Royal London Hospital, part of the largest NHS Trust in England. (Photo: NIKLAS HALLE'N/AFP/Getty Images)","What virus and worms are major potential threats to the healthcare system? Lots. Influenza, HIV, hepatitis, SARS, Ebola and various parasites, just to name a few. As Bill Gates warned, many new viruses could emerge in the 10 to 15 years. But add to this list of biological pathogens a bunch of pathogens that could literally appear, spread and wreak havoc within hours, maybe within minutes: computer viruses and worms. Friday's massive WannaCry cyber attack that affected over 75,000 computers in 99 countries showed how a virus can quickly cripple an entire country's health system.Since Thomas Fox-Brewster covers the details of WannaCry nicely for Forbes, here's just a quick summary of what occurred. This time hackers exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft's Windows operating system that should have been fixed by downloading and installing an update issued by Microsoft in March. This ransomware attack involved infecting computer systems with a worm that encrypted data on computers, making them inaccessible, and demanding bitcoin payments to unlock the data. In essence, ransomware attacks hold your computer and its data hostage until you pay a ransom. The attack significantly disrupted healthcare operations in the United Kingdom (UK), with at least sixteen National Health Service (NHS) organizations infected. As a result, many hospitals throughout London, northwest England and central England had to turn away patients until the situation was under control. Fox-Brewster also explains how the WannyCry pandemic was quelled. Apparently a 22-year-old cybersecurity researcher named MalwareTech (not the person's actual name, in case you were wondering) accidentally activated the “kill switch” for the malware by purchasing for $11 and registering a garbled domain name.Even though the ""kill switch"" prevented much further spread and damage, delays and cancellations of procedures and treatments affected thousands of patients, many of whom had serious illnesses. Who knows the actual short-term and long-term impact of this brief cyber attack? There are so many ways that such an attack could harm and even kill patients. Doctors and other healthcare workers are depending more and more on rapidly getting up-to-date and accurate data on patients. Laboratory results (e.g., levels of potassium and sodium in the blood, the presence of pathogens in patient samples and the ability of blood to clot), monitoring device output (e.g., cardiac monitoring devices and ventilation machines), and imaging studies that are off by a few points or few pixels or days, hours or in some cases minutes out of date could dramatically alter medical care decisions. Mix-ups in patient identity could result in patients getting the wrong tests and treatments. Disruptions in patient ordering and scheduling systems could also lead to mistakes in what patients receive and logjams that prevent patients from getting critical medical procedures (e.g., the operating room is not ready for a patient). Permanently destroying data could mean that life-altering and lifesaving information is not available or force patients to repeat tests, which in some cases could be painful or harmful.Here's a BBC report on how WannaCry made people wanna do so in the UK:To prepare for such computer epidemics or pandemics, the culture of the healthcare industry and medicine needs to change. My previous piece in Forbes discussed how the healthcare industry is doing a very fecal job at investing in data science and cybersecurity. Again, investing in data security doesn't mean throwing some geeks at the problem, because geeks don't like to be thrown, or just importing solutions from other industries, which would be analogous to having golfer Rory McIlroy serve as your NFL team quarterback (yes, even the Cleveland Browns). Since the actions of a single person in a healthcare setting could help unleash the next big computer virus, there need to be larger changes in the system and culture. Data science and computational courses should be standard core components of public health programs, medical school, nursing school and other types of health professional education and training. A single lecture or webinar won't do it. Digital and cyber health have to further grow as important disciplines and industries and receive greater attention, support and funding. Doctors and others with healthcare experience also need to be more involved in cybersecurity discussions.Friday's cyber attack was a bit like the Ebola outbreaks and the 2009 influenza pandemic. People were hurt but luck helped avoid massive catastrophe. But all of these must serve as good wake-up calls and slaps in the face, because our healthcare system is woefully underprepared for any type of major epidemic or pandemic...biological or computational."

Cryptocurrencies Break The Internet Or Break The Bank? For these ...","May 18, 2017,10:00am EDT","For a new form of funding, initial coin offerings, or ICOs, have been raising money at astonishing speed — amassing about $440 million over two years, mostly for developers of early-stage projects.","These crowdsales of new cryptocurrencies give entrepreneurs access to funding from the crowd, and token buyers, in turn, get something akin to a form of equity in the network, since, if the platform becomes more popular, the price for their shares should rise.Early-stage blockchain entrepreneurs have already raised more money via ICOs than venture capital this year, and VCs, seeing the writing on the wall, are beginning to disrupt themselves by tokenizing their own fundraising rounds.But this crowdfunding method raises a lot of questions, starting with: Is a token sold via an ICO a security? Additionally, the ease of raising gobs of money based on a white paper peppered with the word “blockchain” or “token” has led to numerous scams, and many ill-conceived projects have raised a lot more money than they would have from seasoned venture capitalists.For these reasons and more, AngelList, the go-to platform that connects startups and investors, and Protocol Labs, a company working on building the infrastructure for decentralized networks including Filecoin, are launching CoinList, a new platform for token-based networks to reach investors and raise money for the development of the project. The first ICO on the platform will be for Filecoin, sometime in the next few weeks.Screenshot of CoinList“ICOs are obviously a new and interesting form of funding for blockchain-based protocols,” Naval Ravikant, the CEO and cofounder of AngelList, and an investor in Protocol Labs, wrote via email. “But it's not clear that all of them comply with U.S. securities laws or that all of them are companies that have good native use cases for new coins.” Then, referring to Filecoin, the inaugural ICO on CoinList, he wrote, “So, we wanted to use a high-quality coin and team to trailblaze a legal and compliant ICO.” The service is especially helpful for the projects that run a high risk of having their tokens labeled as securities — in this case, those that raise money selling coins well before they launch their network. Some of the thinking around the legality of ICOs stems from whether or not the token has utility, such as how people who buy a golf club membership presumably do so because the buyer wants to use the club, not because the value of the membership may rise. However, if developers sell a token before the network has launched, that muddies the distinction.That then leaves entrepreneurs of blockchain-based networks in a bind — needing to fund the development of their idea but running the risk of getting in trouble with the SEC if they do a token sale for a network that launches 18 months later. There’s also risk for investors, says Juan Benet, founder of Protocol Labs. “It’s similar to Kickstarter, where people are trying to crowd fund the development of the network, but the difference here is that … there’s a significantly different risk between different platforms in crypto vs. a product that just needs manufacturing,” he says. To address these two concerns, CoinList, which Benet calls “a mix between Kickstarter and Angel List,” will employ a new kind of agreement called a SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens). The SAFT is based on a similar mechanism called a SAFE commonly used by early-stage startups to raise money in exchange for equity without having to issue debt instruments like convertible notes. It also enables developers to raise the funds they need to launch the network without issuing a token that could later be perceived as a security.One characteristic of the sales on CoinList that may help curb some of the current rampant speculation is that they will only be open to accredited investors who earn $200,000 or more a year or have a net worth of at least $1 million. On the other hand, that might also dampen some of the enthusiasm for CoinList, because some have felt that ICOs have been democratizing finance and making venture-type deals available to the average retail investor rather than only the wealthy. On the flip side, the CoinList stamp of approval could also push the speculation to new heights. When asked how much CoinList will vet potential ICOs, Benet says, “Investors should do their own due diligence, but we do think there will be some signal here, where, at the very least, we can rate the offering.”Olaf Carlson-Wee, the CEO and founder of Polychain Capital which is a hedge fund that invests in blockchain-based assets, says that SAFTs make so much sense that Polychain had separately come up with the same concept for several of its investments and even used the same acronym for it. However, he believes CoinList's power could be a double-edged sword. It could serve as an important function as a gatekeeper of valid projects, but that then gives it a lot of power that could also fuel more speculation — “because CoinList listed it, I’ll invest in it” type thinking. Additionally, CoinList’s incentive will be to be more inclusive than exclusive “because they take a cut every time something is on the platform,” says Calrson-Wee, ""so if they have an incentive, it’s for inclusion rather than exclusion, but it depends if [they're] optimizing for short-term profits or long-term signal.”Still, both CoinList and SAFTS could be good antidotes to the problem of groups raising money before they have a product. It could get more groups to hold an ICO is held at the same time as the launch of the network, which, he says, “makes the crowdsale more about getting a piece of software instead of being an investor in a future piece of software."" To illustrate the dangers of raising a lot of money for an idea instead of a product, Carlson-Wee brought up the example of Clinkle, a startup that raised $30 million before it had a product and then disappeared two years later. (It also came up in my podcast on ICOs earlier this week.) “That was a great example of VC pile on,"" he says. ""'Look, this name is backing us,' and then another guy says, If they’re backing you, I’ll back you, and then the third guy says, If those two are backing you, I’ll definitely back you, and then fourth guy says, Wow, if those three are backing you, then how can I get in on this deal?” It's an example he likes in particular because, in its early days, his former employer Coinbase was constantly asked how it would compete against Clinkle. Coinbase now has 6.9 million customers and a valuation of $500.5 million."

We don't live in one paradigm at a time.","Jun 8, 2017,01:25pm EDT",Shutterstock,"When the iPhone launched in 2007, it was both the best phone the world had ever seen and Apple’s first phone. Dyson’s first ever Vacuum cleaner was the best ever vacuum ever made at launch. When Tony Faddell made Nest Lab's first Thermostat, it was also by far the best in class.From Tesla’s first ever car setting the standard for the entire car industry to Uber’s first Taxi business, to Amazon’s first attempt at Retail, to Donald Trump's first role in Politics being the leader of the free world, it seems that the real step changes in how things are done come from those who've never done it before.So have these companies succeeded changing the game despite a lack of experience, or because of it?How can Tesla with less than 10 years car experience make vehicles that accelerate faster than any other road car ever known, beating cars more than 10 times the price, with half the capacity and despite 10 times more experience making cars?A New Disruption Theory.What these companies and people have done is leverage the power of not knowing better. While businesses make incremental improvements, learn from others and their experiences, best practices and the past, insurgent companies have no such baggage and muscle memory from the past. My new theory for disruption is based on companies ( who unlike Jean Marie Dru's Disruption Theory) don't go against category norms, they just base their approach on brand new thinking and change the parameters that fixed the design process.My new disruption theory politely laughs in the face of Clayton Christensen's globally renowned, but intrinsically flawed idea that Disruption is about companies who undermine legacy players based on a new technology at a lower price point. A theory based on selected data from a narrow window of time, from the world of data storage technology and digger design around 40 years ago. A theory that fails to explain the iPhone, Uber, Tesla, Airbnb, Flatscreen TV's, Netflix, 3G and most of the world in which we live.Instead it's a theory based on the design process.Evolutionary Funnels.If you ask a person to draw anything on anything with any implement, they quickly freeze. If you ask a graphic designer to design a logo and give them nothing, they can't do anything. An architect with no brief or budget, a creative in an ad agency with no problem, it's all the same. I'm not the first to say that any design process needs constraints or parameters.Yet ask a group of people to draw a house and most homes look similar. We have in our heads a preconceived idea of what a home should look like. We make many assumptions that are not there. In a massively complex world we have to fight to make sense of, we can't continually challenge everything. We don't wake up in the morning unsure if we should accept gravity exists, it would be exhausting.So design follows an iterative process based on a brief that is guided by assumptions to continually refine a solution or design to an optimal result. Let's call this ( as it's rather Darwinian) an evolutionary funnel.Yet sometimes, the end result of that funnel is the best solution based on those criteria, but there is a better way to solve the same problem, but only when someone explores a solution with very different design assumptions.I believe what we witness is the leap from a world of possibilities to another, a leap from from one paradigm to another, an optimal solution based on a whole new world of thinking. This is a paradigm leap and it's the essence of disruption.The Paradigms of Personal Music.Personal Cassette Players.The first personal cassette players were massive, expensive, had terrible sound quality, skipped badly, offered awful battery life and best of all, didn’t even have a rewind function. We had to turn a tape over and fast forward or do the spinny thing with a pencil.Over a period of years, huge investments, many errors, commerical pressure and competition from other companies, everything got better.We got Dolby ( B, then C) , rechargeable batteries, rewind buttons, the size of the personal cassette player got little bigger than the cassette itself. The device got WAY cheaper. We even saw sports models with yellow plastic, people added radios, we got volume controls on the headphones. Life was good.The improvements came fast then slow, it got to a point where the improvements got smaller, it was easy to reduce the size initially but once barely bigger than a cassette tape, improvements were marginal.The CD EraThe very peak of Walkman design came as the the very worst personal CD player was made. It was huge, incredibly expensive, had awful battery life, it would skip all the time, the LCD display was tiny and had little information, it was the worst CD player ever, but still better than the Walkman.We’d made a paradigm leap, gone from ever smaller, incremental design improvements towards an increasingly easy to envision optimal goal, to a whole new canvas for design, where the end result wasn't clear.Over time we now had new criteria to optimize, new design constraints and new problems to solve. We could now skip tracks, get digital sound, batteries lasted longer and the device was far thinner, yet skipping remained an issue until antishock was developed.Notably all the criteria that once held back the Cassette player were different, the problems new and the expertise needed wildly different, laser engineers replaced electromagnetic sensor experts, Dolby engineers replaced people who knew about caching digital memory. Designers who loved slow, high torque motors now needed to know about fast spinning, low torque designs.The Worst MP3 Players.As Discmans became marvelously cheap, remarkably thin, far better than every music device ever made, music moved from physical discs to data, someone had a new idea. What if the storage device wasn't needed. What if we compressed music into MP3's?We jumped the paradigm of MP3 players, where once again all bets were off. New problems, no longer about battery power, but memory. Less about hardware design, more about software.The Streaming AgeAnd then again to Streaming, where no longer needed a musical player, just an app on Phone. We no longer needed to own music, we rented it, or never touched it.The Wrong AssumptionsAt every stage the new era demanded totally new assumptions, different thinking and a step change in performance was noted. Often the dominant player changed, the incumbent built on the expertise of the past, the insurgent wasn't bogged down by expertise.It’s happened in many forms, the era of VHS, the era of DVD, to the era of streaming on demand.The era of goods by horse, to goods by canal, to goods by railway and next largely by road.In high jumping all records tended towards one optimal goal until the Fosbury Flop changed everything.We've had it in money, shells, coins, notes, credit cards and now Apple pay, bitcoin, Venmo and more.We don't live in one paradigm at a time.But the most successful companies the world has ever seen, are typically the first in a new paradigm.From Facebook to Uber, Amazon to eBay, Skype to WeWork, Tesla to Nest, Dyson to Trump, what happens when you challenge things from scratch?So how would you build your business if you started it now?Knowing what you know about consumer behaviors, new expectations, the new possibilities that technology affords and the accelerating pace of change?I’m guessing many business would look rather different. Companies have good explanations for the way things are, it’s easy to see why startups have it easier, but do you think your customers care?Are explanations or excuses enough, or must you adapt, rebuild or die?Now not everything is changing, not all businesses face existential threats, but it’s certainly wise to be open to all change.Because some businesses only make sense in the next paradigm."

the ...","May 30, 2017,04:46pm EDT","There isn’t much that the Left and Right agree upon these days, but there is one thing that they seem to share: an increasing trend toward “federalism,” which, oddly enough, means that more policymaking should be done at the State level, rather than the Federal.","This was the original vision of the United States, and is still the basis of the U.S. Constitution although we spent the last century ignoring that. The enumerated powers of the Federal government were limited mostly to various aspects of foreign policy: the military, foreign trade, immigration and naturalization, and foreign relations. On the domestic side, the Federal government would enforce free trade between the States, preventing any State from erecting internal tariffs or barriers to travel. There were a few rules regarding what the States could do internally; basically, the Bill of Rights and subsequent Amendments. Besides that, the States could do just about whatever they wanted, within the confines of their own State constitutions, this privilege explicitly defined and protected by the Tenth Amendment.This was a radical vision for its day, when power was normally concentrated upon the monarchy and its administration. Over time, our government has become more and more monarchical, even if it is not an absolute monarchy like that of Louis XIV, but more like a Chinese emperor in the latter stages of the dynasty, when the monarch performs the duties of a ceremonial figurehead while the hidden mandarins run the show.For those with a proper education in these matters, these details are rudimentary. But, such people are rare. I would guess that most people on the Left didn’t know that for California to set up its own single-payer healthcare system is actually how its supposed to work in this country; and that many conservatives, who might oppose the idea on the Federal level, are actually quite comfortable letting California go right ahead and do it, as long as they pay for it themselves.For one thing, Californians might find out how much it costs, and then have some second thoughts. This is also how it is supposed to work.I’ve long expected that the present crisis era (if that is what it is) would result in the remaking of all the post-WWII institutions, all of which have become decrepit with age, obesity and gnawing corruption. This includes: Social Security and other retirement-related systems including private pensions, the combination of state-provided and employer-provided healthcare that emerged after WWII, the postwar university, the welfare state in general, the size of government as a percentage of GDP, the tax system, the dollar-centric world monetary system, the Federal Reserve (which did not exist before 1913, and did not have a monopoly on U.S. currency creation until 1940), the K-12 educational system, the CIA, the permanent globe-spanning military, the low-density automobile-dependent suburb, the major media, various forms of the War on Drugs, the hypertrophied finance industry, the use of Russia as an all-purpose bogeyman, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations, and most any other institution you could name.During the crisis era, the new forms and institutions can begin to make their appearance, without yet becoming dominant. Social Security, which became operational in 1937, was almost irrelevant at first. It looks to me like Federalism – returning the Federal government to more like its original role, and consequently empowering the States – could be a part of this new order. It is just bubbling up these days, like marijuana legalization, homeschooling, a return to urban centers, and Bitcoin.Anyway, the original Federalism should be part of our future. For one thing, a much smaller Federal government would be much cheaper – small enough to be paid for with a modest flat income tax (without Federal payroll taxes), or, if we are bold enough to repeal the Sixteenth Amendment, some kind of indirect tax such as a national sales tax or tariff. In 1910, the Federal government’s primary revenue sources were tariffs and excise taxes on things like alcohol. There was no income tax.That is not very feasible today. Arguments for a return to that indirect-taxes-only model (such as the “fair tax”) have stumbled on the fact that the Federal government’s present revenue needs make any such tax system into a caricature. However, a much smaller Federal government could once again sustain itself in this way.I would like to see all sorts of domestic policy devolved back to the States, and the Federal government return toward its original role primarily as an agent of foreign affairs. Oddly enough, the big-government Left might like this plan too, as it allows that relatively small number of metropolitan coastal Blue Counties to do as they please. We would still have Big Government, but it would be contained.As it turns out, states like California and New York have the same big-city Blue and rural Red split as the U.S. as a whole. But, dissatisfied conservative New Yorkers or Californians could easily move to Texas or New Hampshire, choosing with their feet among fifty competing visions of government.On a more practical basis, today’s wildly different values might drive a push towards Federalism as an alternative to outright secessionist movements. The idea of having California secede might seem like a joke until you think of the real consequences of having the West Coast of North America home to a foreign country, possibly with communist tendencies and allegiances, possibly hostile, and possibly nuclear-armed. "

bitcoin ...","May 14, 2017,03:33pm EDT",Shutterstock,"Henry Thoreau once argued that “what a man thinks of himself, that it is which determines, or rather indicates, his fate.” In reality, however, our self-views are relatively inconsequential, particularly compared to what other people think of us. Indeed, although conceptions of talent have changed over the past few centuries, shifting focus from formal qualifications and knowledge to general intelligence, learning potential, and people-skills, a constant factor has been that our careers and personal success have always depended on what other people make of us. In other words, reputation is king.And yet, most people seem remarkably negligent about their reputation. Recent evidence points to our careless online behaviors, from our overindulgence in inappropriate self-disclosure on social media, to our naive understanding of data privacy. Unless you have a very common name, or are paranoid, snapshots of your digital self will be available to the wider public, including recruiters, employers, and potential romantic partners. There is of course an enormous amount of variability in both the depth and accessibility of people’s online reputation, but it is increasingly difficult for everyone to control their digital selves, which explains why so many people have simply stopped trying – or at least they appear to have.Watch on Forbes:That said, most people’s reputation is still predominantly determined by what they do offline rather than online. From high-stake performance instances, such as job interviews, client pitches, and critical work projects, to everyday patterns, such as the way we work, relax, and interact with others, our reputation is the working model of our personality others use to make sense of our habits and predict what we are likely to do. Note that when those “others” are individuals with sufficient power and influence to affect our future, it is quite irrelevant whether they are actually right in their views of us. This can work in our favor, as when others think more highly of us than they should; or against us, when they underestimate our talents. Yet, we have a foolish tendency to assess the validity of other people’s opinions of us by their closeness to our own opinions of ourselves, as if our self-views where the ultimate yardstick for our reputation. This egocentric approach to understanding who we are is an unconscious attempt to maintaining a positive self-concept at the expense of coming to terms with reality. It leads to narcissistic and deluded self-views that widen the gap between our fantasized talents and the talents others think we have.In line, here are four bitter facts you should digest about your reputation:• It is probably not what you think: Most people are unaware of their reputation, not least because they pay little attention to what others think of them. Convergence between self- and other-ratings in 360-degree feedback surveys is typically modest, though there is generally high inter-rater agreement in other people’s views of the evaluated candidate. Importantly, high-performing employees (and leaders) tend to be more aware of their reputation, which suggests that it does pay off to know what other people think of you. Historically, we have tended to think of self-awareness as a sort of deep introspection on a metaphysical quest to unveil our true self. A more pragmatic and consequential view of self-awareness, however, would define it in terms of our ability to understand how others see us. In other words, to be self-aware is to know how you impact on others, which makes self-awareness essentially about other-awareness, and interpersonal rather than intrapersonal.• You are probably not that interested in it: Most people are only partly interested in their reputation – they love to hear about its bright side, but are rather skilled at ignoring its dark side. Indeed, the human capacity for self-deception is unrivaled, particularly in men (women are somewhat less capable, and they are oddly punished for it). Our brains seem equipped with a default mechanism for filtering out unpleasant facts about ourselves while exaggerating even the slightest compliment: we are our own best propaganda machine, but only because we are also our own main audience. This is why you are reluctant to seek feedback from people who criticize you. It is also why you love hanging out with your friends, family, and closest work colleagues: they validate your self-views by adhering to a version of your reputation that is overwhelmingly positive, perhaps even better than the version of you you would like to see yourself. That does not necessarily mean they are being genuine, but at least they like you enough to pretend that you are great.• It takes ages to change: People are quick to make up their mind about our reputation, and it takes a great deal of time and effort to change those views. Likewise, once our reputation solidifies we will need an enormous amount of dedication and persistence to create a new reputation, and the sediments of our past reputation will always remain. Consider the case of Bill Gates, who has been exceptionally effective at reshaping his reputation (and public persona) through the years. He began his meteoric career rise as one of the first famous case studies of a college dropout geek turned tech entrepreneur. Yet this nerdy innocent image quickly morphed into that of a ruthless business tycoon capable of engaging in all sorts of tactics to beat his competitors and preserve a monopoly that turned him into the richest man in the world. Unhappy about this reputation, the last decade saw Gates going to great lengths to clean-up his negative image, but becoming the biggest philanthropist in the world is not enough to erase his reputational scars. By the same token, organizations pay a high price for their PR fiascos because no amount of social corporate responsibility or charity work is enough to cover up for inappropriate past behaviors — unless they have not been found out. However, whereas it is hard to change a bad reputation, even the best reputation can be ruined in a heartbeat — think Tiger Woods or Lance Armstrong. As Bill Gates’ friend Warren Buffet noted: ""It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you'll do things differently.""Sign up here to get top career advice delivered straight to your inbox every week.• It is the best measure of your talent: Reputation is the bitcoin for talent. From the badges you proudly advertise on your LinkedIn profile, to the number of people that perceive you as capable, and your public career track record, you are only as talented as other people think. And, with the exception of a minority of candidates who may be accurately described as hidden gems or underrated talents, that is less talent than you probably think you have. There is of course little point in being more talented than other people think unless you can actually persuade them that they are wrong, so your reputation is still the definitive measure of your talent, as well as a major constrain to your potential. The good news is that being aware of your reputation will help you harness your potential, if you can find the right career niche that turns your reputation into an asset. Reputation is largely a reflection of your personality – how other people perceive it — and talent is largely personality in the right place. Find a job that is a good fit for your natural habits and preferred behavioral tendencies — one that requires the qualities that other people think you’ve got — and you will be more likely to succeed.Finally, one of the positive consequences of living in a reputation economy is that it is now easier than ever to find out what others think of us. E-mails and other technologically-mediated communication forms make it pretty painless to request critical feedback from others, especially compared to face-to-face conversations. A quick google search will reveal the main fragments of our public persona, which is precisely what others will access when they are trying to decipher your reputation. Finally, if you are an active social media user you will be able to get feedback on everything you post and say online, though most negative feedback is either suppressed or disguised as no feedback. Unsurprisingly, machine learning algorithms can translate Facebook activity into a personality profile.Yet we don’t need technology to understand our reputation. In fact, there is no better way to come to terms with our career reputation than asking experts in our field to give us brutally honest feedback about our achievements, or getting smart and critical work colleagues to tell us where our strengths and weaknesses are. Thus the best mentor is someone who carefully monitors our reputation and helps us curate it to reflect the best possible version of ourselves, even if a great deal of distortion is needed."

Disclosure: I own some bitcoin ...","May 5, 2017,05:12pm EDT","An employee puts tires onto bicycle rims at the Worksman Cycles production facility in Queens, New... [+] York.","The heart of American manufacturing is in the Midwest, but that doesn’t mean it's the best place to find manufacturing jobs today. Professional networking site LinkedIn released a workforce report this week showing a more severe manufacturing skills gap in coastal cities relative to middle American metro areas.  In places like Detroit, Cleveland and Indianapolis, LinkedIn saw that the supply of manufacturing skills exceeded the demand. Many workers in these regions know lean manufacturing, quality management and supply-chain management. These cities have had manufacturing as a core sector for a long time, so many local workers already have manufacturing expertise. That wouldn't be a problem if the cities weren't shrinking, says LinkedIn economist Guy Berger. Skills supply remains high, but demand for manufacturing jobs has declined.Cities like San Francisco, New York, Miami, and Washington, D.C., have a more pronounced skills gap in manufacturing. Berger says these coastal cities attract people who work in other sectors such as technology and politics, leaving peripheral industries like manufacturing with a worker shortage.In LinkedIn’s data, the greater New York area showed a manufacturing skills gap in semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and consumer goods. And the most in-demand roles were in operations, engineering and quality assurance. Miquela Craytor, director of industrial policy at the New York City Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit that supports workforce development, has observed strong demand for manufacturing talent. She says a big challenge is that different manufacturing sectors require unique skills that aren’t necessarily transferable from one company to another, so new employees often have to be trained on the job. Sign up here to get top career advice delivered straight to your inbox every week.“There’s an intense pressure to adopt new forms of technology,” Craytor adds. “Our equipment is getting smarter and more advanced.” For example, Lee Spring is a Brooklyn-based manufacturer with nearly 160 employees that uses sophisticated equipment to make springs. The work requires both technical skills and an extreme attention to detail. For anyone interested in manufacturing, Craytor recommends paying close attention to science, technology, engineering and math education programs. Some communities have opened “maker spaces” where people can experiment with creating new objects, ranging from robots to clothing. “Think of it as an upgraded version of a shop class, but more inclusive to people of all shapes and sizes,” she says. Technical skills are important—Craytor notes that knowledge of CAD software, often used in architectural design and structural engineering, is valuable. But you don’t have to like coding to excel in manufacturing. There’s strong demand for quality assurance positions, which involve reviewing products to ensure they were made properly. Manufacturing companies also need talent in traditional business roles like sales, marketing and finance. "

bitcoin -- so that payments are safe, fast, and efficient for both you ...","May 27, 2017,08:00am EDT","As a business owner, invoicing may seem like a tedious, straight forward task that doesn’t require your full attention. But, it’s absolutely crucial if you want your business to maintain a positive cash flow.","Even if you realize this fact, simply sending your clients or customers an invoice informing them that they owe you a specific amount of money is ineffective and unprofessional. But, that, along with the following 25 mistakes, happen frequently.To ensure that you get compensated for your goods or services on time, you need to prevent these mistakes.Obvious? Sure. But invoicing can sometimes slip the minds of business because they’re so busy. There are even some circumstances when a business owner doesn’t send out a bill.Maybe they have a deal in place with a client or customer so they assume the client will automatically compensate them for their products or services.Remember, it’s your responsibility to send out an invoice. Make invoicing a priority so that you don’t forget.The best time to send out an invoice is immediately following the completion of a project or a sale. Unless you have another financial arrangement with your clients or customers, you can’t afford to wait to send out an invoice.We’ve actually found that when you invoice the same day that the job is completed (as opposed to waiting two-plus weeks for your billing cycle) you are almost 1.5x more likely to get paid!Even if you’ve made invoicing a priority and send them out immediately or frequently, there will be times when the client misses the due date because they misplaced the invoice, simply forgot about it, or are just deadbeats.Like sending invoices in the first place, this is your responsibility to follow-up on unpaid invoices. Contact the client immediately to find out what’s going on and use invoicing software that send out automated reminders.If the client is unresponsive, you may have to take steps like taking them to small claims court or having a collection agency chase down the payment for you.Avoid using vague language when writing out an invoice. If you want the client to pay the invoice quickly, make sure that you include clearly stated item descriptions, prices and quantities. Avoid any ambiguous language or descriptions.If your clients also need to clearly understand when the payment is due by using ‘Days’ instead of ‘Net,’ as well as the consequences if these terms are broken.Here’s some killer words of wisdom from Sir Richard Branson, “In an ideal world, a handshake would be all that an entrepreneur or executive needs to seal a deal with a business partner.” However, since it’s not uncommon for business conditions to change, because of the economy or consumer tastes, it’s in your best interest to have a signed contract to protect you from getting played instead of getting paid.Having your clients sign a simple contract ensures that both parties are protected and are on the same page when it comes to payments. As Branson notes, “By all means, shake hands on a deal, but then make sure to ask your lawyers to record the details. It could be the best bill you ever pay!”Just because you agreed on a project, sale, and payment terms with an individual doesn’t mean that they’re going to be the ones responsible for paying the invoice.After all, they could have an entirely different department or have hired an outside party to handle billing. Even worse? Billing the wrong client altogether. It’s embarrassing, unprofessional, and could sever the relationship with that client.Prior to sending out an invoice always make sure that you’re sending it to the right person or individual so that you can bill them directly.In order to prevent any misunderstandings, your invoice should always include the following information:Always make sure to include the following details on any invoice you send out:Speaking of itemization, every one of your invoices should include an explanation of each charge, such as hourly rate, expenses, or the flat fee for a project.How you itemize your invoices will vary depending on your business, but it’s an essential component of invoicing if you want to get paid on time since it will let your clients know exactly what they’re paying for.A numbering system makes it easier to track and manage your invoices bills, like which invoices have paid and which ones are still pending, and prevents you from sending duplicates.Additionally, a numbering system, makes it easier to locate a bill if you ever have the unfortunate event of getting audited.What happens if your computer crashes or is damaged and you haven’t backed up all of its data? You’re in a pickle, to say the least.Like all of your other vital documents, make sure that your invoices are backed-up and stored on the cloud so that they can be easily retrieved. Thankfully, most invoicing software systems do this automatically for you.Not all all surprises are pleasant. In fact, one of the worst invoicing mistakes that you could make is sending a client an invoice that contains undiscussed or additional fees. This could lead to confusion or even distrust.Explain each and every charge to your clients prior to starting a project so that they aren’t surprised when they review the invoice.Late interest fees can create a sense of urgency among your clients since it notifies them that if the invoice isn’t paid by the due date there will be consequences.Make sure that this is discussed upfront and is included in your payment terms.At the same time you should encourage your customers to pay the invoice on time or, even better, ahead of schedule.This can can be done by offering them a discount if they pay the bill before it’s due. Other incentives could be gift cards or credits or if they pay early.Spelling errors, incorrect dollar amounts, and generic formatting can make your business look sloppy and unprofessional. As if that wasn’t enough, this can also prevent you from receiving the correct payment on time.Always double check your invoices so that you can catch mistakes before the invoice is sent out.If you want to get paid on time, then you need to make is as easy as possible for your clients and customers to pay you. Consider using a variety of payment options from credit card processing, to direct bank deposits and checks.Thankfully even more options are opening up, such as cryptocurrencies like bitcoin -- so that payments are safe, fast, and efficient for both you and your customers.Did you know that you’re 3x more likely to get paid if you add a company logo to your invoice? That’s because a logo establishes your company as a professional and established brand and differentiates you from the other invoices that your client’s are receiving. It also serves as a good branding opportunity.Besides your logo, make sure that you use colors, fonts, and templates that mirror your brand.While the main goal of your invoices is to get paid, invoices can also be used as a marketing tool that can can increase your revenue.When you send out an invoice don’t be afraid to include marketing materials, such as flyers or email newsletters. Discounts for future work or products and referral incentives work well.Asking for testimonials or recommendations or showing a short testimonial on the invoice is good advertising.Being polite, like adding phrases like “please pay your invoice within 21 days” or “thank you for your business,” can increase the percentage of your invoices getting paid by more than 5 percent!That may not sound like that big of a deal, but that could potentially equal thousands of dollars per year into your bank account.As an additional perk, being polite can also improve your brand’s image.If you give customers too much time to make a payment, then it’s obviously going to take longer for you to get compensated.For example, if you give a customer 45 days to pay an invoice, and that customer pays you two weeks after the due, then that means you’ve waited two months to receive that payment.It’s the norm to have a payment term of 30 days or less, however, make sure that you review your industry’s invoice standards, along with asking the client when their pay cycle runs, in order to establish your payment terms.Speaking of your client’s pay cycle, your clients have set their own payment procedures. For example, they may pay their bills only on the first of every month, which means that even if you send them weekly invoices they won’t be paying those invoices until the first.Ask your customers when their pay cycle so that you can sync their cycle with your own so that you know when to bill them.Although you’ve established payment terms, and you need to stick to them. Then if needed, you can offer a little wiggle room.For instance, you may want to set-up a monthly payment plan instead of asking for the payment in full if the client doesn’t have the money to pay the full amount of the bill by the due date.Providing warranties and guarantees helps make your business appear more legit and credible. It also gives the customer peace of mind.If you do offer a guarantee or warranty, make sure that is clearly mentioned in your terms and conditions.You should also discuss any possible situations where the client/customer loses this warranty or guarantee.This is a big no-no. In fact, storing your customer’s credit card numbers violates PCI-DSS regulations. Working with a trusted and reputable payment processing vendor eliminates this temptation.Are you in need of cash fast? Then invoice factoring is a popular option where you sell unpaid invoices to an invoice factoring company in exchange for cash.In most cases, you’ll receive 80 percent of the invoice amount immediately and 20 percent (minus fees) when the invoice is paid-in-full.While this can be a life-saving option when you’re cash strapped, many businesses fail to fully understand invoice factoring.Before going this route, make sure that you’re aware of the fees that you’ll have to pay, not meeting the minimum requirements, submitting a bad application, and trying to submit invoices from habitually late paying clients.Finally, there’s no longer an excuse to use a paper-based invoicing system. Switching to a cloud-based system will save you money on postage, paper, and ink -- it's faster and will save a tree or two.Additionally, it will speed up the payment process since invoices are sent and received electronically and it’s easier to track and manage your invoices.Still not convinced? Cloud-based invoicing systems will automate the invoicing process by allowing you to set-up recurring payments, sending out payment reminders, and backing-up your invoices on the cloud."

He's already on the FBI's Most Wanted list.,"Alexsey Belan is a wily character, if the stories are to be believed.In 2013, after an arrest warrant was put out by the United States, the auburn-haired, blue-eyed 29-year-old Latvian managed to escape from his hideout in Europe, believed to have been in Greece, sources familiar with the matter told Forbes. That came after American law enforcement called for international assistance in apprehending someone they believed to have carried out attacks on two major e-commerce sites. No one knows exactly how or when he escaped and made it back into the protective arms of Russia.As a result of his escapades, the FBI put out a $100,000 reward for anyone who could help arrest him. There was also an Interpol Red Notice, demanding his apprehension if he was spotted by law enforcement in any country, whether in one of his journeys to the homeland of Latvia, or his sojourns in the Maldives or Thailand.He was never caught. And earlier this week, he was indicted for one of the biggest hacks ever, the 2014 breach of Yahoo in which the attackers stole information on 500 million accounts. And in that indictment, the U.S. government alleged he did so at the behest of the FSB, Russia's national law enforcement agency.Belan was an obvious recruit for Russia's clandestine online operations, according to security experts who've monitored his various web personas, as named on his FBI Most Wanted page: M4G, Magg, Fedyunya and Quarker. From M4G in particular, it appears Belan moved quickly from teenage hijinks to becoming one of the more adept website hackers working across the Russian cybercrime underworld, researchers told Forbes. Who is Belan?Belan's alleged monikers were active since at least 2006, when he was aged just 18. From 2007 onwards, the M4G alias associated with Belan was gaining a reputation across hacker forums and comms channels like InsidePro and Zloy, while blogging on his own site, M4G.RU, though archived posts reveal no obvious illicit activity.But the M4G name is linked to multiple breaches. In his early days, M4G focused on websites related to ICQ communications, said Vitali Kremez, director of research at cybercrime intelligence provider Flashpoint. Those sites included uinshop.com, nomerkov.net and uinzz.com. Another of his targets, lordmancer.ru, was a massively multiplayer game, Kremez added. And a screenshot from a hacking forum on which M4G posted also indicated he'd acquired data from Tjat.com, a cloud computing supplier based in Israel. (The named targets hand't responded to request for comment at the time of publication).The M4G alias associated with Belan posts on an underground hacking forum about target Tjat.com.Another source, who wished to remain anonymous, said Belan's alleged personas were also associated with breaches at a number of major sites across Russia and the old Soviet Block. They included Ukrainian entertainment website Bigmir.net, and one of Russia's biggest search engines and web portals Rambler.ru, which admitted to a 2014 breach last year in which records on 98 million accounts were stolen. (Neither company had responded to requests for comment). All of those hacks boosted his reputation in the darker corners of the web, the sources said.M4G was a collaborative player too, often requesting services to crack hashes of passwords he'd stolen. (Hashes are cryptographic representations of plaintext that can be ""cracked"" by computers running a large number of guesses at rapid speed, putting each through a hashing algorithm until a match has been found). He's been seen selling credit card data, ICQ accounts he'd hacked, and data from a number of breached forums too, said Kremez.A post on a hacker forum from M4G, a moniker the DOJ associated with Alexsey Belan. M4G is seen here... [+] asking someone to crack passwords he'd acquired.By 2011, the M4G name had built a reputation as an adept web app hacker, breaching a large number of website, with a specialty in breaching WordPress sites. ""He's definitely on the radar of the most sophisticated hackers we’ve seen,"" said Kremez.An escape to and from GreeceIn 2012 and 2013, U.S. authorities filed indictments against Belan for attacks on three unnamed American e-commerce companies. According to the New York Times, Belan was previously indicted in 2012 for a breach of Amazon-owned shoe retailer Zappos, and in 2013 for attacks on Evernote and Scribd. Sources told Forbes Belan was also linked to hacks of companies in the U.S. online healthcare insurance market.At that time, Belan was living in Greece, sources familiar with his activities told Forbes, and it's believed that's where he was apprehended in 2013. It's unclear for what specific crime he was arrested, or how he escaped.By 2014, much of his attention turned to Yahoo, according to the Department of Justice indictment. Far more than co-defendant Karim Baratov, he helped two FSB agents - Dmitry Dokuchaev and Igor Sushchin - acquire access to a large number of Yahoo accounts belonging to targets of interest to Russian intelligence, the DOJ claimed. They included: the former Minister of Economic Development of a country bordering Russia, a diplomat from another bordering nation, an investigative reporter who worked for Russian publication Kommersant Daily, employees of a U.S. cloud storage company, a Nevada gaming official, a senior officer of a major U.S. airline, a managing director of a U.S. private equity firm, and 14 members of staff at a Swiss Bitcoin wallet provider, amongst many others.Belan was lining his own pockets at the same time, prosecutors alleged, and had one particularly devilish scheme in November 2014 when he manipulated Yahoo search algorithms so that anyone looking for erectile dysfunction treatments would be presented with his own links to an online pharmacy company. That firm would then pay Belan a commission for driving traffic to the site.From March 2015, he also used his technical finesse honed during those early years to craft access cookies that allowed him into an astonishing 30 million Yahoo accounts, the U.S. said. He then rummaged through victims' contacts to spam them, according to the charges, while also searching for credit card data.Most Wanted hackersThe only comparable hacker, said Kremez, was another alleged cybercrime kingpin: Evgeniy Bogachev. He's believed to have the protection of the Russian government too. Despite being accused of running a massive malware operation that caused as much as $100 million in damage to U.S. organizations, he continues to live out his days as a free man in a town near the Black Sea, according to law enforcement officials and security companies with knowledge of his activities.Both Bogachev and Belan were on the list of President Obama's sanctions following the hacks of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and multiple other organizations involved in the 2016 election, allegedly sponsored by the Kremlin. As reported by Forbes  in 2015, Bogachev was also associated with Russian cyberespionage activity focused on the U.S., Georgia and Ukraine.Evgeniy Bogachev is one of the FBI's Most Wanted and found his way onto American sanctions of... [+] Russian individuals and entities following the U.S. election hacks of 2016.No one is telling where Belan might be enjoying the good life. According to the DoJ indictment released last week, he's receiving intelligence from the FSB that's helping him avoid the watchful eyes of Western agencies.Emails to addresses associated with Belan's alleged online aliases - quarker@bk.ru and moy_yawik@bk.ru - received no reply."

AFP / Manjunath KIRAN/Getty Images,"My friend Raoul Pal, mastermind of Global Macro Investor, writes one of the most expensive macroeconomic letters in the world. His subscriber list is short and extremely exclusive.Raul comes up with more unique ideas per year than any man I know. What’s fascinating is that once he comes up with an idea, you then begin to see it filtering into the trading/hedge fund community.So when Raul has something to say, my ears perk up. And when he leads off a piece this way, I am ALL ears: “I’m going to blow your mind with this following article. My mind is still reeling from my discovery and from writing this piece.”Turns out he’s talking about India. And more specifically, he says that recent advances in that nation's technological infrastructure leave the rest of the world far behind.And Raoul wastes no time in telling us the implications of this development:India is now the most attractive major investment opportunity in the world.That’s quite a statement. So rather than tease his insight, I’ll just let Raoul make his case.IndiaBy Raoul PalI’m going to blow your mind with this following article. My mind is still reeling from my discovery and from writing this piece.Let me enlighten you...Companies that create massively outsized technological breakthroughs tend to capture the investing population’s attention and thus their share prices trade at huge multiples, as future growth and future revenues are extrapolated into the future.From time to time, entire countries re-model their economies and shift their growth trajectory. The most recent example was the liberalisation of China’s economy and massive spending on infrastructure, which together created an incredibly powerful force for growth over the last two decades.But it is very rare indeed that a country develops an outsized technological infrastructure breakthrough that leaves the rest of the world far behind.But exactly this has just happened in India... and no one noticed.India has, without question, made the largest technological breakthrough of any nation in living memory.Its technological advancement has even left Silicon Valley standing. India has built the world’s first national digital infrastructure, leaping at least two generations of financial technologies and has built something as important as the railroad was to the UK or the interstate highways were to the U.S.India is now the most attractive major investment opportunity in the world.It’s all about something called Aadhaar and a breathtakingly ambitious plan with flawless execution.What just blows my mind is how few people have even noticed it. To be honest, writing the article last month was the first time I learned about any of the developments. I think this is the biggest emerging market macro story in the world.Phase 1 – The Aadhaar ActIndia, pre-2009, had a massive problem for a developing economy: nearly half of its people did not have any form of identification. If you were born outside of a hospital or without any government services, which is common in India, you don’t get a birth certificate. Without a birth certificate, you can’t get the basic infrastructure of modern life: a bank account, driving license, insurance or a loan. You operate outside the official sector and the opportunities available to others are not available to you. It almost guarantees a perpetuation of poverty and it also guarantees a low tax take for India, thus it holds Indian growth back too.Normally, a country such as India would solve this problem by making a large push to register more births or send bureaucrats into villages to issues official papers (and sadly accept bribes in return). It would have been costly, inefficient and messy. It probably would have only partially worked.But in 2009, India did something that no one else in the world at the time had done before; they launched a project called Aadhaar which was a technological solution to the problem, creating a biometric database based on a 12-digit digital identity, authenticated by finger prints and retina scans.Aadhaar became the largest and most successful IT project ever undertaken in the world and, as of 2016, 1.1 billion people (95% of the population) now has a digital proof of identity. To understand the scale of what India has achieved with Aadhaar you have to understand that India accounts for 17.2% of the entire world’s population!But this biometric database was just the first phase...Phase 2 – Banking AdoptionOnce huge swathes of the population began to register on the official system, the next phase was to get them into the banking system. The Government allowed the creation of eleven Payment Banks, which can hold money but don’t do any lending. To motivate people to open accounts, it offered free life insurance with them and linked bank accounts to social welfare benefits. Within three years more than 270 million bank accounts were opened and $10bn in deposits flooded in.People who registered under the Aadhaar Act could open a bank account just with their Aadhaar number.Phase 3 – Building Out a Mobile InfrastructureThe Aadhaar card holds another important benefit – people can use it to instantly open a mobile phone account. I covered this in detail last month but the key takeaway is that mobile phone penetration exploded after Aadhaar and went from 40% of the population to 79% within a few years...The next phase in the mobile phone story will be the rapid rise in smart phones, which will revolutionise everything. Currently only 28% of the population has a smart phone but growth rates are close to 70% per year.In July 2016, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), which administers Aadhaar, called a meeting with executives from Google, Microsoft, Samsung and Indian smartphone maker Micromax amongst others, to talk about developing Aadhaar compliant devices.Qualcomm is working closely with government authorities to get more Aadhaar-enabled devices onto the market and working with customers – including the biggest Android manufacturers – to integrate required features, such as secure cameras and iris authentication partners.Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, recently singled out India as a top priority for Apple.Microsoft has also just launched a lite version of Skype designed to work on an unstable 2G connection and is integrated with the Aadhaar database, so video calling can be used for authenticated calls.This rise in smart, Aadhaar compliant mobile phone penetration set the stage for the really clever stuff...Phase 4 – UPI – A New Transaction SystemBut that is not all. In December 30th 2016, Indian launched BHIM (Bharat Interface for Money) which is a digital payments platform using UPI (Unified Payments Interface). This is another giant leap that allows non-UPI linked bank accounts into the payments system. Now payments can be made from UPI accounts to non-UPI accounts and can use QR codes for instant payments and also allows users to check bank balances.While the world is digesting all of this, assuming that it is going to lead to an explosion in mobile phone eWallets (which is happening already), the next step is materializing. This is where the really big breakthrough lies...Payments can now be made without using mobile phones, just using fingerprints and an Aadhaar number.Fucking hell. That is the biggest change to any financial system in history.What is even more remarkable is that this system works on a 2G network so it reaches even the most remote parts of India!! It will revolutionise the agricultural economy, which employs 60% of the workforce and contributes 17% of GDP. Farmers will now have access to bank accounts and credit, along with crop insurance.But again, that is not all... India has gone one step further...Phase 5 – India Stack – A Digital LifeIn 2016, India introduced another innovation called India Stack. This is a series of secured and connected systems that allows people to store and share personal data such as addresses, bank statements, medical records, employment records and tax filings and it enables the digital signing of documents. This is all accessed, and can be shared, via Aadhaar biometric authentication.Essentially, it is a secure Dropbox for your entire official life and creates what is known as eKYC: Electronic Know Your Customer.Using India Stack APIs, all that is required is a fingerprint or retina scan to open a bank account, mobile phone account, brokerage account, buy a mutual fund or share medical records at any hospital or clinic in India. It also creates the opportunity instant loans and brings insurance to the masses, particularly life insurance. All of this data can also in turn be stored on India Stack to give, for example, proof of utility bill payment or life insurance coverage.What is India Stack exactly?India Stack is the framework that will make the new digital economy work seamlessly.It’s a set of APIs that allows governments, businesses, startups and developers to utilise a unique digital infrastructure to solve India’s hard problems towards presence-less, paperless and cashless service delivery.India Stack provides the ability to operate in real time, transactions such as lending, bank or mobile account opening that usually can take few days to complete are now instant.As you can see, Smart phones will act as key to access the kingdom.This is fast, secure and reliable; this is the future...This revolutionary digital infrastructure will soon be able to process billions more transactions than bitcoin ever has. It may well be a bitcoin killer or at best provide the framework for how blockchain technology could be applied in the real world. It is too early to tell whether other countries or the private sector adopts blockchain versions of this infrastructure or abandons it altogether and follows India’s centralised version.India Stack is the largest open API in the world and will allow for massive fintech opportunities to be built around it. India is already the third largest fintech centre but it will jump into first place in a few years. India is already organizing hackathons to develop applications for the APIs.It has left Silicon Valley in the dust.Phase 6 – A Cash BanThe final stroke of genius was the cash ban, which I have also discussed at length in the past. The cash ban is the final part of the story. It simply forces everyone into the new digital economy and has the hugely beneficial side-effect of reducing everyday corruption, recapitalising the banking sector and increasing government tax take, thus allowing India to rebuild its crumbling infrastructure...India was a cash society but once the dust settles, cash will account for less than 40% of total transactions in the next five years. It may eliminate cash altogether in the next ten years.The cash ban digitizes India. No other economy in the world is even close to this.Phase 7 – The Investment OpportunityEveryone thinks they know about the Indian economy – crappy infrastructure, corruption, bureaucracy and antiquated institutions but with a massively growing middle class. Well, that is the narrative and has been for the last 15 years.But that phase is over and no one noticed. So few people in the investment community or even Silicon Valley are even vaguely aware of what has happened in India and that has created an enormous investment opportunity.The future for India is massive technological advancement, a higher trend rate of GDP and more tax revenues. Tax revenues will fund infrastructure – ports, roads, rail and healthcare. Technology will increase agricultural productivity, online services and manufacturing productivity.Telecom, banking, insurance and online retailing will boom, as will the tech sector.Nothing in India will be the same again.FDI is already exploding and will rise massively in the years ahead as technology giants and others pour into India to take advantage of the opportunity...I am long the telco sector (Bharti)...And I am long the Nifty Banks Index...I think India is going to offer an entire world of opportunity going forwards.If I can sum up, it’s in this one chart: the SENSEX in US Dollars. It looks explosive for the next 10 years...Incredible India indeed.***Hot off the press***I decided to test the waters on Twitter on Sunday and Monday to find out how many non-Indians were aware of India Stack/Aadhaar. I have 24,000 followers on Twitter, many of which are you guys, and hosts of others heavily engaged in financial markets i.e. it’s a decent data sample.In the 12 hours since the survey began, around 900 people have responded. It appears that 90% of the investment world knows absolutely nothing about the biggest IT project ever accomplished and have never even heard of it.Now, that is an informational edge.Every week I highlight a well-researched, controversial essay from a fellow economic expert. Get the newsletter free in your inbox"

cryptoland and discovered that all in not as it seems, yet it is 
spectacular.","May 23, 2017,04:08pm EDT",There’s a stereotype about women being dramatic schemers that’s as pervasive as it is idiotic. The never-ending war of office politics transcends gender lines. We need to move away from Mean Girls and re-channel our energy into cooperation and mentorship – so we can all get ahead.,"For Wunderman Health CEO Becky Chidester, the answer isn’t to crush our competitive energy, but to work together so we can go farther. Overseeing a division of Wunderman, a company with a 7,000-person workforce total, with the kind of office drama those numbers bring, sounds daunting, but after hearing a friend of mine who works at Wunderman sing the praises of the ecosystem to encourage and support and mutual success, I put aside my skepticism and went to find out more from the woman herself.CEO of Wunderman Health (Courtesy of Wunderman Health)Leah Wald: What does empowering women in business look like to you? How do you foster that vision at the individual and organizational levels?Becky Chidester [CEO of Wunderman Health]: Women will only rise by claiming leadership positions – both by empowering ourselves and by using our influence to empower the women around us.It’s terrific that more organizations are prioritizing gender equality and key that women take this opportunity to spearhead initiatives to drive this change within their organizations. Many women have not made career development plans or mapped out their career goals so coaching and self-development programs can have a huge impact. As we empower more women to embrace their potential, they must, and I believe will, in turn, exert their own influence to help other women reach theirs, creating waves of change through organizations and industries.Wald: How do you encourage women to take the risks needed to get to the success they want?Chidester: First, women need to hear how others have successfully overcome challenges and fears and found ways to balance careers with commitments to family. We need to be honest about this journey and the struggle, feeling confident sharing the disappointments and failures along with the joys and successes.Second, we must identify ways to personally advance the women around us. Beyond encouragement, we should find ways to support them in their roles and push them beyond their comfort zones. In the case of individuals on your team, perhaps this means proactively challenging them with increasingly bigger and higher-visibility assignments. Or helping to ensure they receive credit for their work at a higher level.Finally, let’s be strategic in how we help others. Stretching a person beyond their comfort zone does not mean pushing them into roles not suited for them. The goal is to help women understand their strengths and advance through the right roles. In many companies, there are traditional avenues for advancement. If these roles are not in line with a talented individual’s skills, define a new role that will stretch them around their strengths.Wald: Why is it important that it's women helping women in the workplace as opposed to just anyone? What are the extra incentives to approach it that way?Chidester: As women, we are in the best positions to help other women, sharing personal experiences and what has worked for us. And when we do not, we continue the negative stereotypes that hold us all back.Also, women championing women will enlighten organizations to different styles of working. Women do approach problems differently and we present ourselves with a female voice.Wald: What would you consider the one or two key things to keep in mind for other women who want to carry your mission forward in their own organizations and support more women achieving their professional goals?Chidester: Claim your success and be conscious of your brand. Often, women get caught in the same old roles, roles where they feel comfortable and recognized. I have seen many women focus on the task at hand over their own reputation and we are typically seen as good at getting things done. We must challenge ourselves to manage our reputations, seize opportunities and shape our careers.Commit to supporting other women. Identify opportunities to open doors for young female graduates. Vocally support and recognize the other women in your company. Use your influence to champion them individually, organizationally and throughout your community.These questions and answers have been edited for length and clarity."

Disclosure: I own some bitcoin ...","Jun 14, 2017,02:34pm EDT","Ellyn Shook, Accenture's chief leadership and human resources officer, at an event in 2016. She's... [+] confident that her firm can create a 50% female workforce by 2025.","Accenture has taken a bold step for diversity: Today it announced a commitment to reaching a gender-balanced workforce by 2025. It appears to be the first major professional services firm to publicly set a 50/50 gender-balance objective.Given the pace of change at Accenture over the past five years and that its current workforce is just below 40% women, reaching gender balance by 2025 seems like a tall order. For example, from 2015 to 2016, it only nudged its balance of women upwards by one percentage point.Accenture has pledged to create a 50% female workforce by 2025.
But Ellyn Shook, Accenture’s chief leadership and human resources officer, insists it will come to pass, based on a focused effort and internal data she has seen. “I feel a huge sense of confidence, and I know that we’ll be able to get there,” she says. “We have an unwavering belief that diversity makes us smarter and more innovative.”So far, one way Accenture has increased its female ranks is by setting diversity goals for each of its business segments and geographies and providing transparent progress updates. In early 2016, it reportedly became the first large professional services company to publish its demographics. In recruiting, Accenture offers outsize referral bonuses for women and underrepresented-minority hires, an initiative Shook considers powerful and disruptive. And it has a program where C-suite mentors sponsor senior women in their career advancement. Debbie Polishook, an executive who participated in that program, went on to rise into the C-suite. Today, Accenture women stay longer and get promoted at higher rates than men, dynamics that support Shook’s confidence in achieving the new goal. For senior women, Accenture pledged to raise the number of female managing directors from 20% today to 25% by 2020. Female executives are more difficult to recruit because they change jobs less often, Shook says. “When women find a job that helps them professionally and personally, they’re loyal ... the loyalty factor is real.” The company’s C-suite is currently 25% women, one percentage point above the 24% average observed among the top 1,000 highest-grossing public companies. But Accenture stopped short of pledging to improve female representation on its leadership team. “To be frank, at Accenture, there's not constant turnover at the global management committee level ... the churn isn’t like other parts. We don’t grow this team,” Shook says. What about pay equity? “Three years ago, the board asked us to look at it,” Shook says. “We did a thorough study led by an outside organization, and found some issues.” Shook and Accenture CEO Pierre Nanterme chose to fix them immediately by boosting salaries. Today, they have a “rigorous process” of analyzing pay equity once per year, and they make adjustments when inequities seep in.By setting its gender-balance goal, Accenture hopes to take a leadership position in diversity among professional services firms. Shook says, “I hope that by us making this public commitment that other companies will join us and do the same so the world can be a better place.”"

@jeffkauflin. Disclosure: I own some bitcoin and ether. Read Less.","Mar 29, 2017,02:02pm EDT","Paul Brown joined Arby's in May 2013. Since then, sales have grown 16%.","An Arby’s venison sandwich might strike you as disgusting, but it’s also a stroke of genius. Arby’s CEO Paul Brown has come up with menu innovations like that to drive growth at the once-downtrodden fast food chain. When the financial crisis hit, Arby’s suffered badly. Sales and margins shrank for three straight years, from 2008 through 2010. The company began offering more promotional deals to dig itself out of a deep hole, but the recovery was slow. In 2010 a JPMorgan analyst said, “Arby's performance is amongst the worst in modern restaurant history."" In 2013, two years after Wendy’s had sold Arby’s to a private equity firm, Paul Brown, former president of Hilton Worldwide, was brought in to attempt a turnaround. Since he became CEO, the chain has grown same-store sales for 14 straight quarters. Top-line sales have jumped by 16% to $3.6 billion, and Arby’s restaurants now have average revenue of $1.1 million, 25% higher than before Brown arrived.  When he first joined, the company had already seen two years of same-store sales growth, but Brown attributes the upswing to increased promotions. “It was a very value-driven period of the economy. But you can only do that for so long,” he says. He decided to ease discounting and foster a reputation for quality meats. He hired a new ad agency and began unleashing a barrage of new products. In 2013 Arby’s released a brisket sandwich, which lifted sales 12% and became the company’s most successful product. Over the next few years it added gyros, a “loaded Italian sandwich” and a “buttermilk buffalo chicken sandwich.” And it got smarter in its choices of new products to launch. Before Brown became CEO, if there were two potential new sandwiches, the company would research how much consumers liked each, but wouldn’t measure whether they would cannibalize any other Arby’s item. Today the process is different. “There’s a level of analytical rigor that we didn’t have three to four years ago.” Today Arby’s typically launches new products at a discount, and those items often make up 10 to 15% of the company’s sales, says Brown. Then Arby’s turns off the promotional pricing, sits and waits. If the item can hold steady at 3 - 6% of sales, it earns a permanent place on the menu. Otherwise it’s gone. Of the 25 to 30 new products Arby’s has launched under Brown’s watch, he says about four have earned that distinction. Arby’s now launches 12 new products a year. Before Brown, it released about two a year. Arby’s also exerts a great deal of effort on public relations, a strategy I observed first-hand. Before I spoke with Brown, a spokesperson sent me a neatly polished, ten-slide PowerPoint presentation touting the company’s progress. I’d never received such a detailed document before an interview (usually companies don’t send anything). Last October, the company launched a new venison sandwich in 17 hunting-heavy markets. It drew mixed reviews but sold out on its first day, and it received unprecedented press coverage. “It was our largest earned media event that we’ve ever had,” Brown says.Jon Stewart often made fun of Arby’s on the Daily Show. But instead of taking a defensive stance, Brown saw an opportunity, and he agreed to appear on the show’s last episode. “Think about a brand personality as a friend,” he says. “How many defensive friends do you have? You’d rather have a friend who’s fun and self-deprecating.” The week after the episode aired, in August 2015, the company’s sales hit an all-time high. Brown thinks the value of the good press Arby’s receives is worth 40 to 50% of its advertising spend. From January through November of 2016, Arby’s spent $129 million on advertising, according to marketing research firm Kantar Media. That means the press it received last year might have been worth $50 to $65 million. Since Brown became CEO, “margins have expanded significantly,” he says. “Half of margin growth has come from sales growth.” In 2016 Arby’s increased sales to $3.6 billion, from $3.5 billion the year prior. It says it’s on track to reach $4 billion in 2018. How will it get there? Arby’s will continue to follow the playbook of menu innovation, advertising and PR, but those efforts alone won’t cut it. Store redesigns will help, Brown says. And the company needs to open and choose the right locations for new stores. With 3,358 restaurants today, Arby’s has 42 fewer locations than when Brown became CEO. 2016 was the first time since 2008 that the company ended the year with more stores than it started with. Arby's declines to share its goal for 2017, but says that redesigning and opening new locations are top priorities. Over the long term, it thinks there’s enough consumer demand to have 6,000 total locations. "

[+] Robert Half and Korn Ferry Executive Search ranked highly.,"If you speak with startup founders or large-company CEOs, they’ll probably tell you that hiring good people is their biggest challenge. It’s no wonder there are thousands of recruiting firms in the U.S., all vying to help companies get talent in the door. But which recruiters are the most well-respected? Forbes worked with analytics firm Statista to compile two lists of America’s best recruiting firms. The first set ranks 250 executive search firms, defined as companies that place executives in positions with at least $100,000 in annual pay. The second ranks 250 professional search firms, which place employees in roles with less than $100,000 in annual income. Click below to view the full lists:To see the 10 most highly-rated companies in each category, open the gallery.To conduct its research, Statista first consulted with sources like trade organizations and company databases, identifying about 4,000 recruiters in each of the two categories. Then it invited thousands of recruiters, employees who have worked with recruiters over the past three years, and H.R. managers to take an online survey. The survey asked them to recommend up to 10 recruiting firms (excluding their own), and it gathered a total of 20,000 recommendations. The companies with the most recommendations ranked highest.   Robert Half, a recruiting firm based in Silicon Valley, was the only company to make the top 10 on both the professional and executive recruiters lists. It has 16,400 employees, made $5.3 billion in revenue last year and is a member of the S&P 500. Robert Half places candidates in a range of industries, including finance, law, technology and marketing.  Korn Ferry took the top spot on the executive recruiters list. The Los Angeles-based company has 7,000 employees and works with 93% of the highest-grossing companies in the U.S. It places candidates in dozens of sectors, ranging from investment banking to industrial manufacturing and education. New York had more recruiters on the lists than any other city, with 41 executive recruiting firms and 18 professional recruiting firms. Chicago had the second-most, followed by Atlanta.  "

currency, which would cause a step change in financial industry ...","Apr 19, 2017,07:45am EDT",­,"­But we need to control it!In 1998, Kodak had 170,000 employees and sold 85% of all photo paper worldwide.Within just a few years, their business model disappeared.Recently, I’ve been impressed by a vision of the future as shared by serial entrepreneur and CEO Udo Gollub. He has noted that  what happened to Kodak will happen to many industries in the next 10 years. But most don't see it coming. Did you think, in 1998, that 3 years later you would never take pictures on film or paper again?Digital cameras were invented in 1975. The first models had only 10,000 pixels of image resolution, but followed Moore's law (like transistors, we’ve doubled the number of pixels per square inch every year). Similar to many exponentially growing technologies, it was a disappointment for a long time, but grew progressively more superior and went mainstream in only a few short years. Welcome to the 4th Industrial Revolution. Welcome to the Exponential Age.Software will disrupt most traditional industries. Uber, for example, is just a software tool. They don't own cars, but are now the biggest taxi company in the world. Airbnb is now the biggest hotel company in the world, although they don't own any properties.And then there’s Artificial Intelligence. Computers are becoming exponentially better at understanding the world. In 2016, a computer beat the best Go player in the world, 10 years earlier than expected. In the US., young lawyers already have difficulty getting jobs. Because of IBM Watson, you can now get basic legal advice within seconds, with 90% accuracy (compared with 70% accuracy when provided by humans). So if you study law, consider your options immediately. There will be fewer lawyers in the future. Watson also helps doctors diagnose cancer, with a four times higher accuracy rate than humans. Facebook now has pattern recognition software that can recognize faces better than humans. It is forecast that by 2030, computers will become more intelligent than humans.Autonomous cars: Self driving cars will soon be available to the public. Disruption of the auto industry has already begun. You won't need to own a car anymore. You will call a car with your phone, it will show up at your location and will drive you to your destination. You will not need to park; you will only pay for the driven distance and you can be productive while traveling. Our kids may never get a driver's license and never own a car. This will change cities, because they will need to contain far fewer cars. We can transform former parking space into parks. Currently, more than 1.2 million people worldwide die in car accidents every year. While we currently experience one accident every 60,000 miles, with autonomous driving, this rate will drop dramatically, saving perhaps a million lives each year worldwide.Most car companies will be at risk of gradually failing. Traditional car companies will try the evolutionary approach and just build a better car, while tech companies (Tesla, Apple, Uber and Google) will take the revolutionary approach of building a computer on wheels. Engineers from major car companies are are very concerned about the looming threat from Tesla.Auto insurance companies will have massive trouble because, with far fewer accidents, the price of insurance will become much lower. Their car insurance business will shrink drastically. Likewise, the geographic distribution of Real Estate prices will change. When you can work while you commute and commutes become shorter, as traffic flows more efficiently with autonomous cars, people will move further away to live in more beautiful neighborhoods.Electric cars will become mainstream. Cities will be less noisy because electric cars are so quiet. Electricity will become progressively less expensive and clean: Solar production has been on an exponential curve for 30 years, but we can now begin to see the impact. Last year, more solar energy was installed worldwide than fossil. For a few days in March 2017, solar power produced half of all the electricity used in California. The price for solar will drop so much that many coal companies will be put out of business and oil will be impacted by reduced demand.With low cost electricity comes affordable and abundant water. We don't have scarce water in most places; we only have scarce drinking water. Imagine what will be possible when anyone can have as much clean water as they want.In health care there will soon be companies that will build medical devices (remember the ""Tricorder"" from Star Trek) that work with your phone to scan your retina, take your blood sample and sample your breath. They will then analyze biomarkers that will identify nearly any disease. It will be inexpensive, so in ten or twenty years everyone in the developed world can have access to world class diagnosis.In 3D printing, the price of the cheapest 3D printer has already reduced from $18,000 to $300 in 10 years. In the same period, they became 100 times faster. All major shoe companies have started 3D printing of shoes. Spare airplane parts are already 3D printed in remote airports. The space station now has a printer that eliminates the need for storing the large amount of spare parts they used to carry. Construction of Real Estate will also be revolutionized, bringing abundant housing to the poor and luxurious options for the rich, all while reducing the need for people to do the work.Soon, new smartphones will offer 3D scanning. You will be able to 3D scan your feet and print or order your perfect shoe from your home. China has already 3D printed a complete 6-story office building. 3D printing will disrupt almost all fields of manufacturing. Agriculture will evolve dramatically as well. There will soon be a $100 agricultural robot. Farmers in third-world countries will become managers of their fields instead of being manual laborors. The first petri dish beef is now available and will become less expensive and cleaner than beef from cows. Right now, almost one third of all agricultural land is used for cow farming. Imagine the impact if we don't need that space. There are several startups bringing non-animal source protein to the market that contain more protein than meat.There are already apps that can recognize your mood. In a few years there will be apps that can tell by your facial expressions if you are lying. Imagine a live political debate where viewers can see within seconds when a politician tells a lie. Quite a market!The Internet of Things is on the way to driving dramatically increased service levels, higher efficiency and reliability across most areas of our lives and businesses, while reducing the number of people needed to do the work.Bitcoin is becoming mainstream and might become the world’s default reserve currency, which would cause a step change in financial industry efficiency.Our longevity will be impacted as well. Right now, the average human being’s life span increases by three months per year. In 1900 worldwide life expectancy was 31 years. In 1950 it was 48 years, a 55% increase. By 2013 lifespan worldwide increased to 71 years, a further 48% increase. The increase per year is currently accelerating, and it is predicted that around 2036 we’ll begin a temporary period during which more that one year increase in lifespan will occur every year that passes. So we may live for well beyond 100 years. In education, accelerating ownership of smartphones will give widespread access to world class education.Third world children will be able to use Khan academy for access to everything a child currently learns at school in a First World country. At work, large swaths of jobs as we know them today will disappear. There will be new jobs, but it is not clear what they’ll be. What is clear is that there will not be enough new jobs to replace lost jobs, by a sizable margin. We are likely to see a large proportion of the working population unable to find employment.When I look at the future, I see both exciting opportunities and huge peril. We can expect that many of the incredible changes I have described will take longer to have an impact than is currently believed. But these changes are coming, and their effects will be huge.The likely direct outcome of the current future that is already evolving is that as many as half of the workforce will be impacted, their lives disrupted with the logistical, financial and societal side effects our future will cause. Human beings need to be gainfully employed and challenged to feel fulfilled. While various socially advanced countries will do a better job than others at reducing impact on their people through cross training and guaranteed minimum income programs, this approach is a type of band-aid, and it lacks a levered effect. It is simply not enough.I see a far more effective method for taking charge of our future. What if we were to motivate entrepreneurs to build companies that have the creation of new jobs on a large scale as a clear objective? We know that entrepreneurs and startups have a huge impact on what they set their sights on. For example, look at the way Jeff Bezos has changed retail buying. I believe we can drive effective and positive control over our future by causing the most levered group in society– our entrepreneurs–to apply themselves to create employment. As a group, entrepreneurs have the impact that can deliver on the required scale. Perhaps now is the time to motivate entrepreneurs to solve the upcoming employment vacuum by creating companies that by their nature generate far higher employment.  We cannot rely on altruism. So let’s get the growth capital industry (VC firms, Angel Investor groups, Incubators, and crowdfunding platforms) on board with this objective, to provide the financial motivation to build the critical mass of entrepreneurs that is needed. And let’s get entrepreneurs to buy in. I have voted with my feet - I have set up the EmployYourFuture program at my company to encourage entrepreneurs to build startups that create jobs at scale.We can have our future and enjoy it too—a far better alternative than a future that disrupts our children’s lives for decades!"

To put it all in perspective, getting the first four horses correct is such a tough task that a $20 superfecta bet on last year’s race would have returned $11,000.Swarm A.I correctly picking 2016's Kentucky Derby winner.Churchill Downs took note of this outstanding feat and invited Unanimous A.I. to be part of the action in 2017. The track and it’s wagering arm, Twinspires.com, invited some of the top horse racing minds in the industry to make up the “swarm” that will predict the outcome of this year’s race. Last year’s superfecta pick came from an online swarm of self-identified horse-racing enthusiasts, while this year’s crop is a group of proven experts. The collective is getting together on Wednesday to make picks and the results will be publicly released on Thursday, giving potential bettors time to utilize the information to make an informed wager ahead of Saturday’s Run for the Roses.Swarm A.I. is inspired by the way that birds and other animals flock together in order to amplify their intelligence and decision-making as a group, going far beyond what an individual is capable of. Unanimous A.I., founded by Dr. Louis Rosenberg, came up with algorithms that allow for humans to benefit from a hive mind. The founder had this to say about his company’s technology leading up to this weekend’s race:While predicting sports always involve a large element of chance, Unanimous A.I. taps the intelligence of groups and evokes the best possible prediction based on the available information. We have seen this work in a wide range of fields, from forecasting movie box-office to predicting the price of bitcoin. We are excited to see how these handicappers do against one of the most unpredictable of events – the race commonly known as the most exciting two minutes in all of sports.Swarm A.I. has worked well so far and the 2017 Kentucky Derby will be a perfect test for it’s continued use in handicapping. If the swarm can repeat its successes, this time using even better sources in the swarm, it could change horse racing betting forever.For those who want to get involved, TwinSpires will be running a $10,000 players pool that will make wagers based on the results of the Unanimous A.I. swarm. Members of the public can buy into this—with shares starting as little as $10—and earn a piece of the profit should the swarm once again correctly project the outcome of the Kentucky Derby."

directly; ...","May 4, 2017,12:38pm EDT",The music industry needs a central database with correct information.,"Today’s hot topics in the music industry are more about data and payments than sex, drugs, and rock ‘n’ roll. As previously discussed, payments to musicians, songwriters, and the companies that represent them are unfairly low. Aside from the rates, the other problem with getting paid fairly relies on the accuracy of the data relating to music.Digital uses of music require various types of data embedded in and tied to digital music files – called metadata. Metadata includes data like the copyright owners of the compositions and master recordings, ISRC codes (unique identifying codes for master recordings), ISWC codes (unique identifying codes for compositions), performance rights organization affiliations, and other information. One large problem with current metadata within the industry is a problem of matching. Music publishers and record labels often need to match data so certain sound recordings are matched to the composition embodied within them, or that certain uses can be matched to the exact sound recording and composition used. However, there is not yet a good system in place for totally accurate matching, which means a lot of extra work for rights’ holders to identify uses of their works in order to collect the payments associated with those uses.The other problem is the lack of correct metadata. Oftentimes, identifying correct metadata is like identifying the correct message in a game of telephone. Between the publishers, labels, distributors, and other involved entities, metadata that may have been correct at the beginning of the chain is often incorrect by the time it reaches a stage of usage, resulting in incorrectly identified (or unidentified) owners who don’t receive payments because it is unclear who to pay.Metadata is often incorrect for several reasons: (1) human error of employees incorrectly inputting data, and (2) lack of communication stemming from either rights’ owners not being clear on their shares of ownership or co-owners not sharing ownership information, (3) companies that have been sold or gone out of business with no clear successor, and (4) people who claim ownership of shares to which they do not actually have rights. In addition, many rights owners (often songwriters) do not want their ownership shares made public because they feel the ease of third parties figuring out what they earn will decrease their bargaining power.There has been a longstanding argument within the music industry for the need for a centralized database containing all relevant ownership information for all songs. There was an initiative to create the Global Repertoire Database (GRD) to solve this problem, however, the initiative failed reportedly due to companies not providing their data, side initiatives focused on mini-GRD projects, and lack of funding. Although the GRD failed, there are other possible alternatives. CISAC, which is a worldwide collective society of author organizations, supports CIS-NET, a global network of ownership information powered by Fastrack. CIS-NET will be available to CISAC member societies, but not the general public or digital service providers.Significant attention has been focused on using Blockchain technology to create an open database that is not governed by any one body and can be contributed to by multiple sources. This is a similar principle to the Wikipedia model. The advantages of using Blockchain technology for a centralized music rights database include: the data on the platform is encrypted and run across multiple computers making it difficult to hack; its Bitcoin protocol supports micropayment amounts, making it easier for rights owners to receive that $0.0007 payment and receive it directly; and its decentralized nature allow for rights’ owners to correct information on the rights they own.However, in my opinion, there needs to be a centralized body to oversee the database to protect against bogus claims and try to discern correct data when inconsistencies are present. Further, while it is great that Blockchain technology can pay artists and writers directly, the technology needs to be implemented in such a way that representatives of rights’ owners like performance rights organizations, music publishers, record labels, attorneys, etc. are not circumvented, as those representatives are essential to handling important business functions for artists and rights’ owners who need to spend their time creating instead of drowning in the minutiae of administration.The music industry needs a central database with correct information, splits, metadata, etc., both for cohesiveness within the industry and for information transparency to increase the efficiency and reliability of receiving payments. While Blockchain puts forth some real advantages, there is one element that Blockchain or any other database will never have – the human element. The music business is a business of relationships, a business run by people who manage and guard the rights of the music. Therefore, we can only achieve a winning proposition if the business can implement the technology in a way that supports the structure of and the people within the music business.*This article does not constitute legal advice.Erin M.

Disclosure: I own some bitcoin ...","Editors' Pick|Apr 28, 2017,09:38am EDT",Author Duff McDonald says Harvard Business School has failed to accomplish one of its founding... [+] goals.,"In the new book, The Golden Passport: Harvard Business School, the Limits of Capitalism, and the Moral Failure of the MBA Elite, financial journalist Duff McDonald takes the vaunted business school to task. The author homes in on one of the goals the school was founded on: “the multiplication of men who will handle their current business problems in socially constructive ways.” On this objective, the school has been “an enormous failure,” McDonald writes. When Forbes spoke with McDonald, he first acknowledged Harvard Business School’s positive accomplishments. For example, it advanced and codified the study of management in the early 1900s by blending social sciences with business. It helped pioneer the venture capital industry, although many aren’t aware of that history. “Everyone looks at Stanford as being the beating heart of venture capital,” McDonald says. “HBS’ involvement in VC is unrivaled.” He notes the work of former HBS professor Georges Doriot, who’s known as the father of venture capital. HBS also helped the U.S. win World War II. “The school was a branch of the military,” says McDonald. It did important statistical work in managing people and materials, getting them to the right place at the right time. But its misdeeds loom larger. One of McDonald’s most searing criticisms lands on Michael Jensen, the economist and HBS professor responsible for “agency theory,” which purports that management’s primary job is to maximize shareholder value. Jensen’s theory implies that hostile corporate takeovers—which left many workers abruptly unemployed in the 1980s—and excessive CEO pay are fine, as long as share prices rise. Earlier this week, HBS Dean Nitin Nohria reacted to McDonald’s book and said his professors have denounced agency theory for years. Yet McDonald thinks Wall Street’s continued focus on short-term results is a direct result of Jensen’s work. Economists have found evidence that a short-term view causes companies to invest less in the future and makes them less responsive to new opportunities. McDonald also finds fault in the case method, a teaching model that dominates HBS’ curriculum, in which students study historical business scenarios and evaluate the best way to manage them. The case method “tends to have a central CEO character as the hero ... it has contributed to the CEO fame machine and the sense of narcissism among modern corporate executives,” McDonald says. Beyond hypocrisy, McDonald says HBS misleads the public and its own students about leadership. “They tell MBAs from the moment of admission that they’re the world’s future leaders,” he says. “They’re utterly convinced that mere admission to HBS designates you as a future leader.” McDonald doesn’t think getting into or completing any MBA program is proof that you’re a good leader—the only credential that proves it is an actual track record. As evidence, he cites the work of Henry Mintzberg, a management professor at McGill who’s highly critical of HBS. It doesn’t matter how many CEOs the school has minted, Mintzberg has written. What’s more important is how they’ve performed as CEOs. He studied 19 HBS-alumni CEOs who were deemed exemplary in a 1990 book by David Ewing, Inside the Harvard Business School: Strategies and Lessons of America’s Leading School of Business. Mintzberg looked at those CEOs 10 years later and found that ten had failed, four had performed questionably, and only five were doing well. "

@jeffkauflin. Disclosure: I own some bitcoin and ether. Read Less.","Apr 4, 2017,09:06pm EDT",New data from Hired.com shows that women experience a widened pay gap several years into their... [+] career.,"Jessica Kirkpatrick, a data scientist with a Ph.D. in astrophysics, was looking for a new job. She had spent the past few years working at tech firms in the Bay Area, and she began using Hired.com, a recruiting site. Hired asks candidates to state their preferred salaries, then matches them with potential employers. Kirkpatrick told Hired she wanted a 10% raise on her current compensation. She was surprised by what she learned next. A representative from Hired told Kirkpatrick that, based on the current market for data scientists, she should ask for a 25% raise. In other words, she was significantly underpaid at her current job. In a prior role, Kirkpatrick had found out she was paid less than her male counterparts, but it hadn’t been by such a large margin.Watch on Forbes:She took Hired’s advice and upped her salary preference. Among the 18 companies that contacted Kirkpatrick through Hired, several offered a salary in the range of a 25% raise, and three or four made offers of a 50% bump. One of the firms that met Kirkpatrick's asking price (of a 25% raise) was Hired.com itself, and Kirkpatrick joined the startup as its lead data scientist.Today Hired released a report showing that Kirkpatrick’s experience of seeing a widened wage gap several years into her career is common. According to Hired’s data, women aren't paid less than men early in their careers, a dynamic possibly driven by today’s heightened awareness of a gender pay gap. But when they reach six years’ experience, a gap appears. Recent data from workforce analytics firm Visier shows a similar pattern—the pay gap begins to widen for women at age 32 and continues to do so until age 40. Hired calculated the pay gap between men and women in the same job, at the same company. And it showed an overall gap of 4% for technical positions. That’s much lower than the often-cited 20% pay gap, because the latter compares all men with all women in the country, regardless of industry or job title. That doesn’t mean the 20% number isn’t valid; it is. It’s just set in a broader context. What causes the pay gap to grow alongside years of experience? “I believe biases and inequities accumulate over time,” Kirkpatrick says. For example, men are 30% more likely to be promoted from an entry-level role to manager, according to a study by McKinsey and Sheryl Sandberg’s LeanIn.org. Women are socialized to play down their achievements and self-promote less, Kirkpatrick adds.  Another factor relates to negotiation. Women are less aggressive in negotiating, research has shown, and when they try, they meet more resistance and have less success than men. Kirkpatrick experienced this dynamic first-hand. After getting her Ph.D., she joined a tech company around the same time as two male colleagues with the same job title and similar experience. All three of them were initially offered the same salary by the same hiring manager, Kirkpatrick wrote in a Quartz post, and all asked for more money. Kirkpatrick was the only one denied an increase. The two men walked away with salaries $10,000 higher. Child care also matters. When women take parental leave, their salaries are affected more negatively than when men take leave. And companies often base new hires’ compensation on their most recent salary. Since women are generally paid less than men, that difference gets exacerbated at every new job they take.Sign up here to get top career advice delivered straight to your inbox every week.What can organizations and employees do to reduce the pay gap? First, companies should keep offers equitable, says Kirkpatrick. When a business sees a prospective hire who has a low current salary, it’s tempting to make him or her a low offer, since it may save tens of thousands of dollars in the short term. Conversely, for candidates with high current salaries who play hardball in negotiations, it’s tempting to go outside the company’s norms and offer more pay. “But in the long term, if you have large disparities, people figure that out,” Kirkpatrick says. “It’s not good for retaining talent and helping people feel like they’re at a place that values them.”Firms should conduct regular salary audits to look for gender and race-based inequities. Today Glassdoor released a 17-page guide for how employers can analyze the gender pay gap among their employees. And companies should recognize the need for mentorship and sponsorship of people who are underrepresented in their organization. For women preparing to negotiate, “come in armed with data knowing what your worth is,” Kirkpatrick says. Tools like PayScale, Glassdoor’s Know Your Worth and Comparably can help. Speaking with peers and joining professional groups is also useful—the more you can broaden the pool of people you discuss compensation with, the better. Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that Kirkpatrick initially wanted a 25% raise and that a representative from Hired suggested she ask for a 50% increase."

Insider's Bitcoin Wall Street power list” (April 2018). Eric has guided ...","Apr 28, 2017,06:01am EDT",Shutterstock,"The month of April marks the U.S. tax filing deadline for individuals. For most, this can be confusing—if not dreadful— as taxpayers attempt to make sense of all the moving pieces in their financial lives, especially investments.To add to the complexity, each security in a portfolio likely gets taxed differently, forcing a careful review of the year’s tax documents with a tax advisor. It is also increasingly important for investors to become familiar with tax terms like cost basis, ordinary income, and Schedule B.In light of the intricacy of filing taxes, here are a few important takeaways investors should know going forward, especially when creating ETF and mutual fund portfolios.The Difference Between ETFs And Mutual Funds: Capital GainsConventional wisdom says ETFs are more tax efficient than mutual funds, but what does that mean exactly? Both mutual funds and ETFs are baskets of different investments, which may change based on market conditions. But, mutual fund managers often buy or sell securities in an effort to outperform the market. If a mutual fund sells an underlying investment that has increased in value, it can result in a capital gain— a taxable event. Mutual funds are legally required to make these profitable distributions to investors, passing taxable capital gain payouts to investors, creating a tax liability for the mutual fund investor.ETFs, on the other hand, are generally intended to track an underlying index/benchmark. To this end, ETF managers rarely buy and sell investments in their baskets. Therefore, ETF distributions are usually dividends from underlying investments, as opposed to a combination of both dividends and capital gain distributions. In recent years, the average capital gains distribution for small, large, and mid-cap funds surpassed 5% of a mutual funds’ net asset value, while ETFs are usually less than 1% on capital gain distributions.Why is this important? Quite simply, taxes on dividends can be lower than taxes from capital gains payouts. If a mutual fund sells a profitable underlying investment that was held for less than one year, the capital gain payout is considered short-term, and taxed at ordinary income rates, which can be up to 39.6%.Long-term capital gain rates may be less painful than short-term capital gains, but this rate is not guaranteed with holding mutual funds. If a mutual fund is held in a non-retirement account, one could potentially face an unanticipated tax expense, stemming from the fund’s capital gain payout.Dividends, on the other hand, can be considered “qualified” if the U.S. stock or ETF was held for at least 60 days during the 121-day period surrounding the ex-date. Qualified dividends are taxed at a rate from 0% to 20% max, depending on one’s income bracket for that tax year. Comparatively, dividends can potentially allow investors to keep more of a portfolio’s generated income than other income-producing investments.Source: IRS.govWhat About My Bond Interest?Bonds generate interest income for investors and are taxed differently from dividends. Bond interest, like short-term capital gain distributions, is taxed as ordinary income, which as we know can be much higher than with dividends. Furthermore, municipal bond funds may offer appealing tax relief in some cases, but can be subject to a “stealth tax”, which makes social security benefits taxable – thereby defeating the investor’s tax advantage. Among income investments, qualified dividends may be a better alternative to fixed income when it comes to tax consequences.As illustrated in the chart below, the tax savings between ordinary income from short term capital gain distributions and bond interest can make a big difference.Source: IRS.govThe Power Of Dividend Growth ETFsIn addition to the relative tax efficiency of dividends and ETFs, dividend growth also serves as an indicator of strong performance. Dividends account for close to 43% of overall S&P 500 returns since 1930, and over 75% of S&P 500 total return during low-growth periods. A company that consistently raises its dividend likely has strong fundamentals, suggesting future growth potential and consistently positive cash flows.Investing in dividend growth ETFs combines the performance potential of dividend growing stocks with the tax efficiency of ETFs, powering a strong one-two punch for your portfolio.Consider speaking with your tax advisor about adding dividend growth ETFs to your portfolio. "

By analyzing people who have drastically improved their self-awareness and exploring hundreds of studies, she explains why we have such big blind spots and how to change. Self-awareness is critical for career success. People who are more self-aware tend to perform better at work, get more promotions and lead more effectively. Companies with more self-aware professionals have shown stronger financial performance. Watch on Forbes:In a series of surveys, Eurich found that 95% of people think they’re self-aware, but only 10-15% truly are. She cites three reasons for this disconnect. First, we naturally have blind spots. We’re wired to operate on autopilot, unaware of how we’re behaving, and why. There’s also the feel-good effect: we’re happier when we see ourselves in a more positive light. She calls the last factor the “cult of self,” the idea that we’ve become more self-absorbed as social media has exploded in popularity. So how can we become more self-aware? There are two aspects to address, internal and external self-awareness, Eurich says. Internal self-awareness is “an inward understanding of your values, passions, aspirations ... External self-awareness is about understanding yourself from the outside in—that is, knowing how other people see you,” she writes in Insight. Surprisingly, people who are externally self-aware don’t necessarily tend to be internally self-aware. Research has shown there’s no relationship between the two.To improve external self-awareness, Eurich suggests finding a “loving critic” at work. Find someone who both wants you to be successful and will tell you the truth, without any sugarcoating. Don’t try to ask all your colleagues for feedback—that can be overwhelming. Take one colleague out to lunch, letting him or her know in advance what you’re looking for. To drive the conversation, Eurich suggests asking, “What’s the thing you see me doing that’s helping me best contribute to the team or organization? What’s the thing I do that’s detracting from our success?” Sign up here to get top career advice delivered straight to your inbox every week.Building internal self-awareness might sound easier, but it requires an equally deliberate approach. Eurich first cautions against writing lengthy journal entries that harp on your troubles, or trying to search deeply for hidden meaning in your thoughts and actions. Such exercises can make you more depressed, she says.  Instead of trying to go deep, go wide—for example, list the jobs you’ve had and what you enjoyed most about them. Look for themes and patterns in the types of work you find fulfilling. At the end of every day, Eurich recommends asking yourself, “What went well today? What did I learn that I might do differently? Whose perspective can I get if I’m having a particular challenge?”Some people fear that becoming more self-aware means seeing the ugly truth about yourself. Eurich says the process can be difficult—for instance, she’s never seen someone enjoy getting negative feedback—but it’s okay to feel uncomfortable. “We have to let ourselves feel those reactions” and take some time to process them, she notes. “It takes courage, energy. But it is absolutely worth the effort, and it helps us be more confident and more in control of our lives.”"

[+] topped the list.","Summer is approaching, and for many American college students, that means they have something else on their mind besides Alice Cooper’s summer anthem, “School’s Out”: internships. Today careers site Glassdoor released its list of the 25 highest-paying internships in America. It looked at compensation data submitted by Glassdoor users over the past year, and it only included firms that received at least 25 salary reports. For organizations with the same median monthly pay, the company with the highest number of salary reports received the best rank.To see the top 10 highest-paying internships, open the gallery below. For the full list, see the end of this post. Facebook was number one, with monthly median pay of $8,000, nearly $1,000 more than the next company on this list. In a Glassdoor review, one intern reported “interesting projects” and “amazing pay and benefits” but also noted a culture of long hours. “There is a danger of working too much just because all the benefits make you think that you owe the company to work more than you already do,” the reviewer wrote.  Microsoft, where interns take home $7,100 monthly, came in second. Last December, one Glassdoor user said it’s a good time to work at the company, since it’s reinventing itself, but that your experience as an intern depends largely on your mentor. In my experience, that’s a reality for most internships—your manager strongly influences your enjoyment of the job. Multiple Glassdoor users also praised Microsoft’s intern events. ExxonMobil ranked third. It’s the only non-tech company in the top 10, and interns there make median wages of $6,507 a month. According to its website, ExxonMobil does the bulk of its intern recruiting in the fall. But some work opportunities remain for students in financial and technical roles. One Glassdoor user at ExxonMobil called the work environment exciting, but said the hours were long. Yelp had the eighth-highest-paying internship program, with interns making $6,400 monthly. Yelp hires about 150 interns per year, its website says, and sets them to work as software developers, project managers and designers. One Yelp intern spoke highly of the team events and mentorship, but noted that Yelp doesn’t often extend its internships to be longer than six months.

Insider's Bitcoin Wall Street power list” (April 2018). Eric has guided ...","Jun 14, 2017,06:45am EDT",(Photo by Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images),"Approaching week 10 of the MLB season, fantasy sports players are likely counting roto points, scrambling to make trades to fix draft-day mistakes, or some combination of the two. Since the arrival of fantasy sports in the 1980’s, fans can watch their favorite players and teams with an added layer of enjoyment—or dread—in real time. Professional players win pennants and World Series Trophies, but astute fantasy sports fans earn bragging rights, and even cash prizes after an all-star performance.Investing is no different. Whether it’s luck, thorough analysis, or both, great investors are able make money by picking leaders in the stock market. Now that the 2017 MLB season is in full swing, here’s how winning your fantasy league can help you win at investing.Draft Your Winning TeamAs you probably know, the key to scoring the most fantasy league points is assembling the best roster of quality players that produce across a range of factors. Interestingly, earning points isn’t necessarily about winning games, it’s about winning stat lines. The players on your fantasy team are like stocks in a portfolio. Instead of purely looking at the box score at the bottom of the ninth, fantasy league players score points if a hitter has a strong OBP and tally of RBIs, and if pitcher’s K count, ERA and WHIP are in good shape.Like sports, making great investments can be done by leveraging crucial stat lines. But, which one’s are the most important when picking stocks? Amid the barrage of opinions and noise surrounding the markets, investors can feel intimidated when stepping up to the plate, afraid of being struck by the curveball of a bear market, or another market crisis.Similar to the aforementioned advanced analytics and metrics for analyzing baseball stats, one of our favorite measures of a high-quality stock is dividend growth. A stock’s ability to grow its dividends has historically been one of the biggest determinants of its future returns. So, to better assess a dividend’s growth potential, look deeper into the data, just like your favorite fantasy players. Scout The Right DataElite pitchers log strikeout after strikeout, and limit the number of walks. Elite hitters, among other skillsets, frequently get on base, and hit home runs—producing runs and points. Dividends are a function of earnings, and accordingly, stocks that consistently grow their dividends have robust earnings-per-share (EPS) growth relative to their peers. Also, if a company has declared multiple dividend increases within the last 5 years, and no dividend cuts, the stock’s long run potential and dividend’s staying power are healthy.  Knock Ratios Out of The ParkPitchers are a mighty force on your fantasy team. Clayton Kershaw is considered one of baseball’s best pitchers because of his sky-high strikeout-to-walk ratio. Bryce Harper and Mike Trout are among the best at the plate because of their elite-level batting averages.When creating your portfolio, keep an eye on important ratios. What’s the ratio of buybacks to dividends? If high, a company is less likely to cut its dividends, and has more cash to grow dividend payouts with reduced buybacks (see more of our view on buybacks). Additionally, a corporation needs cash to pay dividends to shareholders. Does it have the cash to cover the payouts? Look at the free cash flow to dividend ratio, if high, you can rest assured the company’s dividend isn’t in danger of being cut.Like fantasy league, we can’t just rely on a single factor when investing. If a player hits 40 runs but strikes out every other time, his performance at the end of the season won’t be that great. Similarly, in investing, dividend stocks that pay a high yield alone can look appealing but may experience weakness in the long run. Consistent Dividend growth is a better measure. Remember, it’s about overall performance for the entire season.Take the FieldAs you approach your fantasy league season with pencil and calculator in hand, remember that your skills as a great fantasy sports player can be directly applied to your investing. Analyzing data, following a hunch, and possibly even taking a contrarian strategy, all apply to both baseball and investing. Whether it’s a relatively high on-base-percentage, or high probability of a dividend increase, you can build a championship portfolio, and great investing will no longer be a fantasy.See your favorite stock’s dividend growth potential here.

@jeffkauflin. Disclosure: I own some bitcoin and ether. Read Less.","May 17, 2017,08:43pm EDT",Indoor cycling company Flywheel plans to sell an at-home spinning bike and video-streaming service... [+] by the end of this year.,"Flywheel Sports, a growing indoor cycling company with 42 studio locations, announced today that it’s making a major change to its business model. By the end of this year, it plans to sell an at-home spinning bike and video-streaming service, jumping into the ring with New York-based startup Peloton, which began selling its own bike and streaming service in 2013. Both companies are trying to take advantage of the country’s growing infatuation with fitness. As of 2015, 55 million Americans belonged to a gym, up from 41 million in 2005, according to the International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association. The new offering, dubbed Flywheel Anywhere, will feature both live and on-demand classes filmed in a second studio the company is building at its Lincoln Square location in New York. The classes will be taught by a “hand-picked, select group” of current Flywheel instructors from across the country, says Flywheel CEO Sarah Robb O’Hagan. She declined to comment on how much the new product will cost, saying she’ll announce pricing later in the year, along with more details about the service. Peloton, which had more than $170 million in revenue last year, sells its bikes and streaming service for $1,995 and $39 a month. A SoulCycle spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the rival studio cycling business plans to offer an at-home product.Most of Flywheel’s current locations are in large U.S. cities, and with Flywheel Anywhere, the company hopes to extend its reach. Robb O’Hagan says Flywheel has succeeded in smaller cities, like Charlotte and Raleigh, but the studio business is less viable in areas with lower population density. She declines to disclose past or projected revenue, but says, “the studio and streaming content will be equally important parts of the business.” How will Flywheel’s offering differ from Peloton’s? “Most importantly, we’re very focused on a unique customer,” says Robb O’Hagan. “We’re targeting the person who’s very competitively minded ... we’re not going after the weight-loss community so much as the people riding in service of a bigger athletic goal.” She notes that 50% of Flywheel riders are training for an athletic event like a marathon. Yet John Foley, Peloton’s co-founder and CEO, thinks they’ll be competing for the same customers. He acknowledges that Peloton has a wide variety of class styles, some of which are entertainment-focused, but he says it also has instructors who have competed in the Tour de France. “If you’re a hardcore athlete, Peloton has classes that will make you bleed through your nose,” he says.  One key difference between Flywheel and Peloton is that Peloton sees itself as more of a vertically integrated tech company. It builds its bikes and software in-house, has 75 engineers and plans to hire 75 more over the next year, according to Foley. Flywheel outsources its bike manufacturing. Although it has an in-house team of engineers and was the first boutique cycling company to use tracking technology combined with a leaderboard, it will partner with outside firms on software development and product design. “We’re first and foremost an athletic fitness company, with a strong grounding in technology,” Robb O’Hagan says. Flywheel places particular emphasis on its workouts and has a proprietary approach to interval training. One thing Peloton and Flywheel agree on: their category is going to grow. Foley expects dozens of competitors to enter the space, and Robb O’Hagan says, “I think the entire boutique fitness category is at the very beginning of its growth potential.” "

This year is no different, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Forbes looked at the National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates from the BLS to find the best and worst-paying jobs as of May 2016. The data covers all industries in urban, suburban and rural areas, but excludes jobs that people don’t typically work in full-time or year-round, such as actors, dancers and musicians.To see the top 10 earners, open the gallery below. For the worst-paying jobs, see the end of this post. Doctors dominate the top 10, with a near sweep but for one exception. In particular, anesthesiologists earn the most, with an average salary of $269,600. The job involves taking care of patients’ safety during surgery and trying to prevent any pain or distress, according to the Hospital of Special Surgery. And how many anesthesiologists are there in the country? Slightly more than 30,000. Surgeons rank second in earning power, taking home slightly less at $252,910, followed by obstetricians and gynecologists. If you’ve ever had braces, you might be intrigued to hear that orthodontists rank fifth on the list, earning $228,780 on average. Yet there’s only one-sixth as many orthodontists as anesthesiologists in the country. Chief executive ranks tenth on the list, making it the only non-medical gig to crack the top 10. Given the lofty salaries of the best-paying jobs, you might guess that middle-of-the-pack pay in the U.S. is near $50,000 or $75,000. But it’s actually lower. Median compensation is $37,040, and the top-earning 10% of all Americans make $94,540 or more.Median wages for all workersAmong the 10 lowest-earning jobs, half are in food services. Food preparation and serving workers make the least, at $20,460 on average. (The reason this number doesn’t mathematically align with the graphic above is because it’s an average, and the numbers above are medians.) There are more than 3.4 million food preparation and serving workers in America, or about four times as many as all of the 10 best-paying jobs combined. Fast food cooks make the second-least, followed by shampooers and dishwashers. Other occupations falling in the bottom ranks include cashiers, gaming dealers, and amusement park attendants.
