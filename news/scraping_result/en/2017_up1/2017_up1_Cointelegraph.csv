No Taxes",https://cointelegraph.com/news/australia-will-recognize-bitcoin-as-money-and-protect-bitcoin-businesses-no-taxes,"Two majors factors which drove startups, exchanges and businesses dealing 
with Bitcoin and other digital currencies in Australia away from the ...","May 11, 2017","UPD: The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), the federal government agency for scientific research in Australia, stated that Blockchain technology will have a profound impact on the Australian economy. ","Bitcoin will be treated as money in Australia by July 1, 2017, and will be exempt from goods and services tax (GST). Bitcoin traders and investors will not be taxed for purchasing and selling Bitcoin through regulated exchanges and trading platforms. Over the past two years, the Australian Bitcoin exchange market significantly fell behind growing markets such as South Korea, Japan and South Korea, that control more than half of the global Bitcoin exchange market share. Two majors factors which drove startups, exchanges and businesses dealing with Bitcoin and other digital currencies in Australia away from the country where the termination of banking services by leading Australian banks due to their anti-competitive nature and the double taxation of Bitcoin trading by the Australian government. Starting July 1 however, double taxation and trading and goods and services taxation on Bitcoin will be exempted. In its 2017 to 2018 budget for “Backing innovation and FinTech,” the Australian government wrote: “The Government will make it easier for new innovative digital currency businesses to operate in Australia. From 1 July 2017, purchases of digital currency will no longer be subject to the GST, allowing digital currencies to be treated just like money for GST purposes. Currently, consumers who use digital currencies can effectively bear GST twice: once on the purchase of the digital currency and once again on its use in exchange for other goods and services subject to the GST.” More importantly, the Australian government’s new vision to spur the growth of fintech and the digital currency market would most likely prevent local banks and financial institutions for unfairly denying banking services to Bitcoin businesses and exchanges. If the above mentioned issues can be resolved by July 1, the Australian Bitcoin market could potentially experience a rapid growth in terms of user base and trading volumes. The document further read: “Innovation will drive productivity growth in Australia. That is why the Government’s $1.1 bln National Innovation and Science Agenda (NISA) is designed to enable Australia to take full advantage of new economic opportunities. The Government is committed to establishing Australia as a leading global financial technology (fintech) hub and is announcing a new package that aims to position our local fintech industry as a world leader.” At the Blockchain NZ conference held in Auckland, New Zealand earlier this week, Bitcoin and security expert Andreas Antonopoulos emphasized the Australian government’s uninvolvement in its local Bitcoin market and the impact of such actions on Bitcoin businesses and exchanges. More to that, Antonopoulos criticized the local government’s taxation policy on Bitcoin, which essentially drove away businesses and users from Australia to other countries. “Governments can choose to either do nothing – which is okay, make things worse for cryptocurrency trading – like what Australia did by imposing sales taxes on all cryptocurrency transactions, or they can make things easier for companies by reining in the banks and encouraging companies by creating a level playing field,” Antonopoulos said. With Australia’s new policy, the Bitcoin ecosystem in the country could change drastically. Banks will start offering services to Bitcoin exchanges and traders will not be taxed with GST upon the purchase of Bitcoin. "

you make a profit of the difference between those two prices, less any ...","Mar 29, 2017","There has been a protracted debate on the actual identity of Bitcoin, whether it should be regarded as a currency or a commodity.","With reasonable support on each side of the debate based on its inherent characteristics, a huge segment of the ecosystem is of the opinion that Bitcoin can, and should be regarded as both a currency and a commodity.Whatever definition attached to Bitcoin, the constant variation in price offers an opportunity for investors to make a profit by trading the cryptocurrency, either as a long term investment or in a speculative short term pattern.Bashir Aminu, Bitcoin trader and convener of online crypto group Cryptogene, explains the basic Bitcoin trading process as follows:“If you buy Bitcoins at one price and then sell them for a higher price, you make a profit of the difference between those two prices, less any commission that you paid. However, if the price goes down, you will be in the uncomfortable position of having to either sell them at a loss or hold and hope the price goes back up while risking higher and higher losses if the price continues to drop.”There are two major types of traders in the Bitcoin market, they are ‘long term’ traders and ‘short term’ traders. Each of these group of traders are classified by how long they may wish to hold onto a given position of trade.Long term traders are usually involved in studying price trends over long periods of time. This informs their decision to buy and hold Bitcoin also over long periods with the hope of taking profit at a price higher than their original entry point. With Bitcoin still in its developmental stages, a lot of users suggest that this is a good time to buy.This suggestion is based on the assumption that with increasing use case scenario and more adoption, demand for Bitcoin and its associated technology will increase, thereby creating more demand for the cryptocurrency which will automatically cause an eventual increase in value. Glimpses of this have been observed with the surge in Bitcoin price which coincides with a boost in its market capitalization and volume of trade.On the other hand, short-term traders analyze the intraday behavior of Bitcoin price and seek to take advantage of the swings in price. These traders thrive in market volatility, a factor that is presently characteristic of Bitcoin.In its early stages, the swings in Bitcoin price was usually so huge as every little event within the crypto space had very serious impact on the price of the cryptocurrency. As adoption grows and Bitcoin becomes more stable, price volatility has reduced considerably and experts think it is a better time to trade the cryptocurrency, compared to an earlier time.“Bitcoin is certainly safer to invest in now than it was a couple of years ago”, says Aminu.Aminu describes Bitcoin trading as extremely profitable if you play your cards well. According to him, it all depends on the market movement pattern. He tells Cointelegraph that Bitcoin value rises and falls dramatically throughout each trading day, jumping in whole dollar amounts. A phenomenon which he identifies as very risky when misjudged.Based on his trading experience, Aminu outlines a set of rules for newcomers who may wish to profit from the Bitcoin market as follows:"

The currency suffered greatly due to the theft of millions of dollars worth 
of ...","Jun 3, 2017",Josh Althauser is a tech entrepreneur and open source advocate specializing in providing mentorship for startups for their marketing technology. You may connect with him on Twitter.,"Bitcoin’s value is soaring. Over recent months, the cryptocurrency has hit record highs. In early May of this year, the open-source digital currency ballooned to almost $3,000 a coin. Last May, one coin fetched only $450. By no means is this growth a sudden trend. Bitcoin’s value has been steadily increasing since its inception in 2008, nearly a decade ago. Still, many remain hesitant to invest.The theft of hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins from the now-infamous Mt. Gox may still haunt investors. Or perhaps the volatility, as the Bitcoin market is 26 times more volatile than the S&P 500, and the lack of governmental oversight have speculators forecasting disaster. This is understandable as Bitcoin is not backed by a precious metal, a country or a bank. It’s regulated by sentiment alone. Although there are clear advantages to a market structured like this, there are serious obstacles and dangers that cannot be ignored. If you’re willing to stomach the risk, however, investing in Bitcoin may be a worthwhile endeavor.1. It’s experiencing incredible growth.The currency suffered greatly due to the theft of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoins in 2014, but has recovered quite quickly in the span of two years and is now experiencing rapid growth.In February of this year, Bitcoin surpassed one troy ounce of gold in value. It’s now surpassing the value of gold by even larger margins. If you happened to invest meagerly in Bitcoin in 2011, you would have already seen massive returns. For example, an $100 investment would have garnered you approximately $600,000 if you sold this May.2. The supply is fixed.21 mln Bitcoins are scheduled for release. No more, no less. It is likely that every Bitcoin will be in distribution around the year 2140. Each year, the number of Bitcoins slated for circulation is halved, slowing the process significantly. A currency with a fixed supply seems counterintuitive to some. Fiat currency is printed as needed. More money is circulated as time goes on.According to Bitcoin’s website, “Bitcoin is intended to inflate in its early years and become stable in its later years... With a stable monetary base and a stable economy, the value of the currency should remain the same.” Although it might be predicted that a lower supply results in hoarding and deflation, this most likely will not be the case for the currency as the fixed supply is expected.3. Bitcoin may be an effective way to diversify.Investors are beginning to take Bitcoin more seriously. In 2011, Bitcoin was virtually unknown. Now, it regularly appears in the mainstream news. Kiosks devoted to trading Bitcoins have sprung up. Increasingly, digital currency is being used for everyday transactions, international trade and as investment vehicles.Adoption rates have risen and trust in the digital currency has strengthened steadily. Cryptocurrency itself is widening as dozens of competing alternatives based on Bitcoin technology (aptly named altcoins) flood the market. JP Morgan Chase, Intel and Microsoft even came together to back the Blockchain currency Ethereum.“More and more investors are looking for unique opportunities outside the traditional arena,” writes Bobby Cho for The Street.“[B]itcoin is emerging as a viable alternative asset class for institutional and retail investors alike. It has an enormous amount of investment potential and is unlike any investment product in the world today.”Bitcoin has grown exponentially. But, by the same token, the currency’s upward climb hasn’t been without setbacks. Mt. Gox underscored fears about the mercurial nature of the peer-to-peer currency. Millions of dollars were lost likely due to undetected theft, leaving supporters and skeptics alike with concerns about its security and long-term viability. However, it has taken these losses in stride. The Blockchain currency has surged well over its pre-Mt. Gox market value this year, experiencing two all-time highs in the span of a few months.The original public ledger provides unique opportunities to investors who are willing to steel themselves against downturns and remain calm during record surges. The supply of Bitcoins is fixed, which may stabilize the currency over time. Moreover, faith in Blockchain currency is expanding as giants like JPMorgan Chase, Intel and Microsoft have already shown their support of cryptocurrency. Therefore, Bitcoin is currently experiencing wider adoption and is being taken more seriously as an investment vehicle.If you are serious about adding Bitcoin into your portfolio, you’ll need to exercise caution. When investing in cryptocurrency, you should only risk as much as you’re willing to lose. Continue to conduct your own research, monitor Bitcoin’s growth and assess the currency’s weaknesses. Shrewd investment bolstered by thorough research could, in fact, lead to immense returns.Read more: How to Buy Bitcoin: Best Practices, Where to Buy, Tips"

Since then, over a period of 12 months, Bitcoin price tripled, increasing from $420 to $1257.","As Cointelegraph previously reported, Bitcoin price is nearing its all-time high price set at $1,277, primarily due to the explosive growth of the Japanese Bitcoin industry.Analysts expect Bitcoin price to increase consistently in the mid-term if key markets such as Japan and the US sustain their growth and if relatively small markets like India experience a massive change in regulatory frameworks for Bitcoin trading and usage.For years, India was considered to be one of the more important markets for Bitcoin to penetrate because of the country’s poor banking system, declining financial platform and weak infrastructure. Today, local analysts and researchers note that 40 percent of Indian population remains unbanked.The vast majority of households and individuals in India do not rely on banks or established financial institutions to manage their money for a few reasons.Recently, the demonetization of 500 and 1,000 bank notes initiated by the Indian government led to a nationwide financial crisis, as banks and ATMs ran out of cash to dispense. Both the banked and unbanked populations of India have been struggling to obtain cash to fund day-to-day operations and basic necessities ever since.Moreover, research and professional services firms such as PwC revealed that by October of 2015, 233 mln Indians had no access to bank accounts. According to Times of India, a prominent local publication, a UN report further revealed that 43 percent of adults in India made no deposits or withdrawals in banks.""I have nearly Rs 20,000 saved up from the last so many years. I never knew how to do bank work, so I never had an account. I've had no need for one, and now I am stuck with all the cash but can't use it to buy my supplies. I have some money saved but all in cash at home, as I did not know how to deposit in the bank,” said a full-time professional who resides in India.Over the past few years, major Bitcoin exchanges and service providers in India were not able to demonstrate an exponential rate of growth in terms of user base and daily trading volume. It was only by early 2016 that exchanges such as Zebpay and Unocoin began to see a spike in their user base and trading volumes.One key factor that would allow the Indian Bitcoin industry to grow at a rapid rate similar to China, South Korea and Japan is the legalization of Bitcoin as legal tender and currency. The central banks of the Philippines and Japan most recently legalized Bitcoin as legal tender, to help their local industries to grow and allow the general consumer base to utilize bitcoin.For Bitcoin to achieve mainstream adoption in India, a legalization of the digital currency by local authorities is necessary. If Bitcoin becomes legalized by the end of May as many predicts, and millions of new users from India emerge as a result, Bitcoin price will likely surge in the mid-term. Therefore, for the mid-term, the performance of the Japanese, US and Indian markets should be considered as reasons to hold onto Bitcoin as an investment."

cryptocurrency's total market cap as investors hedge with top altcoins.","Mar 20, 2017",Bitcoin’s scaling fight has led to a record low in its percentage of cryptocurrency’s total market cap as investors hedge with top altcoins. ,"As its user base expands, Bitcoin’s transactions have also grown, leading to blocks, capped at 1mb, to be filled to capacity. As a result, transactions have slowed and fees have spiked. An effort to solve Bitcoin’s scaling issues has led to a civil war of sorts between the Core development team and its supporters backing the Segregated Witness (SegWit) soft fork, and the Bitcoin Unlimited miner-directed block size hard fork and its supporters. In contrast to previous hard fork attempts (XT, Classic), Unlimited has gained speed, occasionally passing SegWit in adoption by miners. Recently, Unlimited has secured a solid lead, due in part to a major mining pool, Antpool, switching to Unlimited. “Bitcoin Jesus” Roger Ver, who has led the opposition to the current state of Bitcoin and its hard cap of 1mb blocks, has stated that he believes that the current inability to find a resolution to the issue has cost Bitcoin billions of dollars already: The damage caused by Core's intentional fee market via full blocks has already likely damaged Bitcoin's market cap by billions of dollars. As a result of increasing uncertainty, lack of usability and conflict surrounding Bitcoin, its growth has stagnated- even receded, while other coins have seen exceptional gains. Ethereum, cryptocurrency’s number two contender, has seen a massive increase, more than doubling in market cap and price in the last 10 days alone. It currently sits at about $4 bln total and $45 per coin, with a current trading volume of over $200 mln. Dash has seen even more impressive relative gains, multiplying its value and market cap five times over since one month ago. It has broken the three-digit barrier and appears to have settled above $100, having also broken 10 percent the price of Bitcoin per coin. As a result of this growth, Dash’s treasury, 10 percent of its block reward set aside for development and other projects, has passed $500,000 monthly, closing in on a million dollar monthly budget for the newly number three ranked coin. Monero has also picked up on the Bitcoin exodus, doubling in value over the last 10 days, maintaining a solid fourth place and passing $300 mln in market cap. This growth and reshuffling of the cryptocurrency field has led to a slipping in Bitcoin’s dominance. Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap has sunk to 70 percent, a new all-time low since the previous low of 74 percent during Ethereum’s initial boom last year. Total cryptocurrency market cap remains slightly lower than its all-time high, while combined altcoin value has grown from approximately $2.2 bln at the year’s start to over $7 bln now, nearly $4 bln of that growth over the last month alone. In spite of this growing shift, the Bitcoin scaling conflict continues to become more heated. Ver alleges that many Unlimited nodes identify as Core in order to avoid DDoS attacks, which have plagued Bitcoin.com all last week. Unlimited supporters have documented a pattern of alleged censorship on the Bitcoin subreddit, filtering out comments in support of an alternative implementation of Bitcoin than the one stewarded by the Core developers. Meanwhile, faced by increasing resistance from large mining pools, such as Antpool, Core member Peter Todd publicly mused about a proof-of-work algorithm change in order to reshuffle mining power as a “backup plan”: With some miners threatening 51% attacks against Bitcoin, researching a PoW change is a good backup plan: https://t.co/SEZ1qlxhAH Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s network congestion remains an issue. Low-end fees remain above 50 cents and the median confirmation time continues to rise. The mempool of backlogged transactions has filtered out slightly, though it still remains in excess of 20mb over a seven-day average. "

However, users in the online community wherein ginerbreadfutters made his announcement harshly criticized his decision to all in on Bitcoin after they discovered that he obtained the capital through a loan.To be specific, gingerbreadfutters acquired an equity loan of $325,239 on his house in order to purchase 191 Bitcoins.He stated:“I decided to make my newest lunge, using what equity I have accrued on my estate over the past 10 years since the 2008 financial crisis. If Bitcoin reaches the 10k mark — which I see as a distinct possibility, or I would not have taken such a risk — I plan on moving to the West Coast and getting away from all the angry people here where I currently reside.”An equity loan is a type of loan in which the equity of the borrower’s home is used as collateral. In other words, gingerbreadfutters is gambling on his life savings that is his real estate and betting yet another $325,000 obtained by using his life savings as collateral to make a mid-term profit on Bitcoin.More to that, gingerbreadfutters told his online community that he plans to sell all of his Bitcoins once Bitcoin price hits $10,000 and purchase new real estate on the west coast.However, the community criticized gingerbreadfutters’ extremely risky and frankly foolish investment strategy. Investors should always prevent from initiating risky investments for short and mid-term profit because there are potential situations wherein investors may be in urgent need of capital but their assets or money are locked up.Bitcoin is a highly liquid asset, investment and currency to posses. But, if gingerbreadfutters makes a slight mistake in his calculations and plans and risk his life savings, the entire mid-term Bitcoin investment strategy could end up as a disaster.Another online community user with the alias Dispairsquid16 efficiently analyzed gingerbreadfutters’ situation and investment mindset with an analogy:“Almost like a high school chemistry teacher deciding to begin making and selling crystal meth due to a change in life circumstances.”Gingerbreadfutters realized that he will not be able to live a long life due to an undisclosed terminal disease and thus, acknowledging that he has little to lose, he gambled his life savings and a massive debt obtained using his life savings as collateral to investment in Bitcoin.For any potential investors planning on investing in Bitcoin, it is an extremely risky approach to gamble a large amount of money on Bitcoin’s short and mid-term price trend."

Apparently, there has been an influx of capital as a result of many new participants within the industry.","According to Jeremy Epstein of Never Stop Marketing, there has been over $35 bln invested in crypto overall since the beginning of the year. Epstein notes that the tech and the space over all are becoming normalized. Hence the influx of new participants as investors seem to be more comfortable with the environment.Making specific reference to Bitcoin, Epstein says:“The most popular on-ramp to crypto is Bitcoin. It is the “reserve currency” of the crypto world, so everyone pretty much is going to have some of it. As more people join, the price will definitely go up.”Internet entrepreneur and cryptocurrency investor Vinny Lingham reveals his expectation for Bitcoin to reach $3,000 in 2017.This prediction was made in a series of tweets where he narrated his activities of the recent past and hopes for the future concerning Bitcoin and other altcoins.Lingham’s prediction comes just days before Bitcoin reached an all-time high of over $1,730.However, Lignham notes that he does not discuss his trades in alts and tokens in order to avoid influencing the market.Lingham says:“The reason I don't discuss my alt and token trades specifically is that I don't want to pump and dump coins. My profits there are honest.”President of Crypto Consultant, Jason Cassidy also indicates that achieving this landmark by Bitcoin is a possibility if the hard fork situation with Bitcoin's scaling issues can be resolved without too much damage to the reputation it enjoys today. “We saw how resilient the market was to an ETF rejection, creating only a minor, short-lived buying opportunity,” he says.  He explains that currently, Bitcoin serves as a store of value given its superior utility of moving around large amounts of wealth. Today, it is much easier to move millions of dollars of value via Bitcoin than it is through the traditional banking system, from both a time, cost, security and administrative (red tape) perspective.Cassidy also notes that mass adoption of Bitcoin will eventually take place if Bitcoin is able to offer consumers more than a settlement layer for high-value transactions.Cassidy explains:“Japan is beginning to experience this and we still have issues unresolved in the protocol that are well known. Consider the affect Japan is having on the price now, multiplied by several other countries simultaneously going through a similar adoption wave. Once this begins, it will be unlike anything comparable in recent human history and the $3,000 mark will be reached and exceeded in short order.""Read more: How to Buy Bitcoin: Best Practices, Where to Buy, Tips"

Some believe that Bitcoin should be regulated, while others are firm that Bitcoin should be left to its own devices.","Before legislators can take action, they must understand the nature of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This is a great challenge because the Blockchain Technology must be understood, as well as its impact on different industries. Even though many experts think that US is a step behind Bitcoin regulation, there seems to be ongoing progress this 2017.Let's take a look at the current regulation landscape in five prominent US States: Washington, Illinois, Hawaii, California, and Florida.Washington legislators have started creating new rules that will encompass Bitcoin transactions. Businesses with digital currency services are covered by these rules. The Senate Bill 5013 clarifies the definition of Cryptocurrency and includes various disclosure requirements on consumer information. The bill will also require online currency exchanges in Washington to maintain a surety bond.The bill was introduced in January and it’s already cleared to be sent to Governor Jay Inslee. Speculations about the bill are mostly positive. Despite this regulation progress, some Cryptocurrency-based startups are having doubts operating in the state. Washington has also applied heavier cybersecurity frameworks.When Secretary Bryan A. Schneider of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR) announced a new initiative that contains several Cryptocurrency implications, some factors were clarified. The initiative, known as Digital Currency Regulatory Guidance, was focused on digital currencies like Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and ZCash. The guidance increased the regulation of numerous activities related with digital currencies.According to Ciccolo, the IDFPR and Schneider will continue to deliver unwavering support to the innovation of Blockchain Technology. Ciccolo is also optimistic that Bitcoin technology will contribute to the financial innovation of Illinois.Relying on public leverage, Coinbase – a well-respected Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange – announced that it ceased offering support for customers in the State of Hawaii. The reasons pointed out are the “impractical” regulatory policies concerning Bitcoin in that state. This was based on the notice received by Coinbase, indicating that Cryptocurrency operators must hold case reserves equivalent to the values held by customers.Now that Hawaii is considering a bill that would create a working group focused on analyzing digital currencies and Blockchain technology, Coinbase leaders saw a new glimmer of hope. Once the bill is passed, Coinbase will resume working with regulators. This could mean a positive regulatory development for Hawaii.Recently, California’s Assembly Bill 1123 – a counterpart of New York’s BitLicense – was proposed. Once passed, the bill would enact the Virtual Currency Act – an initiative that would prevent a person from engaging with virtual currency businesses unless that person is officially licensed by the Commissioner of Business Oversight or exempted from the requirement.According to Kuskowski, the proposed bill should not be the direction to go in. Such level of regulation, just like BitLicense, caused New York to lose its prominence and status as a crypto hub. Apparently, with California’s position as tech innovation and startup capital of the world, the regulation will have greater catastrophic effects.Now that Florida House Bill 1379 was passed, many people will be aware of the full definition of virtual currency. The bill will also regulate and prohibit the use of virtual currency for money laundering. The term ‘virtual currency’ was officially added to the main definition of “money instruments” based on Florida’s Money Laundering Act. The bill is now with Florida’s governor and is expected to be signed soon.Kuskowski has also stated that a balance is needed among the side of legislators and Cryptocurrency users. People must also understand that a precise regulatory environment will help businesses in making strategic decisions. This way, many businesses can grow.While most of the states in US prefer to have Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to be heavily regulated, there are a few Bitcoin-friendly states such as Nevada where Blockchain transactions are not taxed, Texas and New Hampshire."

In an interview with CNBC, Hayter stated:""Arbitrage between the fiat pairs drags markets up or down in line with leading markets. At present, volumes on the KRW and JPY pairs dominate trading with a combined 48 percent market share.”Cointelegraph previously emphasized the importance of the Japanese and South Korean exchange markets on the global Bitcoin market. The two markets hold over 48.6 percent of the global bBtcoin exchange market share and represent the vast majority of institutional investors within Asia.Japan, in particular, has experienced an explosive growth in demand for Bitcoin as some of the country’s most influential conglomerates announced the launch of their independent digital currency exchanges, with the vision of facilitating fiat-to-digital currency trading securely and transparently, with low fees.Cointelegraph reported that a significant number of investors have started to fuel an altcoin bubble concentrated around Ripple and NEM.IndieSquare co-founder and Japan-based researcher Koji Higashi stated that the legalization of digital currency and the tax exemption of Bitcoin convinced beginner and casual cryptocurrency traders that every other cryptocurrencies are legitimate and well-based.However, Higashi noted that most investors are investing in cryptocurrencies apart from Bitcoin with relatively shallow knowledge and understanding of digital currencies.Higashi explained:“I think I know the answer now. Newly entering Japanese investors are driving this great altcoin bubble and not-so-smart money is flowing into the space especially into some altcoins at a rather concerning rate. Another thing to note about this new trend is that the general lack of understanding or appreciation of the technology by many of new users.”In the next few months, as Bitcoin maintains its momentum and upward trend, it is likely that the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange market will demonstrate some stability and see a decline in interest over alternative cryptocurrencies or altcoins. If so, the demand for Bitcoin will likely increase over time.Currently, analysts and researchers at mainstream media outlets such as CNBC and Bloomberg are attributing Bitcoin’s recent upward momentum to the economic uncertainty and instability of the US. This is a rational conclusion considering that the US replaced the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market for the first time in the past 12 months to become the largest Bitcoin exchange market."

As early as five a.m. GMT+2 on Saturday, CoinMarketCap listed the pacesetter of digital currency for $2014 with almost $34 mln Market Cap.The $2,000 lane has been expected for some time now but it intensified three days ago when Satoshi Nakamoto's brainchild stabilized at the $1,800 range.On Friday it made it to the $1,900s further increasing the $2,000 price obsession.As much as it is good news for the whole community, what does this mean for all of us? What is in it for the ecosystem? Experts and community members differ on what’s ahead.Bitcoin Price Pundit Vinny Lingham is not excited about the current price trend and sees it as very deleterious for the space. ""Not healthy in my opinion, but clearly everyone else knows best,"" he noted. ""I'll just wait and see.""More so, Gulden Wallet Developer, Malcolm Macleod's concern is that the price has been pushed too high, without the fundamentals to back it up and ultimately it is damaging to the ecosystem.He cites particularly the ongoing transaction queue problems.""These things are always a mixed bag, so probably some good and some bad things come from it,"" Malcolm stated.But Alexandro Colorado of Bitcoin Mexico believes otherwise. For him, even though Bitcoin certainly has the availability issue but the rally has merits. ""It makes sense as there is more money coming into the system,"" Alexandro explained to Cointelegraph.The Chief Cat Herder of Cryptopulco, the annual cryptocurrency conference in Acapulco, Mexico, Nathan T. Freeman had this to say:""BTC increases in value relative to USD because people are willing to give up more fiat currency in exchange for Bitcoin. If you try to explain why they are willing, you are projecting a motive for their subjective value, and you're most likely full of shit. Even if the motive you ascribe is correct, you can't prove it. It's just an unfalsifiable claim in a sea of individual choices. It's all good.""Though the network is growing impressively, hitting pass $2,000 seems like an impending doom for some experts.Whilst others point to some nagging fundamentals, many are optimistic it will keep growing without any blemish.Alexandro Colorado says:""A bubble is some sort of manipulation but actual growth is another thing. Companies grow billions in months, why crypto shouldn't? The Mexico-based Bitcoin enthusiast pointed out that a lot of the world still don't know or trust crypto but it doesn't mean we are heading into a bubble.”When Cointelegraph asked Vinny Lingham if there is an impending bubble, this was his answer:""Yes, but people who called the bubble in 2011 were wrong. It took two years to burst.""Malcolm MacLeod is unsure if there is going to be a burst, but it is unclear to him what fundamentals if there are any behind the latest price growth. ""I think there is a high chance that it is a bubble of some kind but I hope to be wrong,"" he indicated.Absorbingly, this is Nathan T. Freeman's take on whether it is a bubble and will it burst soon:“There's only one major event in Bitcoin itself that could shape the future, and that's the outcome of the block size debate. All other factors are outside the purview of Bitcoin itself and therefore could shape out. Anyway, you're talking about predicting the simultaneous global effect of huge political shifts.”""Predicting a bubble is a dice roll, and anyone who claims to know those outcomes is a coin-flipper,"" he added."

Leaders",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-scaling-consensus-reached-commentary-from-industry-leaders,"Bitcoin scaling solution consensus has been reached among key industry 
players. SegWit and 2MB block size increase to be implemented.","May 23, 2017","Monday, Cointelegraph has reported that a number of leading players of the Blockchain industry have reached a consensus in regards to the Bitcoin scaling solution. This break in the scaling debate stalemate is a new, highly significant boost for the Bitcoin ecosystem.","According to sources, a number of Bitcoin businesses owners, including Barry Silbert (Digital Currency Group), Roger Ver (Bitcoin.com) and major mining players Jihan Wu (Bitmain) and Valery Vavilov (BitFury), have come to a general agreement at the currently ongoing Consensus conference in New York.They have agreed to collectively enable the SegWit proposal for Bitcoin scaling, effective immediately. Additionally, their proposed solution includes a countdown to another hard fork, which will enable an increase of the block size limit to 2MB - as opposed to the current limit of 1MB.This means that the problem of Bitcoin scaling, that has been unresolved for years, could soon become a thing of the past. This news comes quite on time, as the number of transactions being stuck in the backlog has reached record heights in recent days.Until now, the community has been unable to come to a consensus on whether to enable Bitcoin scaling by activating SegWit, Bitcoin Unlimited, or some other technology.Some steps towards reaching an agreement were made before, including a meeting in February 2016 in Hong Kong. However, it differed in terms, and the discussion then did not include the people who have agreed to the current consensus.This time, the new solution has received enthusiastic approval from key members of the community. Regardless of the differences in their technical expertise and ideological outlook, industry members came to realise that a compromise between SegWit and a block size increase may be necessary for further progress.Cointelegraph has reached out to several key leaders of the Bitcoin industry, and asked them to comment on this major event:Sarah Maxwell, Blockchain.com:""The consensus realized today reflects our collective desire to see the industry move forward. We are grateful to join these partners and are committed to helping Bitcoin reach its full potential to improve the lives of billions across the globe.""Valery Vavilov, CEO BitFury:""We are glad that consensus has been finally reached. BitFury, along with vast majority, is fully supporting this historic decision. This is a very important moment for the ecosystem with this solution setting the new chapter for the Bitcoin technology.""Ben Peters of Bitso.com:“I think it's an important step forward - it's taking Bitcoin over a major hurdle, and facilitating future scaling, while relieving what had become something of a short term crisis. I think the most significant thing about it is, however, that it was possible to reach a compromise within a community of very strongly-held and conflicting views. This bodes very well for Bitcoin's future growth and development.Both elements of the agreement contribute to transaction capacity increase, which means greater efficiency with respect to on-chain transaction cost. Segwit in particular helps open the door to the second-tier scaling solutions that will make small/micro transactions viable, so that's really exciting.Overall, I'm really proud that it was possible to navigate this issue. I have always felt that all parties were acting in good faith in this debate, and I think that this agreement proves that.”David Schwartz, Chief Cryptographer at Ripple:“We’ve been saying that governance is important for many years. That the idea that you could have a decentralized system that just magically governed itself just doesn’t seem to be realistic. There are going to be decisions that have to be made: somebody wants SegWit, somebody doesn’t want SegWit; somebody has to win, and somebody has to lose. And there has to be some process to make that decision, or you are going to have, essentially, a war over every decision.And so I’m very pleased to hear that Bitcoin has reached some sort of agreement, and hopefully we’ll get some resolution to the block size problem. We’ve been focusing on governance from day 1. We have a system that’s governed by users, rather than miners, that we think aligns incentives better.”Charlie Shrem:""This is an important event because it represents the larger business and miner community who know what their users want.""Moe Levin, Director of European Business Development at BitPay:""I think there’s a lot of disagreement and there aren’t many good forums for people to discuss this without feeling a lot of pressure. And that makes progress difficult. There are some solutions which look more promising than others, and I guess time is the only thing that will be able to tell which is best. There are protocols which support better solutions.""Konstantin Gladych, CEO at Changelly:""I appreciate the consensus on the scaling solution. Bitcoin remains the stronghold of the crypto world. Changelly's users will be glad to hear the network will soon allow for faster transactions, as the demand increases drastically.""Charles Hoskinson, CEO & Founder at IOHK:""Segregated Witness is actually kind of a clever idea. It's well-tested, it's been around for a few years, it solves a few real problems, like transaction malleability, and it gives us a little bit more runway. It also activates things like the Lightning Network, so I think it's overall very good for Bitcoin. I think the holdover was seeing if it worked in practice, and since Litecoin adopted it, it was kind of the last mile, and now there is a lot of support for it.It's more of a gradual evolution of what features and functionality does Bitcoin need to adopt, to scale in a more general type of a system. So you think about overlay protocols like Lightning, or if you want to do things like microtransactions, and the system is never really going to be able to do that well with its current design. So being able to open that up is very encouraging. And it leaves the door open for future solutions, such as sidechains. Maybe in two-three years if that proves itself out, and we get better iterations, we'll see that work its way into the system as well.""Juan Llanos, Senior Advisor at One World Identity:""There's two worlds here: there's one world that has a vested interest in seeing the capacity of the blocks grow, so that there's more transactionality, more users on the platform; rather than just holders of Bitcoin for a storage of value, as investment, as a new asset class. So if you're a transactional firm, if you're selling services that have to do with the transactionality of Bitcoin - obviously you want more throughput in the technology. You want to compete with other payment networks, you want to become a more viable alternative. And the argument against the growth of the block is that it compromises security, because the point of having a smaller block is that the system is more resilient and less vulnerable to some form of attack.So, the more conservative thinkers, or the less commercially-focused people within the Bitcoin community want to take a more conservative approach, and they want Bitcoin to maintain the structure it has today, and they want to build the transactionality, and the speed, and the throughput on a higher-layer technology that they are building. You could also argue that they have a vested interest in the blocks being small so that their technologies and their solutions become successful. This is the way I see it - I think, it's all about commercial interest, or economics, or game theory.It's happening, and it happens everywhere, so the question is 'what's gonna give?' and 'who is gonna compromise?' and 'how is this gonna resolve?' These are the question marks for everyone - we have no idea, and we've been in the industry for years. But it's a very interesting experiment in distributed and non-institutional governors, if you will. It's a distributed system, where people are working on technology, they have the building infrastructure, they're building services, and there's no one making decisions. It's a fascinating world, and it's part of the new revolution in distributed technology.""Brian Armstrong, CEO & Founder at Coinbase:""I was excited to see a scaling solution come out for Bitcoin, combining 2 megabyte hard fork with SegWit. Bitcoin has been really struggling to scale for a while, and I'm looking forward to seeing a solution for that. It's great to see the industry come together and come to an agreement.""Dirk Siegel, Partner At Deloitte Germany, Lead at Blockchain Institute In ZGermany:""Firstly, it's a debate that was obviously necessary, because the block size was being reached. It was very important to have that issue resolved. We were watching this very closely, because we see it as a litmus test for how the ecosystem works. Whether it has the ability to structure, to overcome such situations, and if it can reform from inside.The fact that a consensus has been announced is a very important sign. A large number of important players seem to be on its side, as they have just announced. We believe that it will in all probability go ahead, and that would be a very good sign that the Bitcoin community has the capability to take these decisions. Nobody knows at this stage whether this will lead to some kind of fork - which could, of course, happen, if you don't have 100% on your side. It could be a hard fork, but maybe it clears itself out quite quickly, where the 10% or 5% that remain will join the larger community. Overall, we are very bullish and think that this is the right decision, and it will make Bitcoin a viable solution for the future.""The significance of solving the problem of Bitcoin scaling cannot be overstated, as it finally enables the cryptocurrency to be used by the vast mainstream audience - something, which was considered impossible before.UPDATE: the official statement on the Bitcoin Scaling Agreement at Consensus 2017 has been released by the Digital Currency Group."

The average trading value of Bitcoin was similar throughout the Japanese and US Bitcoin exchange markets, at $1,430.","On April 29, only two days ago, Cointelegraph reported that Bitcoin price established a new all-time high at $1,377. At the time, analysts including BKCM CEO Brian Kelly attributed the upward trend of Bitcoin price to the US Securities Exchange Commission’s decision to re-examine the Winklevoss twins’ Bitcoin ETF COIN proposal.""The SEC is concerned about how most of the markets [for Bitcoin] has traded outside of the US with no regulatory oversight. As of this point, I don't think the SEC would approve the ETF. What would change my mind is if the ETF or SEC only traded Bitcoin on regulated exchanges,” said Kelly.Since then, Bitcoin price increased by another five percent. Although Bitcoin price has declined slightly upon reaching its new all-time high, over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin price demonstrated a 7.3 percent increase and it is currently averaged at $1,437.Many analysts including Bitfury Group executive vice chairman George Kikvadze, attributed the recent surge in Bitcoin price to the explosive growth of the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market and the activation of SegWit on Litecoin.Kikvadze writes:Japan; new btc apps and inst. investors driving price twrds $1500; if we activate well-tested; no risk scaling #segwit - easily at $5000The Japanese government’s legalization of Bitcoin and the elimination of taxes for Bitcoin trading have hugely impacted the Bitcoin trading ecosystem and the demand for the digital currency in Japan. Some of Japan’s largest financial companies including SBI Group have begun to involve themselves in the Bitcoin industry by supporting and funding various projects.More importantly, Kikvadze predicted that Bitcoin price would most likely achieve $5,000 with SegWit enabled. Also, Bitcoin price is increasing due to the full activation of SegWit on Litecoin. As the cryptocurrency community has finally seen the possibility of SegWit being activated on a successful digital currency, the community has become more optimistic toward the activation of SegWit on Bitcoin.Also, Kikvadze explained that during a meeting, high profile investors unanimously agreed that they are interested in Bitcoin but are only willing to “massively” invest in Bitcoin once SegWit is activated.“Just finished a two-week roadshow with investors. Message: We love Bitcoin but need to sort out scaling before we massively invest. Active SegWit!,” said Kikvadze."

With the exception of 2014, which was affected by the downfall of now-defunct Mt. Gox, Bitcoin has continuously recorded positive daily value change since 2010.Bitcoin average DAILY value change: 2010: +0.82% 2011: +0.76% 2012: +0.26% 2013: +1.11% 2014: -0.25% 2015: +0.09% 2016: +0.22% 2017: +0.66%In the past three years, Bitcoin price has increased exponentially, surging by 0.09, 0.22 and 0.66 percent in 2015, 2016 and 2017 respectively on a daily basis. In 2017, Bitcoin price increased by 0.66 percent on a daily basis, as Bitcoin price surged from $980 to $2750 within a six-month period.If Lopp’s Bitcoin daily gain since 2010 is considered, by 2020, Bitcoin price should reach $250,000. This, of course, assumes that Bitcoin price will increase at an average rate of 0.42 percent on a daily basis.Bitcoin’s value cannot be predicted based on a linear calculation and graph. Bitcoin’s growth in terms of user base and market cap is exponential and because of it, Bitcoin price can’t be calculated with one certain formula.However, Lopp stated that the miracle of compound interest makes the $250,000 by 2020 calculation nonlinear.“It's not linear due to the miracle of compound ""interest."" 0.42 percent of tomorrow's value is > 0.42 percent of today's value,” said Lopp.As we reported, an increasing number of mainstream media outlets and analysts have started to compare Bitcoin and its growth to that of reserve currencies and major assets such as gold.Most recently, ABC News, a national news service in Australia produced by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and The Wall Street Journal have been offering extensive coverage on Bitcoin price by comparing the cryptocurrency to the performance of the US dollar, euro, Japanese yen and British pound.Alan Silbert, senior vice president at Capital One Healthcare and founder of BitPremier, revealed that the traditional Wall Street Journal newspaper demonstrated the growth chart of gold and Bitcoin on its front page as interest and demand toward Bitcoin have been on the rise.If scaling issues of Bitcoin become resolved and more investor begin to purchase Bitcoin as both a digital currency and digital gold, it is possible for Bitcoin to grow at the predicted rate of Lopp. In fact, Xapo CEO Wences Casares shared that Business Insider CEO Henry Blodget recently claimed Bitcoin price could go up to $1 mln."

In a bear market, Bitcoin is reasserting itself vis-a-vis altcoins.","The frenzied demand for altcoins over the past few months has resulted in almost all coins witnessing a multifold increase in price. It didn’t matter which altcoin you picked in March, almost all of them have gone through the roof.While Bitcoin price has steadily increased, its dominance has steadily decreased as altcoins (Ethereum, Ripple, Dash amongst others) outperformed it. Bitcoin’s dominance went below the psychologically important level of 50 percent on May 16, in spite of Bitcoin scaling agreement negotiations.One of the real challengers to Bitcoin’s dominance has been Ripple. At its peak, Ripple had a market capitalization of $17 bln and accounted for about 25 percent of the total crypto market cap. However, over the last one week, its price has fallen sharply and it has lost approximately 60 percent of its value in BTC terms.The steady challenger to Bitcoin remains Ethereum, which now accounts for 20 percent of the total crypto market capitalization. The contribution of Ethereum to the total crypto market capitalization has remained between 15 to 20 percent over the last two months.Other coins like Litecoin, Monero, Dash and NEM have risen substantially but have not mounted a serious challenge to Bitcoin.​In a bear market like the current one, the demand for tether has increased substantially. Although the value of one tether is supposed to be pegged to $1, traders at crypto exchanges are paying up to $1.08 for one tether. Those buying tether are locking in profits by moving out of cryptocurrencies and would look to reenter the market at an appropriate time. The premium payable for tether is expected to go down, once stability returns to the crypto markets."

These factors, especially remittance, have much to do with Africa, whose composition of developing countries have what will strengthen the rise and use of Bitcoin for several financial purposes in the coming years.Remittance is gradually becoming a major boost for Bitcoin use in Africa - as well as in parts of Asia and Latin America. The advent of new services that use the digital currency for the purpose of sending money from one point to another has started eating into the roughly $4 bln per year cost that banks and other institutions make from international transfers to Africa.As earlier reported, many countries in this region - and in Asia - have the most expensive transfer rates in the world as well as bureaucratic processes that make sending and receiving money to and from loved ones a little difficult. This is a major reason why the promotion of the ease of use that Bitcoin brings is essential.Bitwala, for example, notes that transferring money to South East Asia is cheaper than it is to Africa where banks and intermediaries charge high fees and manipulate currency rates to their advantage. The majority of banks charge between 10-19 percent on any transfers to, from and within African countries.The payment service provider points to a leaked document from Santander, a major Spanish banking group, as confirming the dangers of using banks.""In 2016, the bank made €585 mln solely from international money transfers, making up 10 percent of all of its revenue, it says. In addition to transfer fees, the bank also made another killing by controlling its foreign currency exchange which helped it earn €290 mln.""Perhaps the most shocking part is that 80 percent of all global money transfers are still conducted via banks and conventional monetary transfer channels.Bitwala adds that the number of signups from developing countries on its platform is almost as those in the US and the EU in total - developing countries forming approximately 30 percent of its new signups globally. Bitwala recently launched into Africa to compete for market share with other companies like BitPesa, BITSSA and Luno.Africa boasts some of the top developing markets in the world presently. This is the main reason why the continent’s market of over a billion people stands a chance to be at the center of a share struggle in a couple of years.Africa has the youngest population in the world - about a quarter of a billion people aged 15 to 29 in Africa as of 2010. Current trend indicates that this figure will double by 2045, according to the 2012 African Economic Outlook report prepared by experts from the African Development Bank (AfDB), the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and the industrialized countries’ Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), among others.Fast forward to 2017, the October 2016 IMF’s World Economic Outlook shows that 12 of the top 25 world’s fastest-growing economies are in Africa.These countries, according to the outlook, will continue their growth into 2019 where the latest forecast stops. The growing Internet connection rate, particularly in Africa, will also add to the increasing interest in Bitcoin.Most of the emerging figures from Africa apply in the LATAM region where a series of events are now being put together to widen the understanding of the burgeoning economy and how to enhance access to income easily, cutting down costs and not necessarily relying on the use of a physical structure.""A key barrier to the projected rise, however, is not its untapped market potentials or for the infrastructures. Rather, it is the lack of awareness."""

Bitcoin’s public image altered drastically due to a rapid increase in global adoption.An increasing number of investors and users have begun to understand that Bitcoin’s transparent nature disallows the cryptocurrency from being completely anonymous and, therefore, it makes it possible to track Bitcoin transactions.On a show hosted by CNBC, Cramer stated that the recent surge of Bitcoin price can be attributed to the mass purchase of Bitcoin by European banks to pay off hackers and ransomware distributors.He said:""I think it could because the European banks are frantically trying to buy them so they can pay off ransomware. It's a short-term way to be able to deal with cybersecurity. It is the way to pay off the bad guys.”Such claim is evidently non-factual because the European Bitcoin exchange market only accounts for nine percent of the global Bitcoin exchange market and it is behind the US, Japan, China and South Korea in trading volumes. Hence, if European banks are causing Bitcoin price to surge, it needs to have absolute dominance over the market. A nine percent market share doesn't have a major influence over the 44.9 billion market cap of bitcoin.More importantly, Cramer’s statement fails to consider the fact that Bitcoin is being utilized as a currency and safe haven asset more than it is being used as a lifeline to feed ransomware developers.In the case of WannaCry ransomware, the biggest ransomware attack in history, the distributors earned less than $100,000. That is only 0.0012 percent of the European Bitcoin exchange market. Thus, to say that Bitcoin price is rising because of 0.0012 percent of traders from the fifth largest Bitcoin exchange market is not an accurate depiction of the surging Bitcoin price.Adam White, head of Coinbase’s digital currency exchange, said on CNBC in regards to Cramer’s statement that Bitcoin price is surging as a result of victims paying criminals: “I think that’s a stretch.”Regardless, Cramer believes that Bitcoin price will reach $1 mln one day due to its rapidly increasing trading volumes and demand from investors. Users of Bitcoin are expecting an alternative financial system to banks and existing financial networks.If Bitcoin enters the $1 mln region, it will be competing with the reserve currencies of the world."

transaction processing competition on the Bitcoin Blockchain. This, in 
essence, ...","Mar 30, 2017","Bitcoin mining is the process of adding transaction records to Bitcoin's public ledger of past transactions. In the early days of Bitcoin, mining was performed by individual computers running the Bitcoin nodes as they compete to solve algorithmic problems while confirming transactions on the Bitcoin Blockchain.","The fastest computer to solve a particular problem is rewarded with a specific amount of Bitcoin, and that is how new coins are introduced into the ecosystem, hence the term “Bitcoin Mining.”As time passed, “Bitcoin halving” factors in, technology improves and more efficient mining equipment developed. This gave rise to increased mining difficulty as the rate of competition skyrocketed.Instead of having millions of individual computers independently mining Bitcoins across the globe as is assumed to have been the original intention of Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, what is obtainable nowadays is the installation of massive mining farms.A Bitcoin mining farm is usually comprised of a huge number of processors, known as mining pools. These pools are interconnected to compete as a single unit in the transaction processing competition on the Bitcoin Blockchain. This, in essence, automatically makes it extremely difficult for small independent miners to carry out mining profitably.One major factor that determines the viability of Bitcoin mining is the return on investment (ROI).Jure Pirc sees Bitcoin mining in 2017 as a very challenging adventure. He notes that every person or company that decides to invest in Bitcoin mining must understand that the current ROI time for the most efficient miner on the market ""Antminer T9"" is between 9-11 months. However, ROI time varies with energy and cooling costs. Therefore, countries with affordable electricity and a cooler climate hold a big advantage when it comes to mining profitability.Another important factor to mention is that the ROI calculation is also based on the prevailing network difficulty which keeps increasing as time goes on.Concerning mining hardware equipment, Pirc says:“I get quite a lot of requests to assist and advise with setting up Bitcoin mining operations and almost always the end result is that it makes more sense to set up a GPU mining rig where a user/miner has a lot more choice.”“When it comes to choosing the currency one wishes to mine, while with Bitcoin ASIC devices the only choice is to mine SHA256 based cryptocurrencies. There are a few of these out there that are still in the proof of work phase,” Pirc adds.For newcomers to the Bitcoin ecosystem, Pirc thinks that the individual mining process could be a very complex adventure.Blockchain Research Specialist Sean Brizendine describes the profitability of Bitcoin mining in 2017 as an unpredictable phenomenon considering the parameters involved in it.He says:“Bitmain sells an Antminer T9-12.5TH/s for $1,205 beginning April 10 (pre-paid). So you’re looking at $204.84 a month, with electricity costing $93.60, meaning that the profit after electricity is around $111.24 a month.”In Brizendine’s opinion, Bitcoin mining is not a particularly great investment but for the purpose of maintaining the network, he advises holders of a lot of Bitcoins to run at least one miner, regardless of the little profit.“Right now I would personally buy and run one Bitcoin miner to support decentralization and contribute to the strength of the Bitcoin network and also invest heavily into buying the Bitcoins and holding them in a cold storage hardware wallet like a Trezor or KeepKey,” he concludes.Aaron Foster, co-founder and CEO of TheBitPoint, explains that Bitcoin mining profitability depends on Bitcoin price. Given the scaling situation, if not resolved one way or the other he thinks that returns will be in the negative. Even worse, a hard fork with two chains, giving rise to the mining of either BTU or BTC.Foster also notes that the lifespan of the hardware must be put into consideration, figuring out how long before a mining device becomes obsolete:“The best way to profit from Bitcoin for the smaller investor is with the buy and hold strategy for now. Unless you can get some ant miners cheaply and have really cheap or free electricity.”Fred Gondzar, president/CEO of Healthy Wealth, LLC, is of the opinion that being part of a mining club is the best approach for anyone who wants to earn rewards from the complex environment of Bitcoin mining. He speaks from the standpoint of a participant of such arrangements and claims to receive his dividends on a daily basis.Gondzar says:“From my perspective, it is a good idea to be involved in Bitcoin mining, however, not as an individual but as a member of a Bitcoin mining club that is mining on a large scale. I am in a couple of groups that are mining like that, and it is paying me daily, so I am in favor of it.”Clearly, Bitcoin mining in 2017 could be a complex adventure which depends on several factors. However, with proper planning and a conducive environment, individuals can still benefit from the Bitcoin ecosystem through mining."

It is also the most common way to go through the liquidation process. The loss of 37.08% will have the same effect on all members' assets.”Bitfinex only this month announced it had fully recapitalized and was able to purchase back tokens issued when its users received a 36 percent tax on their balances.The move caused mixed reactions, with ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees notably calling it “fucking amazing.”At the same time, users who sold off their tokens early after they dipped in value have no recourse to their original funds and have lost out.Whether Yapizon will instigate a full token scheme remains to be seen. Interim measures make reference to a sequential payment scheme where users will be repaid in so-called “fei” tokens, but the process appears overly convoluted.A number of cryptocurrency exchanges experienced hacks in 2016, including ShapeShift."

This, in turn, has also affected other cryptocurrencies and pushed them to decrease in value as people are massively selling as a result.While many investors are not happy with the crash of Coinbase as a result of the Asian frenzy, it could prove a good sign for the cryptocurrency market. Since the increase in the value of the cryptocurrency market, many investors have been putting their money in various other cryptocurrency platforms in order to take advantage of the riding trend. Coinbase also rode along this trend when hundreds of investors decided to try investing in their platform as well.According to a graph reported by Cryptorial, it can be seen that since early 2016, there has been a sharp increase in the number of Coinbase users, up until after January 2017 (refer to the graph below).- Source: Naira DigitThis did not bode well for Coinbase as their system could not withstand the significant surge in followers. At the same time, this sign shows how much of a high demand cryptocurrencies have. Although it may look bad at the moment, the cryptocurrency market should experience positive growth in the future due to surging investors.With all the panic selling occurring after the crash of Coinbase, both Ethereum and Bitcoin present an opportunity for other investors to jump in and invest.Earlier this year, Bitcoin reached an all-time high and Ethereum saw steady growth. As reported by a monthly graph by Cryptocurry, it can be seen that after March, the price skyrocketed up sometime in the earlier part of May and went down again. It then slowly regained its momentum but slowly went down. Ethereum, on the other hand, has maintained stability this year and is expected to go up again later in the year (refer to the graph below).- Source: CryptocurryOf course, this only shows a temporary decrease in value for most cryptocurrencies because of the panic selling that is happening due to the crash of Coinbase.However, this would be a good opportunity for more established cryptocurrency platforms like Ethereum and Bitcoin to get more investors. This is also good for the investors in a sense that even the newer investors can take part in the opportunity of investing in a medium that has a lot of room for growth. It is also an opportunity for Coinbase to improve their system so that they may cater to the number of investors that will be putting their money into cryptocurrencies in the near future when the price goes up.With the price of cryptocurrencies expected to rise by another tenfold this year, it would not be a good idea to sell everything just yet."

capitalization as well as the price of Bitcoin and top altcoins.","May 5, 2017",Mainstream adoption of Bitcoin goes hand in hand with an increase in market capitalization as well as the price of Bitcoin and top altcoins.,"Bob Wood of Nexxus University says:“Cryptocurrency is advancing rapidly with technology solutions that are far outpacing the marketplace development of the mainstream public.”Still, in the very early stages of development with a consistently growing density of adoption, certain factors are considered of utmost importance and fundamental to the development of the crypto industry in general.Wood explains that the most important elements for mainstream adoption mirror those of previous new technologies like the personal computer and the Internet. They include public awareness and knowledge, a perceived user benefit sometimes referred to as the ""killer app,"" convenience and ease of use, safety and security.According to Wood, very little is currently being done to advance the benefits of cryptocurrency from the tech world to the mainstream public. As more business-oriented entrepreneurs develop cryptocurrency solutions, more thought will go into meeting the needs for mainstream adoption.He notes that the prevailing rate of growth for mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency will need to be accelerated to see acceptance rates similar to previous new technologies. Wood says:“The personal computer was invented around 1975 but didn't see mainstream adoption until 1990 with the prevalence of the graphical user interface for usability. The Internet was commercially available around 1990 but didn't see mainstream adoption until after the turn of the century. Cryptocurrency is in the early stages of only eight years since its invention and is currently comparable to green screens and floppy drives of the personal computer era in the early 1980s. Based on these previous new technologies, cryptocurrency may not reach full mainstream adoption until after 2025.” Nexxus is assisting non-tech mainstream public users in learning what cryptocurrency is and how it can benefit them. Wood says Nexxus is taking the technology to the people rather than trying to take the people to the technology:“We need to meet people where they are most comfortable and lead them to the virtues of cryptocurrency.” The CEO of Netcoins, Michael Vogel, thinks that the idea of mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency is subjective:“Personally, I've never seen Bitcoin as something that needs to be accepted by brick and mortar retailers in order to be considered mainstream.”He continues by explaining that Bitcoin is a valuable tool for e-commerce, remittance, micropayments, peer to peer lending, store of value and many other applications.The use cases continue to grow and Bitcoin is already being used in ways that cash, credit cards and gold simply cannot function.Vogel also notes that there are major league American sports teams that accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. “I would absolutely consider that mainstream adoption,” he says.Also making particular reference to the early days of the Internet, Vogel notes that even though a lot of users were actively online by the late 1990s, the majority of the population simply had no Internet access (or perceived need for access), while some even shunned the idea of owning a computer.Vogel explains that the Internet was not doomed to fail because it wasn't being used by everyone at that point in time.He concludes by noting that he expects a similar trajectory with Bitcoin, except with Bitcoin serving as a behind the scenes backbone for consumers accustomed to fiat currency."

largest financial communications platform for the investing community, ...","May 14, 2017","Both Bitcoin and gold are considered prominent stores of value and safe haven assets. However, over the past seven years, one experienced a meteoric rise in terms of market cap, user base and value, while the other failed to live up to the expectations of its investors.","On May 13, StockTwits, the world’s largest financial communications platform for the investing community, revealed one of its users’ growth chart comparing various currencies, bonds and assets. In it, a StockTwits user by the name of Charlie Bilello noted that a $10,000 investment in Bitcoin made in July 2010 would have earned investors a $200 mln return.To be exact, a Bitcoin investor who purchased $10,000 worth of Bitcoin in 2010 would have earned $201.56 mln.In contrast, an investor who purchased $10,000 worth of gold in 2010 would have experienced a negative return of $9,981.Gold is widely regarded as a safe haven asset, which by definition means an investment that retains or increases its value amidst market turbulence and economic certainty, over time. In the past seven years, gold hasn’t met either of the two descriptions. Gold has failed to sustain its value over a seven-year period and has failed to see an increase in its value. Thus, whether gold can still be considered as a safe haven asset is quite unclear.Since July of 2010, Bitcoin has significantly outperformed the Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Euro, Silver, Gold, US Dollar, bonds, global stocks, US real estate and US stocks. Naturally, its decentralized nature, high liquidity and transportability began to appeal to a wide range of investors seeking for alternative assets to protect their wealth with a long-term investment.In many ways, Bitcoin can be perceived as Gold 2.0, or digital gold, due to its characteristics. Unlike gold, Bitcoin can sustain its value or even record an increase in its value over time because of its fixed supply of 21 mln Bitcoins. If a massive gold supply is discovered, then gold could become inflationary in terms of supply and could hinder its mid-term value.In fact, in late March, China’s largest gold mine to date was discovered by Shangdong Gold Group, a state-owned gold producer in China. At the time, Bloomberg reported:“The Xiling mine in Shandong province told local authorities it had found 382.58 tons of gold reserves and that the volume could reach more than 550 tons once exploration is completed in two years.”More importantly, Bitcoin’s ownership is evidently portrayed with the utilization of cryptography. Hence, Bitcoin can’t be seized by a central entity because the Bitcoin network itself is decentralized and unalterable.Furthermore, Bitcoin provides an important component which gold fails to offer and that is settlement network. Bitcoin as of current is often referred to as digital gold and settlement network. It isn’t necessarily perceived as digital cash as laid out by Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto because of the lack of scaling and the network’s high transaction fees."

Since 2008, though, it hasn’t been an easy ride for the currency, which has experienced many highs and lows on its journey to acceptance.","Let’s take a seat then as we revisit some of Bitcoin’s major crashes up to the present day, with this handy infographic from Investoo, a learn to trade website.According to legend, it’s believed that Satoshi Nakamoto initially began working on the idea of Bitcoin in 2007. However, it wasn’t until 2008, that a paper by the elusive Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, was published.On Jan. 3, 2009, the Genesis Block was mined, while the first Bitcoin transaction in block 170, took place between Satoshi and Hal Finney, on Jan. 12, 2009, kicking off what has been a roller coaster ride for the currency.It wasn’t until Feb. 9, 2011, however, that Bitcoin achieved parity with the US dollar, costing $1 per Bitcoin at Mt Gox. Yet, despite the Bitcoin.org website struggling to handle traffic at the news of Bitcoin’s parity, on June 19, 2011, the Bitcoin price fell $3 within minutes to less than $16 after the Mt Gox hacking.A repeat incident took place again on Feb. 11, 2012, when the Bitcoin price dropped by $2 to around $4 after Paxum ceased accepting the currency.Several weeks later on March 1, the Bitcoin price plunged to $4.89 after 46,000 Bitcoin were stolen in the Linode hacking, at the time worth just under $230,000.Even though the currency rose slightly in the proceeding months of 2012, on Aug. 17, 2012, the Bitcoin price dropped by $3 to less than $11 after Priateat40 stopped Bitcoin payments.Over the proceeding months, Bitcoin price steadily rose as interest in the currency increased. However, on April 10, 2013, the currency crashed $60 to just $122 in what was reported to be an apparent distributed denial of service attack.Later in the year, on Dec. 5, 2013, People’s Bank of China bans Bitcoin transactions, causing the currency to nosedive $300 to $840.On Feb. 7, 2014, Bitcoin records a $100 drop as major exchanges experience widespread DDoS attacks. Bitcoin miners and developers block size debate on Feb. 21, 2014 sees the currency plunging $30. While the announcement of the closure of Mt Gox on Feb. 24, 2014, causes Bitcoin to drop by around $57 to $550.After the IRS declares Bitcoin as a property on March 26, 2014, Bitcoin plummets by $150 to $453.Bitstamp suspended its service after a hack, which saw 19,000 bitcoin stolen; however, nearly a week later, it reopened.The currency continues to rise and fall over the next year and on August 19, 2015 Bitcoin price declines by $45 to $214 after the release of new client software XT Fork, in a bid to resolve the scalability question.Despite a slight increase in price, it then fell by $50 to $334 as its sign was accepted into Unicode on Nov. 3, 2015.After Mike Hearn terms Bitcoin a ‘failure’ on Jan. 14, 2016, the Bitcoin price records a $40 decline.Later that year, the second-biggest security breach took place at the Bitfinex bitcoin exchange when hackers stole 120,000 bitcoin on Aug. 2, 2016.Fast-forward to 2017 and on the Jan. 5, Bitcoin plunges 31 percent to $889 as Chinese officials mull restrictions on Bitcoin transactions.While it certainly hasn’t been an easy ride for the currency, the fact that it’s still here is a testament to the fact that people believe in the currency despite the setbacks it experiences.- © Bitcoin Trading Investoo.com"

launched through an ICO held on the Poloniex Exchange. However ...","Apr 18, 2017","Let’s face it, Bitcoin is currently dominating the market, but altcoins cannot be just brushed off, they are maturing as well and are ready to provide a keen and tough competition.","There is one coin, however, which, as claimed by its founders, cannot even be called an “altcoin.” Meet Bitcoin Plus - the next great cryptocurrency.The history of Bitcoin Plus goes back to early 2014 when the coin was launched through an ICO held on the Poloniex Exchange. However, it turned out that the ICO was carried to fund not the cryptocurrency but holidays of the original developer who escaped with collected funds somewhere in the south direction.Later on, Bitcoin Plus went into rehab as a few truly dedicated community members formed a team, hired a coder to fix the wallet and introduced the sustainability plan.Yule Mills, one of the team leaders at Bitcoin Plus, explains to Cointelegraph:“The original developers created a great coin but it appeared they had ulterior motives, therefore they soon abandoned the coin. I was the original investor and have loved it since I first found out about it in May 2014. I think it is Bitcoin but reincarnated with many improvements and rarities, hence the added Plus in the name of the coin.”The cryptocurrency has evolved greatly, especially during the last year. Originally, XBC was purely a Proof-of-Stake coin, however, a bunch of recent updates included the ability to secure the network using Proof-of-Work, therefore Bitcoin Plus is what is now known as a hybrid POS/POW. This means that if the network ever faces a serious issue, things can be moved along manually by switching on Proof-of-Work for a short period.Bitcoin Plus has one mln coins to respond to 21 mln Bitcoins, it is characterized by a much faster block processing time and can handle eight times more transactions than Bitcoin. Mills points out that the best feature of Bitcoin Plus is the 20 percent annual staking until all one mln coins have been staked. In his opinion, this feature alone is currently driving the market wild.Mills comments:“Bitcoin Plus went from $.08 in January 2016 to a high of $131 just last month. That's serious.”There is an opinion that what is good for Bitcoin has a positive impact on other cryptocurrencies. But what about the problems currently faced by Bitcoin, are they any relevant in the rest of the cryptocurrency space?Scalability has always been an issue for Bitcoin but recently the network has been running out of capacity, transaction fees have been getting higher, while the speed of processing was significantly decreasing.The SegWit vs. BU debate has been going on and on for months and it doesn’t look like we are going to see a conclusion any time soon. How do these block games affect Bitcoin Plus?Well, XBC has a much shorter average block processing time - 60 seconds compared to that of Bitcoin, therefore the Bitcoin Plus network is able to handle 10 times more transactions every 10 minutes.Besides, the block size limit of Bitcoin Plus is much larger standing at 1.5 MB. The average transaction size of Bitcoin Plus is very similar to its predecessor, therefore every block is able to fit as many as 3,030 transactions or 50.5 transactions per second.The Bitcoin Plus team assures that it will take a long time before users have to start worrying about any scalability issues.Mills says to Cointelegraph:“Regarding scaling issues, the original Bitcoin can handle, as fact, less than seven transactions per second compared to Bitcoin Plus which can handle 50+ transactions per second. We are keeping a close eye on SegWit vs. Unlimited and, truthfully, I don't think either idea is a good one. The thing about Bitcoin Plus that works is we have a team that agrees on things. If Bitcoin Plus needs to scale we will scale to Visa level if needed.”The current team of Bitcoin Plus consists of several community members who run the website, BitcoinTalk Forum Thread, Block Explorers, 24/7 nodes and ensure the sustainability of the coin.The team is open, accessible and their intentions are transparent. It also seems that they are trying to engage the community in the development of the coin, offering ideas for updating of the network for voting and extensively reporting on the completion of upvoted ideas.Isn’t it what the cryptocurrency space is all about? Absolute freedom, flexibility and the ability to reach consensus? With all this packaged in Bitcoin Plus, it is expected that the project will attain great success.Mills concludes:“Bitcoin would be an altcoin if it wasn't so successful. I don't consider Bitcoin Plus an altcoin. It's a force to be reckoned with, and you are going to see Bitcoin Plus on a mass scale soon.”"

The paper is to be released in July.,"In it, the Inter-Disciplinary Committee within India’s Ministry of Finance seeks to examine the existing global regulatory and legal structures governing virtual currencies and suggest measures for dealing with them, particularly as they relate to consumer protection, money laundering, etc.The committee, chaired by the Special Secretary for Economic Affairs, comprises of representatives from several financial agencies and institutions including the Reserve Bank of India, State Bank of India, Department of Economic Affairs, Department of Financial Services and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.The CEO of Coinsecure, Mohit Kalra, comments:""Finally, something positive for the industry.

We are positive with what will happen in these coming three months.""An early Bitcoiner from India, Vivek, also known as Vivekomon, noted in a chat with Cointelegraph that the next three months indicates a boom for Bitcoin price. He says:“Yes! India is already behind. I think it's the perfect timing especially with UPI and the cashless drive. It's a good move. Bitcoin is growing globally and the government of India is finally working on regulatory frameworks which will help Bitcoin as a new technology to grow further in India and not be left out. Hopefully, it will be somewhat similar to what we are seeing in Japan and the rest of world. Hoping for a boom in three months or sooner! Sure thing!”A joint statement by the Digital Assets and Blockchain Foundation of India, which comprises of Bitcoin exchanges, reads:“Digital India is the dream of our current government. By setting up a high-level committee to study and give suggestion on virtual currency regulations, the government has again shown their keenness to study, understand and take well-thought decisions.”“As mentioned in the press release by the government, they are going to study regulations rolled out by other countries. This will be really helpful as experts from world economic forum and senior members of world monetary policy have contributed in drafting regulations there.”Looking at it from the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - BRICS countries - arrangement, which brings together these five major emerging economies that make up 43 percent of the world population, 30 percent of the world GDP and a 17 percent share in world trade, there is every indication that the committee will force India to recognize the legitimacy of Bitcoin as the most used digital currency in the world by the time its report is out in three months. If that happens, it will follow the order of China and Russia which have both shown growing interest in Bitcoin. Moreover, the three constitute the most powerful of the arrangement."

What if we could build a financial system with Bitcoin that would lead to a more equitable and fairer society?,"Bitcoin has been around for nearly a decade now and it has survived many doomsday predictions regarding its demise. It has grown to become an accepted medium of transferring money, it has also been recognized as a currency in some countries like Japan.The present financial system is supported by large-scale financial institutions that provide financial services. This means banks, insurance companies, credit card companies, housing finance companies, money transfer companies etc.The problem is that while these businesses have existed for a long time, accessibility has always been an issue. According to the world bank, two bln people still do not have access to a bank account. Yet this present financial institution based payment system is stuck in an archaic era.People are expected to use cash by withdrawing it from a bank account, they are supposed to deposit money physically at a bank teller or a machine and there are costs attached to just using and maintaining the system.Digitalization and using modern technology like smartphones has many benefits. The World Bank Working Paper titled - The Global Findex Database 2014, Measuring Financial Inclusion around the World says:“Moving from cash-based to digital payments has many potential benefits, for both senders and receivers. It can improve the efficiency of making payments by increasing the speed of payments and by lowering the cost of disbursing and receiving them.”The report points out further that digital payments increase transparency of payments reduce leakages and provide a first entry point to a formal financial system.Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that have emerged have several advantages. Firstly they are digital. There is no cash to handle. You do not need vaults, armored cars or any of the other infrastructure that makes handling cash expensive.Secondly, some cryptocurrencies have features like smart contracts built in, which can be used by people to conduct transactions securely with each other without the need for intermediaries institutional or otherwise.As MIT Technology Review recently quoted Joi Ito, Director of MIT Media Lab as saying about Bitcoin:“Whether you’re an individual trying to get access or you’re a pensioner with lots of money tied up in the market, you’re going through these intermediaries that don’t represent you very well. [Bitcoin] creates a much more level playing field, and hopefully, it will reduce the complexity of the financial system.”Regulatory hurdles need to be surmounted before digital currency can truly go mainstream, however, there is hope for the future as countries are getting around to the idea of Bitcoins becoming a part of the system.There are advantages as well. Digital currencies are transparent and some currencies like Bitcoin offer a transaction ledger that is public. These currencies can help the poor gain freedom from cash which is money that offers anonymity to drug dealers, corrupt officials and others preying on them. Digital currencies also takes out the need for people living in remote areas to go to centers of population for making transactions.Conversely, it also frees up financial institutions from having to put up infrastructure and staff in remote locations. Whichever way you look at it, the poor gain significant freedom from the advent and use of digital currencies."

While most major Bitcoin exchanges including BTCC, Bitstamp and Bitfinex have clarified their stance on the hard fork contingency, some regional exchanges such as Korbit and HitBTC haven’t come to a consensus in regards to hard fork support.","On March 24, Cointelegraph spoke to HitBTC about their questionable statement released to their users about the Bitcoin Unlimited hard fork.In their statement, HitBTC wrote:“Bitcoin Unlimited has been listed on the platform and is available for trading from March 24. The exact date of the hard fork is currently unknown and BTC and BTU withdrawals are temporarily locked due to the probable replay attack which may occur after the split. Withdrawals will be unlocked soon after the hard fork is complete.”Cointelegraph immediately reached out to HitBTC as the BTU token has yet to be released since the hard fork hasn’t been executed and, according to experts, it is actually very far from being forked.HitBTC attempted to clarify their stance but offered a very ambiguous response instead:“Currently there are 2 existing systems - Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Unlimited. Both systems have daemons and nodes. At the moment they are using one [common] Blockchain. But sooner or later their Blockchains will be split and fully independent. If you look at Coin Dance, you will see real blocks with BTU, so BTU does exist.”BTU simply doesn’t exist as of yet because the hard fork hasn’t been executed. Bitcoin miners signaling Bitcoin Unlimited support is very different from creating blocks with BTU. Bitcoin Unlimited tokens are credited to users by wallet platforms or Bitcoin exchanges when they are introduced to the network by the way of a hard fork.However, if the hard fork isn’t executed, there is no way that users can trade it because the tokens do not exist.Therefore, the announcement of HitBTC in regard to enabling BTU trading can be considered as a controversial and questionable move by the exchange, as the community is well aware that BTU tokens aren’t available yet.If the exchange is allowing users to trade BTU which doesn’t exist, what is HitBTC trying to accomplish? The first sentence of the statement of HitBTC read: “HitBTC, known for its cutting-edge technology, is giving you an opportunity to get Bitcoin Unlimited before the hard fork occurs.”Anyone with the slightest understanding of hard forks and the Bitcoin protocol understands that Bitcoin Unlimited tokens can’t be created or distributed to the network without executing a hard fork. Therefore, how is HitBTC providing a way for users to get Bitcoin Unlimited before the hard fork occurs?More importantly, what happens if the hard fork doesn’t occur? Then the derivative-like product which HitBTC is offering to users is rendered worthless by the market.Bitcoin exchanges must respect the market and users and be responsible enough to make reasonable decisions to support the network and community."

The recent surge of Bitcoin price seems to be largely affected by the economic uncertainty of the US, caused by troubles surrounding the Trump administration.","Donald Trump sent jitters down the spine of the world’s political and financial elite from the day of his inauguration when Bitcoin price immediately shot upward.Bloomberg reported that major US stock indexes had their worst session in eight months while world’s 500 most valuable billionaires have lost $35 bln due to the Trump administration’s turmoil and the US economy’s underwhelming performance.Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg shed $3.7 bln as the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by more than 370 points.In an interview with Bloomberg, Evercore ISI Executive Dennis DeBusschere stated:“What has been setting in over the course of the day is that political uncertainty is something that’s likely going to be with us for a significant amount of time. We may be looking at a higher volatility backdrop with a trending lower market for the next couple of months.”Amid the economic and financial turmoil, investors have begun to protect their assets and wealth with safe haven assets such as gold and Bitcoin. While gold has gained around 1.9 percent, Bitcoin price recorded a seven percent increase to surpass the $1,820 mark, reaching closer to the current all-time high price established at $1,868.Recently, Cointelegraph reported that gold hasn’t met the description of a safe haven asset over the past seven years. Being considered as a safe haven asset for centuries, since 2010 gold has not managed to maintain its value nor demonstrate an increase. As Cointelegraph noted, a $10,000 investment in gold back in 2010 would have led to a loss of $20, while a $10,000 investment in Bitcoin would have led to a net gain of $200 mln.Hence, investors have started to rely on Bitcoin, which is considered to be digital gold and a settlement network, to avoid market instability and economic uncertainty. As DeBusschere noted, the US market will most likely struggle to recover throughout the next few months. If so, Bitcoin price is likely to maintain its upward trend and potentially set new all-time highs in the upcoming months.The rise in demand toward Bitcoin in the US is evident as the US Bitcoin exchange market surpassed the Japanese Bitcoin exchange market for the first time in 2017 in terms of trading volume.At the time of writing, Japan has reclaimed its position as the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange market with over 37 percent of the market share."

In fact, as reported by Cointelegraph in February, the Philippines officially recognized Bitcoin as a legitimate remittance and payment method.Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the country’s central bank, stated in its Circular No.944:“Rather, the BSP aims to regulate VCs when used for delivery of financial services, particularly, for payments and remittances, which have a material impact on anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT), consumer protection and financial stability.”According to Liew and Blockchain CEO Peter Smith, the transportability and high liquidity of Bitcoin allow the digital currency to operate as a practical remittance method for the general consumer base. In that regard, Liew explained that Bitcoin is appealing to mainstream investors and users as a strong investment and reliable digital currency.Liew and Smith noted:""Expats sending money home have found in Bitcoin an inexpensive alternative, and we assume that the percentage of Bitcoin-based remittances will sharply increase with greater Bitcoin awareness. We believe Bitcoin awareness, high liquidity, ease of transport and continued market outperformance as geopolitical risks mount, will make Bitcoin a strong contender for investment at a consumer and investor level.”Bitcoin’s distinctive applications are enabling the currency to grow at an explosive rate. Some are utilizing Bitcoin as a wealth management tool, while others are relying on Bitcoin to send and receive payments, to profit in the long run, and settle transactions with low fees and shorter confirmation periods in contrast to bank transfers.In consideration of Bitcoin’s exponential growth, its limited supply, scarcity and rarity, Liew explained that it is highly likely for Bitcoin price to reach $500,000 as its user base reaches 400 mln. Currently, there exist approximately 20 mln Bitcoin wallets provided by service providers such as Blockchain and Coinbase. Liew expects the user base of Bitcoin to grow by 20 times in the next 13 years.“Bitcoin's 2030 price and user count total $500,000 and 400 million, respectively. The price is found by taking the $10 trillion market cap and dividing it by the fixed supply of 20 million bitcoin,” a section of the presentation provided by Liew and Smith read.For Liew and Smith, the denial of the Winklevoss twins’ Bitcoin ETF COIN was somewhat expected, primarily due to the inefficiency of the SEC when it comes to the approval of new markets and assets. However, Liew also noted that Bitcoin does not need a strictly regulated channel in order to appeal to a large group of investors.The Bitcoin exchange market itself provides a high level of liquidity for traders. Thus, it is relatively easy for an average trader to purchase and sell Bitcoin on regulated platforms.He told Business Insider:""The SEC’s ruling wasn't a surprise to us. We know that getting this sort of approval is going to take (a potentially long) time. In the meantime, bitcoin is already simple to buy and hold and, as the asset continues to mature, we'll continue to see an increase in the development and deployment of surrounding products."""

Just two months ago, the Bitcoin market capitalization was about $16 bln, at the time of writing, the market cap has risen to over $35 bln. This steady growth and the rise in Bitcoin price, especially as is observed since the beginning of the year has raised a storm of curiosity among the Internet.With regards to altcoins and ICO’s, CEO BnkToTheFuture.com, Simon Dixon believes that we are in a bubble, so all the demand is speculation driven by traders trying to gain more Bitcoin.Dixon says:“I expect a major correction when their value returns to their actual utility. Bitcoin, however, is fulfilling its user case as a global store of value more and more and this user case has been accelerated by political uncertainty and monetary policies like waging wars on cash as well as institutions and hedge funds joining the party.”According to Dixon, Bitcoin is gaining more and more utility each day. The community is in a phase of accumulation before a scaling solution is reached where few holders will be willing to sell.Kumar Gaurav, Founder of Auxesis Group & Cashaa believes that Bitcoin has created a reputation that has endeared it to new investors.Gaurav tells Cointelegraph:“Bitcoin’s steady high growth is one the main reasons that is attracting more investors. Bitcoin had a massive rally in April, overall doubled from $1,000 to over $2,000 this year.”Gaurav notes that recently, several regulators`and government decisions have been in favor of Bitcoin. For example, Japan has recognized Bitcoin as a legal payment method, then Australia, and more countries planning to do so. In the meantime, the SEC is reviewing its recent rejection of the Bitcoin ETF, and Russia who was anti-Bitcoin is planning to recognize it and other cryptocurrencies in 2018. Also, major industries and blue chips are now changing their position and becoming more receptive to cryptocurrencies.Gaurav adds that being comparable to gold, cryptocurrencies are also seen as a protection against political uncertainty like currently in the US and Brazil. Bitcoin has always performed better during political uncertainty and events like Brexit and movement on nationalism while the war on cash is fueling the crypto movement.Even after strong scrutiny of Chinese exchanges interest in Bitcoin is still strong in the country. The second largest populated country India also started taking its baby steps in Bitcoin in spite of the warning from the Central bank (RBI). “Every day more than 2,500 people are joining the Bitcoin network in India and RBI is also taking recitations from its peers showing positive signal to the market,” he says.A rather unconventional factor identified by Gaurav to have contributed to the growth in awareness of Bitcoin is the recent hack Wannacry cyber attack in 150 countries. An exercise which exploited the mistakes of government and in the end attracted huge media attention towards Bitcoin. Due to this attack, many average consumers are learning and experiencing Bitcoin for the first time. Then there is the effect of global trading markets, which includes FTSE100, Dax, S&P500 and MSCI`s World Index. These have shown record highs this year, making investors feel rich and more open to experimenting. Positive market signals coming from all the oracles provides exponential growth to Bitcoin but impacts mostly cryptocurrencies whose units are cheaper such as ripple, Ether, Dash, Moreno, and other major ones.Gaurav concludes by noting that Bitcoin has proved that money can be created without centralized institutions and can work well, hence now all major altcoins are surging. The challenge posed by the prevailing delays in Bitcoin transactions has compelled users to consider other alternatives such as Litecoin. Litecoin has successfully implemented scaling solution SegWit, which not only made its own price increase but also increased hope in Bitcoin being able to solve its problem without a hard fork."

That is a 796,000x return as an investment. In fact, today, on May 24, Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high at $2,392 and is continuously demonstrating a rising demand from both casual and institutional investors.Bitcoin price hits new all-time high again for the second time this week at $2,392. Important to note, China made a strong comeback. pic.twitter.com/S8mceNDTqMThe majority of mainstream media analysts suggest that Bitcoin price is completely speculative in the sense that investors are purchasing Bitcoin solely expecting a massive return in value. However, as Cointelegraph previously reported, prominent investors including GoldSilver.com founder Mike Maloney are encouraging investors to hold Bitcoin as a mandatory asset to hedge against inevitable global economic uncertainty and financial instability, not just as a large return investment.On the contrary, the Japanese Bitcoin industry has been perceiving and considering Bitcoin as digital currency and digital cash. Some of the country’s largest conglomerates have launched fiat-to-Bitcoin exchanges to provide high liquidity for the rapidly expanding number of cryptocurrency investors in the region.Also, some of Japan’s most influential companies including Bic Camera, Peach Aviation and Recruit Holdings, the company behind the country’s most widely utilized Point of Sale (PoS) systems are offering Bitcoin as an official payment option to their clientsHence, the categorization of Bitcoin as a “risky investment” as noted by several mainstream media outlets including the Washington Post is not a fair evaluation of the role Bitcoin plays in the global economy. Bitcoin is the alternative financial network which is directly competing with the banking and financial industries. It is one of the only technologies that could render banking and financial industries redundant.In an analysis, a Washington Post analyst wrote, “Most investors agree that, although the currency’s meteoric rise is very attractive, it’s also an extremely volatile and risky investment.” However, some of the world’s largest investment firms including Fidelity Investments, an investment firm which brings in more than $15.9 bln in annual revenue and manages $2.13 tln worth of assets, disagrees with the assessment and considers Bitcoin as a safe haven asset that is arguably more reliable than gold.""I love this stuff – Bitcoin, Ethereum, Blockchain technology – and what the future holds. But I am still a believer – and it's no accident that I'm one of the few standing before you today from a large financial services firm that hasn't given up on digital currencies,” said Fidelity Investments CEO Abigail Johnson.Most importantly, Cointelegraph previously revealed that Bitcoin outpaced and outperformed gold as a safe haven asset. A $10,000 Bitcoin investment in 2010 is now worth $200 mln while an identical investment in gold led to a negative return of $9,900.Cointelegraph’s analysis further argued whether gold can be considered as a safe haven asset, if it is not able to hold its value or experience an increase in price amid economic uncertainty since a safe haven asset by definition is an investment that retains or increases its value amidst market turbulence and economic certainty, over time."

When it is, it will become the first Bitcoin wallet to address privacy issues in Blockchain transactions while working with the Bitcoin protocol without requiring any forks.Speaking to Cointelegraph, Chris Trew, founder and CEO at Stratis, said that the Breeze Wallet will serve as a typical Bitcoin wallet for desktop computers, but combines the innovative TumbleBit solution and privacy enhancements.“Connected through a TumbleBit tumbler, Breeze Wallet users can mix their coins without needing to trust each other or the tumbler with their coins or their privacy,” he said.Their goal, according to Trew, is to offer a truly trustless and decentralized privacy protocol on the Stratis Blockchain, which has its own token, the Stratis token, and its private chains. It will also work with financial service regulators on creating regulatory compliant Blockchain solutions using the Stratis Privacy protocol.Introduced by Ethan Heilman, Leen AlShenibr, Foteini Baldimtsi, Alessandra Scafuro and Sharon Goldberg, as an unlinkable payment hub, TumbleBit utilizes cryptographic techniques to ensure that the Tumbler doesn’t violate anonymity, steal Bitcoins or print money by issuing payments to itself.By replacing on-Blockchain payments with off-Blockchain puzzle solving, Alice can send payments faster to Bob, with transactions completed in seconds. In the TumbleBit white paper, the authors explain it like this:“Alice A pays Bob B by providing B with the solution to a puzzle. The puzzle z is generated through interaction between B and T and solved through an interaction between A and T. Each time a puzzle is solved, one Bitcoin is transferred from Alice A to the Tumbler T and finally on to Bob B.”Trew explains that different ideas were looked at before deciding that TumbleBit was the best fit for their future goals as it is fully compatible with the Bitcoin’s protocol.“The team behind Stratis carefully evaluated the different concepts and technological options to deliver a truly trustless and secure privacy solution that would meet the requirements of enterprise and consumers worldwide,” he said.In order to ensure the privacy features that the Breeze Wallet is promising, it will be introducing the Full Block Secure Payment Validation System or the Full Block SVP.To aid the Stratis team to build the Breeze Wallet to the TumbleBit specifications, Adam Ficsor, one of the contributors to the TumbleBit research paper and the official implementation of TumbleBit NTumbleBit, is helping them with the creation of the full block SPV wallet in C#."

His name is Mike Cannon-Brookes and he is co-founder of the collaboration software firm Atlassian based in Sydney, Australia.","According to Forbes, his real time net worth as at May 1 stands at $2.4 bln. Cannon-Brookes’ business partner is billionaire co-founder, Scott Farquhar, who recently bought Australia's most expensive house - the $70 mln Point Piper estate Elaine. They are the only individuals under the age of 40 on Forbes list of Australia’s richest people.Cannon-Brookes made a tweet last week to confirm his bet on Bitcoin and how it has turned out well. Unlike Novogratz, who disclosed that he has 10 percent of his net worth in the cryptocurrency space and described it as the ""best investment of my life"", Cannon-Brookes doesn’t seem to consider his as an investment.The tweet says:Yup, my BTC bet is paying out well. Theory? “It will be worth a lot, or zero”. Much like a horse racing. Not like investing. https://t.co/VrGz6JzWoQHe did not say in any of his tweets about the digital currency how much he put into Bitcoin or whether he is holding other cryptocurrencies as well.According to the Sunday Morning Herald, Cannon-Brookes, whose firm has no sales team but boasts NASA, Tesla and SpaceX as customers, is understood to have a number of public bets in the cryptocurrency space via tech investor Blackbird Ventures and bank disrupter Tyro. He is currently working with Elon Musk to bring Musk's battery technology to Southern Australia.Though it is unclear what the fraction of wealthy people who are presently owning some Bitcoins could be, disclosures of this nature show that the belief that those who own the digital currency are mostly minions is not completely true.It also, in a way, confirms the view that main investors have started getting involved in Bitcoin by investing a part of their money.This could be in line with the advice of billionaire bond manager Bill Gross who in his investment outlook letter last year picked Bitcoin as an attractive storage of wealth for investors.According to Bitinfochart.com, less than 150,000 Bitcoin wallet addresses - about one percent of the total addresses available - have 10 or more Bitcoins each and they keep almost 90 percent of the total Bitcoin currently in supply.While individual owners may not be identified, some of the wallets could be for cryptocurrency exchanges or other businesses.Read more: How to Buy Bitcoin: Best Practices, Where to Buy, Tips"

For short and mid-term investment, is it too late to buy the mentioned digital currencies?Dash and Ether are different from most digital currencies such as Bitcoin or Monero in the sense that they have unique monetary policies.Ethereum, for instance, is actually an inflationary token because it operates on top of a concept called the “Issuance Rate.” The Issuance Rate represents the number of Ethereum tokens or Ether that will be created within a year. In 2017, the issuance rate of Ether is 14.75 percent.Dash is a controversial cryptocurrency because over two mln Dash - previously known as Darkcoin - was instantaneously mined in the first 30 hours of launch. Homero, a Bitcoin trader and cryptocurrency trader, wrote:“During the first day 2M coins were mined, and as of today, less than 3k are mined daily. Even if there were no features/community at the time, he didn’t relaunch and decided to keep his instamine, claiming that the community told him to do so. Having a fair launch is very trivial for the future of a coin, because a premined coin has only one future : to make the creator rich.”Bitcoin and Monero, on the other hand, were launched and mined with complete transparency and legitimacy and because of their open processes. They continue to be two of the most respected and appreciated cryptocurrencies currently in existence.Since Bitcoin and Monero are based on a fixed supply of coins, it is quite evident that the value of the two coins will continue to rise until their supplies are maximized. In other words, Bitcoin price will continue to increase until it hits its 21 mln supply cap. Even when the supply cap is reached, if the demand of the currencies continues to increase, its price will maintain an upward trend.For Ethereum and Dash, the second and third largest cryptocurrencies in the world, it is difficult to predict their price trends due to their unique monetary policies.Furthermore, Ether is considered as an alt-asset instead of a digital currency because the Ethereum network uses gas or Ether to power decentralized applications, hence the necessity of an inflationary monetary supply.In general, cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Monero, Dash and Ethereum are all at their early stages. For both short and mid-term investors, it is important to recognize and evaluate the technical backgrounds and usability of these cryptocurrencies.Ethereum developers or users will argue that the price of Ether will continue to increase so long as the development community remains active.Conclusively, it is not too late to invest in cryptocurrencies that have potential to grow and evolve."

It will ensure that nowhere in the supply chain is general sales tax (GST) paid more than once.“The Government will make it easier for new innovative digital currency businesses to operate in Australia,” the summary reads.“From 1 July 2017, purchases of digital currency will no longer be subject to the GST, allowing digital currencies to be treated just like money for GST purposes. Currently, consumers who use digital currencies can effectively bear GST twice: once on the purchase of the digital currency and once again on its use in exchange for other goods and services subject to the GST.”Australia has had a troubled relationship with cryptocurrency regulation until recently. The decision to allow double taxation originally caused several well-known operators to quit the country back in 2014, while innovation has subsequently lagged behind markets in which businesses have enjoyed greater freedom.Innovative fintech deals involving Blockchain have surfaced this year, however, and the tone of the budget extract points to a desire to change Australia’s environment.“Innovation will drive productivity growth in Australia,” it continues.“The Government is committed to establishing Australia as a leading global financial technology (FinTech) hub and is announcing a new package that aims to position our local fintech industry as a world leader.”Meanwhile, local business optimism is also increasing."

Once the security has been breached, people will lose money which will result in a lot of users reacting violently. Andresen makes this claim as he has been keeping tabs on Bitcoin and has observed a lot of system problems that have stemmed out, such as faulty data generation. Even the smallest mistake and small breaches like these have already negatively affected the whole Bitcoin community.Such security breaches were seen in an incident in August 2013, where Bitcoin wallets operated on Android became vulnerable to security breaches. Two years later, in May 2015, there was another fault in the Bitcoin wallet system which caused a lot of Bitcoin investors to lose significant amounts of money. This was caused by the random number generator which provided insufficient data to be used with Android operating systems. This is the exact thing that the RSP project is designed to address.While the RSP is beneficial to Bitcoin, as it will aid in preventing potential security breaches, it is not directly associated with Bitcoin at all. Rather, it is an independent project for helping digital monetary systems.Andresen has already been working on this project for more than six months and is steadily making progress. When the project is complete, Andresen states that he would not want to make it into a profit generating project. Rather, he wants to make it a free system like Linux wherein there will be a sponsor behind it.The RSP works as a verification system that will tell the user whether random bytes are “true” or “false.” The system does that by determining whether the numbers are random or not. If they are random, they are classified as “true.” This is a very important aspect of how systems work their data because if bytes lose their randomness, the data could become invalid. There are, in fact, a lot of factors that can affect randomness such as software and system upgrades. Other factors include work from a third party person or a breach.The RSP aims to check for randomness in the bytes so that developers will be able to prevent any disasters in the system. This is beneficial to a lot of people, especially those who deal with investing in digital currencies like Bitcoin."

He then asked the community for a method to steal funds of the wallet equivalent to 70 Bitcoins.","Seed or wallet words to a Bitcoin wallet like Electrum or Multibit is an important component necessary to back up funds. If a user accidentally deletes wallet information or has his computer stolen, the user can locate his wallet words or seed to recover his funds.However, the Multibit development team strictly warned its users against leaving wallet words or seed exposed.The team stated:“To restore your wallet and recover your Bitcoin, you must have your wallet words. With your wallet words, you can recover your Bitcoin. You must keep your wallet words safe because anyone who knows your wallet words can steal your Bitcoin.”With two simple steps, anyone that holds a seed or wallet words to a Bitcoin wallet can steal funds. The first step is to obtain the seed. Then, once the wallet backup folder is located on the computer, using the seed, funds, notes, payment history and exchange rates in payments can all be stolen without a trace.On the 4chan bulletin board discussion, an anonymous user explained to the community that he found the seed to his friend’s Electrum wallet.The user wrote:“I have a seed to a friend’s Electrum wallet with 70+ Bitcoins. He left his wallet at my house when he went to drop something off at his girlfriend’s. Went through it and found a piece of paper which was clearly a seed. Given he has shown me his Bitcoin on an Electrum wallet, I’m 99 percent sure it is that. Wrote it down and put it back where I found it.”For localized Bitcoin wallets, seed or wallet words is the most important security component to protect. With one string of words, as seen in the image above, 70 Bitcoins can be lost. By today’s exchange rate, as of May 1, 2017, the wallet owner’s clumsy and irresponsible action to store seed words in a public place will cost him at least $99,330. The anonymous user noted that they could be more funds stored within the wallet.This unfortunate event and the loss of 70 Bitcoins should be considered as a reminder for the rest of the Bitcoin community to implement appropriate security measures and keep seed words safely."

While some players in the industry believe that the initial surge in price is as a result of value proposition and reasonable adoption of the entities, others have insisted that the surge is fueled by speculators who only want to recycle the capital to make a profit.","The recent decline in the price of the aforementioned entities presents an opportunity for further questions about the robustness of the market value of cryptocurrencies in general. These questions arise due to the early history of Bitcoin price which saw a significant crash after previously appreciating in value.Jason Cassidy, President of Crypto Consultant, tells Cointelegraph that this development is normal and nothing out of the ordinary.Cassidy says:“As we witness the birth of a new financial system taking shape, it is natural to witness a certain level of speculation. Organic growth is certainly taking place and progress is being made from the top down. Government recognition and approval, continued merchant and consumer adoption along with innovative services are helping broaden the currency's appeal and utility.”Cassidy explains that traders and speculators that have been on the market for several years are going to be focused on locking in profits after a sharp increase in price. This, he says happens each time a new growth spurt takes place. New money enters the market and as the price gets bid up, seasoned and pragmatic traders will look to take a profit.He also notes that every market has this dynamic, however with cryptocurrency markets being very much new, the volatility is greater. Over time as Bitcoin's price volatility in the market will lessen.Dana Coe of BitLox sees the network effect of Bitcoin and other crypto adoption as having a significant effect on the price fluctuations.Coe explains that given that a lot of people have at least tangentially heard of Bitcoin, very few of them have actually ""gotten into"" it.He also notes that since most altcoins have no actual real-world spending applications, the perceived growth within the altcoin environment appears to be a collective ""bandwagon effect"" rather than a reasonable investment or organic growth.According to Coe:“Everybody is always searching for the next big thing. This builds a feedback loop driving prices and ‘growth’.""Coe concludes by explaining that speculation in and of itself is not a bad thing, noting that it is a free market and in all free markets there are some winners and some losers. Organic growth comes from adding more people to the user base of all coins and an exciting market is the best advertisement ever for getting people to sit up, take notice and get on board."

In the year 2008, it was stock and real estate. This time, it is stocks, real estates and bonds and they are all in some of the biggest bubbles of all time. When these burst, it’s going to be devastating for most people but it doesn’t have to be devastating for you.”He added that the answer to the question of how to be prepared for this roller coaster crash and the potential for the new world monetary system - he’d found while researching his book that a new system emerges every thirty years - has become a little more complex than just relying on gold and silver.He stressed that although cryptocurrencies should not be relied upon solely because they are worthless without an Internet connection, he explains how essential they are:“You want to have an alternative monetary system that is already ready to go and those actually exist today. They are called cryptocurrencies. It started with Bitcoin. There have been several others that have been introduced. I own a few of them. I don’t own a lot of cryptocurrencies but I think it is something that is necessary to be prepared because if the monetary system fails, you’ll be able to do transactions right away with other people and you can do them over long distances. You can do them over the Internet just like you pay with your credit card today.”Unlike others that caution against Bitcoin as a competitor to gold or as a risky investment, Maloney’s recommendation of Bitcoin as a solution for online transactions seems to be in line with the view of the former manager of the Prudent Bear Fund, David Tice.In an interview with CNBC. Tice said that although Bitcoin has been looked down on, it truly makes a lot of sense to invest in it, particularly on a transactional basis as it has the potential to give investors money."

and etc affect the future shape of the economy? Is it the end of 
Capitalism ...","Apr 12, 2017",Money has shaped our modern economy. We have gone from using grain and cattle and even salt as currency to using metal tokens (coins) and paper.,"However, paper has the habit of sticking and it has been around ever since the Chinese introduced it during the Tang dynasty. We have grown comfortable using paper currency and no one can deny that it has had its usefulness.Now we are approaching another era in which bits are playing the same role that paper did. Digital currencies are no longer something that will happen way into the future, they are here.How will the advent of digital currencies like Bitcoin, Monero, Ethereum and etc affect the future shape of the economy?Ed Finn wrote an article in the Guardian asking, “Do digital currencies spell the end of Capitalism?” Finn’s article covered the DAO issue and how Ethereum community dealt with the hack. He examines the very nature of digital currency and ponders the questions surrounding ‘programmable money.’In the end, he succinctly concludes:“If what counts, and how we count, is measured in processor cycles instead of human exchange, it will change the rules of the economy as surely as driverless vehicles will change transportation. What we value is fundamentally a question of belief, and it’s increasingly unclear what we believe in more: billfolds or bits?”So what will change if we move to digital currencies, surely these currencies change the nature of money as they are not issued by a central monetary authority or backed by the promise of the sovereign.These currencies are an organism of their own kind. They open the doors to people issuing their own tokens and creating their own monetary policies. This could radically change the financial system as individuals could potentially fund their own enterprises with their own currencies. They also remove the vagaries of the interest rate cycles associated with government issued money and break the nexus between big businesses and the government.Digital currencies have opened doors which were firmly shut. These currencies hold the promise of distribution of wealth like never before.Not only have they brought in the technology to transfer money in a blink of an eye at minimal costs around the world, they have also brought access to ‘money’ for people who never had it before.As Dominik Zynis of the WINGS Foundation says:“Digital currencies will allow anyone, be it person or community, to be included in the economy by self regulated credit expansion enabling trade people who previously lacked access to requisite mediums of exchange.”At the moment people have no choice but to trust the sovereign's money. It is after all a promissory note. Digital currencies put the trust fact squarely among the public.People who choose to use a particular digital currency, do so because they recognize it as money. Not because they were told to use it as money.The use of digital money or programmable money opens the doors for applications like smart contracts. Smart contracts within digital money can revolutionize the way ‘deals’ are done. Escrow can be inbuilt so that a transaction is only completed when certain parameters are met.This removes the need for having intermediaries in financial transactions, property transactions etc.The present economic system that we live in has reached its peak potential. We need a new era of economics if we are to develop further. In an era where the planetary resources are increasingly dwindling, we need a system that places less emphasis on profit and more on developing human resources.Virtual currencies or digital currencies can usher in an era of entrepreneurship and development. They can also transform how we do business today and remove regulatory bottlenecks out of the system.While capitalism might not come to an end immediately due to ‘programmable money’, it is certainly about to evolve into something different. No one can deny though that we are at the crossroads."

He first purchased Bitcoin in 2013, when the digital currency was worth around $50. The Bitcoin price declined throughout 2013 due to the Mt. Gox fiasco which led to the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in user funds.Early investors of both Bitcoin and Ethereum are respected in the cryptocurrency community because they hardly sell their savings in Bitcoin despite extreme volatility and fluctuation at times. In 2013 for instance, Bitcoin price remained at one of its lowest points for 11 straight months, until it started to surge in November.Since his investment in 2013, Bitcoin price increased from around $50 to $1,270. In fact, it is close to reaching its all-time high price at $1,277, which was established minutes before the decision of the US Securities and Exchange Commission to decline the Winklevoss Twins’ Bitcoin ETF proposal.At the Harvard Business School Club of New York Blockchain conference, Novogratz explained that his decision to invest 10 percent of his life savings into Bitcoin and Ether is the best investment of his life so far.Novogratz also purchased Ethereum’s Ether during its ICO, when the token was worth around $1. Currently, Ethereum is trading at $49, which translates to a 49x return for Novogratz. At the event, Novogratz explained that a meeting with Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and a prominent CEO allowed him to understand the true potential of Ethereum and its applicability across various industries.As Cointelegraph reported previously, the Ethereum network and the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance platform are being utilized by some of the largest multi-billion dollar banks and corporations around the world, including the $92 bln firm BHP Billiton.Novogratz sees a bright future in the development of Ethereum and its evolution as a smart contract-based Blockchain platform for large-scale commercial businesses and corporations.Tim Draper, the multi-billionaire angel investor of prominent companies including Uber and Skype, has also experienced a huge success in his Bitcoin investment. So far, his investment in Bitcoin alone earned Draper over $16 mln in profit. Apart from his direct investment in Bitcoin, he is a major investor in regional Bitcoin exchanges such as Coinplug and Blockchain startups such as Factom.One common link between successful investors like Draper and Novogratz is their firm belief in the long-term success of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum. Novogratz, in particular, held onto his savings in Bitcoin throughout highly volatile periods when Bitcoin price declined by up to 30 percent in a period of weeks.However, Novogratz noted that the crypto space will likely have a bubble that would be exploited in the near future. Cryptocurrencies or altcoins without clear scalability plans and long-term roadmaps are likely to fail."

Since Satoshi Nakamoto unveiled his cryptocurrency in 2008, we’ve witnessed a proliferation of digital cash companies and codebases. Utilizing his public, distributed ledger, dozens of promising currencies have emerged. Only a select few have proven themselves as true contenders to Bitcoin, however.","Here are the top 10 altcoins on CoinMarketCap (note that the list is changing constantly, especially in the tail part, with other altcoins like MaidSafeCoin, Golem and Augur playing musical chairs with others):J.P Morgan Chase, Microsoft and Intel allied in order to create the fiercest rival to Bitcoin in circulation today: Ethereum. The main purpose of the endeavor was to program binding agreements into the Blockchain itself. This incarnated into the now-popular smart contract feature.Interestingly, Ethereum is not just a currency. It’s a Blockchain platform powered by the Ether cryptocurrency. The New York Times describes the technology as “a single shared computer that is run by the network of users and on which resources are parceled out and paid for by Ether.”Ripple attracted a great deal of venture capital during its inception. The Google-backed altcoin startup managed to pull in upwards of $50 mln from banking institutions, gathering an impressive $90 mln in total funding. Ripple is unique in that it allows for transacting with any unit of value, from fiat currency to frequent flier miles.“Ripple provides global financial settlement solutions to enable the world to exchange value like it already exchanges information giving rise to an Internet of Value (IoV). Ripple solutions lower the total cost of settlement by enabling banks to transact directly, instantly and with certainty of settlement,” reads the company’s copy on their official website.Initially a middling contender, Ripple has gained momentum in the cryptocurrency market, seeing a marked surge earlier this year. In fact, Ripple experienced a 100 percent increase in value within a 24-hour period in late March.Former Google engineer Charles Lee created this altcoin in an effort to improve upon Bitcoin. Namely, the speed to generate a new block is improved dramatically. Transactions are much faster. By the same token, however, this speed makes Litecoin’s Blockchain larger and more prone to producing orphaned blocks.Dash, a combination of the words “digital” and “cash,” is the Internet’s cash-in-hand. Dash is quick. Its transactions are instant. “Your time is valuable. InstantSend payments confirm in less than a second,” Dash claims. By comparison, Bitcoin’s transactions can take up to an hour to process.GPU/CPU mining is no longer cost effective. In order to mine, you’ll need specific hardware, computers known as ASICs to complete Dash’s proof-of-work puzzles.NEM is written in Java; built on an entirely new codebase separate and apart from Bitcoin’s open-source code. There are a few other intriguing differences from Bitcoin as well. In NEM, you harvest rather than mine. It’s essentially the same as mining in Bitcoin, only that multiple people profit - albeit in much smaller quantities - from a generated block.NEM introduced the proof-of-importance algorithm to the digital ledger. A user’s wealth and number of transactions are used to timestamp transactions.NEM has seen rapid growth in its valuation since the beginning of 2017 as the altcoin is currently being embraced in Japan.A parallel Ethereum platform exists and sustains a sizeable usership with a market cap hovering just below $430 mln.Why do two versions of the same platform exist?The Ethereum community fractured when a disagreement over how a technically legal theft of funds should be handled. The majority of users wished to change Ethereum’s code in order to get the lost funds back. A minority believed that Ethereum should not be tampered with or altered by third parties. Even in cases of users exploiting the smart contract feature to trick others, the Blockchain must remain “immutable.” Thus, the minority created the Classic version of Ethereum, which still survives and thrives.Monero is geared toward those who desire greater anonymity. The cryptocurrency allows you to “send and receive funds without your transactions being publically visible on the Blockchain.” Transactions are completely untraceable due to Monero’s leveraging of ring signatures. Unfortunately, because of Monero’s emphasis on privacy, it has seen adoption by the darknet and other criminal organizations.Zcash, like Monero, offers greater privacy to users. Unlike Monero, transactions are shielded rather than made completely private. Meaning, the details of the transaction itself, such as the users involved and the amount traded, are hidden. Zcash does this by using a “zero-knowledge” proof that allows for parties to exchange funds without revealing each other’s identity.Decred’s primary aim is to focus on “community input, open governance and sustainable funding and development.” The currency melds proof-of-work and proof-of-stake mining algorithms to ensure a minority of users do not own the majority of the funds and that decisions are led by the community rather than a handful of developers or early investors.PIVX stands for Private Instant Verified Transactions. Another open-source decentralized Blockchain currency, it is built upon Bitcoin Core. Like Zcash and Monero, PIVX boasts its heightened privacy and security.“[W]e believe that you have the right to exchange privately and securely, without interference from corporatocracy pressures, governmental influences, prying eyes, and nefarious individuals and movements,” PIVX contends.PIVX is highly volatile, experiencing massive spikes in trading volume and valuation as of March of this year. Again, because of the currency’s emphasis on privacy, PIVX is susceptible to criminal activity.Cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and the altcoins it has spawned, may bring about a new global economy. They allow us to transact in a peer-to-peer fashion, without third-party bodies governing us. Bitcoin introduced the Blockchain, but other developers are quickly improving upon Nakamoto’s idea. Some currencies have focused on speed, as is the case with both Ripple and Litecoin. Others have honed in on privacy, currencies like Zcash going so far as making all transactions private and untraceable. Each altcoin comes with its own strengths and weakness. Surely, we’ll discover more as time goes on. For now, these 10 currencies are at the top. Their fate could turn, however, at a flip of a coin."

When Bitcoin rises in value, Ether price declines and vice versa. $ETH and $BTC. They are not always inversely correlated. But right now they are. pic.twitter.com/njO7FPOQjY The Ethereum and Bitcoin network are completely different from each other in terms of philosophy, structure, monetary policy and vision. Bitcoin was developed to operate as digital gold and as a cash system. Ethereum, in contrast,was introduced to supplement decentralized applications. Essentially, Bitcoin is a digital currency and Ethereum is a decentralized network of applications. Many Bitcoin and security experts including Andreas Antonopoulos commented on the comparison between Ethereum and Bitcoin in the past. In 2016, Antonopoulos wrote: “Stop calling ethereum ""the bitcoin rival"". No one in ethereum or bitcoin believes it is a rival. Post-national currencies are not zero-sum.” In a way, Ethereum developers and companies depend on the Bitcoin network for its stability and security. Ethereum prioritizes flexibility and functionality to provide a more efficient ecosystem for developers, while Bitcoin operates as a better store of value. For instance, Blockchain startups that often engage in Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) normally hedge their funds raised in Ether to Bitcoin for increased stability. Since Bitcoin has a substantially lower volatility rate, startups prefer to maintain their funds in Bitcoin via cold storage or hardware wallets such as Trezor. Recently, as the Bitcoin community struggled to come to a consensus on which solution to activate to scale the Bitcoin network, some users migrated over to the Ethereum network. Some analysts including Social Minds founder and Reality Keys developer Edmund Edgar went as far as to describe Ether as a viable alternative payment method to Bitcoin due to its fixed transaction fees. In Ethereum, transaction fees are called gas. For users to initiate smart contracts or send transactions, they are required to spend a certain amount of gas. According to Edgar, this transaction fee for Ethereum transactions is fixed and does not alter depending on the size of the transaction, unlike Bitcoin. Edgar explains: “A user’s account can be modeled as… an account. You can have a single balance, and it doesn’t matter how many payments it took to get you that balance. Wallets are simpler, less surprising stuff happens, and fees are easier to predict and explain. All payments cost the same, regardless of where the funds came from.” ARK Invest’s crypto-focused product lead Chris Burniske further noted that traders tend to switch back and forth between Bitcoin and Ether, depending on the performance of the two markets. 3/ ""Correlation != Causation"" & these are short time periods for data, but it does suggest traders are swinging back & forth b/w $BTC & $ETH Increasing interest of Bitcoin users, developers and businesses in Ethereum is demonstrated in the global exchange market of Ethereum. The ETH to BTC pair accounts for over 50 percent of all Ethereum trading. "

Through the ETN, both retail and institutional investors would be able to take indirect exposure to the price of Bitcoin.Hargreaves Lansdown is Britain’s largest retail trading platform, with over GBP 70 bln of investments and 876,000 active clients. It has offered its clients access to Bitcoin ETNs issued by XBT Provider, a Swedish company.Ryan Radloff, head of Investor Relations for XBT Provider, said: “By adding self-service, online dealing, the team at Hargreaves Lansdown is providing UK investors with professional and quick access to the Bitcoin space in the UK and greater Europe. This is very exciting for any investors who have been thinking about buying Bitcoin but did not want the hassle of security and regulation involved in buying Bitcoin directly from exchanges.”The move by Hargreaves Lansdown would expand the investor base of Bitcoin.enabling a new set of individuals and institutions to invest in it. While the US SEC has rejected the application for a Bitcoin ETF (it is giving the application a second look), other regulators around the world are looking at cryptocurrencies positively. Asia has taken the lead, with Japan recognizing cryptocurrencies and issuing rules for the operation of exchanges. The price of Bitcoin has risen in 2017 in sync with the various positive news.Clients of Hargreaves Lansdown can invest in the Bitcoin ETNs through either their normal broking account or through their self-invested pension plan (SIPP). While adding a small amount of cryptocurrency exposure to a pension account can greatly enhance long-term returns, it does come with higher risk. Investors are exposed to the price volatility of the underlying asset (Bitcoin) as well as foreign exchange risk (the ETNs are denominated in Swedish Kronor/Euro). Hence investors should carefully evaluate their portfolio allocation for pension assets and should take a prudent call on how much to invest in Bitcoin ETN."

It essentially is like a database that stores, secures and facilitates transaction data for Bitcoin users.","Over the past few years, leading banks and financial institutions have focused on building Blockchain-based systems including cross-bank payment facilitation tools, inter-ledger protocols and multiple layer financial solutions. Billions of dollars have been allocated for the development of so-called “private Blockchains or ledgers” and banks are yet to demonstrate the commercial success of the Blockchain.One major reason why banks continue to struggle to adopt the Blockchain and demonstrate its usability within the financial industry is the regulatory conflict which arises due to the decentralized nature of Blockchain.By money transmission and financial policies, banks are required to strictly oversee transactions and financial activities. If a public Blockchain network-based system is implemented, banks will not be able to manipulate transactions and thus lose control of their network.Basically, a public Blockchain network cannot be adopted due to regulatory hurdles. Private Blockchain networks can’t be applied either due to severe security issues. Over time, investors and Blockchain consortia realized that Blockchain doesn’t suit the financial industry and corporations such as the R3CEV have moved on to Blockchain-inspired technologies.Google-funded Currencycloud is following a roadmap that is similar to the R3 consortium. Instead of pegging their system on Blockchain, Currencycloud is entering the financial industry with a Blockchain-inspired technology that is actually applicable to a wide range of operations such as transaction facilitation.Recently, Currencycloud raised another $25 mln funding round from Google’s venture capital arm GV, which puts their total funding to date at nearly $55 mln, acquired from prominent venture capital firms and technology companies including Sapphire, Notion Capital and Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten’s fund Anthemis.Essentially, the infrastructure of Currencycloud works as a cross-bank ledger that allows instantaneous transactions in a more secure yet cheaper ecosystem. With a simple API, banks can utilize Currencloud’s infrastructure to optimize settlement of payments.Currencycloud CEO CEO Mike Laven stated:“GV looked at that and looked at empowering developers and making it easy for them to tie up to global services and said that is consistent with our view of the world, a tool that's part of globalization. That was part of the theme of the investment. We've been saying all along, we're not just a payments company, not just an FX company. We're a platform with API access to the world of global payments.""A rapidly emerging group of fintech companies and Blockchain-inspired infrastructure developers are targeting banks and financial institutions that can utilize their solutions to optimize large commercial projects. So far, Blockchain technology, or to be more specific private Blockchain network-based platforms, haven’t proved its worth in the financial industry despite billions of dollars being invested in the technology.The question remains if Blockchain technology is relevant in the realm of finance and if it actually can improve banking services. Concerns of investors on fintech and Blockchain startups is that banks are beginning to realize Blockchain without Bitcoin or the main digital asset, hash power and an open community of developers isn’t at all efficient."

Soon, Lightning Network technology will also deploy for Litecoin, allowing for near-instant transactions.Responding to the poll results, fellow entrepreneur Tuur Demeester noted that “very little complaints” could be found on darknet markets regarding the fees. “Suspect we can go up to $5 for that use case,” he added, also highlighting Bitcoin was still the darknet’s currency of choice despite the cost savings of altcoins.Total transaction fees paid to miners are hovering near all-time highs on Thursday."

Based on the ...","May 12, 2017",It seems as if a Bitcoin scaling solution is urgently needed to process transactions more efficiently.,"Earlier today, on May 12, the Bitcoin network’s mempool, the holding area for all pending and unconfirmed transactions, achieved an all-time high size of 110 mln bytes or 110 MBs. For two days, the size of the mempool remained in the 100 MBs region, which meant that many transactions were left unconfirmed and weren’t broadcasted to the Bitcoin Blockchain.More to that, the average size of Bitcoin blocks increased to around 0.988 MB, getting closer to the Bitcoin network’s 1 MB cap. Based on the growing mempool size and the average Bitcoin block size which is a few kilobytes away from maximizing Bitcoin’s block size cap, a scaling solution is urgently and evidently needed in order to scale the Bitcoin network proportionally to its growth.In April, Bitcoin Core developer Luke-Jr claimed that the legitimate use of the Bitcoin Blockchain amounts to only 750 KB or 0.75 MB per block on average, assuming that the rest are spam transactions initiated to mislead the community into thinking that a scaling solution must be urgently adopted. Luke-Jr wrote:“All legitimate uses of the blockchain currently amount to approximately 750k/block average. If inefficient and microtransaction usage is put aside, likely below 500k would be sufficient. No block size increase is likely to be needed in the near future. Before we reach the point that 1MB is insufficient, we are likely to have the Lightning protocol working in production. This improves efficiency of blockchain usage by magnitudes, possibly reducing 1 MB block usage to ~10k.”He further emphasized that the integration of Lightning would optimize Bitcoin blocks by up to 90 percent by enabling cheap and secure micropayments with lesser fees. Whether only 750 KB of transactions in each block are legitimate and authentic is difficult to prove and conclude based on the current circumstances.However, as Luke-Jr noted in his comment about SegWit and Lightning, the activation of SegWit on Bitcoin will most likely lead to an immediate implementation of the Lightning network, as seen in Litecoin’s most recent facilitation of a Lightning micropayment.According to Blockstream developer Rusty Russell, Litecoin processed its first SegWit-based Lightning transaction that is worth about 1.3 cents. The transaction was settled in less than a second on a non-test network initiated by fellow Blockstream developer Christian Decker.The effect of Lightning on the optimization of Bitcoin blocks is still speculative, mainly because Litecoin’s blocks are almost 90 percent empty and Lightning could have an entirely different impact on Bitcoin. For instance, Litecoin was designed to process transactions on a 2.5-minute basis, while Bitcoin settles transactions or grants confirmations every 10 minutes. Hence, the speed of Lightning micropayment settlement on Litecoin could significantly differ from that of Bitcoin.Either way, based on Bitcoin’s growing mempool size and the exponential growth in daily transactions, a scaling solution is needed. At this point, SegWit seems like the most viable mid-term scaling solution as it offers infrastructure for two-layer solutions and offers fixes to existing issues such as transaction malleability."

disclosure of the covert usage of AsicBoost by Bitcoin Core ...","Apr 13, 2017",Segregated Witness (SegWit) support has been on the rise ever since the disclosure of the covert usage of AsicBoost by Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell.,"On April 5, Maxwell sent out a letter entitled “Inhibiting a covert attack on the Bitcoin POW function” to the Bitcoin development mailing list. In it, Maxwell explained the possibility of utilizing a method called AsicBoost to exploit a flaw in the Proof of Work function of Bitcoin.Maxwell wrote:“There are two major ways of exploiting the underlying vulnerability: One obvious way which is highly detectable and is not in use on the network today and a covert way which has significant interaction and potential interference with the Bitcoin protocol. The covert mechanism is not easily detected except through its interference with the protocol. In particular, the protocol interactions of the covert method can block the implementation of virtuous improvements such as segregated witness.”Upon the release of Maxwell’s letter, the vast majority of the community assumed that the company or the ASIC manufacturer in question was Bitmain. In fact, Bitcoin journalist Kyle Torpey confirmed with a source that Bitmain was the company mentioned in Maxwell’s letter.As expected, Bitmain refuted the claims of Maxwell with a response statement. In it, Bitmain denied the usage of AsicBoost on the mainnet of Bitcoin but admitted to testing the technology on testnet, which further validated the statement of Maxwell.“I never alleged that I could prove they were using it on mainnet, only that their hardware secretly supported it. They've admitted to putting it in their hardware and to using it on testnet. They claim that haven't used it on mainnet ""for the good of the network""-- but the constantly produce empty blocks (a potential asicboost sign) and argued that it was fine because the protocol permits it, when people complained,” Maxwell said in a separate statement.Controversy on the Bitmain-AsicBoost discussion deepened when various users discovered several loopholes in the public statement of Bitmain. Although the company denied the actual usage of AsicBooost on Bitcoin’s mainnet, it did not specify whether their statement applied to its subsidiaries and other companies they own.""More importantly, Bitmain admitted their ownership of a patent on AsicBoost.""However, the company was criticized for failing to credit the original inventors of AsicBoost Timo Hanke and Sergio Lerner, who reportedly hold a patent on AsicBoost elsewhere.Whalepanda, a cryptocurrency trader, further emphasized in his blog post that Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu’s strange behavior and his support for AsicBoost-compatible solutions or proposals such as a BCoin’s extension block proves his intent to protect AsicBoost from being disabled permanently with solutions like SegWit.Whalepanda wrote:“Yesterday BCoin’s proposal came with Extension Blocks which is compatible with ASICBoost. BCoin didn’t follow the normal rules of Bitcoin proposals but got the media immediately involved. EB was nothing new, they just needed another excuse to stall.”Apart from his AsicBoost discovery, Maxwell and the rest of the Bitcoin Core development team privately disclosed bugs and technical errors in the Bitcoin Unlimited software to its development team. In return, the Bitcoin Unlimited development team has been attempting for weeks to publicize supposed bugs in Core’s software although they turned out to be non-existent.“Next time you have a suspected vulnerability in Bitcoin Core, it would be helpful if told us immediately instead of discussing it in public for 13 days first. There are vulnerabilities in unlimited which have been privately reported to you in Unlimited by Bitcoin Core folks which you have not acted on, sadly. More severe than this one, in fact,” Maxwell said.So far, Maxwell has made a point in disclosing bugs and errors in the Bitcoin Unlimited software and unraveling the intent behind some mining pools and companies which opposed SegWit."

powering it.” Later, in the exclusive interview with Cointelegraph he ...","Apr 25, 2017","A couple of weeks ago Bitcoin legend Charlie Shrem hosted a BlockShow Europe 2017 which was organized by Cointelegraph Events in partnership with Deloitte Germany, nexussquared and BlockPay. The event in Munich became the largest Blockchain-related event organized in Europe so far, attracting over 550 attendees, offering a stage to 32 international speakers and opening an exhibition hall to 25 Blockchain and cryptocurrency businesses.","Shrem himself was impressed by the level of event’s organization. He tells Cointelegraph:“BlockShow is really great. I’ve been to a bunch of events in the US and this was my first trip outside of the US in the last four years and had to pick a good event. Cointelegraph is not new to the industry, you guys have been around for many years. So it’s not like there are a few events funded by these new entities that do not really understand what the vision was. Of course, you have to know where you came from to know where you are going. So it is a great choice for you guys to organize the BlockShow 2017. It was super awesome and exciting.”Shrem opened the event with the keynote discussing the current state of the Blockchain, where he compared the technology with the printing press for its potential to move the control out of the hands of the few back to the people.“It gave people the ability to publish their own information very cheaply across borders around the world and distribute it in a decentralized way,” he says. “Bitcoin is the printing press of our time and the Blockchain is what is powering it.”Later, in the exclusive interview with Cointelegraph he elaborated on this thought and shared his view on where we are now in maturing of Blockchain technology, as well as what we should expect next.Only the laziest is not talking about Blockchain nowadays. As a rule already, the words ‘Blockchain’ and ‘revolutionize’ go together. But with all the hype around the technology, we need to be realistic. Shrem suggests to keep your feet on the ground while dreaming about all of the good it can do.“We still don’t even know what this technology actually is, we all thought and we were all pretty confident that Bitcoin was going to disrupt finance and that was it,” he notes. “Over the past few years, we’ve seen all these applications that cover supply chain, logistics, content distribution, all this different stuff that you didn’t even know Blockchain could do. And it pushes us back too a little, we are having all these re-discoveries.”The use cases suggested by the Blockchain technology seem to be endless, indeed, however, it does not necessarily mean that technology behind Bitcoin is mature enough to be deployed and implemented on a larger scale just yet, or is it?Shrem shares his perception of technology maturation:“Bitcoin and Blockchain are still in its experimental phase, we are not even in version 1.0 yet, I think we are super early, I think we are in the mid-90s, it can take us another 20 years to see the mainstream adoption that we all are looking for. I’ve always thought that Blockchain tech is in its college years, it knows what it is, it kinda knows what it wants to do, now thinking of how to actually do it. But maybe it’s more like it’s back in high school because we can’t still figure out what we are doing and what we can do. There’s no reason to rush it.”The most successful implementation of Blockchain technology to this day is Bitcoin and I guess nobody can deny that this is where the tech is actually mature enough. As for the application of Blockchain technology in other areas, there’s a lot of hurdles, both technical and non-technical.To start with, how do you convince institutions to replace something that has been operating (even if with relative success) for so many years with something radically new. Besides, there are technical issues that need to be addressed.“Unfortunately, or rather, fortunately, the tech has grown so much, and now we have all these scaling issues. It’s kind of like champagne problems – when we won the elections what type of champagne do we want to drink? Well, let’s do that later, let’s try to win the elections first! We are kind of at that stage, but now we need to know,” says Shrem and explains: “Because it can break the whole project - how do we scale? Blockchain scaling has taught us that we need to answer these questions now, we need to know how do we scale, how do we grow because we know it’s going to succeed, we know it’s going to do amazing.”Blockchain technology in other areas is more of a hype perhaps - there is a lot of suggestions (which is great) but we don’t actually see it being implemented, not just yet. Financial services for sure lead the maturity curve nowadays but the adoption rate doesn’t really change. Besides, there are other areas willing to compete in terms of taking a leading role in the implementation of Blockchain.Shrem says:“We have already seen a lot of finance, we are gonna see smart contracts, ICOs are going to be huge the next year too. Supply chain and logistics – people are not looking at it yet. I think it comes to the ways corporations and governments talk to each other, they need to trust each other. How do they share debt settlement, financial information, content, intelligence? Governments all share, the only way they do it now is through a signed agreement. They all are looking for a common non-trusted way to be able to move information around.”Shrem believes that when it will come to the adoption of Blockchain, small corporations are going to drive this process. “Everything is top down, Bitcoin is bottom up,” he notes. “You'll see corporations first, you'll see small banks. We will not even know how big the Blockchain is being used because we will not even know we are using it. What we see and what is already happening is that small banks, corporate institutions that hold reserves, start to hold some percentage of their reserves in Bitcoin. Because they want to hedge, if there’s a potential there’s the future.”Some believe that eventually, Bitcoin will turn into a digital gold and that’s what is going to drive the price of Bitcoin up. Shrem feels positive for everyone holding at least 10 BTC in their wallets now, as in 30 years from now it will be enough to buy a nice house.He recalls the time when the Bitcoin price was going down people would go from crypto back to fiat, however, now when the Bitcoin price is going down, the whole crypto market cap doesn’t move, it is quite the opposite as we see the increase.Shrem explains:“People are going to Dash, Ether, Ripple, but you are not seeing money exit the crypto. If you are looking at the market capitalization of all crypto for the last five years, you’ll notice that it is constant up. It is super positive, Bitcoin is a reserve currency, you don’t see much USD to Dash trading pair, you see Dash/BTC, you see Steem/BTC, Bitcoin is like the reserve currency of all of these altcoins.”Governments’ attitudes towards cryptocurrencies around the world are still inconsistent when it comes to defining the concept, treatment and legality. But a brilliant thing is that regulations are evolving together with the market.Some governments seem to be a little bit more advanced when it comes to regulations. China, India, and Japan set off on to finally make up their minds concerning the status of cryptocurrencies. “The Chinese government is taking more like a ‘work with the businesses’ approach, they are visiting exchanges, they are going there, they are speaking to them, they are not just shutting them down not taking away their money,” remarks Shrem. “I’ve always admired the way the Chinese government has been handling innovation comparing to how other governments have been doing this.”Shrem points out that the Chinese have been a big influence on the Bitcoin price lately. He continues:“If you go to China everyone is excited about Bitcoin and Blockchain technology, even the government is. The Chinese government is actually funding a bunch of different projects. They just want to protect their national interests. And they want to make sure that people aren’t money laundering and that’s understandable. As long as they are not trying to block innovation and they are taking the right attitude, I do applaud the Chinese government so far.”The measures taken might feel a little uncomfortable but who would argue that in the long term it is not going to be good for Bitcoin? Chinese, and now Indians are actually begging the government to regulate Bitcoin because that would mean the acceptability, relevance and approval. “A lot of early adopters were like – no regulation,” notes Shrem and continues: “We shouldn’t use regulation. But the issue is that it's not a question of regulation or no regulation, it is a question of illegal or regulation. And you don’t want it to be illegal, you don’t want a threat of jail. Because jail really sucks, but you have to engage governments, they are going to do what they want to do anyway, but we should try to get the best out of it.”Does it sometimes feel like we are living in some kind of crypto soap opera, with these never-ending dramas, heartbreaks, and mysteries? We have lived through fake Satoshi story, all kinds of internal misunderstandings, certain consortium’s decisions to abandon Blockchain altogether and so on and so forth. Then there was Bitcoin ETF denial.Shrem tells Cointelegraph:“If you asked me about the ETF before it was declined I would say I wish they have never even applied in the first place. Because I felt that a denial would look really bad in the short term. Indeed, an ETF would have been really cool, ‘cause you know my grandfather could buy Bitcoin but Bitcoin is not ready for that yet, we don’t even know what it is, it is so new still. It’s only less than 10 years old, we might need another five to 10 years until we are going to have an ETF traded product. How are you going to regulate something that’s inherently unregulatable?”Indeed, so what they said No? We just dusted off the fluff and moved on. Now, however, we are in the middle of another drama, the outcome of which is said to significantly alter the future of Bitcoin, and the drama is - SegWit vs. BU.Shrem says:“Bitcoin is not free from agenda. Satoshi was very smart and he said – who has the most to gain and the most to lose when it comes to the honesty and integrity of the Blockchain? And that was the miners. The miners spend all the money and they have the financial incentive, which is the best incentive, to keep the Blockchain with its integrity. So governments, institutions, corporations, all these other players, businesses, they are incentivized of course, but they are not directly as incentivized as the miners actually - the miners will always try to make the most of money, but also try to keep the integrity of the Blockchain.”So, are the miners actually represent the power that controls Bitcoin and its future? Shrem says:“I think everyone needs to work together, so we see this whole scaling debate which involves the core developers and the miners but there’s not really a lot of miners, there’s a small group of them, so let’s see what happens. Satoshi built the whole system kind of like with balances of power and we are seeing the balance being pushed to limits. Now we have all these different entities involved and everyone has a say, and maybe they are taking a little bit longer but we are going to have the best possible outcome, the best possible solution, which is tested and production ready.”"

They are called cryptocurrencies. It started with Bitcoin. There have been several others that have been introduced. I own a few of them,” said Maloney.Evidently, an increasing number of investors are moving toward Bitcoin perceiving the digital currency as gold 2.0, a more evolved safe haven asset with transportability and high liquidity, to avoid market instability.The short-term fall in US stocks, bonds and assets have also allowed the Japanese market to strengthen, leading to the longest economic growth streak in over a decade.Although mainstream media outlets including CNN and Bloomberg have emphasized the rising demand for Bitcoin amid economic uncertainty, it seems as if strengthening markets such as Japan are giving investors more confidence and resources to invest in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.As Koji Higashi, the co-founder of IndieSquare and a Japan-based analyst, stated, investing in cryptocurrencies has become the norm after the legalization of Bitcoin by the Japanese government and the exemption of taxes for Bitcoin traders.Higashi wrote:“Japan is known for its homogeneous culture and the key to adoption of anything is whether people perceive that “everyone else is doing it” or not. So, obviously, it seems we have passed the tipping point in Japan and now it’s suddenly completely “OK” to hop onto the crypto train and people started assuming it’s safe to invest in them because “everyone else is doing it”.”At one of the lowest and sharpest declines of stock markets and assets, the US briefly became the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange market, obtaining a 30 percent market share over the global Bitcoin exchange market. At the time of writing, Japan has already reclaimed its title but the US is maintaining its substantially high market share of 30 percent.In the upcoming months, if the US market and economy struggle to recover, the Bitcoin market may see the US exchange market overtake Japan again in the near future."

Capacities",https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-powered-supercomputer-how-to-use-bitcoin-minings-enormous-capacities,"How to make use of enormous Bitcoin mining capacities. Ponomarev, CEO and

This, in turn, reduces the pricing efficiency of computing services and makes the computing market generally unstable and easy to control.SONM has been working on the solution to allow millions of miners worldwide to start supplying computing resources through the SONM Application Pool.It has been noted before that GPU mining is becoming less and less profitable due to the significant increase in mining difficulty. Besides, many cryptocurrencies are going to migrate to a proof-of-stake algorithm making mining equipment practically useless. But GPU mining farms are basically general-purpose computing systems with standard CPUs, sufficient amount of RAM memory and a hard drive. So these resources could potentially be opened up for an access to those demanding computing power.For instance, according to publicly available data, Amazon EC2 C3 Instance Cluster computing power stands at 484 Flops = 0.0004842 EFlops, which is approximately 0.012 percent of the total computing power of all mining equipment (according to SONM calculations the total computing power of altcoin miners’ resources is as high as ~4EFlops). This is not taking into account idle computing power not used in mining, including PCs, mobile devices, game consoles, etc. Provided with a platform for efficient distribution, these computing resources could eventually prevail on the market. Ponomarev, CEO and founder at SONM, has been working in the field of useful calculations since late 2013. He became obsessed with the idea of making use of Bitcoin mining capacities outside the cryptocurrency space. He was going through various fork options until he faced the key limitation - performing calculations directly on Blockchain is not rational, besides it was impossible to create the full P2P scheme. This is how he came up with the idea to create concentration hubs.Ponomarev has successfully completed a study focusing on this issue and started looking for a developer with an already built platform. Through the Russian-speaking community of BOINC, Ponomarev met Andrey Voronkov, who had been conducting research on medicines in Norway.At that time, Voronkov had been struggling with the inefficiency in computing power for biomedical resources. He founded a DrugDiscover@home project, a distributed computing project, which uses the power of different computing devices worldwide (PCs, GPUs, smartphones, clusters, etc.), provided by volunteers to contribute to the discovery of new drugs for cancer, age-related diseases, as well as the development of antibiotics and antivirals. Together with Ponomarev, they embarked on a journey to build a global supercomputer.SONM attracts “neighboring” hubs and deploys unique PoE technology for undetermined computations (e.g. launch of applications, hosting, machine learning, etc.). The platform is built on Yandex.Cocaine which supports a variety of programming languages.Ponomarev notes:“Alignment of programs represent an important concern. OS parameters of a customer’s device and the one of a developer can differ significantly, which might result in errors when launching an application. SONM managed to solve this problem by implementing Docker Container into the system.”He notes that SONM architecture is an extension of many other existing projects, and migration to Yandex.Cocaine, an open source PaaS with a large Russian-speaking community, is one of the most important strategic decisions. As a result of this decision, founder of Cocaine Anton Tyurin joined the SONM team.Development of a supercomputer is certainly a very ambitious task and implies certain challenges. Geographical distances between suppliers of computing power and those in need for it, network congestions and signal collisions are some of the key challenges faced in the field of distributed computing. Besides, devices need to be able to communicate with each other to trade computational resources in real time, therefore they need to be compatible.As noted by Ponomarev, building SONM architecture itself represented a challenge; an enormous amount of time and resources have been invested into combining platforms and systems that allowed for higher security and universality, particularly the integration of Yandex.Cocaine.Ponomarev says:“PaaS technology with open source code, a wide variety of other platforms including BTSync, Whisper, ensures faster exchange of data and communication between nodes, as well as the implementation of Ethereum smart contracts.”Besides that, SONM is challenged to ensure the highest level of security. At the moment, the team is testing a complex, multi-level, anti-fraud system, which is deploying both mechanical and reputational security tools.For a long time, SONM has been considered as a key competitor of Golem. However, the CEO of SONM explains to Cointelegraph:“The project of Polish developers Golem is focused on the development of their own platform, and they moved away from deploying existing solutions in the field of computing, therefore risking getting stuck trying to invent a bicycle and find solutions that have already been found.”Compared to Golem, SONM is making use of existing platforms. Initially, the platform was planned to be built on BOINC platform, however, the SONM team decided to change their strategy.Ponomarev tells Cointelegraph:“Working with BOINC we have faced a few issues, particularly the fact that BOINC platform supports programming languages limited to C++, FORTRAN and Python, and is generally not that universal. Therefore, we have made a decision to migrate to Yandex. Cocaine, which is more flexible and convenient. The platform is the key to universal services and, generally, the implementation of fog computing.”At the moment, the SONM team is investing time, energy and resources into establishing a team of high-end developers, who could work and deliver results according to the SONM roadmap. Besides, SONM is getting ready to launch an alpha version and a user prototype.The SONM team gave a little sneak peak into what is coming next. Once the alpha version is launched, they are planning to release a teaser presenting endless amounts of use-cases for the platform.Ponomarev says:“We decided to make a teaser through a server of popular game Quake. With the unfolding of service locators, we expect companies of AAA class to start purchasing SONM services. We are planning to attract hosting services, which are now working with Amazon. End users and leasers will realize the benefits of hosting websites and applications on SONM platform, as decentralized computing will be much cheaper than those cloud services provided by industry giants.”Step by step, SONM is planning to provide solutions for a wide range of issues. For example, it will be possible to use the platform for computing in science projects, hosting of applications and websites, game servers, neural networks, as well as CGI and video rendering.Ponomarev noted that the project was met with enormous interest in the Blockchain community. The team has managed to collect $500,000 within 10 hours of pre-ICO.There is a huge belief that distributed computing will be able to shake off cloud services from their pedestals. Ponomarev says that it is very important for them to see huge support from the community, as the next step they are planning is to test their platform with companies which are ready to replace AWS, an alike with the fog computing platform developed by SONM.If you are interested in what SONM is working on, be sure to find them at Consensus in New York and at the Blockchain Expo in Berlin. They are open to starting discussions not only with experts from the Blockchain industry but also with those who are full of enthusiasm to work on use-cases for the SONM platform and test it once it is launched."

Web sites, such as Amazon and eBay, have been very successful and their success translated into multi-billion-dollar capitalizations.","It is known, though, that the biggest room in the world is that for improvement. They were revolutionary for their time, offering the users an unprecedented opportunity of trading almost any items across the globe. But by now it is clear that the currently leading online marketplaces are far from perfect.High fees, frequent fraudulent refunds by the sellers and unreliable listings are just some of the most popular criticisms that the likes of eBay and Amazon receive from their users. Too much happiness of the users, though, a new kind of trend is currently emerging on the scene, enabled by the Blockchain technology - decentralized peer-to-peer marketplaces.The appearance of cryptocurrencies has enabled direct payments between users, without the need for any intermediaries. From there, adding the transfer of physical items to the transaction was just one small step, and it has been successfully made by numerous platforms.Today, we take a look at one of the most popular exemplars of this new paradigm - the Bitify market. Our team has actually conducted a purchase from a user there to go through the whole ‘customer experience’ and we will be happy to share it with you.As soon as you enter the website, you are greeted with a login/signup window, as well as a sneak peek of some of the featured items which are currently listed on the market:You can signup using the regular username/password pair, or via your Facebook, Google, Twitter or Windows Live accounts. When signing up, make sure that you enable Google two-factor authentication, as it is an essential security layer in 2017.The actual process of signing up is straightforward: after filling in all the blanks, you will receive an automated confirmation email from Bitify, that will allow you to log into the marketplace. After that, there are two possible ways to search for items to buy.One is to look through the lists of goods featured on the homepage. You will find all kinds of stuff in there: software product keys, accounts registered at online services, guides on different topics, various trinkets and whatnot. The second way of browsing is handy when you need something specific: Bitify has a search feature, which comes with an ability to narrow down to particular categories of goods:After a long period of browsing and deliberating, we at Cointelegraph have made our decision to purchase this beautiful German tankard to satisfy all our drinking needs:After you’ve selected the item you want to buy and committed to paying for it, you have a 48-hour window to conduct the actual payment. The website will let you know how much you have to send - in either BTC or LTC equivalent, depending on your choice. The sum will include the price of the item itself, the shipping cost - if applicable - and, if you choose to use it, the escrow service fee.The escrow is a feature which is highly recommended by Bitify. Here is how it works: instead of sending your Bitcoins/Litecoins directly to the seller, you send them to Bitify instead. The company then holds the coins for a period long enough for the items to be shipped and for you to ensure that whatever you ordered has arrived in adequate condition.After you successfully receive your order and confirm it with Bitify, they release the money from the escrow and send it to the seller, thus concluding the deal. This is an efficient measure of customer protection that ensures that there is no room for fraud from any of the parties. Currently, escrow may be used for any items, and it costs an extra one percent fee per each deal.Anyway, back to our experience. We have sent $101.2 worth of Bitcoins for Bitify to hold them for us, as we chose to use the escrow feature. After that, we’ve got in touch with the seller via the built-in messaging system and briefly discussed the shipping process. A couple of days later, the tankard was on its way.The length of time that you’ll have to wait for the item to arrive depends on the exact post service but for us, it took just a little over two weeks, decent enough. Lo and behold, the successfully delivered tankard:We have confirmed that the item is in perfect condition, and released the money from the escrow - it has been automatically sent to the seller. After that, all we had to do was to leave our positive feedback on the seller’s profile page and thank them for a deal well done.Overall, the experience was a very intuitive and a straightforward one. Thanks to a simple interface, built-in messaging system and an escrow service, there was little room for any problems, and, true enough, we had none.Unfortunately, we didn’t get the chance to see the process from a seller’s standpoint, but, judging by how simple it was for us, and the fact that our counterparty didn’t issue any complaints, it’s easy to imagine that their experience has been similarly pleasant.Cointelegraph team has enjoyed using Bitify and recommends the service to buyers and sellers alike.

On June 12, Ethereum price reached $396, moving closer to Bitcoin’s current market cap of $46 bln.","The Flippening is almost here! https://t.co/tr0jCGuev2 pic.twitter.com/xr8ZU26qz2The cryptocurrency industry, market and community are anticipating the “flipenning” or the possibility of Ethereum surpassing the market of Bitcoin. It is approximately $10 bln away from reaching the market of Bitcoin.Before speculating on the possibility of Ethereum becoming the most dominant Blockchain network, it is important to consider whether its recent price rally can be justified. Has Ethereum demonstrated commercial success? Are actual users utilizing Ethereum to access decentralized applications? Or is it a completely speculative investment and not-so-smart money flowing into the market?Objectively, Ethereum’s recent price rally has been mostly speculative. The vast majority of investors in South Korea, the largest Ethereum exchange market, do not have sufficient knowledge of the purpose, structure, technical intricacies and philosophy of the Ethereum network. Most investors can’t seem to differentiate Ethereum from Bitcoin when the two Blockchain networks fundamentally oppose each other in many ways.Charlie Shrem, the COO of Jaxx, wrote:“ETH is rising because new users want to ""get rich quick with ICO's"". They don't care about the ETH price, and they arent holding. All the supply gets locked by the ICO's in the contract. They won't sell because the price is rising. Demand grows, supply is reduced.”Ethereum’s native token Ether was designed to be used as gas. It isn’t a cryptocurrency or a store of value, unlike other altcoins such as Ethereum Classic that have a fixed supply. Ethereum is based on an inflationary supply to ensure that the network is fueled by Ether, also referred to as gas, within the network.Hence, investors purchasing Ether to utilize it as a currency because it settles much faster than Bitcoin transactions have failed to understand the purpose of Ether. Most investors have purchased Ether due to their overall enthusiasm and optimism toward the network. Very few investors have purchased Ether to participate in ICOs, to use it as a currency or to use it as gas to fuel decentralized applications.It is difficult to justify that the money flowing into the Ethereum market is not speculative because of major markets such as South Korea. In a recent interview, Vitalik Buterin emphasized that he had no idea why South Korea is the largest Ethereum exchange market. He noted that he is aware of the active Ethereum development community within China led by various consortia, educational institutions and conglomerates.South Korea, in contrast, is simply the largest Ethereum exchange market because people are speculating on the value of Ethereum.Over the past year, Ethereum has introduced a phenomenal method of raising investments for startups and companies called ICO. By offering unique tokens that are compatible with the Ethereum network and its token Ether, companies can raise capital without the involvement of intermediaries and mediators.However, as prominent Bitcoin trader and cryptocurrency analyst WhalePanda noted in his blog post, the major factor that led Ethereum’s market cap to surge is the rising popularity of ICOs.He noted:“I do admit I didn’t see this Ethereum bubble coming, but then again I wrongly assumed that no startup would need or even dare to ask $50 million in funding and I also wrongly assumed that people would use common sense and that leading developers would speak out against this sort of practice. Quite the opposite it seems. Ethereum’s sole use case at the moment is ICOs and token creation.”Evidently, ICOs are not the only sole use case of Ethereum. However, its recent price surge has been solely attributed to the growth of ICOs and the launch of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.Ethereum offers an infrastructure and a level of flexibility which Bitcoin simply doesn’t. On the other hand, Bitcoin offers a store of value and a settlement network that is secure and that was designed to operate as money, down to its monetary supply.Even if Ethereum’s market cap surpasses that of Bitcoin, investors shouldn’t consider Ethereum as a superior Blockchain network over Bitcoin. Vice versa, Bitcoin investors shouldn’t dismiss Ethereum because of its smaller market cap. The two Blockchain networks obviously offer features and infrastructures that are unique and are sought out by the market."

Altcoin Along",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-matures-out-of-volatility-ready-to-become-global-currency-take-altcoin-along,"Amid hyperinflation, demonetization and weakening fiat currencies, Bitcoin 
is experiencing real world demand. It may be said that in the last ...","May 2, 2017","Amid hyperinflation, demonetization and weakening fiat currencies, Bitcoin is experiencing real world demand. It may be said that in the last twelve months, Bitcoin has increasingly played a vital role in today's global economy. But does this mean it's on its way to becoming a global currency?","In November 2016, India's government announced that they would be banning two of the country's biggest banknotes, the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000, in a bid to target so-called black money. As a consequence of the country's demonetization, demand for alternative assets increased, one of which was Bitcoin. So much so, that just a few days after the country's move to demonetize high-value currency notes, Google inquiries into the purchase of Bitcoin increased by 20-30 percent.China too has seen an increase in demand for Bitcoin. At the end of last year, China restricted the importation of gold in order to prevent the devaluation of the yuan, making Bitcoin a highly sought-after asset for investors.Whereas in Venezuela, the country's hyperinflated national currency, the bolivar fuerte, is forcing residents to consider their options when it comes to purchasing items. With the Venezuelan bolivar declining each day, more people are utilizing Bitcoin to purchase things such as medicine.Through these examples and the fact that Bitcoin recently reached an all-time high of $1,442, surpassing its previous all-time high of $1,350 at the beginning of March, it indicates that Bitcoin is steadily gaining real world value that could soon see it become mainstream.Speaking to Cointelegraph were Nicolas Cary, co-founder and president at Blockchain.info, and David Motta, investor and CEO of ACQURE Business Solutions, a business consulting firm.Cary says that with transformation things tend to take place slowly and that even though we're in the early stages of transformation with Bitcoin, we can already see the impact this technology is producing on individuals and industries around the world.He explains to Cointelegraph:""Over the past twelve months alone, Bitcoin has matured out of the volatility that has defined the currency to date. It has become a viable investment asset and we've started to see meaningful adoption on a personal level.""However, while Motta believes that fiat currencies will remain in the future, he thinks that governments will learn to adapt and implement digital currencies as part of how money is transacted.""What governments have to lose is the complete control of money,"" he says. ""I believe that just like the masses will eventually be forced to adapt to cryptocurrency, governments will also be forced to adapt and accept cryptocurrency as the next evolution and that it will be part of every nation.""How it's being adapted with other nations can already be seen in countries such as Nigeria and China where remittance payments come with significant fees through traditional money transfer services such as the Western Union or WorldRemit. It's also becoming the most promising technology for the unbanked and underbanked populations and could reach a vast majority of millennials who don't trust banks.""Bitcoin has many advantages, which has led to its impressive growth,"" said Cary. ""Among them is its distributed and global nature, which provides greater stability in the face of geopolitical crisis and its accessibility, which allows for the financial inclusion of billions across the globe who are excluded from the incumbent financial model.""Yet, with debates circulating Bitcoin's potential hard fork and the high fees it charges to transfer transactions unlike other digital currencies, could Bitcoin's rivals remove it from the top spot?Motta states that anytime there is a high demand for something people will charge a premium for it:""This is good news for other currencies as they make their way into the consumer's eyes looking for potential long term gains.""Ethereum, which has a market cap value of just over $7 bln and is the second most valued cryptocurrency, could potentially outpace Bitcoin. With one Ether surpassing $80 for the first time on Monday, the currency is one contender that could outpace Bitcoin.Another altcoin to consider is Dash. Whereas Bitcoin is struggling with its transaction backlog, taking up to an hour to confirm a transaction, Dash is quick with instant transactions taking less than a second. Furthermore, Dash also solves Bitcoin's privacy issue, which could help pitch it ahead of Bitcoin. While this may not be a disadvantage to Bitcoin at the moment, if governments want to look into what people are doing, there is some chance this could be achieved through Bitcoin.Of course, while Bitcoin is the most valued cryptocurrency on the market, its power structure may not be enough to let it adapt. Bitcoin can only succeed if its power elements such as miners, mining pools, exchanges, nodes, etc., work together.While the current structure may need looking into, Cary believes it can be improved on.""I believe you want a financial system to be stable,"" he said. ""The current structure ensures that stability by making changes [is] hard – though not impossible – to implement.""Another important point to look at is the fact that as the Bitcoin mining network grows, so too does the amount of electricity needed to confirm transactions. At the moment, it's estimated that by 2020, Bitcoin mining could consume 14,000 megawatts of electricity. This is comparable to all of Denmark's consumption.Even though Bitcoin is the most popular digital currency on the market, is it the best option for mass adoption across households if it will increase electricity use compared to existing financial services?It can be assumed that new and existing altcoin are learning from Bitcoin, which will help them produce a more sustainable alternative for mass adoption.""I believe Bitcoin is already the next big currency, but I also believe many other cryptocurrencies are positioning themselves to be adopted by the masses,"" states Motta.At this point in time, banks and governments have plenty to lose while the Bitcoin community has a lot to win. Banks and governments benefit from fiat money, but even if they give the benefits back to the people, they won't hand over the power. Ultimately, this will make digital currencies more attractive.Whereas TV stations and newspapers were once considered the “banks” where you could only find out what's going on in the world in a centralized, organized and censored fashion, now you can do so by watching a YouTube video that can reach millions worldwide. How information is disseminated, is changing.So too is how we consider money and where it comes from. The monopoly from big banks will shift as the masses realize they have the power to create structures independently.Cary concludes:""My perspective is that we will see a rich digital ecosystem that includes Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies and central bank-backed digital currencies working alongside each other."""

Other three Guardsmen – Derrick Shelton, Quentin Stewart, and Jamal Moody – pleaded guilty for wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and conspiracy to commit access device fraud.","On June 2, the two indicted persons, James Stewart and Vincent Grant, were caught red-handed using Bitcoins in purchasing stolen credit and debit card numbers. They bought the credit cards from a number of foreign websites. The Justice Department records reveal that Stewart and Grant were also prosecuted last year.The perpetrators successfully skimmed credit card information by using advanced magnetic strip tools. The numbers were then transferred to dummy cards which were used to purchase merchandise from Army and Air Force Exchange Service stores stationed at various US military bases. Apparently, the duo also bought items from other locations all over Maryland.Stewart was found guilty on charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft. Grant, on the other hand, was convicted for conspiracy to commit access device fraud and also aggravated identity theft. Overall, five members of the US Army National Guard were arrested and charged.James, Shelton, and Quentin will face a maximum of 20 years imprisonment, while Grant and Moody are heading on to a maximum of seven-and-half year sentence. All of the five suspects involved will also face a mandatory imprisonment of two years minimum for aggravated identity theft.Even though Bitcoin is known as a dynamic cryptocurrency, key lapses in its blockchain data enabled the frauds committed by the indicted Guardsmen. With the prevalence of such crime, many experts are certain that blockchain platforms will have stricter, anti-fraud systems. Since many ‘Bitcoin frauds’ are still operational, heightened vigilance is needed by Bitcoin owners whenever doing transactions online."

While this correlation has not been proven, it is an interesting indicator of Bitcoin price to consider.","On April 12, the Chinese yuan strengthened against most of the world’s reserve currencies, including the US dollar.Immediately after the initial surge in the value the Chinese yuan, Bitcoin price, as listed on major Bitcoin exchanges, fell by around five percent from $1,232 to $1170.Although a five percent fluctuation in Bitcoin price is often perceived as normal daily volatility, the correlation between the decline of Bitcoin price and the strong performance of the yuan triggered the interests of day-to-day traders.In the past, BTC/CNY pair was considered to be a major determining factor of Bitcoin price until Chinese regulators enforced a policy which required local Bitcoin exchanges to implement trading fees.Upon the integration of a small trading fee, inflated trading volumes of Chinese exchanges vanished, massively decreasing the daily trading volume of the Chinese Bitcoin exchange market as a whole.Until late 2016, the Chinese Bitcoin exchange market was believed to process around 95 percent of global trading. However, the enforced trading fees unraveled the true volume of Chinese Bitcoin exchanges, which currently only account for eight percent of the global Bitcoin exchange market.With eight percent of the global Bitcoin trading volume, it seemed unlikely that a factor which affects the Chinese market would impact the global Bitcoin exchange market and ultimately, Bitcoin price.Some traders including Tone Vays noted that the US market and its traders closely follow the Chinese market and a correlation between the Chinese market and Bitcoin price could actually stem from reactive trading from US-based traders and investors.Simply put, US traders expecting Bitcoin price to decline as a result of the strengthening of the Chinese yuan sell the digital currency which leads to a short-term fall in Bitcoin price.Currently, with over 27 percent of the global Bitcoin trading volume and as the second largest Bitcoin exchange market, the US has substantially more leverage over Bitcoin price than the Chinese market.Therefore, it is highly likely that reactive trading from the US traders often leads to the decline of Bitcoin price upon the increase in the Chinese yuan."

Know ...","Apr 20, 2017","Cathy Mulligan, co-director of Imperial College London’s Center for Cryptocurrency Research and Engineering, stated that the lack of regulatory frameworks for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are holding back Bitcoin startups in many regions.","India is a prime example of Mulligan’s concern with insufficient and impractical regulatory frameworks. Startups, exchanges and trading platforms in India are currently self-regulating themselves with strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) policies due to the lack of regulations and clarity in the country.Although Indian regulators confirmed with local publications that the legality of Bitcoin will be decided by May 20, 2017, for years, Indian Bitcoin exchanges and companies were not able to achieve their full potential. They target the country’s general consumer base due to the government’s unclear regulations toward Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.Mulligan explained that startups in the UK are experiencing the same issues as companies in India. Startups are requesting clarity on regulations for Bitcoin and Blockchain development but the country’s regulators are yet to provide clear regulatory frameworks for the Bitcoin and Blockchain industries to grow.“We have the situation in the UK where many startups are chasing the regulator to say, ‘How are we going to be regulated?’ Bitcoin in the UK is really treated as private money. If you tried to exchange Bitcoin for sterling you don’t get charged VAT on the value of the Bitcoin but it is charged on, for example, the commission instead. From the UK perspective, we haven’t seen huge amounts of regulation,” said Mulligan.Unlike other regions such as the US and China, Bitcoin exchanges and trading platforms are not required by the UK law to establish AML and KYC systems. However, the majority of exchanges do have strict AML and KYC systems in place to avoid similar issues OKCoin and Huobi suffered in China.When the Chinese government rolled out its AML and KYC regulations on Bitcoin exchanges, Huobi and OKCoin were required to halt their services until they comply to the newly drafted regulatory frameworks.“They aren’t being forced to have AML or ‘know your customer’ regulation just yet. I think what will happen in Japan is, there will be an influx in startups because the business environment is stable and you’ll know how you’re going to regulate it,” added Mulligan.In order for Bitcoin to achieve wide mainstream adoption as the digital currency, governments must approve it as legal tender and enforce practical regulations for the industry to develop.The Japanese and Philippine governments introduced official regulatory frameworks on Bitcoin after recognizing it as legal tender and payment method. Such clarity in the legality of Bitcoin allowed the Bitcoin industries in Japan and Philippines to experience a rapid rate of growth.Eitan Jankelewitz, an attorney at Blockchain and cryptocurrency-focused law firm Sheridans, explained that Bitcoin hasn’t demonstrated its full potential as a digital cash system and currency. For Bitcoin to achieve complete mainstream adoption, Jankelewitz reaffirmed that efficient regulatory frameworks must be introduced.Jankelewitz wrote:“The brutal truth is that as a currency in the UK, and perhaps globally, it hasn’t taken off. People generally buy it because they think it’s going to increase in value in the long term or they just like the volatility and they decide they are going to trade it the same way you trade gold. It’s another currency, but there’s no burning need for it.”"

It's the ultimate insurance policy against autocracy, currency curbs and other forms of value destruction.Bitcoin is a unique store of value, settlement network and digital currency in the sense that it offers absolute financial freedom and independence to its users. Within Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer network, users can send each other transactions or payments with the absence of intermediaries and third party service providers.Palihapitiya described Bitcoin as the insurance policy against autocracy, or a government with absolute power, and currency curbs because of its decentralized nature. Central entities or authorities can’t possibly censor, restrict, manipulate and control the Bitcoin network.For this reason, to prevent Bitcoin moving over to the over-the-counter (OTC) market that is arguably much harder to oversee and surveil, governments were forced to adopt and regulate Bitcoin against their will. Regulated or not people will still use Bitcoin. With regulatory frameworks, however, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) policies can be used to the advantage of the government to identify Bitcoin users.However, the emergence of privacy-focused two layer solutions such as TumbleBit could potentially offer complete financial privacy to users because it can obscure both inputs and outputs to render Bitcoin transactions anonymous.Bitcoin as insurance policy against currency curbsOver the past year and a half, since early 2016, high profile and institutional investors have begun to perceive Bitcoin as a safe haven asset or digital gold. Hence, investors in China, the US and Japan have begun to rely on Bitcoin to protect themselves against abrupt financial troubles or currency curbs, essentially using Bitcoin as a wealth management product (WMP).Such reliance and dependence on Bitcoin has led to a surge in the demand for Bitcoin and granted Bitcoin another identity apart from its primary identity of digital currency and digital cash. This was outlined by Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto in the Bitcoin white paper.Palihapitiya also commented on the comparison between digital asset Ethereum and Bitcoin, when he was asked why he personally prefers Bitcoin over Ethereum.He responded:“Coke v Pepsi. Pick the more mainstream option that more people can easily consume. Both will make money but bigger is always better.”Simply put, Palihapitiya explained that Bitcoin has the resources and market to achieve mainstream adoption ahead of Ethereum."

pending transactions, recorded more than 82,000 transactions.","Apr 30, 2017","On April 29, the Bitcoin mempool, the holding area for unconfirmed and pending transactions, recorded more than 82,000 transactions. Most transactions were delayed for up to 48 hours.","When a Bitcoin transaction is signed and sent to the network, it is first verified by the Bitcoin network’s nodes. Once the transaction successfully passes the first stage of verification, it then sits on the mempool awaiting for miner confirmation. After several confirmations from Bitcoin miners, the transaction is broadcasted to the public Blockchain of Bitcoin.During the second verification phase, miners prioritize transactions with high fees. In order to have transactions confirmed faster, transaction initiators attach higher fees to incentivize the miners. Even though a transaction with a higher fee is initiated long after a group of transactions with lower fees, miners tend to prioritize the transaction with a higher fee and broadcast it to the network.Currently, Bitcoin’s block size is capped at one MB. According to Blockchain.info, the average block size as of April 29 is 927 KB, which is extremely close to the maximum capacity of Bitcoin’s one MB block size cap.The increasing size of Bitcoin blocks are leading to a larger amount of delayed transactions stuck in the Bitcoin mempool and the growth of the fee market. In Bitcoin, fee market is referred to an ecosystem wherein users compete to add higher fees to have their transactions confirmed at a faster rate.Until a Bitcoin scaling solution such as Bitcoin Core’s Segregated Witness, Andrew Lee’s Extension Blocks and Bitcoin Unlimited is activated to increase the capacity of the Bitcoin Blockchain, the fee market will continue to exist.To ensure that the recipient of the transaction does not suffer from long confirmation period that could range up to 72 hours, it is important to utilize Bitcoin wallet platforms with appropriate fee estimation features.Blockchain, the world’s most popular Bitcoin wallet platform with over 12 mln users, have an accurate fee estimation feature which allows users to predict when the transaction will be confirmed.For instance, when a fee is attached, Blockchain provides its users a certain time period, such as 10 minutes one hour, until the first confirmation is secured. Once the first confirmation is secured, it will take approximately 10 minutes for additional confirmations. On Blockchain, three confirmations is the standard for all users.There are various innovative platforms such as 21 Inc’s Bitcoin Fees that allows users to find the optimal transaction fee for their transactions. Since the optimal transaction fee could vary depending on many variables such as the size of the transaction, 21 Fees note that 140 satoshis/byte is the optimal fee for Bitcoin transactions.On average, the Bitcoin transaction size is 226 bytes. Thus, a $0.4 fee would allow a user to secure its first confirmation within 10 minutes.Samourai Wallet, a privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet platform, is currently working to release the full version of its application that features Peter Todd’s replace-by-fee function, which allows recipients to add fees on top of the initial fee attached by the sender to speed up the confirmation process."

Uniquely, Mobi allows customers to send money in any currency, including Bitcoin to any of Twitter's 319 mln users.Mobi will also appeal to Bitcoin users and those looking to hedge or speculate on Bitcoin and other currencies’ price movements by allowing instant in-app conversions between Bitcoin and 154 currencies with no trading fee.Innovations in the payments industry have been led by Chinese companies for quite some time with the likes of AliPay and WeChat, although Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCC, believes Mobi will succeed where the other Chinese payment technologies have not.Bobby Lee says:“Mobi is the only app that supports instant conversion, storage and transfer of 100+ currencies so it can be used worldwide compared to AliPay and WeChat which only supports CNY, and can only be used in China. With Mobi you can send any form of money to anyone, anywhere. Mobi eliminates friction in money transfers, making money truly global.”All Mobi accounts are linked to the users’ mobile number, so all that is needed to use it is a smartphone. Mobi users can instantly transfer funds to any of the two bln other global smartphone users using Mobi’s private Blockchain. Mobi also supports Bitcoin transfers on the Bitcoin public Blockchain.The optional debit card is linked to users’ Mobi accounts allowing them to withdraw fiat in any currency at ATMs worldwide as well as enabling the spending of funds at any retail point of sale that supports Visa. The debit card automatically deducts funds from the customer's’ wallet balance.Mobi also offers support for 15 languages including English, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish.Lee concludes:“Mobi will take Bitcoin mainstream with mobile number accounts, Twitter payments, 100+ currencies and a Visa debit card.

From its value of about $8 at the year’s start, it has gone on to attain a figure of more than $350, and despite the recent correction haggles around this level.It has been within the last few years that cryptocurrencies have gained much favor among investors who are looking for alternative means of investing other than the traditional investment mediums. While most investors still have their money invested in traditional financial markets, such as the stock market and the forex market, a lot of these investors have become worried about the economic climate of the world economy.With recent events pointing to its inherent instability, many investors have been looking to other means of investment where they can put their money.With the creation and popularization of cryptocurrency, as well as its sharp rise in value, many investors, especially those from Asia, have joined in on the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trend.While most people are more familiar with Bitcoin, Ethereum has also gained its fair share of the market. However, the key difference between the two lies in the technology used by Ethereum and Bitcoin.The difference in the system would be that Ethereum’s data processing is much faster than Bitcoin, as Ethereum’s system automatically applies the terms and conditions of a contract once it has been agreed upon.While many might think that Ethereum may be inferior to Bitcoin because its price value is lower, this is actually a good thing for potential investors who are looking for means of investing other than Bitcoin. The lower price may attract more investors as there is more room for growth. The only drawback would be that Ethereum is not as well established as Bitcoin. In consideration of this, Bitcoin is safer than Ethereum.Cryptocurrencies have made their mark ever since the inception of Bitcoin in 2009, and they are continuing to grow. In fact, the value of legitimate cryptocurrencies has grown much since that time.Though cryptocurrencies are doing very well this year, analysts foresee that when the economic climate is better, investors will go back to traditional investment mediums and leave cryptocurrencies. When this happens, the volatility of cryptocurrencies will go down due to the decrease in demand.Of course, the next few years will still see the growth of cryptocurrencies, which will help the industry remain quite strong. While this is all happening, it would definitely be a good idea for investors to hold on to their cryptocurrencies as they continue to strive for future growth.Read more: How to Buy Bitcoin: Best Practices, Where to Buy, Tips"

who also went by the name of “Dread Pirate Roberts” online, lost his ...","Jun 15, 2017","Bitcoin is a currency that is born out of the Internet and is used on networks both for legal and illegal purposes - the intervention of the state at some level is a foregone conclusion. When it comes to the sale of drugs online, the issues are complex and serious and there is more than what meets the eye.","Recently, Ross Ulbricht, a man who also went by the name of “Dread Pirate Roberts” online, lost his appeal for a new trial. He was the man behind the infamous Silk Road marketplace and operated the website between 2011 and 2013. The marketplace sold things such as drugs, weapons and other contraband.Ulbricht has been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole and his original sentence will stand. Silk Road payments were made in Bitcoin and, in fact, $15 mln worth of Bitcoin was recovered from Ulbricht’s computer when he was arrested.In a story titled “Opioid Dealers Embrace the Dark Web to Send Deadly Drugs by Mail,” the New York Times published the news of the death of two 13-year-olds, Grant Seaver and Ryan Ainsworth.These boys died at Park City, Utah after consuming an opioid called “pinky” that they had procured through the dark web using Bitcoin. The father of Grant, Jim Seaver, was quoted in the New York Times as saying: “It’s unimaginable that Grant could gain access to a drug like Pinky so easily, and be gone so quickly, poof. The pain and brutality of this tragedy is crippling.”According to the same report, there are more than 21,000 listings of opioids and more than 4,100 for fentanyl and similar drugs on AlphaBay, a dark web marketplace.The answer perhaps lies hidden in the darkness of the dark web. Often, drug dealers and consumers have to go underground to get their drugs, exposing themselves to ruthless drug dealers who will sell to anyone who has the money.Ever since Nixon popularized the term “the war on drugs,” there has been a consistently wrong policy applied to tackling the issue of drugs and addictions. Many countries have created systems where drug users are branded as criminals and we have filled prisons with people who are not inherently criminal.The best policy could be the legalization of drugs and an above board selling these substances so that the users can get rid of the stigma and get the help they need.The often cited example is Portugal, where the government treats drug-related issues as one of health and not criminal matters. According to the NPR, drug-related HIV infections in Portugal have since dropped 95 percent. Clearly, there are side benefits associated with the legalization of drugs.Bitcoin is a medium of exchange and even if it disappears one day, people who are forced to go underground to procure their fill of drugs will simply use another medium to get what their addicted bodies need.On the matter of regulation, so that underage users can’t get access to drugs, Tone Vays of Cryptoscam.com tells us:“No, what is needed is the legalization of drugs so that those who are selling drugs legally to adults would help expose those abusing the laws and interfering with legal businesses.”The regulation of Bitcoin is not going to achieve anything significant in either the upliftment of people who abuse substances nor would it benefit the law enforcement authorities. It would simply be chasing symptoms instead of tackling the real problem.David Mondrus, CEO of Trive.news, says:“No to regulation. Regulations never decrease, only increase. And the road to hell is ALWAYS paved with good intentions.”"

The travel bookings giant made a significant step forward and issued a statement that they will accept Bitcoin earlier in 2014.We tried it out, the question was simple: does that really work from Eastern Europe? The answer: nothing happens. Nothing at all. You can pay with your credit card or PayPal, you can use other conventional payment systems but you cannot pay with Bitcoin.The story begins really well. Everybody knew what expedia.com said about Bitcoin acceptance earlier in 2014. To refresh our memory, here were their words:""Bitcoin is a great example of how Expedia is investing early in an array of payment options to give our customers and partners more choice in the ways they interact with us,” expedia.com told Coindesk. “Customers simply indicate Bitcoin as their method of payment and then follow a few steps to safely and securely complete each transaction.”The statements were once appropriate, you can only use Bitcoins to book hotels. Maybe, you could, but now you can’t.After a year the good mood of the travel bookings giant had a bit shutter. In 2015, 40 percent of the Bitcoin payment orders flew away with the Bitcoin price decline.Though statements were made, as this:""We accept Bitcoin as a way of just allowing customers to pay with whatever method they want to pay. For us, Bitcoin is on an even playing field with the other payment types we offer.""In 2015, they added:""We accept Bitcoin on hotels only where we are a merchant of record. So for some of the hotels that we sell we are the merchant, meaning that you, as a customer are the one paying on our site directly when you are trying to book.""So, we tried booking, but no Bitcoin paying possibility.Though there is a long Terms and Condition list on Expedia’s website, you can’t pay with Bitcoin. Or maybe it is just not possible to do so from Hungary.So, now in 2017, you cannot find any possibilities to pay with your Bitcoins. We tried to reach Expedia’s press office.We asked a few simple questions: Is there an opportunity to pay with Bitcoin on your website? Is it public how many Bitcoin users could use - or maybe used the website and the expedia.com? Will there be an opportunity to pay with cryptocurrencies, if yes, when? Nobody answers anything.Cointelegraph tried to reach other travel and hospitality service giants, like booking.com, or Airbnb, surprisingly no answer came. After Bitcoin steadily reached and passed the red $1000 barrier, it seems no travel services can be bought with Bitcoin from the major service providers.By Tamas Csizmadia"

With the Kurdish People's Protection Units [YPG] military group, the anarchist hacker stood at the front line and actively engaged in the war against ISIS. In an interview, Taaki stated:""When I discovered Rojava [the term Kurds use to refer to northern or Syrian Kurdistan] I felt I had to go there. At first, I was completely scared - I thought I was going to die. I got sent to the frontline. I had no training, and I was given a Kalashnikov. I learned how to use a gun on the way, another Western fighter showed me. I found myself on the front with a gun, I had to fight. But I wanted to go elsewhere, where my skills would be useful.""Taaki, who is best known as the creator of DarkMarket and operator of Bitcoin exchange Bitcoinica, was one of the most important figures in the early stages of Bitcoin development. In fact, New York Times reporter Nathaniel Popper, who wrote the book Digital Gold, initially planned on focusing the narrative of his book on Taaki and his involvement with Bitcoin.At one point, Taaki was one of the four main developers to write off the Bitcoin code. During that time, Taaki also introduced DarkMarket, an anonymous marketplace which operates like Tor’s darknet marketplaces, which allows users to purchase or sell items with full anonymity. The platform was based on a technology called Dark Wallet, that essentially allowed users to make anonymous Bitcoin payments, for financial privacy.However, in August of 2012, the Bitcoin exchange Bitcoinica, which Taaki took over, was hacked. The hack led to the loss of $228,000 worth of Bitcoin and one Bitcoin was equivalent to $10 at the time of the hack. Prior to the August 2012 hack, Bitcoinica also lost more than 40,000 Bitcoins in a security breach. In total, based on the current Bitcoin price, Bitcoinica was responsible for the loss of $66 mln worth of Bitcoin.Many executives and CEOs of existing Bitcoin companies suffered from the hacks of Bitcoinica. Two of the many victims were Kraken CEO Jesse Powell and Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver.The anonymity and intrigue of developers like Taaki ultimately attracted more attention to Bitcoin and added more unique characteristics to Bitcoin. As Popper wrote:""Bitcoin's survival early on depended on young programmers like Amir who had the naive hubris to think that they could change the world, and the programming skills to begin laying the groundwork for that change.""The motive of Taaki wasn’t his opposition against ISIS. The reason why Taaki left the UK to fight in Syria was to bring peace in the Middle East with his abilities to create a decentralized and fair economy. Like he did for Bitcoin, Taaki aimed to contribute in creating an alternative financial infrastructure for the local people and thus, develop a lasting economy.Taaki said:""My main goal with going to Rojava was not because I opposed ISIS, it's because I support their [the Kurds'] revolution. I support their politics and their struggle. It is the only solution for lasting peace in the Middle East. They're trying to create a people's economy. To establish a decentralized economy, you need decentralized money. Rojava's under embargo, so there's no way to move money in or out. So we have to actually create our own Bitcoin economies. Now we have a technological tool for people to freely organize outside the state system. Because it is a currency not controlled by central banks.""Upon his return to the UK, Taaki was immediately arrested by local police. Currently, he is on police bail and awaiting for the investigation to close."

Ethereum and not Bitcoin that you should be watching,” Fuller told ...","Mar 27, 2017","The online gambling industry and Bitcoin are illustrating how profitable they can be when the two are put together with multiple casinos accepting digital currency payments. So much so, that between February and March, an average of $4,000 of Bitcoin was wagered every minute. But according to industry expert James Fuller of BigcoinGambling.com, Bitcoin gambling is just the tip of an enormous cryptographic iceberg and is currently distracting players and operators from something far more interesting happening deep within the belly of cryptocurrency betting.","“If you want to look at the bleeding edge of online gambling then it’s Ethereum and not Bitcoin that you should be watching,” Fuller told Cointelegraph. “Many casinos are experiencing a ‘fear of missing out’ when dealing with Bitcoin, but if they looked a little deeper they’d see that Ethereum’s smart contract technology is on the cusp of rewriting the industry as a whole.”Bitcoin is succeeding as a replacement for fiat currency betting. Its value comes in its security and for some – anonymity – when playing at online casinos. Fuller says, though, that whilst this is a useful application of the currency, an entirely new paradigm is being formed on the back of Ethereum smart contracts.Trustless online gambling has only recently been made possible through Ethereum’s enablement of smart contracts. Smart contracts, the code of which is publicly available for audit, ensure that a bet is paid out to the correct party based on agreed conditions between those involved. These contracts require no middlemen and a collection of contracts can replace entire gambling operators without any need for oversight – the code is guaranteed to run thanks to the Ethereum virtual machine. These smart contracts result in drastically reduced operational costs for the businesses that deploy them.“With lower costs comes a lower house edge; and it’s possible that in the future, smart contract gambling applications will operate at a zero percent house edge,” says Fuller. “It’s hard to imagine what a gambling industry with zero percent house edge would mean for players and operators, but it would certainly shake up an industry that has stayed fairly stable for the past couple of decades.”Fuller adds that with a zero percent house edge, though, other means of monetization would need to be found and competing with the marketing budgets of traditional casinos would be extremely difficult.Profitability isn’t the only problem that’s holding back smart contract gambling applications, says Fuller, stating that smart contracts are still too young, which is witnessing problems with adoption and user experience that are ‘insurmountable at this moment in time.’“We expect the status quo to remain as it is for at least the next two years whilst smart contract casinos have their ‘bells and whistles’ attached,” he added. “But developments beneath the surface of this market are moving fast and what we’re seeing may well swallow the gambling industry whole.”It’s not just the traditional casino experience that Ethereum is expected to disrupt. Entirely new facets of online gambling are being realized, with Fuller positing that the prediction market platform Augur is proving itself to be the most promising real world application currently in development.Augur aims to enable the forecasting of future events by allowing anyone in the world to make permissionless bets on any given outcome. Using the “wisdom of the crowd”, forecasters can make predictions with greater levels of accuracy, whilst players can stake and earn real value tokens (REP) if their prediction is correct.Despite such promising applications for the betting industry, the reality is that gambling, a pastime whose origins can be traced back to Europe and China, is unlikely to change much anytime soon.And yet, with the advent of Bitcoin and latterly, Ethereum’s smart contracts, trustless and permissionless betting could become a huge market in the not too distant future, says Fuller.“Augur is doing some really interesting things that the mainstream public would want to get involved with, which is great because to get involved they’ll need to enter into the Ethereum Blockchain,” Fuller concludes. “Great for adoption.”"

Zcash Support",https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-to-mine-after-ethereums-pos-worlds-first-bitcoin-mining-pool-adds-zcash-support,"“We have introduced support for Zcash mining today. That is quite a huge 
step for us, as we have focused solely on Bitcoin and merged mining ...","Apr 23, 2017","Zooko Wilcox, the CEO of Zerocoin Electric Coin Company (ZECC), the development team behind the anonymous cryptocurrency Zcash, revealed that Slush Pool, the world’s first Bitcoin mining pool, added support for Zcash.","In a public statement, Slush Pool announced:“We have introduced support for Zcash mining today. That is quite a huge step for us, as we have focused solely on Bitcoin and merged mining so far. It took us many months to develop and thoroughly test our Zcash mining system. We have already successfully mined over 20 blocks during the private testing stage and we are hungry for more.”In its blog post entitled “5 Reasons to Mine Zcash with Slush Pool,” Slush Pool outlined five major reasons why miners should be interested in mining Zcash. One of the reasons listed by the Slush Pool team was Advanced Account Security.In October of 2016, Trezor reaffirmed the importance of Universal Second Factor (U2F) and its advantages over applications such as Google’s Authenticator that is built on top of a 2FA implementation called a Time-based One-time password.While the TOTP method utilized by Google and its widely utilized application Google Authenticator is simple to implement, the Trezor development team revealed that it has severe weaknesses and inconveniences.Mostly, the disadvantages of TOTP are related to security issues that may arise due to the lack of back up and the maintenance of backup codes online. Any file, data or server that is connected to the Internet and brought online can be vulnerable to attacks and security breaches. Most importantly, TOTP allows the provider to hold the same cryptographic key or one-time password, which then enables hackers to get ahold of user passwords.“You and Provider share the same secret. If an attacker hacks into a company and gains access to both the password and the secrets database, he/she will be able to access every account completely unnoticed,” explained the Trezor team.Considering the security benefits of using Zcash with Trezor and U2F authentication and the reputation of Slush Pool, real-time statistics of Zcash mining and elimination of pool fees, Slush Pool stated that miners who are interested in mining alternative cryptocurrencies apart from Bitcoin should actively look into Zcash mining.It is a positive move for both Slush Pool and the cryptocurrency community that more reputable and legitimate cryptocurrencies such as Zcash are being availed to miners. Currently, the two major cryptocurrencies which miners focus on is Bitcoin and Ethereum.Although Ethereum’s Ether is considered more as a crypto asset due to its characteristics and inflationary nature, its staggering $4.4 bln market cap appeals to a large section of the global mining community.However, as noted in a Cointelegraph exclusive interview with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, the Ethereum network is planning on switching to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol by this year or by early next year. He confirmed that the first phase of PoS development is nearly completed.Buterin told Cointelegraph:“I expect Proof of Stake to be finished in the next one or two years. We plan to do a transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake in several steps. The first step is close to being finished and is starting to be tested now. We’ve already done a lot of work in making sure the algorithms are correct and formally verified. We’re planning to start implementing the first stage very soon and, depending on how quickly that goes, then move on to Proof of Stake over time.”It helps that there are mining pools such as Slush Pool that are adding legitimate alternative cryptocurrencies such as Zcash which miners can rely on after major digital assets like Ethereum migrate to a PoS protocol or a proof of work (PoW) / PoS hybrid protocol."

A US federal judge ruled Friday that cryptocurrency is ...","Apr 1, 2017",A US federal judge ruled Friday that cryptocurrency is completely exempt from regulation due to a little-known law enacted over 40 years ago. ,"HB 1010, known as the Monopoly Act, exempts imitation money, such as novelty items or those used in board games, from falling under government jurisdiction for financial regulation. Under the new interpretation of the law, this has been expanded to include cryptocurrencies. The Monopoly Act was introduced with the intent of preventing the imitation money, used in board games such as Monopoly, from falling under government scrutiny. Parker Brothers, the company behind Monopoly, lobbied heavily for the law to pass, as imitation bills from collector's editions of the game began to draw high value on the market. After one collector was arrested for tax evasion after procuring employment in exchange for these collector's edition Monopoly notes, Parker Brothers feared their value would plummet, sinking sales. The Monopoly Act was passed and signed into law Aug. 5th of 1974, barely noticed during a time of political turmoil and a mere four days before Richard Nixon became the first American president to resign from office. The wording of the bill, however, provides an unintended loophole for cryptocurrency: ""No token, bill, virtual currency, or counterfeit money, whose purpose it is to parody legal tender or otherwise serve as a novelty, and where such can be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt, shall be subject to taxation, regulation, or licensing by any branch of government, but shall instead enjoy free and unrestricted exchange. (emphasis added)” On Friday, a federal judge ruled that cryptocurrencies are, by virtue of lack of a physical form and issuing bank, by definition virtual currency and as such current financial regulations do not apply. While the cryptocurrency field enjoys a period of unregulated economic activity in the United States, for now, those in certain third-world countries have not experienced similar good fortune. Both Zimbabwe and Venezuela have enacted regulations that would treat any token traded as a store of value or used for compensation for goods and services as money, regardless of the object itself. These laws were put in place in both countries following times of drastic hyperinflation when citizens resorted to trading fake currency and game tokens because they held value better than government-issued money. UPDATE: In response to this article, US president Donald Trump has denied the legality of unregulated cryptocurrency activity, criticizing Cointelegraph via Twitter:  "

For instance, if Alice plans to purchase $10,000 worth of Bitcoin from Huobi, Alice will first have to initiate a bank transfer from her bank to Huobi’s bank account. For the sake of this explanation, let’s assume Alice is transferring $10,000 from her Chinese bank account secured by HSBC. When the transfer is completed and Huobi receives the funds from HSBC to process the purchase, Alice will then be required by the exchange due to tightened KYC policies to explain how she obtained the $10,000, to begin with, how the transfer was made, how she intends to use Bitcoin and where her funds will be transferred to. CNLedger, a Bitcoin news agency in China, translated the requirement document received by Huobi users. With this step, we expect #bitcoin withdraws from major exchanges become available soon. With this step, we expect #bitcoin withdraws from major exchanges become available soon. According to the CNLedger team, users are formally required to submit these four documents in order to trade with any Bitcoin exchanges within the Chinese market. These requirements are in part of the PBoC’s new KYC and AML systems drafted for Bitcoin exchanges. The document reads: Your account info at Huobi Your login info Your account UID Explanations of the sources of your funds Bank transfer records to Huobi bank account Explanation of the sources of the funds you transferred Relevant proof that can back up point b. Provide sources of funds Historical bank transfer record details Text description of the fund source Screenshot or pictures of bank information Use of Bitcoin or litecoin particularly how the user intends to use the funds Governments of Japan and South Korea have both regulated their respective Bitcoin markets. In contrast to China, KYC and AML policies in Japan and South Korea require users to submit relevant information on the source of funds but prevent from demanding users extensive history of their bank transfers. The implementation of such irregular, inefficient and impractical KYC and AML policies explain the recent surge in the weekly volumes of LocalBitcoins and other over-the-counter (OTC) markets. Investors and traders are finding it difficult to trade on local trading platforms as a result of tightened KYC policies. CNLedger noted that only after these KYC and AML policies were added to Huobi and OKCoin were they able to operate again. Since the document has been sent out to their users, CNLedger states that Huobi and OKCoin will soon release user funds and allow users and traders to withdraw their funds again. On March 6, the Financial Times reported that China’s banking system overtook the Eurozone to become the world’s largest system by assets. It seems as if China will continue to regulate markets like the Bitcoin industry as its financial system grows larger in size and value. "

We consider the kiosk as a step forward to achieving this goal.CT: To what extent do regulatory shifts impact on ATM operations?MG: There is a direct impact. Establishing a clear regulatory regime should boost kiosk business. This sector is quite a developed one in Russia, and we recommend our partners to fulfill the existing requirements as if cryptocurrencies were regulated as an incumbent pay system.CT: Where are you currently planning to sell and provide services outside of Russia?MG: We are not oriented to Russia only, and already have some partners in the United States and Latin America. But Europe is going to be our priority and we accept orders for ATMs with a very competitive price of €1,200 per unit.CT: If so, are you looking for country representatives?MG: Yes, as our business model in the kiosk area relies on authorized partners, we can probably have a country representative responsible for business development in the concrete region. Anyone interested can apply for that through our website. We will check out all initiatives."

Jaxx is helping to advance the entire ecosystem by providing users with a simple way to control their digital assets,” Shrem said regarding the functionality of Jaxx.Jaxx has been steadily gaining support and interest from influential leaders such as Erik Voorhees and has integrated the ShapeShift exchange into the wallet, making it an easily accessible platform for digital currency holders dealing with multiple currencies while keeping their assets off an exchange and on their own software wallet as an added benefit.On Jaxx’s functionality, Shrem states:“I’m convinced this multi-platform multi-asset command center will do for Blockchain technology what the browser once did for the Internet.”With the exponential growth seen in altcoins over the past year, multi-functional wallets are clearly the way forward. Although similar options like Exodus exist, users might put their trust into a key figure such as Shrem.In April, Shrem appeared at BlockShow Europe, giving an exclusive for Cointelegraph, where he explained how the altcoin/Bitcoin pairs work:“People are going to Dash, Ether, Ripple, but you are not seeing money exit the crypto. If you are looking at the market capitalization of all crypto for the last five years, you’ll notice that it is constantly up. It is super positive, Bitcoin is a reserve currency, you don’t see much USD to Dash trading pair, you see Dash/BTC, you see Steem/BTC, Bitcoin is like the reserve currency of all of these altcoins.”"

The only problem is Coinmarketcap is not updating Electra's circulating supply. It is shown as 43 ECA, while in reality, it is 4 billion plus at the time of writing. The price meanwhile, which is determined fairly by Novaexchage traders, is fluctuating between $40-$140. Electra's total volume is also greater than the minimum $500 required to get ranked. The amount of circulating ECA is shown real-time in CryptoBE, which is a reliable block explorer, that also hosts Top 10 coin, Stratis.","This is the link where Electra's real-time circulating supply (the pre-mine is not included) can be checked which was also submitted to Coinmarketcap.If Coinmarketcap fixes this, Electra will go straight to number 1 at a market cap of around 160 billion dollars. Unfortunately, there may be special interests that are preventing this to happen as other cyrptocurrencies are also competing to surpass Bitcoin's market cap.Whatever aspect of Electra is checked, it can be seen that the valuation was reached legitimately. The pre-mine of Electra was never moved or spent and can also be viewed 24/7 in CryptoBE in the following address.Electra has a rightful claim as the first cryptocurrency to pass Bitcoin's market cap and has done this FAIRLY. The only reason Electra is not on top is because the Circulating supply on Coinmarketcap is stuck at 43 ECA when it should be, at the time of writing, 4 billion ECA.After sending this press release, Electra's datapoint for circulating supply was further relagated to a question mark although the value for total supply is now accurate. However, since market cap requires a value for circulating supply, Electra is no longer ranked although it still exists on Coinmarketcap.###Company name: ElectraCompany site: http://electraproject.weebly.com/Company contacts: Electra01 (Alias of Electra founder at the Bitcointalk forum)"

The trade offer, however, was made for “up to 130,000.”“This sounds like a great deal for both of us. I look forward to ironing out the exact details and terms.

","Meanwhile, the scaling debates have reached a turn for the ugly. Johns Hopkins University professor of cryptography Matthew Green remarked on the hostile tone taken in recent online debates: Why are the Bitcoin people so mean to each other. Lightning Network developer Joseph Poon, who came under fire for his involvement in the Extension Block scaling proposal, recently claimed that he learned about a secret channel in the Bitcoin Core Slack meant for organizing online PR strategies and trolling campaigns. According to Poon, this Slack channel, #dragonsden, was accidentally revealed on the screen during a presentation by Bram Cohen, containing several usernames which have been prominently featured in spirited online debates over Bitcoin’s scaling issue. Emin Gun Sirer, professor of computer science at Cornell University and co-director of the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Smart Contracts, tells Cointelegraph about the likeliness of existence of this “Bitcoin troll army”. Cointelegraph: What is the Dragon's Den? Emin Gün Sirer: The Dragon's Den is a chatroom, allegedly used to organize ""trolling"" and related activities that help advance Core's agenda. CT: Can you define ""Core""? Is it the entire Bitcoin Core development team? EGS: No, Bitcoin Core is a piece of software that constitutes the predominant Bitcoin client. It draws on a large base of contributors. The various Core contributors will repeatedly remind us that ""Bitcoin Core"" is not a singular entity -- as such, they will get upset at any effort to taint ""Bitcoin Core"" with Dragon's Den. However, these efforts are a way to shirk off responsibility, by trying to shape the discourse, by trying to make themselves unnameable. By ""Core"" here, as distinct from ""Bitcoin Core"", I am referring to those individuals who collectively launch campaigns to serve interests of a selected group of individuals whose economic interests coincide with those embodied in the ""Bitcoin Core"" software. These individuals may include contributors to Bitcoin Core, and they likely include people with zero contributions to Bitcoin Core. Being a Bitcoin Core does not automatically include one in this group. Social scientists are perfectly happy to use fuzzy definitions when identifying such tribal formations. What I call ""Core"" is this tribe. They have rituals they perform to achieve the outcomes they seek. The Dragon's Den is a channel where these tribe members gather and organize their efforts to manipulate social media. This includes brigading, reputational attacks, slander, libel, and the like. CT: What evidence have you seen as to the existence of this project? EGS: The Dragon's Den got exposed when Bram Cohen was giving a talk, and his slides got minimized, exposing a channel with 21 of these trolls in it. It was later confirmed with Joseph Poon, Lightning Inventor, exposed that the Dragon's Den was used by Core. I personally have been on the receiving end of such trolls, on and off, as the one thing that the trolls cannot stand is someone who counteracts their narrative. And counteracting unscientific, manipulative narratives is what I do. CT: What is the end goal of this group? EGS: To advance their general agenda. I am not privy to their internal goals, but from having observed the various sock puppets they use, the current agenda seems to be to hold back Bitcoin's scaling by opposing any and every straightforward move to increase Bitcoin's transaction rate and to instead push for a Bitcoin Core-authored solution that is complex, does not go far enough in increasing Bitcoin's capacity, and redirects transaction fees into the hands of a new class of financial players. CT: I've noticed you've publicly outed this initiative. How has the response been? EGS: As expected, I received a torrent of responses from members of the Dragons Den and their sock puppets. A few dozen sockpuppets outed themselves, with their vitriolic responses. The problem, of course, is that humans are incredibly social animals. We have reptilian circuitry in our brains that are carefully attuned to social acceptance. Online, we look for measures of social emphasis, in the form of upvotes or re-tweets. The trolls exist to subvert this circuitry. And they manage to enroll naive people into their cause. The weaker individuals, especially those people at the periphery, vying to get in, tend to get dragged into the troll brigades. I am happy to report that there wasn't that much of the latter, but that is the intended effect of a brigade. There was also talk about calling my employer, and the like, but I have tenure, precisely for this reason. CT: Now, time to play devil's advocate: ""All this is purely coincidental and conspiratorial, there is no vast trolling project, and if there were, it's in no way affiliated with anyone on Bitcoin Core's team."" How would you respond? EGS: My response to that statement is simple: it's an established fact that there is indeed a trolling project. It's not vast. It's just 21 trolls, most of whom are likely unemployed and unemployable dwellers. It's also an established fact that this ""Core"" group is loosely affiliated with some of the contributors to ""Bitcoin Core."" Finally, it's a fact that they do the dirty work of pushing the Core agenda and the contributors of Bitcoin Core tacitly reward these trolls, at least by providing them with attention and legitimacy, if not in other ways. CT: Have your findings at all changed your opinion on the scaling debate? Have they changed those of anyone else to your knowledge? Should they? EGS: Yes, this has changed my opinion on the scaling debate. A strong technology, the technology with the better science behind it, does not need social manipulation techniques. And that should change opinions. "

We do not care what you want or think, just obey us, or you are free to go anywhere' you would say that that is ""Anti-human"" wouldn't you?""However, Fernandez is quite sure the plans of those who are behind Bitcoin Unlimited will not succeed. ""If Bitcoin forks, it will be unfortunate but Core supporters will win,"" he asserted. ""Core has world-class developers in a team that is unique. It is not possible to replicate the Core team or their innovation.""Besides, he believes if Bitcoin splits, the altcoin ""Bitcoin Unlimited"" will have a different code base that cannot accept Core's new software and immediately they will start to diverge and fall behind in features and security.""The ill effects have already started with Bitcoin Unlimited, who have just closed their source and are releasing binary only versions,"" the Software Engineer added. He strongly believes BU is now not only hiding how their client works, as auditable source helps keep their users safe but they are in violation of the open source licenses of libraries used to build their altcoin client.Then again Fernandez thinks that not only is the altcoin Bitcoin Unlimited violating the software licenses they agreed to but they are violating the ""gentleman's agreement of Bitcoin,"" by launching an aggressive client onto the network in an attempt to hijack it.""He is also of the opinion that exchanges will not list BU as Bitcoin but businesses are signaling that they want nothing to do with this as he puts it, “destructive, selfish, suicidal anti-Bitcoin coup attempt” and their decision is being made easier by the bugs in BU.""""The BU dev team has taken on a very difficult task that only a handful of men on earth can handle properly and they have run into many quality control problems,” Fernandez say.According to him, observers have poured over the last published BU source code to identify problems and rumor has it that there are critical flaws that are deliberately baked into their implementation that will make Bitcoin Unlimited unstable, unpredictable and dangerous. The Bitcoin entrepreneur thinks BU is a disaster waiting to happen on every level.On the whole cul-de-sac, Fernandez's view is that it is wasteful, stressful and painful but they serve a useful purpose.He states:""Anti-Bitcoin saboteurs are exposed, liars are identified and the steady hands that give consistent good advice, rigorously tested software and solid stewardship are appreciated.""Subsequently, he praised Bitcoin Core and said without their exemplary work, Bitcoin would have been a disaster. He declares:""It's also clear that a great deal of patience and software innovation is going to be required in the coming years from the companies relied on the reference client and clients that imp lint e to protocol. There is a lot of very risky hard work to be done and shenanigans like Bitcoin Unlimited are unproductive."""

With this, US Congress has already made a move regarding the tax implications of these investments.""According to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the IRS did not have a strategy for properly dealing with digital currencies. According to the letter by the co-chairs of TIGTA on June 2, 2017, the IRS was urged to take into consideration the recommendations that TIGTA made for the IRS.""This isn’t the first time that the congressional group has reached out to the IRS in order to create a better system for tax regulations surrounding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In late 2016, the Treasury Inspector General criticized the IRS for not enacting regulations that would curb and prevent cases of tax evasion among Bitcoin investors.According to a report by Finance Magnates, the IRS decided to file a petition against the federal court wherein they can obtain the records of Coinbase customers. The IRS was criticized by the Treasury Department for not coming up with strategies on how to properly deal with discrepancy cases.With improper tax guidelines, investors are having a hard time avoiding trouble due to the uncertainty surrounding existing regulations.The biggest problem that regulators are facing would be the amounts to be taxed. Tax regulators are having trouble determining the amounts to tax as not all investors recognize gains.Another follow up problem would be to determine how much of the gains are taxable.With the growing number of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investors, the IRS will have to put in more effort into monitoring taxes as they concern gains.Possible solutions given, according to Perry Woodin, the CEO of Blockchain development company Node40, is to first update the tax guidelines to specify cryptocurrencies and digital tokens in its rules and then use a special software that is able to track amounts and corresponding investors."

Bitcoin Miners?",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitmain-claims-antbleed-had-no-malicious-intent-does-it-really-matter-for-bitcoin-miners,"The Bitcoin community harshly criticized Bitmain for developing malware 
which has the potential to shut down 70 percent of Bitcoin miners.","Apr 30, 2017",Bitmain was caught up in a controversy surrounding its recent patch on its open source codebase. The Bitcoin community harshly criticized Bitmain for developing malware which has the potential to shut down 70 percent of Bitcoin miners.,"The Antbleed backdoor is a type of firmware that enables Bitmain to surveil on the customer sales and delivery records of Antminer users. According to Antbleed.com, the remote service of the firmware can return “false,” which ultimately can stop its miners from mining.Approximately 70 percent of the world’s mining community rely on Bitmain’s Antminer to confirm Bitcoin transactions. Hence, Bitmain has the power and capacity to shut down 70 percent of Bitcoin miners in an instant.As the community outraged over the discovery of the Antbleed malware, Bitmain released its official statement on April 27. A section of the statement read:“This feature was designed and coded by the same team that is responsible for the firmware of Antminers. As the firmware has always been open-source, the feature was never intended to be malicious.”The intent of the Bitmain development team is of less importance. Frankly, it does not matter if the Bitmain development team introduced the Antbleed firmware update with good intentions because it creates the possibility of the majority of the Bitcoin mining community, which serves an important role in maintaining Bitcoin security, of shutting down in an instant.However, it is unclear whether Bitmain can justify the intent of the activation of Antbleed on any ground or basis if it was designed specifically to surveil on its customers. Simply put, Bitmain developed a specific type of firmware to control its miners and customers, with the intent of centralizing the industry. Thus, to explain that the initial intent of the Bitmain team was to bring positive impact to Bitcoin is quite illogical and irrational.Andreas Antonopoulos, security and Bitcoin expert, explained:“I honestly doubt Antbleed was in any way malicious. It shows the intention to centrally control customers, is reckless and poorly implemented.”Antonopoulos further noted that the decision of Bitmain to implement firmware designed to centralize its customers and the mining industry was reckless and incompetent. He said, “reckless implementation combined with the intent to centrally control customers is a very dangerous thing in a decentralized system.”More experts including Slush, the lead architect of hardware wallet Trezor and CEO of Satoshi Labs, the parent company of Trezor, stated that Antbleed is dangerous, regardless of the intent of the Bitmain development team.“ASICBoost and Antbleed are real and create a threat to Bitcoin. I'm not sure if they're just incompetent or malicious but they're dangerous,” said Slush.More importantly, to Bitmain’s official response to the allegations, wherein the company claimed to have never completed the Antbleed feature, Slush explained that the feature is in fact very complete."

The rising number of complaints risks tarnishing the industry that is still growing at a fast pace.On Tuesday, CySEC Chairman Demetra Kalogerou lined up the executives of the island’s Forex firms for an abrupt closed doors meeting. Sources presented at the meeting told Finance Feeds that the change is coming to the industry in what may be a make or break phase.The retail forex trading industry grew rapidly lately, surviving some scandals. Some firms have already paid heavy fines, already to the tune of over three million euros on the island alone.As early as 2014, the Central Bank of Cyprus issued a warning on the risks associated with virtual currencies when certain companies have introduced the dollar/Bitcoin pair.It still holds a neutral stance, while suggesting traders or holders of virtual currencies take steps to protect themselves as they are yet to be regulated. It is uncertain how the latest development will influence companies offering dollar/Bitcoin pairs.New regulations aimed at protecting clients might affect the cryptocurrency trading options.Calling out the boiler room tactics used via call centers, Kalogerou looks to ban them entirely. Sales staff will be required to change from cold callers into CySEC licensed and examined professionals starting this year. A warning was raised against reports of giving clients financial advice and offices will have to be set up in countries where a substantial number of clients reside to better represent them.Affiliate marketing has yet to be called out for a strict ban or not, while Ms. Kalogerou sternly raised concerns as to how to monitor marketers on how and what they advertise to potential clients.“We do not like introducing brokers at all, we do not like affiliates,” said Kalogerou on the topic of affiliates.Leverage limits will now be set to a maximum of 1:50 until clients request and show an aptitude for more. Currently, leverage as high as 1:500 is available to retail clients. The commission already requested a 1:50 cap in November 2016, calling anything above that “excessive leverage.”With European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and Markets in Financial Directive II (MiFID II) legislation set forth by the EU, the market it set to get its act together. Furthermore, CySEC has made it clear that the corporate tax efficient environment of Cyprus will not play host to those who cannot or will not comply."

These will track current miner fee rates, offering customers a suitable fee at the time of the withdrawal request along with more closely matching Kraken’s own costs.Reactions were predictably dry, with users suggesting trading and withdrawing other coins with lower fees, including Ethereum (ETH) and even Dogecoin, the latter attracting fees of around one cent.Yesterday, Blockstream’s Adam Back suggested Bitcoin users would ultimately accept paying up to $100 per transaction."

But today we will travel through some fictional stories that mention Bitcoin or make allusions to it in their universes. Сryptocurrencies are growing in popularity nowadays, so not so many authors have devoted their work to this topic.","But if you’d search for some fiction about crypto yourself, you would likely come across these three standout books.Described by some as “profound and prophetic,” Cryptonomicon is a thrilling novel which takes place in two eras, going back and forth between them - WWII and the World Wide Web. This book offers some historical facts involving military episodes and drama mixed with the author’s thoughts about the future.The truly revolutionary influence of Bitcoin is shown in this novel. Neal Stephenson predicted the forthcoming cryptocurrencies in the beginning of ‘00s as “Cryptonomicon” was published on November 5, 2002.This book has it all: cracking the Enigma code, promoting the idea of creating a “data haven” - a spot in Southeast Asia where encrypted data would be kept and exchanged at ease. Satirical descriptions of the characters and bold humor have their own place in this twisted plot. However, some find this book difficult to read.A few years ago the author of “Cryptonomicon” got acquainted with famous Bitcoin startup investor Roger Ver. The meeting ended with Neal Stephenson getting his phone upgraded.I just helped Neal Stephenson, author of Cryptonomicon, setup his first Bitcoin wallet thanks to @blockchain pic.twitter.com/4vn9GcKQMLThe next book in our review is Down and out in the Magic Kingdom which was published almost a year later than “Cryptonomicon,” on December 5, 2003. It might be described as a mixture of Disney World and Haunted Mansion.The novel deals with a respect-based currency Whuffie, used in the post-shortfall economy. These digital coins resemble Bitcoin in a way. And surely, the more Whuffie people earn, the more they enjoy it.According to the book, even if a civilization has abundant resources, the Whuffie system has both pros and cons. The cons result in a number of undesirable effects for some characters - which likens it to some of the real economic systems.Also, in the story, everyone has mind chips which make it easier for machines to control humans’ consciousness. The machines are able to think for people and immediately tell them the social status of others. This system also keeps track of the way every person gained his or her Whuffie.Later, the author actually tweeted that “Whuffie would be a terrible currency.”Ten years after his debut novel, Cory Doctorow tweeted a picture of a Bitcoin ATM which prints paper versions of Bitcoins, similarly to how it was in his book.Bitcoin ATM pic.twitter.com/hBSnHCZgXqThe last book we are going to talk about is Future Imperfect. It’s a bit younger than the previous two as it was brought out on July 21, 2008. A number of possible future scenarios are fascinatingly described in it.The full name of the novel is “Future Imperfect: Technology and Freedom in an Uncertain World.” In this book, we can find descriptions and discussions on different technological revolutions that might happen in the near future. Achievements in virtual reality, encryption, biotechnology and nanotechnology might be helpful to create a better society. But who knows?“Ecash” which is present in the book, brings it closer to the topic of cryptocurrency. David D. Friedman also mentions ways of preserving privacy online and surviving in a quickly evolving society. Nearly a decade after, some technologies described by the author are starting to develop.The novel’s key topic is the vagueness and unpredictability of the future from an economist’s point of view. Technological progress might cause different changes in life like the reintroduction of slavery or, on the contrary, provide more freedom. All spheres of life from law to medicine will undergo thorough modifications.Have you read any of these books? Do you know any other fictional stories that involve cryptocurrency?

A point release is being prepared for this.”Historically meanwhile, the latest crash is the largest in BU’s history. March’s temporary breakdown saw node numbers halve from around 800 to 400, before recovering to pre-bug levels, subject to two more modest drops along the way.So far this time, a significant resurgence is yet to happen."

The need for more transparent markets is becoming evident.San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken and Delaware-based exchange Poloniex both experienced severe distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on May 7-8 that led to many leveraged positions being liquidated.A large Ethereum sell order was executed within minutes of a DDoS attack on Poloniex. That was a sell order of enough volume to push down the Ethereum price and therefore liquidate positions that had been placed on margin calls.During the attacks, both exchanges were not functioning properly and many users could not log on to manage their account and control their positions. The exchanges, in turn, may have to liquidate users’ positions based on the margin calls.Many users of the exchanges are under the impression that they are victims of market manipulation and possibly even insider trading. Berns Weiss LLP states that if the exchanges or individuals associated with the exchanges, such as employees, broke the law, the owners of accounts affected as a result of the violation could bring forward a lawsuit to recover lost capital.Jeffrey Berns, the managing partner of the firm, says:“The virtual currency/blockchain practice of Berns Weiss LLP has been contacted by various people inquiring about potential legal action against Poloniex and Kraken with regard to the recent sell off at those exchanges in conjunction with DDoS attacks.”Kraken and Poloniex account holders who have been affected or have information regarding the case were asked to contact the firm at info@law111.com.Berns Weiss is one of the firms that actively engages in Blockchain-related cases and research.Apart from the exchange-related case, they have published insight calling on the US government to avoid falling behind even further in regards to Blockchain innovation and has urged lawmakers to increase venture capital focus on Blockchain technology."

such as in the case of Bitcoin, are “uncensorable,” a notion that he ...","Apr 18, 2017","One major characteristic of cryptocurrencies that have endeared the technology towards users is the ability to perform anonymous transactions. This ability to perform transactions in an obscure, unclear or unintelligible manner is known as obfuscation.","Confidentiality of information and security of transactions are some of the benefits of introducing such anonymity within the distributed ledger technology environment.Technically, most platforms involve systems and methods that facilitate computations that are publically defined while assuring the confidentiality of the input data provided, the generated output data or both using homomorphic encryption on the contents of the secure distributed transaction ledger.Jeremy Epstein, CEO of Never Stop Marketing, says:“Anonymity is indeed an important feature for many in the crypto world. People in this industry are acutely aware of the benefits and downsides of technology, so they have a deep appreciation of how nearly every activity leaves a “digital fingerprint’ of where you have been.”To the layman, the simple explanation could be as implemented by blockchain.info in its system of constantly changing addresses for a given wallet. This method discourages the ability to trace payments made to a particular wallet.However, some other platforms like Private Instant Verified Transaction (PIVX) use the process referred to as mixing mechanism to achieve anonymity.Epstein notes how corporations have been identified to manipulate public opinion, making reference to a publication in the Wall Street Journal about the potentials of Facebook and Google in doing so. Pitching that against financial information, Epstein says that users of platforms without anonymity will be potentially susceptible to the control and manipulation of others.In the case of PIVX, its wallet coin mixing is based on CoinJoin. CoinJoin is a process which involves matching a dark wallet user with another dark wallet user who is making a payment at around the same time. The transactions are combined and encrypted so that it is very difficult to determine who paid who.PIVX’s implementation is done in a decentralized fashion facilitated by the network of masternodes. This provides an additional layer of privacy in transactions. While not perfectly anonymous, if a nefarious actor were to control 50 percent of the current masternodes they would have less than 0.5 percent chance of de-anonymizing an individual transaction that was mixed with eight rounds of obfuscation.Some examples cited by Epstein in the implementation of privacy and anonymity include OpenBazaar’s enablement of Tor support to increase the anonymity of transactions and also Zcash.Hrishikesh Huilgolkar, the Blockchain developer at Innominds, thinks that anonymity is very important in Blockchain transactions. Huilgolkar notes that it is considered that cryptocurrency transactions, such as in the case of Bitcoin, are “uncensorable,” a notion that he observes to be untrue.According to Huilgolkar, if miners decide not to include a transaction to or from a certain address, the transaction can be censored. However, he notes that if transactions are anonymous and miners are unable to determine the address of either of the parties, they cannot censor it.Huilgolkar explains: “It is important for users to maintain their privacy for other reasons. Every time a user makes a transaction with someone, they are giving their address, which can be used to find out the users crypto-net worth and the particular exchange the user uses, etc. This information can be used against the user for example in social engineering, hacking, blackmail, kidnapping or by law enforcement where cryptocurrencies are illegal, etc.”Huilgolkar also explains that in the case of DApps, especially in situations where different enterprises are using private Blockchains, usually different companies employ a single DApp. Such companies may not like to expose their transactions and other actions taken on a DApp to their competitors.At the same time, trusted third parties such as regulators should be able to read their transactions if required. This makes privacy in the case of enterprises a tad bit more challenging. In certain DApps such as in betting and gambling, it is crucial to have private transactions for basic functionality.However, Huilgolkar identifies the downside of anonymity as it concerns illegal transactions. He notes that in such cases, it will be very difficult for law enforcement agencies to identify the culprits. He also notes that less transparency can affect the trust of users of the technology since they may not be able to see currency generation, inflation rate and other transactions on the Blockchain.Huilgolkar explains that this can be seen in the case of zk-SNARKs used in Zcash, where a trusted initial setup is required. If this is done improperly, an attacker can generate infinite currency without anyone knowing. Also in the case of Monero, the transactions are not completely private and data analytics can be used to analyze and link transactions with each other.Nwali Chibueze, the founder of Nigeria based Bitcoin exchange Sungrace Exchange, says that privacy and anonymity remain a fundamental right of every human being in any civilized society. According to Chibueze, most responsible governments insist that every one of their citizens is entitled to their privacy, including privacy of transactions. He also notes that privacy of transactions can be employed in the fight against social discrimination.Chibueze explains:“Privacy coins does not necessarily mean encouraging illegal transactions. There are situations where an individual may be suffering from a commonly discriminated ailment and wouldn’t want to purchase medication via traceable transaction systems. Under such a circumstance, anonymity and privacy of transaction should be encouraged as long as it does not involve the purchase of illegal substances.”While considering the dangers posed by anonymity as it pertains criminal activities, Epstein notes the existence of possible criminal application.However, he explains that such challenges must be overcome by the government, law enforcement and regulatory agencies.Epstein says:“Criminals will tend to use this innovation, but I don’t want us to “throw the baby out with the bathwater.” Law enforcement, regulatory agencies and governments are going to have to adapt to this new environment. It will be challenging. Still, the pros far outweigh the cons, in terms of things like individual freedoms, personal liberty and privacy. Plus, safety from manipulation and control by “big data” driven corporations.”"

Last week, the whole cryptocurrencies market was growing and BTC was no exception.Last support zone has shown themselves well.Therefore, you might want to follow the same strategy on the current market. If you are out of the market now or have already taken a profit and waiting for new entry points, take your time and wait for the formation of support zones. This works very well on the trend market.There is little sense to watch high time frames on the current situation – we might see just an incredible fly to the moon. To understand the situation, you need to look at the graphs a little closer. Let us consider a four hour time frame.Clear lines of support and resistance have not yet been formed because of unrestrained growth. However, I think it's worth paying attention to two zones that can potentially become support ones for a rollback.The price was delayed at $1,477. There is a high chance that the support zone will be there. If a rollback took place, and the bulls would begin to buy from this level, it is most likely this is the zone of support. You might want an order, with a short stop, and consider entering the trade.$1,327 is another level that can become a support zone. It's lower because after such an increase, a serious correction may happen.Despite the seeming simplicity, be careful. There are no clear signals. All support lines are potential. Wait for clear indicators, with retests, only in that case, your trades might be successful. Don’t forget to put your stop loss orders.The situation with ETH is slightly more interesting than with the BTC.Despite the same uptrend, we see that there are zones where the bears try to impose a fight.We see the support zone in the area of ​​$72.5. However, be careful - the growth is so large that the zone of support may easily be at $80.3.Potential zones that you might pay attention to are on the graph.How will the price change further? Will see. Where to buy / sell in order to have a mathematical advantage? Key/local zones.These are the main rules of technical analysis. Therefore, you might want to expect a correction, wait for retests, and consider buying at a good price.Since there are not clear situations everywhere, I would like to choose an asset where the occasion is more clear. This is ETC.On the good news, supported by the overall growth of the market, in addition, ETC has shown surprising results.The last few days the price is traded on the channel $6.3 to $7.3.I think it's worth paying attention to two entry points, and two developments of affairs that will suit us as traders.Many traders may object - how not to sell? It may be seen that the price is in the channel, and there was a pullback. The answer is to make deals only according to the trend. This will give you an additional benefit in order each of your trades to be the most profitable at a distance.News about Segregated Witness and main uptrend of the crypto market are pushing LTC up.The last resistance level was at about $16, left far behind. This level may not be actual in forthcoming weeks if there’s no bad news.At the moment, except local uptrend, it is hard to see the support and resistance levels. These levels are very important.Since there are no exact levels, we can highlight key zones, which have good chance to become the levels of support/resistance:We recommend paying attention for the news feed. It is game-changing. And don’t forget to look at the trade volumes, in some cases, it is very important."

Almost immediately after the pool’s signaling of SegWit, major Chinese mining pools were hacked and their hash power was allocated to F2Pool, making F2Pool the single largest mining pool in the world for a brief moment.","Someone hacked major mining operations and their stratum had been changed from antpool, viabtc, btctop to us. Our hashrate doubled instantlyA day after, F2Pool stopped signaling for SegWit on Bitcoin but continued its support for SegWit on Litecoin. This ambiguous approach to scaling confused the vast majority of the community in regard to the position of F2Pool on Bitcoin Core’s SegWit and Bitcoin Unlimited.F2Pool seems to be taking a cautious approach toward signaling SegWit. Based on the pool’s current behavior, it seems as if F2Pool wants to push SegWit activation on Litecoin first, evaluate and analyze its impact on the altcoin and then push for SegWit activation on Bitcoin network.Litecoin is the closest altcoin to Bitcoin, in terms of structure, philosophy and monetary policy. Therefore, as a replica of Bitcoin, various solutions such as SegWit can be tested on Litecoin before being moved to Bitcoin.In-depth testing of Bitcoin solutions on altcoins such as Litecoin will allow developers, businesses and miners to obtain a better understanding of the potential, limits and advantages of SegWit before activating it on Bitcoin.The community is confused about the stance of F2Pool on SegWit and Bitcoin Unlimited because of F2Pool owner Wang Chun’s statements revealed last week. On March 29, Cointelegraph reported Chun’s strong opposition to Bitcoin’s fork. He wrote: “Bitcoin can’t fork and won’t fork.”The majority of the community understood Chun’s statement as his rejection of Bitcoin Unlimited as a contentious hard fork. However, since SegWit is also a fork, the community began to question Chun’s intent behind his statement.As of now, it is quite evident that F2Pool will not support or signal SegWit before seeing the scaling solution activated and running on Litecoin.If SegWit successfully scales the Litecoin network by increasing its block size by around 2x, eliminates transaction malleability and opens the door for two-layer solutions like Lightning, F2Pool will likely signal SegWit for Bitcoin and push SegWit activation for Bitcoin scaling.According to Bitcoin Core developer Luke Jr., the Lightning network, an off-chain two-layer solution which can be introduced to both the Litecoin and Bitcoin networks as a result of SegWit activation, can reduce block size by up to 90 percent. Therefore, if Lightning is introduced and SegWit’s 2x capacity is implemented, users can expect an exponential increase in block size capacity upon the activation of SegWit.“Before we reach the point that 1MB is insufficient, we are likely to have the Lightning protocol working in production. This improves the efficiency of Blockchain usage by magnitudes, possibly reducing 1 MB block usage to ~10k,” said Luke Jr."

Though many investors have lost the opportunity to earn millions from Bitcoin, other opportunities are rising up in the cryptocurrency market. One of the most notable ones is Ethereum. ","The cryptocurrency community was left stunned by the recent meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin. Ethereum is now moving into the spotlight due to its sharp growth of 13,633 percent since 2015 - a record that not many financial mediums have seen in a long time. In fact, experts expect Ethereum price to go even higher than it currently is. With all the spotlight shifting focus, Ethereum has been constantly trying to improve their system to further cater to investors. The Ethereum platform aims for zero downtime and strong security. With the system features alone, Ethereum already holds the upper hand on Bitcoin. With its fast transaction rates, Ethereum has moved further ahead of Bitcoin. Aside from Ethereum, there are other cryptocurrencies that hold even bigger potential for earning, due to their lower price. While Bitcoin and Ethereum are continuously growing, they will eventually reach a point wherein investors won’t receive much profit anymore because they will have reached their peak value. However, the younger and newer cryptocurrencies are still at a low base, which means that they have the potential for future growth. The third highest in value after Bitcoin and Ethereum is Ripple, which has a price of $0.33 and is expected to grow. Ripple is predicted to have a one-year return of 5,478 percent, following the trend of other digital tokens. Following after is New Economic Movement (NEM), which is priced at $0.257 and expected to have a one-year return of 14,998 percent. Another digital token that is being targeted by investors is Bytecoin, which is currently priced at $0.00395 and expected to have a one-year return of 9,785 percent. All figures were taken from a report by CoinMarketCap. These are only a few of the smaller players that are making their way to the heights of Bitcoin. However, among all of the digital tokens that are found in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum is seen as the biggest winner after Bitcoin and seems to be making its way to all-time highs in 2017. "

From the most accurate prediction algorithms, a meta-model is ...","Apr 22, 2017",Money is a mystery.,"Some claim money is an invention by man. But has man really ever invented anything original, something that did not exist before in nature? Technology at its most fundamental level is an imitation of nature.The more we learn about nature, the more we are struck by the dazzling complexity hidden beneath the silhouette of the macrocosm. We look at a cell and we find a factory. We look at DNA and we find a database. We investigate the metabolism and we find an economy. We investigate the brain and we discover a computer.Like zooming into a fractal, every scientific discovery reveals another world that strangely mirrors our own. Money, as Dostoevsky famously said, is coined freedom. But money is also slavery.The future of humanity is inextricably linked to the future of money. To understand money we need to first understand biology.Let’s illustrate the nexus of monetary and biological realities by looking at Numer.ai, a hedge fund founded by mathematician Richard Craib that crowdsources machine learning algorithms for stock market prediction. Every week, Numer.ai releases an encrypted dataset that obscures the origin of the data but preserves the relevant structure.The data scientists participating in Numer.ai then enter into a tournament to find out whose algorithms will make the most accurate predictions extrapolated from the dataset. The programmers behind the victorious algorithms are rewarded with Bitcoin.From the most accurate prediction algorithms, a meta-model is constructed that is designed to cover the totality of the stock market. Selected algorithms will be deployed in those niches of the stock market where they have proven to be spot-on. Taken together, the meta-model amounts to a super-intelligence for anticipating stock market trends.Guess who has spawned the most successful algorithms. The Financial Times reports:""The current leader on Numerai’s tournament board is a user called “NCVSAI”, who works in genomics and biostatistics, according to Mr. Craib. He has earned $5,563 since starting to submit predictions earlier this year, but as the hedge fund grows Numerai intends to ramp up the rewards.""The winner is: Someone whose pattern recognition skills have been honed by doing computational biology! It seems those algorithms that were pioneered in modeling living systems are best suited for financial predictions. This, in turn, means that the financial system is itself alive.Recently, Numer.ai has issued a cryptocurrency of its own called Numeraire in order to fine-tune the competition-based crowdsourcing mechanism underlying their investment strategy into a more cooperative enterprise. The Numeraire, issued exclusively to those data scientists already registered with Numer.ai, will increase in value corresponding to the overall success of the hedge fund.By influencing the behavior of its holders, the Numeraire is intended to act as “programmable money.” Money, in this sense, has an innate potential to incentivize collectives of human beings. Conventional fiat currency has turned out to be terribly ill-suited as the underlying behavioral program for humanity.Digital cryptocurrency, paradoxically, is far more organic. Literally.While fiat has turned the economy into an undead debt zombie, cryptocurrency is here to resuscitate it. This life-giving property of cryptocurrency stems from its kinship with the energy currency of the biological cell – ATP.Inside bacteria and the cells of higher organisms, there is a relentless rush of activity and transformative processes. Despite, many of the biochemical details of how organisms produce and consume energy still being the subject of debate among scientists, major components of the cellular metabolism have been identified.Astonishingly, the frantic happenings inside a cell can be likened to the way an economy works – in more than just a figurative sense. Economists constantly argue about how certain economic phenomena and indicators may be interpreted and what may be done in order to induce a desirable macroeconomic development such as an increase in GDP or a higher employment rate.But few economists will argue that money – in its capacity as a universally accepted medium of exchange – is the attractor that holds everything together. In school, we learn that economy is about the allocation of scarce resources.Philosopher, economist and systems theorist Kenneth Boulding suggested another definition. For him, the economy is the study of exchange.Framed this way, the events inside a biological cell become the subject of economic analysis. Biochemical reactions become transactions and the metabolism becomes a transaction network. It has been  suggested that a transaction network has three main components: a currency, a settlement layer with a degree of finality and a ledger to record transfers of ownership. Let’s see whether we find these things in biological systems.ATP is the universal “energy currency” of the cell. Let’s have a look at how ATP is synthesized in a cell in a very simplified way. First, we take up nutrition that is made up of molecules that contain energy stored in their chemical bonds, e.g. carbohydrates or proteins. The food is digested and broken up into smaller parts via a very complex cascade of biochemical reactions.All of this occurs inside specialized compartments of our cells, the mitochondria. During this process, energy is released that is used to “coin” the cell’s energy currency, ATP molecules. The ingenious solution found by nature enables this currency to be used to pay for virtually every biochemical reaction, by catalyzing or speeding up the production of desired cellular parts, ranging from new DNA strands to structural proteins that provide the scaffolding for our cells. Like capital, ATP accumulates where it is needed.Without delving into the details of enzyme kinetics, it suffices for our purpose to assume that at the cellular level a settlement layer is provided in the form of specialized enzymes that are able to catalyze only one specific reaction.If you pay ATP to a given enzyme for building up a certain molecule, you have to pay another enzyme for degrading this molecule once you don’t need it anymore as well. Building an atomic submarine costs a lot of cash, but decommissioning it isn’t cheap either. In both cases, workers with specialized skills need to be paid or they go on strike.All of the cellular transactions paid for by gigantic amounts of ATP (between 50 – 75 kg per day, you roughly produce as much ATP as your own body weight) are recorded in the so-called epigenome.The epigenome is a vast decentralized network that consists of real-time gene regulatory and metabolic information. Ignoring the molecular details of this system, it is still safe to say that the epigenome can store orders of magnitude more information than your DNA.It tracks and keeps the balance of your ATP account so that you produce just the right amount and spend at just the right places to keep your system carrying on in everyday life. Of course, the balance of an Olympic athlete is different from that of an office worker. But, ideally, it keeps both of them able to carry out their job.So there you have it: Your body is a transaction network. Vice versa, the economy is alive. With the arrival of Bitcoin and Blockchain, we finally have a cure for the ailments of a techno-biological ecosystem chronically out of balance. As pointed out by Nick Ayton, the concept of debt is alien to cryptocurrency. Just like most ATP-catalyzed reactions, Bitcoin transactions are irreversible.Cryptocurrency, as programmable money, will bring about within society the same collaborative behavior already exhibited by the sub-units of a complex biological system.Within the fractal-like structure of our reality, fixing the economy goes hand in hand with deepening our understanding of what it means to be human. “Crypto” means hidden. In truth, it’s a revelation.Claudio Flores, M. Sc., and Danilo Flores are the founders of Kybernesia, a lab for thought experiments and biomimetics based in Hamburg, Germany. They adopt a non-reductionist approach towards technology and nature."

Another theory attributed it to DDoS attacks currently affecting Bitcoin exchanges.But towards the end of the week, a ray of hope appeared, with various digital currencies emerging from the ashes and appreciating in value. It was fantastic to observe the speedy recovery of these cryptocurrencies, with some making admirable gains while others are yet to recover from their losses.Early in the week, it was IOTA who caused an upset by invading the top 10 and taking over the sixth spot. The move ensured that Monero and Bytecoin parted ways with the elite top 10.It also resulted in BitShares and Stratis being pushed down the ladder. They now occupy the ninth and tenth positions respectively. It was a major shake up that indeed caused some mayhem.But the IOTA rampage capsized when the only exchange that has listed it so far endured a DDoS attack. This saw the newcomer being pushed to the eighth position.However, the most intriguing movement came with Litecoin. In fact, the SegWit pacesetter jumped three places to be the world's number four crypto on Saturday. In the process, it pushed aside IOTA, NEM and Ethereum Classic, when just last Wednesday it was ranked seventh.At the time writing on Sunday morning, LTC was being sold for $43.12 and its market cap has surpassed the $2 bln mark. In the past few weeks, the currency has gone through a metamorphosis.First, they successfully activated SegWit and statements from the team indicated that there has yet to be a blemish. Then, the Chinese government lifted its ban on the withdrawal of Litecoin and Satoshis at exchanges. Finally, the community became aware with bliss of Charlie Lee's resignation from Coinbase to concentrate fully on his brainchild."

After experiencing huge growth in May, traders thought that consolidation awaits BTC/USD. Potential support levels of $2,300, $2,500, $2,700 looked really good. However, there was no potential level of growth being shown, and the price moved to historic highs.Right now, we see the following picture:Currently, the price is in the zone of a potentially high support level. Buys from this level might be a good idea for intraday speculators. If the support level proves itself strong, it’s a signal for bulls. Therefore, trades with $2,800 goals will have a decent expectation value. Right now, a level retest is just underway.If the $2,600 level does not remain, then one should wait for the next price bounce and a shaping of new support zones.The main rule is to exclude short positions for BTC/USD. The pair is under serious pressure from the uptrend, so deals against the trend are a bad decision. One should also remember that volatility remains. Always wait for retests to have a more precise signal for position entry.The $200 resistance zone appeared to be great. We saw new highs and the ETH/USD pair has seen a decent decrease in volatility in recent days.Currently, there are three possible scenarios. In the order of probability:The most likely turn of events is the formation of new highs (reasons: global uptrend, news, which might change the picture).Also, mind that on the market with such a super growth there are no short positions. Look for entry points with longs and always use stops. And follow Ethereum news updates.LTC cheers up with stability. The support zone will be $23 and $36 - a good resistance zone but keep in mind possible huge volatility.Despite the decent width of the $23-$26 channel, it has very strong support and resistance zones.The price is trading in the middle of the channel, and there are now signals for deals. For position opening, one should wait for a price at either side of the channel.Currently, the most likely scenario are resistance zone tests.Hitting one of the zones is unlikely. For the price to leave the channel, strong fundamental news is required or a strong decrease of the whole Blockchain market.ETC/USD has not had strong movements since the beginning of the month. Right now, price trades in the $15.5-$18.7 range. Usually, such consolidation happens before fast growth.The resistance zone is around $17. So if this level gets hit and fixed, most probably we will see maximum tests for this pair. It can also be mentioned for ETC/USD that many fundamental factors drive the growth.Mind the following points:All these factors show that current consolidation can lead to strong growth. So watch the resistance zone, and chances are during these changes there might be very good opportunities for deals.Follow the news, ETC can bring many surprises."

In some places, it is due to local policies, in others - news buzz on exchange. Today expensive USDT has been added to the list. Right now one USDT (Tether) is worth $1.06, although it should have parity with the original dollar.","After such a fast growth it is expectable that traders will want to stay where they are, and the fastest way is USDT.When closing a deal don’t forget whether you trade pairs against USD or USDT.PS Right now it’s already $1.03 for one USDT.All ideas and levels considered below are made against original USD.Amid Consensus 2017 conference and the issues that were negotiated there, BTC has shown a super growth. On the daily chart, all global support levels have been left far behind. Right now BTC price is influenced largely by its fundamental component, this what makes traders and investors buy, therefore creating BTC rate growth.Fundamental facts that influence BTC growth, briefly.All these factors have been discussed on Consensus 2017.Technically, to see a support zone you should descend to 4h timeframe.It is not a very strong level, but right now this precise level has been imposed by sellers as a starting point for at least some struggle.Considering possible correction, the $2,300 zone if volumes are enough, will be a good level for buying.A slight correction is also likely after the end of Consensus 2017, the only place that looks good and where the price will head in such scenario is $2,300 price.On the current market news and fundamental changes play an important role, so do watch the news.ETH made its way this week from $90 to $193.Once again, both the fundamental strength of the project and the news have played their role. From important news - Samsung will join EEA (Enterprise Ethereum Alliance).But, compared to BTC, ETH has more vivid support zones.On such a market, selling is not the best idea but buys are worth considering. Therefore, waiting for a correction and more vivid signals is a good strategy for the next week.LTC has been rather still and that has led to the shaping of the $24 to $33 trade channel.Technically, we have the following picture:If the price bounces back, buys from the $24 level is a good idea.$33 resistance zone hitting is unlikely, so even a short from current levels with $24 goals looks good. However, it is not a recommended action, since there is an uptrend pressure.Hitting $33 and fixation above the level looks unlikely.Technically, LTC/USD is one of the best pairs for trading right now."

mining investment scams, scam wallet services and scam exchanges.","Mar 23, 2017","While the cryptocurrency market is maturing at an incredible speed, this creates opportunities for people to be scammed. Yes, fraudsters have evolved amazingly in the techniques they are deploying to sneak into our pockets.","Sadly, cryptocurrencies fall into that arsenal, which doesn’t help to build trust and facilitate its wider adoption.With endless amounts of Bitcoin services out there it is sometimes hard to tell what is legitimate and what is a scam. There are a few strategies utilized by scammers to gain access to your money.Researchers from Southern Methodist University have been working on the first academic paper monitoring Bitcoin scams. They classified four Bitcoin-related scams: high-yield investment programs, mining investment scams, scam wallet services and scam exchanges.Ofir Beigel, the owner of 99Bitcoins, explains:“The most popular Bitcoin scams out there today are coin multipliers (or doublers) and cloud mining sites. The coin multipliers claim they will double your Bitcoins within a month or make other sorts of ridiculous claims that promise an unrealistic return on investment. These sites are also known as HYIPs (High Yield Investment Programs) - that's just a pretty name for a scam.”As for the cloud mining sites claiming to use user’s funds to invest in mining machines, Ofir believes that, in a sense, 99.9 percent of them work in the same way as the coin doublers.“These sites just take people’s money and then use the money from the new users to pay out the old users,” he says. “Of course this is not a sustainable business model in the long run. In the end, the company just disappears one day with a lot of user funds. It's a classic Ponzi scheme, only now it can hide underneath the confusing and attractive front of Bitcoin.”Bitcoin wallets are increasingly used for stealing money. Scammers advertise their wallets as the safest and most secure way to transfer Bitcoin anonymously, operate them for weeks or months and then eventually hide behind some technical issues.Some scam techniques go much further - there are now Bitcoin scams that involve fake websites, which look exactly like trusted platforms, but mislead users into sending funds to their wallets.Other scams operate as apps and plugins. For instance, not that long ago, the Bitcoin community was warned against a fake LocalBitcoin app, and the Chrome add-on “BitcoinWisdom Ads Remover,” which was stealing Bitcoins by replacing QR codes in popular exchanges with fake ones.Recently, Cointelegraph turned a few heads surrounding BitMagnet and BitKingdom suggesting that these two might be scams. Reportedly, the latter has collected $392 mln worth of Bitcoin and stopped paying out.To shed a little light on the issue, we collaborated with Ofir Beigel from 99Bitcoins and ran an investigation.Please note that we, by no means, try to come to immediate conclusions but rather make an attempt to dive deeper into the issue and provide food for thought.Hopefully, next time you encounter a Bitcoin-related business of a similar kind, you will be able to analyze it and decide for yourself whether it is secure to get involved.99Bitcoins is a website and blog concerning Bitcoins. It aims to educate about cryptocurrency and close the gap between newbies to the industry and the technological aspects of how Bitcoin works through simple tutorials translated from technical to basic human language. It was named the “Blockchain Company of the Year 2016.”The platform has a variety of popular sections including Bitcoin Obituaries which documents every public obituary made about Bitcoin since its beginning. Bitcoin Whiteboard Tuesday provides a video series about basic Bitcoin concepts and the Bitcoin scam test, which we deployed for a little investigation.Ofir said to Cointelegraph:“The tool started out as a way to save myself time in answering my readers' emails. I've been getting so many emails asking me whether site ""x"" or ""y"" were a scam that eventually I decided to teach people how to fish instead of giving them a fish. Ever since this tool was created I replied with ""I actually don't know if this site is a scam or not, but feel free to use my Bitcoin scam test tool and find out for yourself.""The Bitcoin scam test is designed as a quiz consisting of 13 questions, some of them are supported by a variety of external tools (e.g. domain age checker, domain authority checker, etc.).Ofir is coming from an Internet marketing background so he knows how to check a site's online reputation. He is also well aware of the various marketing schemes such sites may employ in order to attract new users.He explains:“For example, these sites often use referral programs to get their customers to bring in more customers. So users who are only focused on making a quick buck start inviting other users without even questioning the company they are promoting. However, that's not to say that every site that has a referral program is a scam, some of the more reputable Bitcoin companies around today have referral programs (e.g. TREZOR, Coinbase, Ledger and more).”BitMagnet.biz Limited is a cryptocurrency investment company registered in the UK. The platform invests money in BTC mining and offers three different investment plans promising 3.60 percent, 4.08 percent and 4.56 percent daily returns.Sounds good, yet questionable. Especially considering their claim of having over 269,000 accounts. Domain age checker shows that the platform has been online since January 2017.So young, yet they have such an enormous amount of users. I guess they have real wizards in their marketing department. Alexa Traffic ranks BitMagnet 30,807 on the global scale with approximately 1.01 daily pageviews per visitor.BitKingdom is a platform for distributing help between community members aimed at fighting poverty. It works similarly to other wealth distribution platforms but (tadam!) integrates Bitcoin.We actually wrote quite recently that the notorious MMM has backed their system with Bitcoin-inspired cryptocurrency. The platform is one year and seven months old, and Alexa gives the website a global rank of 116,640 with 4.20 daily pageviews per visitor.The Page Authority tool lists links pointing to the website. Interestingly, some of them are coming from the media sources discussing Ponzi schemes.But let’s forget about numbers, ranks and metrics for a second. The jungle telegraph is normally what comes to the rescue!Don’t be lazy and take your time to check reviews on Google, Bitcointalk and Reddit before engaging in various kinds of investment plans, even if they promise a fortune.It seems that this is actually nothing new under the sun - known scam techniques are now wrapped in a cryptocurrency package. The prevalence of fraud in the cryptocurrency community is remarkably high.Just look at the percentage of the currency’s monetary base being stolen or lost, the percentage of Bitcoin transactions related to fraudulent activities or the volume of turmoil these schemes create.Bitcoin expert Andreas Antonopoulos once noted that: “humans have used physical security controls for thousands of years. By comparison, our experience with digital security is less than 50 years old.”It is true that we still lack the technical ability to keep our digital funds safe, entrusting our holdings to third parties for safekeeping.The concept of decentralization runs the show in the cryptocurrency community. However, when it comes to ensuring cleanliness and honesty in the space, the idea of establishing a central entity or a standard might not sound like a bad one.After all, without established best practices, industry regulation, licensing or an effective reputation system, we are on our own trying to identify whether that one particular custodian service is trustworthy.Ofir comments:“Personally, I don't think there needs to be a standard - rules will never block people from scamming other people (especially with a semi-anonymous decentralized currency). I do think however that as Bitcoin evolves into a more mainstream technology more people will understand the risks in it and know how to avoid getting scammed.”Ofir recalls the case of the Nigerian price when the Internet was first introduced to the public.He concludes:“This is a phase of Bitcoin evolution we're going through and the only way to change it, in the long run, is by educating people as much as we can about Bitcoin - its advantages and more importantly its risks.”"

With a 24.2 percent 24-hour increase, it surpassed Ethereum to become the world’s second largest cryptocurrency. However, investors are concerned about Ripple’s mid-term price trajectory.","On May 8, Cointelegraph reported that Ripple overtook Ethereum after the formation of a Japanese bank consortium which further triggered the attention of institutional investors and casual traders in Japan. At the time, the Japan Bank Consortium stated:“In order to address these emerging needs, banks have come together to launch the Japan Bank Consortium for cross-border and domestic payments which enable a flexible and efficient payment system. It is the world’s first case to implement Ripple solution in a cloud environment.”Since then, Ripple has demonstrated a high level of volatility, mostly because its trading is concentrated in two major markets: Japan and South Korea. According to various Bitcoin and digital market data providers including CoinMarketCap, nearly 15 percent of Ripple’s daily trades are processed in South Korea and, along with Japan, it is processing the majority of orders.The main issue with Ripple’s recent price trend is its inorganic growth. Nearly overnight, Ripple price and market cap surged by around 34.4 percent and this time, unlike its price surge on May 8, the sudden increase in Ripple price is unjustified.It is abnormal for a Blockchain network and cryptocurrency with the size of Ripple to add $3 bln to its market cap without a specific cause.More importantly, as shown in the chart shared below, Ripple’s market cap has risen from around $200 mln to $11.4 bln in a two-month period. That is a 57x growth in a period of 60 days.Ripple nears $12 billion, overtakes Ethereum again to become 2nd largest cryptocurrency. Doesn't look organic at all though. #ripple #xrp pic.twitter.com/g6z7DOhDfVRecently Cointelegraph emphasized that the unexpected and overwhelming performance of Ripple can be attributed to the explosive growth of the Japanese altcoin industry.Last week, ORB Project Leader and IndieSquare Co-Founder Koji Higashi explained that the legalization of Bitcoin and the exponential growth of the cryptocurrency market led most institutional investors and casual traders in Japan to believe investing in other cryptocurrencies apart from Bitcoin was profitable and well-based.The problem with this trend, as Higashi noted in his analysis, is that the majority of traders are investing in altcoins like Ripple and NEM without having actual knowledge of their purpose, origin and technical specifications.Higashi said:“Another thing to note about this new trend is that the general lack of understanding or appreciation of the technology by many of new users. This is no surprise and all of us have been there at one point but the new wave of Japanese investors seem to be exhibiting a whole new level of incomprehension and misguided decision making in my opinion. Many of them don’t bother researching what those coins do nor what they are useful for but rather follow whatever they hear in exchanges’ chatrooms.”The big question for investors is, is Ripple’s price trend and growth sustainable in the mid-term and can Ripple maintain this growth rate in the long run."

BTC price has plummeted from $2,700 to $1,700 in just one day.Currently, we see a market restoration and trading at around $2,200.Huge and fast growth is impossible without any correction since many market players prefer to fix their incomes.Also due to the correction, a strong global support zone has become visible.BTC/USD is showing really good levels.Only a single idea for now, buys around $1,800 to $1,900, with $2,300 goals.Despite obvious signals, it is not recommended to short, since it is trading against the trend.ETH has faced correction with the whole market. However, Ethereum has not only recovered its positions, but also showed a significant growth and secured itself behind a strong resistance zone of $200.The $200 resistance zone is now a support zone. Retests of this level have already taken place and it has shown itself strong.Ideas are the following:Considering the trend, the most likely turn of events is new highs.One should also not forget about the fundamental news. If you trade this pair, it may be useful to follow Vitalik Buterin’s Twitter, his announcements can strongly influence the market. It is especially crucial in the current situation when Ethereum reaches new highs every day.Out of obvious risks, only infrastructure ones can be singled out:Gas price is essential right now.

But on the four-hour chart, we can spectate the shaping of key points.Currently, we can outline the following probable strong support zones:If we outline support zones, right now it is $1,800 high.

This fact also plays into buyer’s hands.Ripple has shown significant growth over the last week.General uptrend pressure along with other factors made the coin to $0.25 trading.The chart shows volatility over the last couple of days.To outline key levels we should descend into a smaller timeframe.On a four hour timeframe, we can see a more precise local uptrend.A 30 percent volatility is okay for Ripple recently.Even the four-hour chart makes it hard to outline key levels.And even if we try to do it, they will not be relevant due to volatility.One should expect the shaping of a Ripple channel in the nearest future. This coin has proved stable throughout its history. Therefore, a 10 percent channel formation seems a likely turn of events.If you are interested in this asset, watch for volumes around potential levels and, of course, the news.Apart from general crypto economy growth, LTC has also been influenced by SegWit.SegWit’s idea has been welcomed warmly within the community.Apart from the uptrend, strong levels are invisible on the daily chart.So, right to the four-hour chart.

It is worth mentioning, however, that it is an unlikely turn of events. A new $38 test is most probable.In general, SegWit news has worked itself out pretty much.

It is suggested that the increased popularity of Bitcoin and other altcoins such as Ripple, Ethereum and Litecoin may have stirred up some genuine curiosity in the faculties of newbies and other hopefuls around the crypto ecosystem. It is this growing curiosity that is milked by con artists who take advantage of the ignorance of their victims.","When it comes to disruptive technology, knowledge isn’t just power, knowledge is everything.The right knowledge about any given innovation will always offer genuine and sustainable benefits. On the contrary, a distorted idea of any given technology will not only be misleading, but it remains a metaphorical time bomb that will eventually explode when the time comes.""In as much as Blockchain and the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) offers a huge platform for various kinds of innovations and investments, the promise of unrealistic returns on investment is a common characteristic that cuts across almost all cryptocurrency scams.""Hiding behind the veil of crypto related activities, a lot of Ponzi schemes have succeeded in enticing many unsuspecting participants.One common characteristic of these setups is their ambiguous way of explaining their processes. They always flinch when confronted with direct questions and the quest for appropriate details of their investment schemes.The basic life-cycle of every pyramid scheme is dependent on its ability to keep recruiting new members.In other words, pyramid schemes can be regarded as Ponzis, where the investments of new recruits are used to pay existing participants.Therefore, as soon as the rate of recruitment falls below a certain level, the system becomes unsustainable and a lot of people will end up losing their investment.Bob Wood, CEO at Nexxus Partners, tells Cointelegraph that cryptocurrency scams abound from the perfect storm of a major disruptive technology and the uninformed public. Wood explains how the average non-technical person can identify these scams early on. Look at:Who are the people behind the cryptocurrency? Are they trustworthy and competent? Are their names and resumes published for the public to review? Do they have a Google trail of promoting other scams? Do they have an experienced technology team behind the cryptocurrency? These are some of the questions that should be clarified by an investor towards any given prospective venture.For entities that are out to promote a given cryptocurrency, questions should be asked about how they are creating value with their cryptocurrency? Are they providing retail products or services as a value to the marketplace to generate a profit? Why would anyone buy and use their cryptocurrency? What user benefit will be derived, outside of speculative trading?Every investor should be wary of claims of receiving an unusually high and fast return on investment. Some scams claim 1-2 percent of daily earnings or 100 percent monthly earnings. Obviously, too-good-to-be-true, but it hypnotizes the greedy into irrational thinking. The reality is that all or most of the returns on investment are being paid from new investors money (i.e. Ponzi scheme), that always collapse eventually.Acclaimed methods for creating profits must be properly scrutinized. Profits from mining Bitcoins is a common claim that is fallacious due to the very competitive mining environment. Another claim is arbitrage, which is the ability to buy low on one public exchange and sell high on another. There is nowhere near the volume of opportunity to satisfy the promised profits. Finally, be wary of claims of widespread acceptance by merchants. When merchants accept a coin they typically have to sell the coin to pay their bills, which drops the coin price not increase it.Wood concludes by noting that the best way for people to protect themselves from cryptocurrency scams is to invest in education to become knowledgeable about the potential and virtues of cryptocurrency."

change the digital currency's Proof of Work consensus mechanism ...","Apr 26, 2017",The cryptocurrency world is maturing and the debate over the right long-term consensus protocol is intensifying. The outcome of this debate will shape the future of the entire ecosystem.,"The purpose of a consensus algorithm in a public Blockchain network is to make sure that the network’s participants agree on the current state of the Blockchain without the need to trust each other or to have a central authority.The use of Proof of Work mining was initially proposed to establish that a given block had required a certain amount of work to be mined. This allowed users to simply pick the longest valid chain with the highest amount of work as the correct chain.However, Proof of Work is extremely inefficient in terms of energy consumption. This makes it expensive and incentivizes miners to centralize the hashing power. So, instead of pushing us towards a truly distributed network, these concentrated mining farms have become de facto authorities.Another alternative was needed.A Proof of Stake algorithm has nothing to do with mining. Instead, it is about validating. The specific actor responsible for the next block in the chain is determined by the Proof of Stake algorithm. In order to avoid overly concentrating this power, the algorithm must have some kind of randomness. At the least, voting shares must be distributed properly to avoid morphing into a centralized system.In a Proof of Stake system, each validator must own some stake in the network. These stakes are bonded, which means that network participants deposit some money into the network using it as a collateral to vouch for a block.In a Proof of Work network, everyone accepts the chain as valid because a significant amount of effort has been employed. Meanwhile, in a Proof of Stake network participants trust the chain with the highest collateral.Within the cryptocurrency world Proof of Work remains the most widely adopted consensus algorithm. However, a few prominent projects including NXT, BitShares and Ethereum use or are migrating to Proof of Stake.Even within the Bitcoin community, some members are considering trying to change the digital currency’s Proof of Work consensus mechanism to address scaling issues and improve the network’s operation.But could there be a better alternative?One project that launches its ICO on May 1st uses a technical design that goes far beyond both Proof of Work and Proof of Stake. The project is called VIVA and it introduces the concept of Proof of Authority.VIVA introduces the concept of Proof of Authority as an algorithm which delivers instant transactions and seamless consensus over a truly distributed network.We recently asked William Banks, CTO at VIVA, to compare Proof of Authority with PoW and PoS models. “While Proof of Stake might have certain advantages, it is not a panacea. The problem is that there is no guarantee that the validator with the highest collateral deposited for a block is going to operate the network in its best interests.”“In fact,” he says, “Proof of Stake coins are plagued with issues because rational people tend to act in their own self-interest. PoS works only because the best interests of the largest stakeholders usually do align with those of the network. In the case of a disagreement, however, the largest stakeholder might assume the role of the supreme commander.”The distributed Proof of Stake algorithm was created to solve problems with the earlier Proof of Work algorithms. To make it work the decisions are weighted based on multiple factors.First and foremost, the size of the stake and the interests of a validator are taken into account. Secondly, it is important to check when their decision last became the primary decision agreed upon by the network’s participants. Finally, it needs to be considered whether the outcome of this decision met with approval by the majority of the network participants.Banks says:“The proposed algorithm, however, does not account for the long time player who has the final endgame in mind from the very beginning.”The Proof of Authority model suggested by VIVA disposes of certain egalitarian notions involved in weaker consensus models replacing them with cryptographic signature proofs and business contracts enforced and backed by the network.The authority in this algorithm is de juris mutual assent to a settlement between the various parties based on the pledge of one set of assets against a whole other set. Thus, if one party falls out of consensus, the other parties automatically assume the non-consenting party’s assets and liabilities so that end users remain unaffected. Banks goes on to explain:“Nothing is lost in this scenario and a worst case event results in bankruptcy of the one who issued the uncovered notes, rendering it feeble and powerless until debts are repaid and the party is brought back into consensus.”Each participant plays a distinct role and the network is able to respond to price changes by increasing or decreasing the energy in the system whether in a specific location or globally. Price and supply are used in the system just like the accelerator and brake pedals in a car.The VIVA team asserts that their Blockchain differs significantly from previous models.It is designed to be a multidimensional graph rather than linear like a traditional chain. Under this design, the VIVA network is said to be more akin to neural networks, with linked, weighted, interconnected data and an optimizing mechanism. This solves the NP hard “traveling salesman problem”, in order to reroute the network into multiple optimal configurations depending on the tasks required of it.By drawing from information in their Content Addressable Network (CAN), the VIVA ecosystem allows for a more robust and intelligent network. Rather than reinvent the wheel, the VIVA team took advantage of hundreds of millions of dollars in research and investment by starting off with a custom fork of the powerful Hyperledger Fabric, which is backed by the likes of IBM and Intel.VIVA has a three-tier cryptocurrency model consisting of VIVA Crowns, VIVA Coins and market-pegged instruments called vX which are tied to local fiat currencies for storing value like vUSD, vMXN or vEUR, etc. Within the system, VIVA Crowns are an indivisible digital asset secured by the best cryptography available. They grant the owner rights to access the network, operate a business referred to as a mint, and receive a Treasury Right (TR) every 90 days to mint a share of the total VIVA coins allotted within that quarter.Within the VIVA network, coins are not mined, they are minted. A mint here can be thought of as a hybrid between a master node and a mining pool, which is allowed to conduct any business activity except minting VIVA Coins to sell on the open market. VIVA Crown Holders who do not operate a mint can sell their quarterly Treasury Rights to other mints who need them to cover their operational expenses.The VIVA Network goes far beyond being just another cryptocurrency. From its inception, it relies on real world business applications to bring in energy into the system. For example, TradeQwik is the crypto/fiat exchange and the primary gateway in and out of the VIVAconomy. It is the first operating mint on the evolving VIVA Network and is currently available in beta.All transactions on TradeQwik are done using the network token VIVA Coin, with a few exchange pairs being offered for trading, including Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Steem, Dash, Golos, XAU/GBG, USD, and MXN.Another VIVA Business Application is Cashola, which is a peer-to-peer payment system which utilizes text messaging as a tool for making transactions. The solution will enable money transfer services to people around the world who may not have smartphones with a stable Internet connection but do have a cellular service. The VIVA team is planning to expand their money transfer licenses to further develop the service while also making it more simple and convenient for end users.VIVA has also developed MedicAxess, an application which hopes to become a game changer in the medical industry. The app will allow individuals to control all of their medical records rather than having them scattered between medical clinics, hospitals, labs and health care providers. Individuals will be empowered to control who has access to their records when they seek medical care. MedicAxess is a unique application in that medical services providers will be allowed to store medical records on the network securely and for free. They will only pay a small fee when they access records on behalf of a patient.Last, but not the least, VIVA introduces POETS (Proof of Educational Transcript System). In the near future, this application will connect educational institutions into a single network of credits earned by students. They will be able to choose courses and instructors from a pool of institutions, collecting the credits over a lifetime, and ‘cashing them in’ when they are degree-ready, and the issuing institution agrees. A lot has been said about life-learning, now there is an actual tool to ensure it, provided by VIVA.The VIVA team is building an entire ecosystem encouraging each and every member of the community to participate. On May 1, VIVA is launching their ICO, which is going to last until May 21. During the ICO, a total of 6500 VIVA Crowns will be available for sale. After the ICO only one Crown will be discovered per week with no more than 42,000 Crowns ever being issued.To learn more about the VIVA project, applications currently being developed and the upcoming ICO, please visit their website."

Governments all over the world have enshrined Bitcoin use in law as a legitimate payment method, and ASFI does produce evidence to support its pyramid scheme accusations.“...We are telling the Bolivian population not to be fooled, not to participate in these closed groups… which take advantage of people and deceive them in order to appropriate their money,” he continued on the subject of a cryptocurrency advocate scheme, members of which were arrested last week.Bolivia’s confusing incomprehension of cryptocurrency appears coupled with even more draconian measures than those witnessed in fellow South American economy Venezuela.The former had arrested members of a mining operation accused of siphoning off too much power from the creaking national grid, a move which had little effect on the explosion of Bitcoin trading seen on exchanges."

money with the hope of making unprecedented returns in the future.","May 12, 2017",The clampdown on OneCoin has intensified as Germany and Hungary initiate fresh moves to bring down the investment scheme that is widely believed to be fraudulent.,"Taking advantage of the early stages of development of digital currencies, OneCoin is widely believed to have built a very large community of followers by making bogus promises of return on investment.With its claims of becoming the next big thing on the Internet and becoming the biggest cryptocurrency, with specific reference to conquering Bitcoin, followers of OneCoin have invested huge sums of money with the hope of making unprecedented returns in the future.The propagators of OneCoin have been accused of violating several governmental investment and payment rules while running the scheme.Among several moves by different governments in protecting citizens against possible financial fraud by OneCoin includes recent reports in Germany where prosecutors from the State Criminal Police Office of North Rhine-Westphalia, as well as the city of Bielefeld, have opened new investigations against the company.In Hungary, the government has also initiated moves to tackle the alleged scam and protect its citizens from further victimization. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB), the country's central bank, announced that it is part of a wide-ranging task force aimed at cracking down on ""certain elements of the alleged pyramid scheme.""In an earlier publication on Cointelegraph, OneCoin was reported to have resolved to media intimidation as a fight-back mechanism. However, such move only seems to have had a counterproductive effect as more media personnel have teamed up to resist the attack and in the process improve on efforts of sensitizing the public and providing support to victims of the alleged scam.The Blockchain specialist, and major target of OneCoin’s intended legal intimidation, Bjorn Bjercke tells Cointelegraph that the tempo is high at the moment towards delivering the public from the claws of OneCoin.Bjercke says:“A lot is happening already, especially in Europe. There already is a victims support group on WhatsApp. After Ruja Ignatova walked off-stage without applaud in Macau, the OneCoin scene has really changed. And Pierre Arens, the new CEO trying to pass off a future Blockchain system as the existing has gotten many OneCoiners to wake up to the truth.”Bjercke tells Cointelegraph that his lawyer had earlier in the week responded to OneCoin’s lawyer, based on the initial letter threatening him to desist from activities against the scheme.However, another conspicuous development in the OneLife community according to Bjercke is the perceived disappearance of the CEO, Pablo Munoz. Munoz was conspicuously missing at the event in Macau where he was scheduled to speak. He has since edited his Linkedin profile, removing every tie to OneCoin/OneLife."

big players being in place. We are thinking to realize other miners ...","Apr 11, 2017","Ehsminer, a Paris-based company specializing in IT security and worldwide promotion and adoption of cryptocurrencies, is not new to the mining industry. Haikel Ben Hmida, the company CEO, has been into mining since 2011. After ordering Bitcoin miners from Butterfly Labs he decided to launch his own mining product. The choice fell on Litecoin since that area was still uncharted with no competitors present.","A company spokesperson told Cointelegraph:“Since the launch of Litecoin, mining is still profitable. It is Bitcoin mining which is considered difficult because of the mass of big players being in place. We are thinking to realize other miners specialized in X11 and even in private algorithms. We have gained experience during the last three years of experimentation. Bitcoin uses SHA256 as the only hashing function, and if it is broken, all the network will be compromised. X11 uses a sequence of eleven scientific hashing algorithms for the proof of work, if ten of them are broken, the whole network remains working. Bitcoin cannot monopolize the cryptocurrency space.”The company has grown and is now set to shake off Chinese manufacturers of mining equipment from the podium. It is already a great challenge to produce high-quality equipment and ensure profitability over a long period.Competition with China is quite fierce since everyone has to be aligned to market price and keep in parallel scalable and energy-friendly products. Besides, the memory cost and its power consumption is another pressing challenge for the industry.A Ehsminer spokesperson said:“Litecoin, Dashcoin, Zcash and others cryptocurrencies are ASIC-resistant. It means that there will be no significant speedup by implementing the algorithm in an ASIC, as compared to a CPU/GPU-based implementation. This is usually achieved by requiring a lot of memory, which when implementing this on an ASIC, translates to needing lots of physical area on the chip. Also, this means that the ASIC will be so expensive that mining cannot be profitable.”Ehsminer is taking the lead to resolve this problem by developing a low-cost, optimized and dedicated memory IP for the cryptocurrency industry. It has developed ACSMA, a Litecoin mining architecture, where every single asset is in continuous operation, and every step of the scrypt algorithm is mapped to an optimized unit.Looking at the architectural side of the multiple mining cores solutions, the Ehsminer team found that in all cores and at a particular time, only a small fraction of the electronics is used.Therefore, the company has come up with a new approach to connect unit cores and optimize the operation of transistors. According to the Ehsminer team:“The great barrier to carrying crypto algorithms to ASICS is memory and power consumption. For example, Zcash uses Equihash as a memory-oriented proof-of-work. This algorithm needs memory to function making the use of ASIC unprofitable given the cost of developing and producing the ASIC. Our approach is to develop our own memory dedicated to these algorithms which will enable us to produce ASICS at low cost. This IP memory is under development in collaboration with one of our partners.”ACSMA has been designed to increase the hash rate by using an architecture organization. A company spokesperson told Cointelegraph:“We believe that at this point in time, this memory, which is considered as the denser part of a Litecoin miner, will be optimized in ways never seen before. We hope this will be enough to catch up with the current offerings. In our view, a 2Gh miner with new components will be possible at prices equivalent to those of the current Chinese offerings.”Another product currently being developed and tested by Ehsminer is a more classical Litecoin architecture similar to those already present on the market. The company is planning to produce this solution in 14nm following the demand.For more information please visit www.ehsminer.com."

Bitcoin Pizza day, it is going to be hot at the top 10 altcoins. 55102 ...","May 22, 2017",,"Wonders shall never end in Cryptoland! On Sunday Cointelegraph predicted that it is going to be hot at the top 10 on CoinMarketCap this week. Truly less than 24 hours, on the early mornings on Monday, Ethereum Classic flew so much to make an upward adjustment of 31.46 percent.In the process, ETC knocked down Dash to take over as the sixth most valuable cryptocurrency in the world. Nothing surprises anyone anymore in this ecosystem when it comes to the growth of altcoin. Just when everyone thought the battle between Dash and Ethereum Classic is over and that Dash has conquered, the latter has called it a bluff.This brings ETC's market capitalization to almost $900 mln and a market price of $9.72. The gap between it and the pacesetter of decentralized community governance is over $170 mln and even two steps behind.A couple of weeks ago Cointelegraph spoke to Carlo Vicari of Ethereum Classic about its current impressive growth and he was really optimist of the future. He revealed how the Ethereum Classic community is bulging with newcomers.Looks like ETC is gunning for the top to get off his senior brother, Ethereum out of the way, even though it looks unfeasible at the interim. But then again, altcoin growth is like we are in wonderland.Moreso in a classic move Ethereum has regained the number two position from Ripple deepening the gap between them to more than $3 bln. It was with such great improvement of over 36 percentage point of growth. Its market price is now an admirable $174.81.As Cointelegraph predicted, the battle between the two is not yet over, and this was informed by how the two are all well-patronised utility. Whether Ripple can make another come back to the number two spot is just another interesting trend to be on the look out for in this space.Yet still, the most intriguing development is Bytecoin that was firmly rooted on the tenth rank rising all of a sudden to the seventh position overnight. It made a casualty of Dash and Stellar Lumens and is now behind Ethereum Classic.On Sunday Cointelegraph asked whether Bytecoin has come to the elite echelons to stay or just one of those flash in a pan you see with altcoin. It appears they are proving it is not a fluke at all. The adjustment is unbelievably impressive! A 61.76 percent gain to knock out two strong cryptos tells you they mean business.Anyway, it doesn't look well for Monero at this stage. It's now sitting at number 10 with Dogecoin barking to push it away. For a few months now Cointelegraph has been referring to it as ‘gradually declining' Monero."

the Bitcoin (and very soon, the Ethereum) Blockchain technology.","May 19, 2017",It's a rare time when we hear about a company doing a public offering of product and presenting itself as an entity without competitors. Monopolist? Liar? Not at all. Here we expose a story about probably the first ICO in the history of cryptocurrencies with no competitors. And it is – paradoxically – a state of the art digital wallet - Veritaseum.,"Veritaseum‘s main mission is popularization of the superior exchange and financial services they provide on the platform at zero cost for the ultimate customer. ICO tokens, Veritas, are available on sale until the 26th of May, so the statement is real.Imagine the world where everyone is honest and always does what they say. Imagine a business whose main purpose is to serve people and produce the best goods and services. Imagine the human mentality free from hunger for money... Slap! And now we are back to reality. What is real now is Veritaseum going ICO, and everyone has a chance to actually take part in recreating the world described all above. A product that serves people’s needs without making them penniless, is what offered at stake.The story of Veritaseum dates back to the year 2013 when the prototype of the value trading platform was created and tested as operational. By the end of the year, the platform was already working on Blockchain technology and implementing small contracts between users.Nowadays Veritaseum is a wallet interface facilitating smart contracts between users in a peer-to-peer manner. Whether you want to exchange currencies or make transactions, the process on Veritaseum is transparent and secured by the Bitcoin (and very soon, the Ethereum) Blockchain technology.There is no commercial agent in your way, no broker, no bank, which will ask for gatekeeper fees. The block goes directly from one individual to another, safe and sound, and let the customers enjoy the unburdened services.Two of the crucial advantages of Veritaseum – adapted Blockchain and close to zero margin – makes its product special and outstanding from what is offered right now on the market.From the first glance, the business model opted by Veritaseum differs from what we had before. While using Veritaseum wallet customers do not pay extremely high transaction commission, they would probably need to pay fees for a traditional exchange service. We are so used to paying a certain percent from the transaction sum, that it sounds unbelievable. However, it is true while using Veritaseum.Moreover, their customers are offered access to assets and value trading without counterparty risks, credit risks and balance sheet exposure. Veritaseum is the machine that works as an autonomous investment bank, free from human factor risks.Reggie Middleton, the Veritaseum CEO, says:“We are the closest thing to an entity that offers full-service investment bank offerings without being an investment bank. We do this by leveraging the power of the blockchain and smart contracts, along with a truly ‘start from scratch’ mentality when it comes to designing business models. Instead of trying to bring old school, extant business models into the Blockchain age, we create brand new business models designed specifically to leverage the abilities of the bleeding age tech. In doing so, we take industry verticals such as asset management, brokerage, merchant banking, etc. and create machines that replicate the services traditionally offered, with improvements in speed, transparency and safety… at zero practical margin.Yes, we give away the crown jewels for free, or close to free. We offer our competitor’s service way below their cost and charge for ancillary services that consumers need to use the free service.”The cost shifting business model they implement in Veritaseum leaves all competitors way behind and makes them withdraw. Having concentrated on best service provision and not profit, together with the ongoing ICO, Veritaseum is aiming to proselyte a great share of customers into fee-free and risk-free value exchange.The founders strongly believe Veritaseum’s P2P autonomous platform to be the defacto standard of global capital markets in twenty years. This doesn’t mean the extinction of intermediaries, but it does mean the great decrease if the intermediary doesn’t add value. The days of getting paid just for being in between two others are soon over. So let us start and enjoy the services of the future with Veritaseum.When the package is ready and wrapped up beautifully, nothing left but to put it on sale. Veritaseum has made a come a long way to facilitate the platform with additional financial research and advisory covering ICOs, tokens, companies and macro, delivered nearly weekly.At the moment the company has several global patents pending application in the field of peer-to-peer value exchange technology and value trading, so the process is ongoing.Veritaseum has a decent amount of sweet bonuses going into the ICO - several patents pending, an existing and functional codebase that ran and worked in the real world with real people, management with a track record of doing things and making things happen – everything to make the ICO promise and dream real.For many startups, an ICO is the way to collect funds to finalize the development of the product or service. In the case of Veritaseum, it is different. The main goal of ICO is to popularize the business model they adapted and get more recognition. It will help to lure more customers to employ the platform.Starting from April and until May 26th Veritaseum goes ICO by selling Veritas tokens. Veritas is, on the one hand, a token, which has a certain value. In Veritaseum they expect the value of Veritas to grow in time with more and more customers connected to the platform. From the other hand, it is the key to the financial research system and advisory services. Veritaseum has created and given the owners a way to enjoy the benefits of both revolutionary software and have a solid investment of a new kind.While the target market for Veritaseum is “everyone” using capital, the ICO audience is seen as those who share the philosophy of value-added products and services.Reggie Middleton explains:“Veritas is not an investment - at least in the financial sense, as in buying a security. Veritas are tokenized knowledge - our knowledge - that serves double time as the keys to unlock the future of finance… P2P capital markets. This can easily be seen as an investment in the future soon to come, but materially differs from an investment in a security, stock or bond.”Aimed for usual customers, Veritas are still not protected from speculation, especially in the long run perspective. It will continue to be a tradeable token. Nevertheless, buying Veritas tokens now during the ICO could be a great investment “in the future” while enjoying the services they provide. In any case, it is a win-win deal.Thinking ICO, many think the risk is involved. Investors first believed in the potential of a startup and then waited for the business to blossom. The big difference is when you purchase Veritas token, you become a user.“Veritaseum tokens have utility value, and they have that value right now! We want you to use our tokens because we feel they are valuable, and once that value is recognized by the greater population, that value (due to the network effect, supply and demand) will simply grow - at least if things go our way,” Reggie concludes.Veritas ICO Tokens are on sale until May 26th. There is still time to be a part of this. To learn more about Veritaseum ICO see the explanatory video or visit their blog."

that ...","May 18, 2017","""Internet Of Things is when your toaster mines Bitcoins to pay off its gambling debts to the fridge.”","When this was tweeted by Andrew Miller in 2015, it rapidly became the go-to meme for anyone slightly cynical about the genuine use cases for Blockchain within the Internet of Things.The idea of a self-actualized toaster with its own digital identity, probably provided by 21 Inc, became as much part of Blockchain popular culture as BitFury's Bitcoin-mining light bulb that never was or Slock.it's self-hiring bicycle.If we are most likely to understand the Internet of Things (IoT) by describing how it relates to objects we use every day, such as toaster or bicycles, we miss the big picture: a futuristic global network of connected devices, transforming industrial and business processes in a way that we cannot yet comprehend.The intersection between IoT and Blockchain is a fascinating area. Gartner has predicted there will be 20.4 bln connected devices by 2020 with smaller, more efficient sensors and microprocessors offering the potential for use cases of which we can barely dream today. Decentralized architectures mitigate against single points of failure while providing standard protocols for devices to discover each other and communicate.For example, imagine a smart device connected to an oil pipeline. With access to historical and current data, smart contracts could be executed which could adjust the flow of oil according to up-to-the-minute global demand or reroute the oil to areas where adverse weather may be about to stimulate a sudden spike in usage.In order to do this, the pipeline must be able to consume data from many different sources and to trust this data. Oil companies would rapidly go out of business if the supply was shut off at the wrong time, or diverted to areas of high demand. This interoperability and trust are key to many IoT interactions.Take, for example, traffic management systems of the future where autonomous vehicles manufactured by different automotive companies may need to share not only their position but also telemetric data such as energy efficiency or the number of passengers in the car with other vehicles or with third-party monitoring systems.Blockchain or in looser terms, distributed ledger tech has been touted as the solution to these challenges. It is important to make this distinction between true Blockchains and other types of public or private distributed ledgers, as apart from some services that are being developed using the Bitcoin, Ethereum or other public Blockchains. Many of these new industrial networks or supply-chain products use technologies whose architecture has only loose similarities with Blockchain as we know it.Four of the most interesting areas where Blockchain technology could be useful for the IoT’s are supply-chain management, devices selling capacity (or other services) to other devices, devices selling services to humans in the shared economy, and devices sharing data with each other or with third parties.Let's look at each in turn.When people talk or write about the IoT, we tend to talk about devices that are permanently connected. Yet the term IoT theoretically covers any product that can be assigned a digital identity and can be tracked and verified, which could be anything from a sneaker to a tuna (real-life proofs-of-concept by Chronicled and Provenance, respectively).While the contract that ensures the provenance of a product may be tamper-proof when written to the Blockchain, the same may not be entirely true of the mechanism that is used to link the contract to the real-world object. NFC or BLE chips can be destroyed or removed and there may need to be some kind of dependency on a centralized authority to verify authenticity at the point of origin thus removing some of the trust advantages of Blockchains.However interesting this data may be for consumers, it is when these supply chain solutions are scaled to industrial levels that they become truly interesting and time-saving.Filament is a startup working in this space and have been funded to the tune of $15 mln. Their approach to industrial networks leverages the power of the Bitcoin Blockchain without the costly overhead of registering every single machine-to-machine transaction.As CEO Allison Clift-Jennings:“Some call this an on-device, off-chain smart contract platform. I like that definition — though it’s important to clarify that these contracts do not run in a Blockchain — they merely verify inputs and outputs via a Blockchain.”It's not just startups who are innovating in this area.Dirk Slama, chief alliance officer at Bosch Software Innovations, said recently:“We are seeing tremendous potential for the application of Blockchain in industrial use cases. Being able to create a tamperproof history of how products are manufactured, moved and maintained in complex value networks with many stakeholders is a critical capability. This must be supported by a shared Blockchain infrastructure and an integrated Internet of Things protocol.”It's worth noting that Bosch presented, earlier this year, a Blockchain-verified solution for ensuring the distances recorded on vehicle odometers, to prevent insurance and vehicle fraud.Similarly, when shipping giant Maersk teamed up with IBM for their Cross-Border Supply Chain experiment, it was a statement of intent that even companies on this scale are prepared to innovate if it suits them.It has been estimated that a large ship of containers can generate as much as one kg of written paperwork which needs to be signed off manually – a tedious overhead that is ripe for automation.IBM have also been working with Finnish startup Kouvola Innovation in this area.Automated ships, their cargo passing seamlessly from country to country, untouched by human hands and recorded in cryptographically secured ledgers as their sensors announce their presence: few would bet against this as the model for global trade a decade from now.While toasters and fridges mining Bitcoin were never likely to be a productive use case, there are some far more interesting prospects for Blockchain-connected devices.Brooklyn's Transactive Grid project, powered by LO3 Energy and Siemens, distributes solar power between neighbors. It makes sense for houses with solar panels on the sunny side of the street to be able to sell their excess energy to their less sunny neighbors.With traditional energy networks and banking systems, the friction and sheer amount of work involved in these transactions mean that no one but the most committed would attempt such a redistribution. Standalone devices for measuring the output from each solar panel, combined with a separate invoicing system and the work required for neighbors to chase traditional bank-to-bank payments from each other would make such transactions prohibitively inefficient.Hence devolving this responsibility to smart contracts makes sense.Generally, there is a trade-off between the level of immutability (difficulty of tampering) and the speed of the network. The Tangle architecture proposed by IOTA is a blockless network that is nevertheless peer-to-peer but without the energy costs of a traditional Proof of Work model. The Tangle nodes validate other transactions in return for their own inclusion in the network but do not have to mine or otherwise earn rewards (all IOTA tokens are pre-mined).Carsten Stöcker, a senior manager at German energy giant Innogy SE and also an IOTA Foundation member, describes the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure thus: ""When a device makes a transaction and broadcasts the transaction to the network, by protocol or 'by default' it has to validate two previous transactions. So, it's a real peer-to-peer network by machines for machines.""Prediction: it is only a matter of time before we trust the smart devices in our households to run themselves, to find the best deals for us, and to interact with our neighbors' households to buy their surplus capacity and services.If the average car is used only three percent of the time, it's unsurprising that vehicle sharing has been at the forefront of the social change that has seen millennials deserting car ownership. But the trend that could change the face of our cities by turning unsightly car parks into green shared spaces has largely been spearheaded by centralized, private entities. Network effects and investment in infrastructure means that we are more likely to turn to Airbnb for space-sharing, or DriveNow for vehicle shares, than to other private individuals.This is where trust really comes into the equation, as the more valuable the asset, the more likely we are to want to derive some additional income from it, while the less likely we are to trust a stranger to take care of it and not to steal it.Despite the DAO debacle, slock.it have done some great work in this area, and their idea of smart locks, backed by smart contracts, are an easily understood way to communicate the benefits of Blockchains such as Ethereum to the general public. Their Share&Charge initiative, where individuals allow their car charging stations, backed by smart contracts, to be used by other individuals, takes the idea a step further.If a bicycle, a charging station, a garden shed or a lawnmower is able to take the initiative and hire itself out, maybe even paying for its own service and maintenance, we begin to view the idea of ownership in a different way. Possibly the company which makes the asset retains ownership, but humans are able to undertake some caretaker duty over the asset, earning themselves some percentage of the machine's income.It raises the tantalizing question of how the governments of the future will legislate and even tax these transactions. Will physical assets have their own tax accounts, separate and distinct from the humans who derive income from them? In other words, will they become DAOs in their own right? Or organize themselves into DAO collectives?As machine learning enables industrial robots, or autonomous cars, to adapt to their own surrounding and to transact with one another, will it free up humans to engage in more meaningful pursuits? Or make us collectively redundant?If the intersecting arcs of machine learning, IoT and Blockchain can produce futuristic scenarios like the ones I have described, then the intersection of IoT, Blockchain and machine learning has equivalent potential. Prediction markets like Augur or Gnosis become more accurate as they consume more data.If data is the oil of the future, then it should be able to be traded in a perfect marketplace, to the entities which bid highest for it. Expect the cities of the future to be crisscrossed with networks of sensors, collectively producing petabytes of data, which some other device, wherever it is in the world, will discover and consume.Want to equip your house or your car with sensors which monitor the weather, noise levels or pollution? Someone somewhere will want to buy that information. The use of smart contracts to enable markets – whether spread-betting companies or insurers – to purchase that information will be a growth area, as will decentralized oracle services.But what about data that could be sensitive – how fast you drive your car, or the results of your recent medical tests or health data? This is where the need for trust comes in, and where there may be a case for Blockchain in the strictest sense of the definition.For individuals who wish to monetize their own data or that of their connected devices, smart contracts are one way to define and limit the type of data that is disclosed to particular sources.Similarly, devices which consume this data need to have some assurance of its provenance.Take the example of the oil pipeline. Data is only as good as its source, and without some kind of third-party, trustless mechanism, it is worthless.So, who are the companies and what are the technologies that will power this brave new future?Whether the ultimate solution is something called a Blockchain, something more like a blockless distributed ledger such as IOTA's Tangle, or some other kind of peer-to-peer solution, the big question is whether these networks will be open and permissionless, or locked down by the existing corporate behemoths.Bosch, BNY Mellon, Cisco and various other household names have teamed up with both Chronicled and Filament to participate in what looks increasingly like an R3 for IoT.IBM has invested millions in Blockchain tech (particularly in integrations with its Watson IoT platform) and is battling it out with the likes of Microsoft to offer Blockchain as a service (BaaS) as the default for powering the industrial networks of the future. Microsoft offer Waves, Parity, Syscoin and Blockstack among the various Blockchain integrations on the Azure Marketplace. IBM, in particular, seems to be aiming a charm offensive at would-be Blockchain developers, making it easy to deploy projects using Hyperledger Fabric on BlueMix, with a free 30-day trial.So, what exactly will the networked, Blockchain-connected world of the future look like?A future where our inanimate devices assume a digital identity and earn money for us, allowing us to participate in in a caring, sharing society? Or a dystopian vision of networks controlled and connected by faceless corporations, sucking our data from us, sensing our presence, using our identity against us to deny us entry to particular areas, or to sell us things we don't need?Perhaps, according to William Gibson's theory of unevenly distributed futures, it is already here."

This shows that the demand for people who hold skills within cryptocurrency technology is increasing.As per the experts, the interest for Blockchain expertise is way off surpassing its supply which makes it one of the trendiest fields in technology recruitment. Many Blockchain-based startups are coming up with established companies in different sectors, from the financial sector to retail services, pushing to get hold of what this new system can offer.“Is there a talent bubble? Yes. We haven’t even seen it yet. There is an entirely new way for businesses to interact it is awesome and as this takes root it will be revolutionary,” says Jerry Cuomo, IBM’s vice-president for Blockchain technology.The finest Blockchain engineer can demand a salary as high as $250,000 or more, and Cuomo says:“It is on the high side of what a really talented consultant or software engineer can earn. Demand is exceeding supply, so we are seeing shortages. It is up there with the cloud and artificial intelligence as a really hot area.”There is a rising demand for Blockchain engineers which is a game changer for both the technology and finance industry.Known companies have begun establishing Blockchain-specific departments, which means that it is a rising field that people can explore and grow their expertise in.Blockchain is a decentralized settlement technology which means that the network is not controlled by one central authority. In the past year, it leveled up the issuance of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, which rose higher than $2,500 last week - almost five times more compared to the past year.There were more than 1,000 Blockchain-related job opportunities on their site last week, which is more than triple its level for the past year based on the LinkedIn data provided. Blockchain ads are expanding in numbers, which is more than 40 percent each quarter.Around 10,000 people on LinkedIn listed Blockchain as a skill. Fifty percent are from the technology industry and twenty-five percent are from the financial services sector. LinkedIn hasn’t included Blockchain on its official list of skills, however, a lot of people specify it as a custom skill and they are considering adding it to the skills that are formally tracked.Joshua Graff, the UK country manager at LinkedIn, said: “Professionals in related areas such as cryptography and machine learning may want to look at the roles available and the skills they need to develop, as there is certainly a growing demand within the technology, finance and insurance industries for Blockchain expertise.”The statement is an assurance that Blockchain is getting even bigger and it seems that it is the future of the virtual world.

is ...","Mar 22, 2017","Firstly, given that I’ve had little actual trading experience, I decided to test how the stop orders work. I have bought 1 Lisk (LSK) and set a sell stop order. If the price grows, the order will execute itself at the preset value; the same will happen, if the price drops instead. That is really convenient, as I won’t have to constantly monitor the market.","For my portfolio, I have chosen some of the most volatile coins, whose average daily trading volume exceeds 100 BTC. From those cryptocurrencies, I will pick a specific group of pairs with prices that have little correlation to each other. For example, if we take the price graphs of ETH/BTC and REP/BTC, we can see that their price trends tend to move in step; whereas DCR/BTC and GNT/BTC may move in the same or the opposite directions at the same time.I will buy at specific lines; I’ve got the idea from here. The goal is to find the peak of a rebound in case the trend keeps moving.Just to show you an example, I made a test order according to my system on GNT/BTC.First, I had to find a trend and trace a line along its rebounds. That line was going to be the level, the breakthrough. It would mean that there would a rebound of a larger scale than the ones that came before.I found a short-term upward trend on GNT/BTC from 0.00001752 and traced a line along the latest, largest rebound. At that moment, the price broke through the diagonal channel. From what I know at this point, the market had two options: to build an upward trend of a larger scale or form a downward reversal. I placed an order at 0.00002159, expecting growth towards 0.000024, and had limited potential losses, placing a sell stop order at 0.00002037, in case the upward scenario stops. So the loss-profit ratio was 1:2.The price went up, but I had closed my deal earlier, at 0.00002256. Couldn’t wait, could I? Nevertheless, the price practically reached the target.I have chosen the following cryptocurrencies for trading and have defined their medium-term levels with the method described above:I will mostly trend during daily hours so that the deals don’t stay up overnight. I will be buying one to three cryptocurrencies, whose trends do not correlate too much with each other. So the risk will constitute 0.5 percent to 1.5 percent of Bitcoin’s value and the profit targets will be twice as much. In other words, if a deal is unsuccessful, I will lose between 0.5 percent and 1.5 percent. But in case I make a right choice, the profit will be between one and three percent.So here I am, starting my cryptocurrency trading path. Hope, it’ll be a successful one. Can’t wait to share my first results. Don’t forget to leave your comments, I may consider them as my next move.Follow Cointelegraph for more articles from me."

Yet despite the major benefits of cost cutting, simplifying and securing, where is the widespread mainstream adoption in business?","With this in mind, CCgroup put it to those CEOs who have adopted technology: what are the major challenges to mainstream adoption of Blockchain technology?“Lack of trust and understanding the public has about a trustless systems (Blockchains). Putting trust into a system with no name or face for many people is ""unreal"", especially when they don't understand the technology. Also, the amount of bad press and attention Bitcoin gets will hinder and delay adoption.”- Paul Busch, Founder at Bitswift“Blockchain technology in its current form is very difficult to use. The user must know how public/private keys work, then go through dozens of steps to acquire and use Bitcoin.”- Shawn Wilkinson, Founder and CEO/CTO at Storj“There is still a lot of confusion about the nature of this technology, how Blockchains differ from traditional shared databases and how those differences inform the set of suitable use cases.”- Dr. Gideon Greenspan, CEO and Architect at MultiChain“Currently, only public chains guarantee the properties that make Blockchains different from standard databases. Namely immutability and resistance to collusion thanks to consensus at scale. Unfortunately, said public chains have severe drawbacks in terms of both privacy and scalability. Privacy drawbacks will not be resolved until Zero Knowledge Proofs / Homomorphic Encryption solutions are developed on top of Blockchains and scalability concerns won't be addressed until sharding is in place on top of at least one smart contract platform. We're at least three years away from both. Further to this, the tooling is very immature compared to what you'd find in say, the C++ or Java world. Don't expect fancy manuals and standardized courses: we're talking about a nascent technology here.”- Stephan Tual, Founder and CCO at Slock IT“The primary challenge has been to make it easy for developers to built on top of Blockchain technology. We need to give the tools for any developer to build better software with the help of a Blockchain. In our roadmap, we have identified the main bottlenecks hindering adoption to be scalability, price stability and privacy. Each Blockchain project aims to solve some problem, but the key is to make the Blockchains be able to integrate together so that at the end we manage to solve all the problems. The future is not a single Blockchain or a single solution, but many Blockchains and many solutions each addressing a particular issue.”- SuperNET Team“The primary challenge for the broadest adoption of Blockchain technology is regulation. The regulatory environment has not caught up to innovation and in many cases prevents or slows the adoption of many institutions deploy Blockchain technology in ways that utilize all of its benefits. As the regulatory framework becomes more established, more products and services that mainstream consumers use will utilize the technology, though in many cases consumers won't be aware of the change.”- Igor Telyatnikov‎, President & Chief Operating Officer at Alphapoint“Depends on what you're focused on or how you look at it but from our end and if you look at what the big players on the market like banks are saying the main one is regulatory compliance and related issues. Accenture even did a survey where that was the top reason. Crypto companies have a hard time dealing with it, financial institutions have a hard time dealing with it, and it’s a very costly and inefficient process overall.”- Grant Blaisdell, Co-founder at Coinfirm“I think that Blockchain technology has to prove its high reliability to gain acceptance from government and big financial players. In regards to small players, retail etc, they are still far away from understanding why they would use Blockchain and replace conventional tools for doing business. So Blockchain technology has to significantly increase its public awareness campaign.”- Livecoin team“Misunderstandings of the true technical abilities of Blockchain technology, coupled with the lack of general awareness about Blockchain technology, currently forms some of the most significant barriers to mainstream adoption. Many people still don't really understand what Blockchain is, or what it can do. Though they may have heard about Bitcoin, and even use it, they might not necessarily understand how it works, much less what else the technology is capable of doing. It’s not surprising though, as people use currencies regularly throughout their lives but are largely not exposed to backend systems, which Blockchain essentially is, though quite a revolutionary one.However, even if more people are aware of Blockchain and its capabilities, the resistance to changing existing systems due to the costs to utilize this new technology is another one of the significant barriers to mainstream adoption. It’s even harder for larger corporations which are less agile and thus have higher costs when making such changes. The benefits of adopting Blockchain technology will thus have to greatly outweigh the costs of this shift in order to justify going through such difficulties.”- Travin Keith, Blockchain Consultant at NXT Foundation“This depends on whether we are talking private/permissioned Blockchain technology or public Blockchain technology, like Bitcoin or Ethereum. I believe we are still trying to find a major use case for private Blockchains that offer major benefits over distributed databases. There are some instances where a read-only view might be useful for the public (e.g. public registries like land registrations) but major use cases are hard to come by. As for public Blockchain technology, I believe we are ramping up. Financial-based technologies like Bitcoin are starting to be used more and more already, and we are only still discovering the power of broader technologies like Ethereum.”- Marc Warne, Founder & CEO at Bittylicious“In a nutshell, the Blockchain industry suffers from a confusion of terminology and unrealistic expectations. We believe that some parties in the industry lack a profound understanding of the technology. This may very well be due to the fact that Blockchain technology itself came from the digital currency Bitcoin. While today, deciphering and demystifying the differences between the underlying technology (Blockchain) and the digital currency (Bitcoin) is becoming less of an issue for most, it is still a demonstrable riddle for those who are new to the technology. Additionally, there has been a lot of hype with regards to the utility that Blockchain can realistically provide in different industries and use cases. This is mostly due to the fact that Blockchain can mean different things to different people. For example, some refer to Blockchain as a storage methodology, while others view it as a platform. Collectively, these fundamental challenges give rise to unsubstantiated claims and hypes, which are damaging and ultimately lead to widely overblown and unrealistic expectations.”- Dr. Naveed Sherwani, President and CEO at Peernova“Majority of consumers in developed countries find it sufficient to use non-Blockchain technology for everyday lives. There is, therefore, no sense of urgency or need to adopt it. For major corporations, the cost of overhauling present day systems for Blockchain technology represents a monumental technological and logistical shift. It is no longer about software upgrades but overhauling an entire system from scratch.”- Kai Cheng Chng, CEO / Co-Founder at Digix“Perspective comes to mind when trying to determine what the major challenges to mainstream adoption of Blockchain technology are. Primary perspectives such as cultural norms, age demographics, general attitudes about money and how current monetary systems are perceived as a general store of value, as well as some technological hurdles exist. Certainly, legal considerations throughout the globe in all countries, as well as scalable solutions play a significant role when trying to determine the challenges that currently impede mainstream adoption.”- Fastcoin teamDisclaimer: This article was researched and compiled by CCgroup.

The cryptocurrency soared to the all time high market capitalisation of $444,000,000, before calming down to around $300,000,000 and establishing itself at the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization at the time of writing (according to CoinMarketCap). A symbolic turning point for one of the first untraceable cryptocurrencies launched in 2012.","The price hike happens upon the flourishing investor interest in cryptocurrency markets, and in particular upon the growing public appreciation of untraceable cryptocurrencies that contain privacy mechanisms (other examples are Monero, Dash and Zcash, which have also experienced an increase in value in the recent months). The Bytecoin surge may also be attributed to the announcement of the new features, which include allegedly never-before-implemented untraceable tokens - also known as “digital assets” or “colored coins”.Amid the Bytecoin price rise, a cryptocurrency Monero has released a statement disclosing a vulnerability in the CryptoNote protocol, that underlies both Monero and Bytecoin cryptocurrencies. As written in the statement, the bug “allows for the creation of an unlimited number of coins in a way that is undetectable to an observer unless they know about the fatal flaw and can search for it.” The statement does not list Bytecoin as one of the currencies that have updated the protocol following the detection of the bug.According to the official response from the Bytecoin, its development team has been aware of the vulnerability in April 2017, when during software testing it has discovered that several malicious transactions creating 504 million Bytecoins had appeared in the network - which accounts for 0.2% of the total 183 billion Bytecoin supply.The development team states that it patched the bug and worked with the mining services to update their software (that validates the transactions in the network), as soon as the bug was found. According to Minergate, the major Bytecoin mining pool, it was contacted by the Bytecoin team in the mid April and “the fix to the mining software has been implemented by adding more checks for the transactions consistency” shortly thereafter.The updated version prevented blocks with malicious transactions to be mined and thus no extra coins could be created. The questions still remain about the cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets, who are supposedly “safe to stick with the previous version of software”, according to the Bytecoin statement, but “encouraged to update the protocol”.In spite of this bug discovery and patching, the CryptoNote-based cryptocurrency markets, including Monero and Bytecoin, has been positive, keeping them among the top 10 by capitalisation. Whether it is because the coin holders are not well-informed of the protocol issues or they are confident of the development teams’ ability to manage these issues, the fact remains that Monero’s and Bytecoin’s capitalizations jointly amount to $750,000,000 at the time of writing, and as a result many early adopters have gone from rags to riches.With the ICO phenomenon coming into place this may not be all, as new cryptocurrency teams emerge stating their intention to adopt the privacy-preserving CryptoNote protocol.In fact, if the concept of untraceable tokens (untraceable digital assets) becomes a reality this year as promised in the Bytecoin roadmap, the major trends of the crypto world could in theory converge: the booming ICO phenomenon, the increasing capitalisation of tokens created on top of various blockchain platforms, and the growing market interest in untraceability and privacy. We are here to observe and see."

The removal of Dash consequently reduced the financial privacy of Jaxx users on iOS.Understanding the strict requirements and high standards of the Apple and iOS development teams, engineers of Jaxx and Zcash underwent a long development period to integrate Zcash into the Jaxx mobile application.Developers of both companies collaborated to ensure that Zcash is approved and accepted by the Apple development team. Ultimately, Apple approved the integration of Zcash into Jaxx and accepted Zcash as a legitimate cryptocurrency built on top of proper cryptographic work and technology.With the introduction of Zcash to hundreds of millions of iOS users, Dilorio reaffirmed the importance of financial privacy and the necessity of anonymity which Zcash offers. In an interview with Cointelegraph, Zcash CEO Zooko Wilcox also noted the significance of financial privacy for all iOS users and the rapid development of the Zcash ecosystem.“It is very important to provide platforms that, like Jaxx, are easy to acquire and easy to use. I'm delighted that Jaxx and other companies and open source volunteers are extending the Zcash ecosystem. Privacy is essential to all commerce, whether buying a cup of coffee, taking care of your family's needs, or executing major business deals,” Wilcox said.Furthermore, Wilcox expressed his excitement over the integration of Zcash into a widely utilized multi-cryptocurrency wallet platform. He explained that the simple and user-friendly interface of Jaxx on both iOS and Android will allow Zcash users to send and receive transactions with ease and full anonymity.Wilcox added:“I'm delighted that now anybody with a smartphone (iPhone or Android) can send, receive, and store Zcash right on their phone. It is delightfully easy to send ""Internet money"" with this simple app, whether across a table or around the world. We were delighted when Jaxx decided to support Zcash, and we offered them free technical support.”One of the highly anticipated projects eagerly awaited by the cryptocurrency community is Zcash on Ethereum. On January 19, Christian Reitwiessner of the Ethereum Foundation released an update on the joint initiative between the Ethereum R&D team and the Zcash Company.According to Reitwiessner, the project was established to share the advantages and strengths of Zcash and Ethereum networks: programmability and privacy.Reitwiessner wrote:“One of the goals of the Zcash company, codenamed Project Alchemy, is to enable a direct decentralized exchange between Ethereum and Zcash. Connecting these two Blockchains and technologies, one focusing on programmability and the other on privacy, is a natural way to facilitate the development of applications requiring both.”In addition to various ongoing projects including Project Alchemy, Wilcox told Cointelegraph that five new features will be released to the public in the near future. Two of these features include payment disclosure and user-issued tokens, which allow users to reveal information about a specific payment and issue unique tokens for particular projects.For a company or a project raising funds in unique Zcash-based tokens, revealing the amount raised during the crowdfunding or funding round and sharing the allocation of funds in a transparent manner will be made possible with the payment disclosure feature.As the Zcash development community grows and the ecosystem expands more interesting features, applications and integrations will be introduced to the community."

From a unit price of $8.52 in the beginning of the year, Ethereum reached its all-time high this week, topping at an incredible $269.36 per unit. The price is up by over 3,000 percent since January 2017.","This week, Ethereum traded at an all-time high of $269.36, according to data from WorldCoinIndex. It has stabilized slightly below that price since June 6. The figure below retraces its 3,000 percent growth since the beginning of 2017.Many factors have led to this record rally, which fit pretty well in the quadriptych of the EEA, ICOs, South Korea and Russia.In March 2017, Blockchain startups, research labs and global companies announced the creation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA). The goal of this alliance is to collectively develop industry standards and encourage collaboration between its various members.The EEA now counts hundreds of members, among which include Microsoft, Intel, J.P. Morgan, Deloitte, Accenture, ING, ConsenSys and the Toyota Research Institute. The alliance is seeking to work on common projects and contribute to the future of the Ethereum permissionless Blockchain by focusing on its scalability, privacy and confidentiality.Julio Faura, chairman of the EEA, says:“The enthusiasm around EEA is remarkable. Our new members come from varying industries such as pharma, mobile, banking, automotive, management consulting, and hardware as well as the startup community driving innovation. It’s great to see everyone come together and build the next generation of our economy on Ethereum blockchain solutions.”Such an initiative is without a doubt giving legitimacy to Ethereum, and played a role in its recent rally.Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are a new way for Blockchain startups to raise millions of dollars in short periods of time, by selling custom tokens. This type of offering has flourished without a legal or regulatory framework, and it is perhaps exactly what made it so attractive.Smith + Crown is a Blockchain consulting firm that tracks ICOs and their achievements. According to the firm, ICOs raised $101 mln in 2016. Since the beginning of 2017, the total amount raised  has passed the $300 mln bar, which represents a near 200 percent increase in less than six months.Many of the recent initiatives in this field are based on the Ethereum Blockchain due to its smart contracts capabilities, and thus, ICOs use Ether tokens and, therefore, contribute to raising the unit price of ETH.South Korea’s three largest digital currency exchanges have integrated Ether, making it the largest Ethereum exchange market with a $335 mln daily trading volume. Since then, and over the past few months, the country accounted for around 38 percent of the total trading volume of Ethereum.The sudden interest in ETH from South Korea is so strong that the ETH/KRW pair processes more trades than the ETH/BTC pair, which used to account for over 50 percent of all Ethereum trading.At Cointelegraph, we recently commented on this historical meeting. Even though not many details have been revealed following it, we do know President Vladimir Putin is ready to support the development of Blockchain technology.This interest has been further confirmed by referring to this meeting on the Kremlin’s website and through its Press Secretary. These are, in my opinion, the four main factors that altogether drove the price of Ethereum to its all-time high this year. What will come next?"

By using this method that ...","Jun 8, 2017","Perhaps you have heard of John Myatt, the famous forger behind the “biggest art fraud of the 20th century.” Myatt recreated over 200 art pieces from famous 19th and 20th-century painters.","His fakes were so genuine that auction house experts valued them at enormous prices and buyers were tricked. Such deceptions and sophisticated forgeries are not an isolated case, nor are they decreasing.In fact, 2016 has even been labeled the “year of the fake” for the complex art forgery scandals it brought.While many consider Blockchain to be a disruptive technology that could have a transformative effect on our global economy, I must at least agree on its versatility. I have yet to find an industry where it won’t have a tremendous impact and the fine art world is also one that could harness Blockchain to solve some of its issues.The actual system of transferring fine art suffers from great opacity that makes it difficult to track provenance and the movement of items. Transaction records are still paper-based most of the time, which exposes them to a plethora of risks - they can be easily lost, destroyed, altered or stolen.This is where Blockchain is particularly fit to solve these issues. As a distributed ledger, it can be used to provide an immutable and censorship-resistant database of ownership.Indeed, many organizations are looking to leverage this technology in issuing certificates of authenticity.One of these organizations is Verisart, which is building a worldwide permanent and decentralized ledger of art and collectibles. Its mobile application can be used by artists to generate a certificate of authenticity, and by collectors to verify provenance in real-time. We previously detailed its ambitions here.Ascribe and Monegraph are other startups that have entered this space. The Berlin-based Ascribe allows artists to generate a certificate of ownership for each one of their creations. Each piece is assigned a unique cryptographic ID from which its complete history can be retrieved.Artists can then share their work, gain visibility on where it spreads on the Internet and use Blockchain to license it and generate revenues.As for Monegraph, it is also using Blockchain to verify digital assets. Artists can submit the URL of their online creations, and receive a Blockchain key and value to be stored in a Namecoin wallet.Namecoin is an open source decentralized key/value registration and transfer system based on Bitcoin technology. By using this method that looks at art as a digital currency, online artists can store certificates of ownership of their creations.Monegraph, in turn, can spot if an illegitimate person is trying to claim ownership of the same creations in the future.Besides, Blockchain’s ability to certify provenance has not only attracted new entrepreneurs. Professional services firms, such as Deloitte, have also expressed their interest in the technology.“The Blockchain distributed ledger can trace the journey of artworks. When this technology is used in the art market, all events in the life cycle of an artwork are recorded and traceable. The application addresses one of the main concerns in the art market today, namely the fragile documentation related to the provenance and movements of a piece of art,” explains Patrick Laurent, partner and technology leader at Deloitte Luxembourg.Deloitte has built a platform enabling anyone, from artists to galleries to owners, to access a distributed ledger of the provenance and transportation history of physical art pieces.Dubbed “ArtTracktive,” this proof-of-concept validates movements on the supply chain through reached consensus, therefore shortcutting the need for a trusted third party.The initiative shows how Blockchain technology can solve the current authenticity and traceability issues in the art world, by recording the full history of an artwork in a secure environment available to all.Although Blockchain technology is still in its early days and business models are still under development, it is very likely that Blockchain will gain momentum among artists who are interested in gaining greater control over their work and being fairly compensated for it.- by Wassim Bendella"

Bt crop, and Xcoins which use Bitcoin, while WeiLend, EthLend, ...","Jun 13, 2017",The strength of every nation’s economy is usually a direct reflection of the viability of the Small and Medium scale Enterprise (SME) sector.,"The impact of SMEs on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of nations cannot be over-emphasized. In most cases, especially developing countries, SMEs account for as much as 35-40% of the total GDP.The backbone of the SME sector of the economy is its access to affordable funding schemes. Strenuous banking processes and high interest rates appear to be major stumbling blocks to the success of SMEs, especially in developing countries.Among other factors, the risk posed by the inability of SMEs to repay loans play a huge role in the reluctance of most banks when dealing with such organizations. Since most SMEs may not have assets that could pass as sufficient collateral, most banks would rather deal with companies with established track record and tangible assets.Therefore, while banks seek guarantees for their facilities, these enterprises struggle to go a step further than just an idea.Using Blockchain technology to disrupt the existing lending or borrowing systems within the financial sector is an innovation that merits attention.Kumar Gaurav, Founder of Auxesis Group & Cashaa, tells Cointelegraph that Blockchain technology is aiding the facilitation of new models with more flexible conditions such as p2p lending, crowdlending, and microlending.Gaurav says:“With cryptocurrency, for the first time, it is possible to send smallest amounts of money anywhere in the world without fees. Lenders and SMEs get connected directly, making the process faster, cheaper and easier”.He continues by explaining that whereas traditional lenders would invest depending on their own, less transparent criteria, Blockchain technology facilitates everyone to become a lender, apply their personal criteria and track the fulfillment of these in real-time. Additionally, a loan can be tokenized and traded, which gives liquidity to an otherwise illiquid asset, and minimizes lenders risk by dividing a loan into smaller parts.Earlier this year, a joint venture between fintech and analytics provider Ipreo and distributed ledger technology Symbiont aimed to solve such issue. Known as Synaps Loans, they have created and tested a working Blockchain solution for servicing syndicated loans.In its original concept, a syndicated loan or syndicated bank facility, is a loan offered by a group of lenders – referred to as a syndicate – that work together to provide funds for a single borrower. The borrower could be a corporation, a large project or a sovereignty, such as a government.Whether Synaps Loans will employ Blockchain technology mainly for the sake of efficiency in servicing the aforementioned exclusive class of businesses, or whether they will explore technologies such as the smart contracts of Ethereum to cover SMEs as well may be part of the details to be known in the coming months as indicated by Emmanuel Aidoo, head of the distributed ledger and Blockchain effort at Credit Suisse.Aidoo says:“Over the coming months we will work with Symbiont and Ipreo to implement the remaining functions to allow for distributed ledger technology to support a syndicated loan facility from origination to payoff, and work toward market adoption. The technical and market expertise that the project participants brought to the table means this solution will be tailor-made for use in live transactions.”Another Blockchain company that claims to enhance business and entrepreneurial loan services is Singapore based WishFinance.WishFinance claims to have its entire portfolio stored on a Blockchain, therefore enhancing transparency for funds, borrowers and investors. The company also claims to focus only on SME's which work with cashless payments (applepay, credit card, etc), offering only short-term (3 to 36 months) business loans.Employing Ethereum’s smart contract and big data analytics, WishFinance claims to achieve its objectives of assessing an applicant by determining the SMEs reach and cash flow. In the area of loan repayment, WishFinance claims to connect to the acquirer providing POS terminal to the SMEs with its APIs and deduct 3-5% of each payment the borrower gets from its customers. This happens with the consent of the borrower, thereby introducing a systematic loan repayment procedure.Other startups employing Blockchain-based lending systems include Bitbond, Bt crop, and Xcoins which use Bitcoin, while WeiLend, EthLend, and Lending Circles are examples using Ethereum.Gaurav notes that his company, Auxesis Group, is developing a Blockchain solution called “Bitkarz” for the Indian Lending market, which will allow people all over the world to invest in SMEs that are part of India`s high growth economy, as well as investing in real estate through Bitcoin and other virtual currencies.Whereas over 20 social lending platforms have been started in India over the past years and have thousands of users, there is still a lot of system fine-tuning needed to be done before they can be seen as serious competition to traditional institutions.One of the major advantages of Blockchain-based loan systems is the fact the it offers accessibility to international capital and reduces the dependence on bank procedures. The system also offers SMEs the opportunity of becoming independent of other local institutions, thereby giving equal chance for both banked and the unbanked entrepreneurs.Naturally, an increase in the number of possible lenders increases the chance of an SME meeting some lenders’ criteria and get a loan.However, Gaurav notes that when everyone can become a lender, there is a higher risk of insufficient due diligence, hence he advocates the offering of minimal capital until there is adequate infrastructure to measure imported data of borrowers ahead of any given contract.“The creditworthiness of some new groups of borrowers may be impossible to measure by any documents such as bank accounts, payslips etc.; social data can be a replacement but for that there first needs to be the infrastructure and standards for capturing and tracking this data. Therefore it is only expedient in P2P lending for now to invest only small amounts of money in diversified SMEs”."

of product) have deployed a Bitcoin marketplace platform called ...","Jun 12, 2017","The Bancor protocol is a standard for a new generation of cryptocurrencies called “smart tokens,” which can hold one or more tokens in reserve. ","It is about easily creating, managing and trading tokens, currently, ERC20 tokens created on the Ethereum network, by increasing their liquidity and allowing them to have an automated market price. Bancor already has a working front-end product which includes smart token creation and wallet, as well as community features like discussions, profiles and stats. The Bancor Network Token allocation event, happening today, will launch the project. The Bancor protocol enables built-in price discovery and a liquidity mechanism for tokens on smart contract Blockchains using an innovative reserve mechanism. These “smart tokens” hold one or more other tokens in reserve and enable any party to instantly purchase or liquidate them directly through the smart contract, without any counterparty and without relying on exchanges. Bancor creates relationships between the ever-increasing number tokens and allows conversion between them through a new kind of economic model which uses an algorithmically discovered price to balance buys and sells, keeping constant the ratio of reserve balances available. This reserve ratio is called a CRR and is user-configured. What Bancor is really doing is creating a paradigm shift, by allowing any token to have liquidity and a market price from day one, which is something not possible on today’s financial exchanges. Moreover, it is intended to support any token, whether it is a fiat currency (dollar), a cryptocurrency (Ethereum), a token issued in a crowdsale (Augur) or a token that represents physical assets (gold). Currently, this is possible through the increasingly popular “tokenization” of assets. In the future, the protocol will support additional Blockchains and currency types as well. Bancor’s Network Token (BNT) is the unifying reserve token linking all network tokens together. It benefits from network effect as the more people use it as the reserve token for their smart tokens, the more value it captures, which in turn appreciates all the smart tokens holding it in reserve. The company is also developing a partnership with TokenCard, the first project issuing Visa debit cards based on ERC20 tokens, to allow smart tokens to be used wherever Visa debit cards are accepted. The Bancor token (BNT) allocation event will begin on June 12, 14:00 GMT. The fundraiser is held here, and the white paper can be pulled from here. The company has also made public its development plan for the next two years. Bancor has designed a unique token allocation model, from a desire to listen to the concerns and needs of its community. Therefore, we present below a summary of its special sale terms: ​ Bancor heard the concerns that having no cap in the first hour (other than the 1 mln Ether security cap) may result in BNT dropping below its initial price after the token allocation event. Indeed, a large contribution event could possibly result in a post-fundraiser price drop, to below its initial price, due to fully saturated demand and evergreen supply. This is why Bancor has designed a unique model to create a price floor that will address these concerns. The company has decided to allocate any proceeds collected in the minimum hour which exceed the hidden cap as follows: 20 percent will be allocated to the BNT Ether Reserve, to further improve the liquidity of BNT, which increases stability while reducing conversion costs for all. 80 percent will be locked for two years in a smart contract that will buy back BNT for 0.01 ETH (the initial price) whenever it is available. The purchased BNT will be added to the foundation’s long-term budget, and after a two-year period, any remaining ETH will be allocated pro-rata. In other words, Bancor is seeking the kind of contributors that purchased Ether at 30 cents and are still holding most of it. To give everybody the chance of joining the adventure as a contributor, a limit on gas has been set so that “whales” can’t jump in line. Transactions with higher gas than needed will be rejected by their system during the token allocation event. It is the people’s token sale! The team behind Bancor has extensive experience in building software products and scaling companies. Yehuda Levi (CTO), Ilana Pinchas (VP engineering) and Eyal Hertzog (chief of product) have deployed a Bitcoin marketplace platform called AppCoin. Two of the founders, Galia and Guy Benartzi have each founded and exited a startup. The team has been working together for over 10 years on a variety of these initiatives. Some of their advisers include venture capitalist Tim Draper, Founders Fund partner Brian Singerman, governance visionary John Clippinger, founder of Asana Justin Rosenstein and more.  Since the BNT smart contract introduces new mechanisms never deployed before on the Ethereum Blockchain, it is of utmost importance to ensure beyond any shadow of a doubt that funds will be secure. For this purpose, Bancor is working with some of the most respected Ethereum security advisors, including Nick Johnson and Martin Holst Swende from the Ethereum Foundation. The results of the audits will be made public. Meni Rosenfeld, an award-winning mathematician well-versed in Blockchain technology, and Yoni Assia, the CEO of eToro, have both joined the adventure as previous advisors.

The assessment will be done according to their standards, verified by independent auditors, certified by them. We do not consider them as a partner but as compliance to their standards and certifications.”The funds powering phase one will likely become only more sizeable. The sale of the startup’s ECOBIT token, which ends June 15, has already raised around $5 mln in Bitcoin, Ethereum and NEM contributions.“Our team members are not the typical youngsters who never handle a multimillion dollar project. Our team members’ age ranges between 30 to 60 and consists of dignitaries and an ambassador too, and we have a council handling the funds,” Tang added.On a technical level, hardware wallet Trezor will be responsible for the security of what is raised in the ICO.The backup seeds will also be dispersed, thus ensuring the council “has no single point of failure,” says Tang.The project’s partnership with NEM, meanwhile, is a recent one, with investor enthusiasm spilling over into its XEM asset, which gained considerable ground following the announcement.Disclaimer.

too. Altcoins might get stuck for months due to faulty nodes so their ...","Apr 27, 2017","Cryptocurrency is perhaps the safest instrument to transfer value between anonymous parties. But storing and trading cryptocurrency can be a risky affair. As a digital crypto-asset, it does not have to worry about the many usual issues vexing paper money but faces challenges unique to fintech industry.","The most popular way of storing cryptocoins is a software wallet. Digital wallets are easy to use and practical but how secure are they? If your hard-earned cryptocoins are stored on your PC, then your assets are only as secure as your computer itself.Basically, protecting your software wallet is no different from safeguarding any sensitive data on your PC. You should be a bit extra paranoid when surfing the net and never store your passwords in an unencrypted file on the same machine as your wallets. Ideally, you should store your passwords offline or not store them at all (brain-wallets!) and install your wallets on a device you do not use for day-to-day browsing and downloading.Another popular solution is Linux operating system, which is believed to be almost impervious to hackers and viruses. You don’t even have to install Linux instead of Windows, it can be booted on your PC when necessary from a USB stick.Then there is cold storage. Cold storage takes security up a few notches and basically means keeping your altcoins in an offline wallet, effectively restricting any attempts of unauthorized access to it.Cold storage wallet is usually created on a device that is never connected to the Internet, like an old offline laptop or a USB stick. Not many people know that a cold wallet can not only be maintained offline but can even be created offline. You do not need to connect the device to the Internet to install a wallet, generate keys and send the coins. Such wallets are perhaps the safest ones.As far as offline wallets go, hardware wallets are the most convenient and secure solution. Hardware wallets are portable devices designed specifically for storing cryptocurrency. Basically, they are USB sticks with simple and secure software and several layers of cryptographic protection.Now cold storage is great for storing your assets, but sooner or later you will need to move your coins online and that is when you face some completely different security issues.Emerging crypto-shopping requires us to find a suitable way of keeping assets online and easily accessible.Many users create a “hot wallet” to take care of routine day to day transactions and a “cold wallet” to store the bulk of their assets, only occasionally accessing it. This approach was also adopted by many exchange websites. Even if you do not consider yourself to be a crypto-trader, at times you will need to exchange your cryptocurrency and dealing with exchanges is almost unavoidable.Online wallets, processing systems and exchanges all have their security issues. Professionals believe that there are a few security measures crypto-traders should be aware of when choosing what online services to use, but also to remember that certain user end measures are absolutely necessary and usually more reliable in the long run.Svetlana Geller, Livecoin.net CEO, says:“Perceived safety and objective safety are two completely different beasts. Perceived safety can be reached by numerous account protection mechanisms. But in reality, this will mostly just hinder the account owner’s user experience. I believe google authenticator with just one IP in its whitelist (the VPN you use to access the exchange) will be enough. With this sort of protection, in place, your account will only be hacked if the perpetrator has full access to your PC and smartphone, which should be hard enough for an Internet-based criminal. You can slap 10 more protections on top of that but none will be nearly as effective.”And of course, pay attention to your email’s security. “Always use unique passwords, protect your email with multi-factor authentication and so on, you know the drill”, Geller continues. “90 percent of all hacks are conducted via accessing your email and changing email in your account or attempting to recover your password. Also mind your smartphone, especially if it's Android with google authenticator installed. Ideally, you should buy a cheap smartphone specifically to be used for your financial activities and restrict your Google authenticator for exchanges to it. These two simple tricks will almost completely safeguard your assets from hacker attacks.”Whether you frequently trade on the exchange or simply store some of your assets there to diversify risks, it is paramount to choose an exchange that will not only be convenient but also reliable and secure.Exchanges, mostly being centralized entities, can get hacked. And often are. Moreover, they tend to sometimes dissolve into thin air along with the clients’ assets. Many times we have seen crypto-exchanges evaporating or crumbling in a matter of days. There were signs of course, but inexperienced users did not read them.To name a few examples, the abrupt resignation of William Dennis Atwood, the sole director of MyCoin, should perhaps have sounded some alarms but in fact, it went largely unnoticed by the community. A month later the notorious Hong Kong exchange collapsed leaving behind many disgruntled users. The downfall of Cryptsy was perhaps even more predictable. For years this exchange experienced numerous technical issues and introduced questionable administration policies. Early in 2016, it proclaimed bankruptcy as a result of the hacker attack that robbed it of $7.5 mln. The court case that followed has shown that the owner has probably funneled exchange’s funds to his personal accounts too.So what are the dark omens traders should be on the lookout for? Apparently, the crypto world is all about trust and reputation so industry celebrities and personalities with good karma in the community disengaging themselves from a project should be an alarming sign. Frequent technical issues and fishy policies are another obvious one. But as professionals say, there are just too many ways to spot a shady exchange so keep your eyes peeled for anything that seems out of place.Geller explains:“There are just too many ways to spot a sketchy exchange given some of them employ very unsophisticated schemes. For example, an exchange suddenly crashes during intensive BTC price fluctuations and when it’s back up clients’ orders are mysteriously fulfilled at a disadvantageous price.”According to Geller, Bitcoin withdrawal issues are always a huge red flag too. Altcoins might get stuck for months due to faulty nodes so their mobility is really not a relevant factor, but bitcoin’s low mobility is definitely a bad sign.She says:""‘Transparency is not always a clear sign. There has been quite a few fairly transparent exchanges that disappeared with clients’ money. On the other hand, there are numerous non-transparent exchanges that are well-respected and reliable, like BTC-e.""Slow response to user tickets is another sign, which while not being absolutely certain should still raise some alarms if frequent enough.”Another tell-tale sign of a shady exchange is a seemingly uncontrolled influx of highly questionable altcoins. Some exchanges even get involved in ICOs and initial emission. And every time a new coin enters such exchange there will be pump-and-dump cycles which will most likely rip a trader off unless he belongs to an insider group. Exchanges with heaps of dead coins on their roster should be avoided unless you absolutely know what you’re doing.Finally, don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Sometimes bad things just happen out of the blue but at least you will be able to greatly decrease your risks by diversifying them."

the coin that it spends. Monero is designed to obscure this linkage by ...","Apr 15, 2017","The privacy-centric cryptocurrency Monero includes unlinkable transactions in its main offering, meaning that a single coin cannot have its entire transaction history revealed. On Friday, a research called that assertion into question.","The research paper, authored by Andrew Miller, Malte Moser, Kevin Lee and Arvind Narayanan, details research into how Monero transactions obfuscate their origins. It reveals how Blockchain analysis could potentially lead to transactions, particularly those taking place before 2017, being linked, showing the transaction history of certain coins.In his reddit comment, Monero developer Riccardo Spagni, aka FluffyPony, says the problem is well understood and 80% of transactions are not traceable.Meanwhile, Cointelegraph spoke with Andrew Miller, assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and associate director for the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts, and one of the researchers cited in the Monero link paper, about the implications of these findings.Cointelegraph: What, in one sentence, were the findings of the paper?Andrew Miller: We found that a significant number of Monero transactions, mostly transactions made in 2014 through 2016, can be linked.CT: Can you define ""linked"" for the layperson?AM: In Bitcoin, each transaction points to a previous transaction, which is the coin that it spends. Monero is designed to obscure this linkage by including a bunch of fake coins, called mixins, along with the real coin.CT: How could this linking be done? Does software exist that could make this possible?AM: Yes, the linking can be done with a really simple algorithm. Anyone with a copy of the Blockchain could run this themselves. But it seems like no one has done it yet.CT: But this is not feasible with current versions of Monero, correct?AM: So to be more clear, we analyzed two ways of linking Monero transactions. The first one leads to “conclusive” linking like we can tell with 100 percent certainty that a particular transaction is linked to another. This method only applies to older transactions.The second way involves some uncertainty.There is a bias in how the ""mixins"" are chosen. You can guess that the ""newest"" coin is the real one and be right much more than if you guessed randomly.CT: Say I downloaded a Monero wallet right now and got some and tried to send them for a transaction. How linkable would a transaction be today?AM: I think it’s hard to speculate here, I don't want to take a guess and say things outside what's supported by the evidence reported in our paper!If you downloaded a wallet today and withdrew coins from an exchange today and then created a transaction to spend them, you would probably use RingCT and the default number of four mixins.That means that for the transaction you created, you would probably expect that an attacker would have a 1/5 chance of linking your ""spend"" transaction to the withdrawal.But actually, it's worse than that, closer to 1/2 instead of 1/5.CT: Not so with old transactions though, right? Say I used Monero for some purchases in late 2015. Those might be linkable?AM: If you made a Monero purchase in late 2015, or even late 2016, there is unarguably a very good chance your transaction could be linked.Whether this de-anonymizes you or not depends on what other information the attacker has, like if they have records from where you received the coins (e.g. an exchange) or if they have records from where you spent the coins (e.g. a merchant).CT: I know hypotheticals are tough, but let's say I bought some Bitcoin on an AML/KYC compliant exchange, exchanged it for Monero and made a purchase during that time period. One could theoretically track that purchase back to my identity?AM: If one could seize the logs from the merchant, then almost certainly.CT: You're linked to Zcash, aren't you? Why should anyone trust this research and not dismiss it as attempts to smear a competitor?AM: A fine question! Yes, I'm linked to Zcash, I've been a consultant for them for years, as well as Tezos, I've also consulted for Ethereum, and made sure to disclose this on the first page. It's trite, but I think everyone should be distrustful of every claim and try to reproduce claims as much as possible. In this case, it should be straightforward.Here's what I think is going on: The reaction I've seen from Monero folks is mostly ""this is not new, we've known this since 2014"" with reference to the MRL reports, which discuss the fundamental problems underlying our analysis. But I do not think that anyone yet has actually looked at the Blockchain to see how bad it is. I have not seen any software that does this analysis, nor seen a block explorer that reveals this, until ours.Monero developer Riccardo Spagni, aka FluffyPony, commented on Reddit:“The problem is not the paper. In fact, I offered to run an FFS so that they get paid for their work, and I suggested we publish it as an MRL paper so that it forms part of the body of Monero research. They took us up on neither of those. The problem is that it was presented as a ""Monero deanonymisation"" paper, released an hour before a hard fork, and even lauded itself by one of the authors as ""New research: serious anonymity weaknesses in privacy-centric cryptocurrency Monero; 80% of transactions linkable"". It's not new research, it's additional research on a problem that is well understood. 80% of transactions are not traceable. etc. etc. It wasn't researchers trying to improve the ecosystem, it was a paid-for hit piece by the president of the ZCash foundation and his cronies. Their reaction to us betrays their motives, not the other way around.”"

However, as is currently obtainable in most cases, only individuals with certain abilities, especially those capable of reading and interpreting computer codes, are really capable of maximizing the potential of most Blockchain resources.Creating user interfaces that can enable the easy application of Blockchain solutions without any special coding skills or extra computer language specialization appears to be an important aspect of industry development if Blockchain is to go mainstream.Michael Vogel, CEO of Netcoins, confirms:“This is part of the next wave of Bitcoin and Blockchain applications. Blockchain technology has now proven itself incredibly useful and valuable for a variety of applications, and developers are now working away on creating these applications. One such application could be Blockchain-based accounting systems, where accountants can create and access financial reports on the Blockchain - as a user-facing application where no coding skills are necessary.”Estonian Blockchain startup Agrello claims that its technology is being developed to allow users without coding or legal skills to form legally-binding agreements on the Blockchain, and to streamline production processes through the automation of resource allocation. To do so, Agrello is set to develop a graphical interface that allows users to assemble contracts, which are then compiled to code, managed and executed on the user’s behalf by intelligent agents, based on BDI-software models.Hando Rand, Agrello CEO, says:“Operating at the intersection of the legal system, financial institutions and disruptive technologies, Agrello is highly dependent on the establishment of good industrial relationships with the off-chain world. We regard the work done by the Ethereum Foundation on this matter as invaluable, and seek to be an active player in the field, lending our hand to promote this effort even further.” According to Vogel, especially on the payment side, the mainstream adoption of Blockchain will happen in ways where people don't even realize that they're using the Blockchain. For example, instead of a credit card payment using traditional payment channels, behind the scenes, the payments between customer and retailer will be instantly settled using a Blockchain mechanism.Melvin Petties, Blockchain evangelist and technologist, notes the current existence of such capabilities - the low hanging fruit for the developer community is to create the appropriate hooks into the platforms that are available. He identifies some platforms that provide the ingredients for molding ""legos"" - reusable code that would expose Blockchain APIs.He notes that with the right platform choice (i.e. Azure, IBM, AWS and other third party workflow or business process management tools like K2, Nintex, etc.) one could then expose that ""lego"" as a drag-and-droppable building block to be incorporated into any business process/workflow.Petties tells Cointelegraph:“As a SharePoint architect, I build solutions like this every day. Business users love it because they don't have to look at JavaScript to decipher how their logic has been implemented. If you can read a decision (flow) chart, you can use these tools. By the way, developers love it too because it completely bypasses the painful change management process, and allows organizations to ""expose"" approved legos without having to approve each department's ""one-off projects."" The business is now empowered to iterate and test ideas with incredible speed and efficiency. IT can focus more on strategic initiatives. Everybody wins.”There exists a universal agreement that whatever efforts are taken to lower the barrier to building value on the Blockchain, the better off we are as innovators and a society as a whole. However, Petties notes that on the flip side, the more transactions that occur on these networks, the more saturated traffic will be.This may have an (intermediate) negative impact depending on which (public) Blockchain is being exposed to that traffic. Therefore, there is the need to be focusing equal attention on usability, speed, security and scale to make this a pleasant transition to wide scale adoption."

What was the reason for the $50 surge?,"On March 16, Bloq, a leader in the development of corporate-class Blockchain solutions, launched BloqLabs aimed at supporting open-source projects in the Bitcoin and Blockchain ecosystems. Thus, Bloq has signaled joining the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. It is a good enough reason for widespread speculative activity, followed by big sell deals. But Ethereum price has fortified above the $30 mark where big buy deals were made earlier. All that indicates that the ETH price is still enjoying some support.After a fall of more than 50 percent at the peak of the upward trend, large sell deals have made an appearance. Selling at $50 along with new upward surges from the previous growth level are a tactic of a big seller who is securing a part of their profit. The $30 level has not been disrupted, which means that the structure of the upward trend hasn’t been broken. Thus, the maximum level for the downward rebound will be at the $30 mark.The situation can change. A signal for the start of a correction towards the entire trend from December 2016 will be a reversal near $30. A reversal structure in that area is one of the signs that there’s a lack of support for the upward trend.Ethereum Classic price has renewed the maximum of the upward trend from 2016. But the period of growth was a short one. Large sell deals started the next day. Sales after a break through the peak of an upward trend are one of the big player’s tactics. It is at moments like this one that the majority of traders open their deals expecting growth, and the big sellers secure their profits.A fall like that, after a break through an important line, can hardly be called fortification. That’s why talking about an upward trend is only reasonable after the price fortifies near $2. The largest volume of sell orders is accumulated around that area.If the price of Ethereum Classic does not have sufficient support for growth at the $1.65 mark, the most likely scenario is a new fall towards the minimal target of $1.3 for a correction towards the upward trend from $0.25.For that course of events to take place, ETC price has to form a downward turn at the $1.65 mark."

one type of computation - value transfer - while Ethereum and ...","Jun 9, 2017",The increasing need for efficient processing of data and computational power has given rise to the creation of supercomputers. ,"A supercomputer is a computer that performs at or near the currently highest operational rate for computers. Traditionally, supercomputers have been used for scientific and engineering applications that must handle very large databases or which perform a great amount of computation (or both). Popular among supercomputers are traditional processors, interconnected and installed in given locations with the task of solving specific data problems. Examples of the top supercomputers in the world include: With the emergence of decentralized technology, the design and installation of supercomputers appear to have shifted gears. However, according to Sergey Ponomarev, the founder of Supercomputer Organized by Network Mining (SONM), from a technical point of view the term ""decentralized computer"" does not exist, it's just a marketing ploy. Ponomarev notes that a correct technical term would be to speak of a global/decentralized operational system. For example, the first such system was Multics, developed in 1964 which allowed the assembling of a supercomputer - just screwing new parts to an already running system, without having to restart. Ponomarev claims that his company does essentially the same thing. However, in its case, it is not a manual installation of computer hardware but rather it is an organization of a network cluster. “SONM is more to say a global network such as the Internet but actually managed with some global operating system,” he says. Ponomarev further summarily describes the decentralized supercomputer as fog computing, where the fog exists in the singular. SONM (as well as Golem, Ayeks, BOINC and others) are building a global operating system that would help users get close to this fog. Ponomarev tells Cointelegraph: “Fog computing can solve some of the most challenging tasks of humanity by joining the powers of personal computers, laptops and even smartphones. Scientific calculations of any difficulty can be performed quite fast due to the opportunities fog computing provides.” Solutions offered by decentralized supercomputers include the generous availability of processing power, uninterrupted uptime, economic incentives among other features. Christopher Franko, founder at Expanse.tech, tells Cointelegraph: “The one peculiar solution that really stands out is uptime. Decentralized systems have 100 percent uptime. So imagine an always accessible supercomputer that you could input data to and get the output at any time all the time.” Franko acknowledges incentivization as a very important feature of decentralized supercomputers. He notes that people with idle machines could assign their machines downtime to contribute computational power to the decentralized computer and earn money for it. He also identifies Bitcoin as a decentralized computer that specializes in one type of computation - value transfer - while Ethereum and Expanse try to take it a step further and give people the ability to do more complex computations. So logically, super-efficient, super-fast, decentralized computation machines are the next step and, for now, are a little out of reach. Vadim Budaev, co-founder at scorch.ai, expects supercomputers to become a more intrinsic part of the digital technology ecosystem in huge data solutions. He says: “I hope, in a while, decentralized supercomputers can be able to solve not only some tasks for cryptocurrency mining, but also process data sets for AI services, such as photo video processing and voice recognition. The AI community and our startup need it very much. Unfortunately, for a while, there are no efficient algorithms to parallelize these processes, but we hope it will be created.” "

A large number of issues involving prize distribution and fairness of raffles are observed regularly in this industry.TrueFlip’s goal is to solve these issues by providing a decentralized, fair and audit-friendly lottery platform. It is creating a more inclusive environment in which power shifts from the organizers to the lottery players.This prowess is achieved by leveraging Blockchain’s capabilities. On the TrueFlip platform, the drawing of the winning lottery numbers is based on the random hashes of Bitcoin’s blocks. The code behind it is open source and available on GitHub.All the other lottery processes such as the ticket purchase, the prize fund composition or the prize distribution are planned to be decentralized in the future, by also transferring them onto the Blockchain.The company has already conducted a successful pre-ICO in stealth mode, securing more than $400,000 in contributions without any major media coverage.The beta version of TrueFlip was launched at the end of April 2017, and it has since reached an audience of 60,000 players.These players have already purchased more than 110,000 lottery tickets, making the total sum of prize payouts surpass 21 BTC.Now, with a product at a fairly advanced stage of development, TrueFlip is organizing a token allocation event to boost the jackpot amount. It is aiming at raising 3,000 BTC through its ICO to further grow their platform.Large part of the collected sum - 40%, to be precise - will go to the jackpot. This money will be secured on cold wallets and use multisignature escrow involving three community stakeholders, while the development team won’t have any access to this money.The other reasons behind the ICO are to make the processes that take place on the platform - such as the purchase of tickets, and the prize fund composition and distribution - even more decentralized and independent from trusted third parties, develop more lottery games and raise a significant budget to invest in a marketing strategy.In the case of a successful ICO, TrueFlip will become the only functional Blockchain lottery with a jackpot of over $8 mln.The crowdsale will begin on June 28 and will last either 30 days, or until all the tokens are sold - if this ever happens earlier.20 percent of the tokens will belong to the original team behind the project, but will remain in the escrow wallet and will only be released in three stages and only after pre-defined KPIs have been reached: 20 percent will be released at the end of the crowdsale, 40 percent six months after its end and the remaining 40 percent a year after its end.The price of a TFL token will be fixed at 0.0005 BTC. Early bird bonuses will be available to the fastest investors, depending on the current amount of money secured (up to a 30 percent bonus).The money secured by selling each token during the crowdsale will be distributed between jackpot funding, platform development, marketing, operations and legal activities.The game is developed by an international team of professionals in the fields of distributed systems, business planning, marketing and finance. The project has been launched by a group of developers who have 12 years of experience in creating and managing Internet-based projects, including Blockchain-specific businesses.Operational management is being conducted by Nikita Parhomenko, Konstantin Katsev is the marketing director and Daniil Andriyanov the director of finance. The team is also comprised of professionals from Canada, China and Japan.Furthermore, the company has the support of several independent advisors, such as the CEO of Cryptopay Eric Benz, the founder of Cryptopay George Basiladze and legal advisor Renato Almeida. TrueFlip is currently looking for more advisors among key members of the community - their onboarding will be announced just as they join.The escrow key holders are the founder of the-blockchain.com Richard Kastelein, George Basiladze, and the current team of TrueFlip. Sasha Ivanov, the CEO of Waves Platform will be the sole holder of the Waves-based tokens, which will be sold as part of the total supply of TFL.For more technical information about the project, head over to the TrueFlip’s ICO page or have a look at their recently released white paper.For announcements regarding the upcoming ICO please stay tuned with us, or visit TrueFlip's official Medium and Steemit channels.Disclaimer.

How will the launch of the TokenCard debit cards impact the market?Ethereum price keeps balancing at the top limit of its medium-term $40 to $50 flat. There was an attempt to form an upward reversal wave on April 18, but the correction never happened. The volume of sell deals was much higher than that of buy deals, which resulted in a fall to $48, the starting point of this wave. The price has again reached a turning point. Will it manage to form a reversal this time around?The TokenCard project is working on the development of Visa debit cards, governed by Ethereum smart contracts. The cards will allow their users to hold several cryptocurrencies at once. The ICO is set to launch on May 4. Such events usually result in volatility growing.Ethereum flat started in the middle of March, is a correction towards the long-term growth from $5.8. As a result, the movement after the $40 to $50 flat exit will be of a corresponding scale. In fact, the news about the debit card project is quite positive and it is expected to increase the Ethereum demand. This will probably influence the growth, as there will be fewer people willing to sell Ethereum. If the market forms an upward reversal at the $52 mark, it will confirm Ethereum price growth.The appearance of a large buy volume is a great opportunity for a big trader to close their deals. There’ll be a signal from the key level near the highest demand area at $50, which protects the uptrend from $41. If a downward reversal takes place near that point, there will be a high chance of a fall down to at least $40 to $43.As expected earlier, there was a movement of a larger scale. After fortifying at $2.6, Ethereum Classic price has formed an upward reversal. A similar scenario was repeated at the peak of the upward trend at three dollars, which was the last signal for the powerful growth beyond $3.5. Ethereum Classic price has renewed its last year’s maximum.The position of a big trader has been opened during the previous protracted flat. Because of that, we now have two possible scenarios for further development: the trader either starts closing their position or doubles down. The highest demand, as usual, is at the crossing point of several technical instruments near $3.9. If a downward reversal doesn’t take place at that point, the odds of growth will increase. As such, the $3.9 mark can be regarded as the most likely peak of a rebound towards the upward trend from $2.5."

in my small business. Turns out it's quite easy, useful and lots of fun!","Apr 16, 2017",,"On April 1st, the famous Russian farmer and crypto-enthusiast Mikhail Shlyapnikov has launched an ICO for his project “Kolionovo Ecosystem.” Cointelegraph spoke with Shlyapnikov to know more about his aims, motivations and what inspired him to apply the Blockchain at his farm.The ICO is carried out on the Waves platform through the Emercoin service. One mln of Kolions are listed for initial sale during the next 30 days. The fundraising is scheduled to end on May 1st after that Kolions will be traded on the stock market.As stated in the White Paper, the project is aimed at attracting additional investments for development of existing production line and a variety of services in Kolionovo village located in the Moscow Region.It is also emphasized that the project should not be viewed as an investment opportunity promising high returns - it should only be considered as a crowdfunding tool for development of the Kolionovo ecosystem, a system of local production and consumption, which has been successfully operating for over a decade.Shlyapnikov is leading a modest life, breeding ducks and hens and growing all sorts of plants.He says:“I don't have that much of a free time to dive deeper into studying digital currencies, their emergence, performance, following all these dramas happening in the space and predictions. Of course, I am trying to follow key trends and new projects. I have a laptop which is soon to turn seven years, an Internet connection through a USB modem which is far from stable, I am not quite able to speak foreign languages. But it doesn't stop me. I have my piece of land where I am working and I love what I do. Blockchain with all its benefits is not an object of adoration and worship for me, it is just a tool which has a potential to be applied in my farmstead. Just like a badass tractor pimped up with a bunch of cool stuff.”- Mikhail Shlyapnikov. Photo: Nikita Girin / “Novaya Gazeta”Long before the ICO Kolions have been in circulation used mainly by the community members of Kolionovo farm, its partners and customers. Mikhail Shlyapnikov, the man behind the project, created Kolions to order transactions between members of the Kolionovo farm.In 2014 with the help of the local printing company he printed 20,000 Kolions, which basically looked like loan-certificates. His initiative immediately attracted the attention of the public prosecution office which claimed that Shlyapnikov is threatening the integrity of the national monetary system.When officials from the Central Bank of Russia learned about the case they just shrugged their shoulders saying they see no harm in Shlyapnikov’s invention, as it’s totally up to the farmer how to handle a relationship with partners and customers and through which instruments.We developed technologies, we taught computers to mimic real life processes and relationship. Now technology is teaching us to easily and continuously improve many organizational systems, simplify complex relationships and transform whole industries suggesting innovative approaches and models.The young but quickly evolving Blockchain technology definitely has some social dimensions and it is interesting to watch the societal impact it is producing.A few years ago we only thought that application of Blockchain technology is limited to the area of finances, it is becoming more and more obvious that its potential is unlimited.The Russian farmer shows how it can transform agriculture. Obviously, one cannot put a cow on Blockchain, but it can be used to tame relationship with business partners and clients, while cryptocurrencies appear to be a perfect instrument for financing industries and projects all forgotten and abandoned by the state.Shlyapnikov told Cointelegraph:“First of all, I'm a farmer. I was interested in Bitcoin and Blockchain technology and decided to try it in my small business. Turns out it's quite easy, useful and lots of fun! In March 2017 we collaborated with Emercoin team and developed a package of ready-made solutions for farmers, providing a free and open access to it. This product has already attracted some interest. I would say that my enthusiasm is more about the application of cryptocurrencies in real life, rather than phenomena itself. Many people contact me asking questions concerning cryptocurrencies, but I just don't have enough competence in this matter. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why my project and ICO were met with irony at this fancy Blockchain party.”The investments are linear by nature, therefore investing in Kolionovo Ecosystem is not about contributing to a single product but rather into expanding and growing the existing production. The growth of Kolions price is proportional to the growth of production volumes. The team behind the project also points out that Kolions holders will be able to purchase a number of products and goods with a discount of up to 100 percent.- Photo:Nikita Girin / “Novaya Gazeta”The key advantage of Kolions is that cryptocurrency is not linked to any traditional currency, it is linked to actual product and serves as an instrument for barter, which is as old as the universe.With this project, Shlyapnikov suggests to step out of the crypto world and invest in something real. The project is not absolutely risk-free, however, all risks are coming from the real world, have nothing to do with attacks by hackers but rather with natural disasters and issues related to regulation of ICOs as an investment model in Russia.In one of the interviews to the local media he once said:“We hope that the government will not try to intrude into our small experiment in our small village. The fact that the experiment is unusual and creative does not necessarily mean that it is illegal. We are working to clearly define the terms of the project. Certainly, there are risks - an asteroid might hit the hen coop.”Last year the Kolionovo Ecosystem carried an ICO on Emercoin Blockchain. First in August partners issued digital equities and shares. They allowed attracting long money for improving the production line, investors in turns were able to purchase farm products with a discount.Shlyapnikov says:“During the eight months of this experiment we've got returns of almost 80 percent which were shared among participants. Those who live in Moscow Region receive it in the form of a ""farm box"", those are investors who live far away are getting their returns in BTC. In December last year using the same platform we have issued digital futures. They are not different from any transactions on blockchain but needed when the production needs more time. For instance making whiskey or growing trees. With time prices for these products are increasing and the price of digital token is growing as well.”The entrepreneur says that the main conclusion from his experiments with cryptocurrency and Blockchain technology is that they blend well with real life, representing an alternative to bank services, more accessible and efficient.He continues:“This actually motivated us to create a digital currency of our own - KLN (Kolion). It is directly connected to the real product and is backed not only by investors' trust but also by real world assets. In November after the crop harvesting, we are planning to direct the profit to support our digital currency and cover investment maturity through purchasing or clearing of our cryptocurrency.”- Photo: Nikita Girin / “Novaya Gazeta”Through his tiny experiment, Shlyapnikov has demonstrated the enormous potential of cryptocurrencies and Blockchain solutions to be used in real life on daily basis. They allow fulfilling principles of P2P interaction to the fullest degree possible, eliminating the need for middlemen.He says:“In our case, we were able to push aside banks, retailers, logistics services and controlling authorities. It allowed us to significantly decrease nonmanufacturing costs. Partly we freed the state from the obligation to support us. Besides the integration of Blockchain moved us from shadow economy. To protect investments we had to register our assets and report everything publicly. Perhaps this might influence the state to change their attitude towards Blockchain technology and its application.”The Kolionovo Ecoproject is original and innovative in many respects. First of all, it has started without any prior promotion or media coverage.Shlyapnikov explains to Cointelegraph:“My Facebook page was the only platform which was actively used for promotion of the project. Later, of course, there were releases on the BTT forum. Interest in our project was growing steadily. Many people who were following the project from the very beginning were very supportive. Those who are not that familiar with what we are doing thought of it as of just another scam.”Shlyapnikov says that some met his project with irony and were making sarcastic jokes like ""peasant decided to crash fancy Blockchain party"", or ""how to brew homemade beer using cryptocurrencies"", etc.He says:“Opinions vary significantly. One of the officials from the Central Bank of Russia contacted me saying that they are keeping an eye on my experiment. I'll repeat myself, but we were able to attract such a huge interest without any promotion.”- Photo: Nikita Girin / “Novaya Gazeta”The farmer is following the ideas of anarchism and says that it might not always be possible to create an anarchy in such a big country, but it is easy to start with a small community.So far the project raised $20,000 in cryptocurrencies and ten times more in fiat. Shlyapnikov shares that the entrepreneur inside him is celebrating because this is a huge success. But as a researcher and pioneer of the idea to combine real life production and digital money, he is a little bit confused.He concludes:“Obviously there is a huge gap between the IT industry and traditional agriculture. Ideally, I would expect to see equal proportions of digital investments and those in fiat.”"

Blockchain News · Business News · Technology News · Policy & ...","Jun 17, 2017",$82 bln banking giant Morgan Stanley and leading financial institution Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon) are utilizing Blockchain technology-based platforms to maintain backup records and process transactions.,"Earlier this week, several publications including Business Insider obtained a note from Morgan Stanley that explained the intricacies of its Blockchain platform such as its structure and protocol. Short for Broker Dealer Service 360, the BDS360 Blockchain platform of Morgan Stanley has been operating as a duplicate backup ledger to the settlement layer of Morgan Stanley’s banking infrastructure.According to Morgan Stanley, the BDS360 Blockchain platform has been operating since March of 2016. Through the utilization of cryptographic signatures and timestamps, the bank relied on Blockchain technology to backup the settlement records of transaction and the transfer of assets managed by Morgan Stanley’s financial network.Morgan Stanley’s note read:“[Blockchain] provides a cost-effective way of adding extra layers of resiliency to the current platform. There is still work to be done to figure out the specifics of client interface. BNY Mellon would also need to engage in regulatory dialogues, and establish necessary standards and protocols. We think BNY Mellon is well positioned to take on those challenges, with ~85% market share in the [bond] space.”At the moment, Morgan Stanley emphasized that Blockchain technology is not sufficiently flexible to handle the settlement of millions of data points in real-time. Hence, banks including BNY Mellon are not utilizing Blockchain to significantly reduce operating costs as of yet. However, the utilization of Blockchain allowed major banks to add resiliency to their networks by securing transactions and settlement history with cryptographic evidence and timestamps.The vast majority of international and cross-bank payments are processed through the SWIFT ledger and network. In order for Blockchain technology to replace SWIFT and establish itself as the technology for the settlement of transaction and assets, Morgan Stanley explained that a few more years of development will be required.Leading banks and financial institutions are pioneering the development of Blockchain technology and Blockchain-based platforms with a long-term vision and strategy of eventually replacing the entire banking infrastructure with the Blockchain-based protocol.Morgan Stanley believes that it is possible if banks can collaborate effectively with one another and introduce solutions to regulatory hurdles:""Adoption of some form of Blockchain technology by incumbents is likely. Given the amount of collaboration required, we expect it could take several years to replace existing back office functions.""Many banks apart from Morgan Stanley and BNY Mellon such as BBVA and some of Japan’s largest banks have partnered with Blockchain projects such as Ripple that have their focus set on competing with the multi-trillion dollar financial network SWIFT."

147,https://cointelegraph.com,"Apr 6, 2017",Matchpool Denies Co-Founder Claims Its CEO Pulled $1.7 Million Exit Scam,https://cointelegraph.com/news/matchpool-denies-co-founder-claims-its-ceo-pulled-17-million-exit-scam,"Bitcoin Suisse not involved. But, as both Shimon and Bitcoin Suisse say, 
Bitcoin Suisse was not involved in any way with the Matchpool fund ...","Apr 6, 2017","The Blockchain project Matchpool raised over $5.7 mln in 48 hours, with high anticipation from the community on its decentralized matchmaking protocol. However, the community was shocked the next day to discover the company co-founder Philip Saunders’ public accusations that its CEO Yonatan Ben Shimon had pulled an exit scam and disappeared with $1.7 mln of the funds raised.","Similar to most Blockchain projects, Matchpool engaged in an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), a crowdfunding mechanism designed after the Initial Public Offering (IPO) process of conventional companies, to raise millions of dollars.Essentially, Matchpool sold its local tokens for the Ethereum networks’ Ether, to secure enough capital to fund their operations until Matchpool is ready for commercial use.Early investors who bought Matchpool’s tokens with Ether become stakeholders of the project, and profit from their investment as the value of Matchpool increases over time.However, instead of being transparent with the usage of their funds, Matchpool seems to have misdirected their funds by trying to hedge their capital to Bitcoin. According to the co-founder of Matchpool, who resigned after he suspected the likely exit scam, the company’s CEO Shimon took 37,500 ETH, which is equivalent to $1.69 mln at the time of writing, from the firm’s multi-signature wallet account to hedge the Ethers to Bitcoin via Bitcoin Suisse AG.But, as both Shimon and Bitcoin Suisse say, Bitcoin Suisse was not involved in any way with the Matchpool fund controversy so the reputation of a completely unrelated Bitcoin service provider was harmed.To withdraw funds from a multi-signature wallet, a user must receive confirmation from every private key holder. In other words, if the multi-signature wallet of Matchpool is maintained by its co-founder, CEO, directors, advisors, etc, in order for Shimon to withdraw 37,500 ETH, he would have needed confirmation from every multi-sig private key holder within the company.So the suspicion grows of a case of fund mishandling and miscommunication from the Matchpool team as they enabled a member of the company to withdraw $1.7 mln of investor money without requesting the member to provide an evidence as to how the funds will be used.The co-founder of Matchpool stated that upon speaking to Bitcoin Suisse, he was certain that Shimon did not hedge 37,500 ETH to Bitcoin and likely pulled a dreaded exit scam, which the cryptocurrency community fears.Matchpool co-founder stated:“Over the last two days, 37,500 ETH has been withdrawn from the multi-sig wallet by the CEO, Yonatan Ben Shimon without any explanation or announcement due to the need for “hedging.” Yonatan keeps claiming he’s working with Bitcoin Suisse and it’s all okay, but so far I haven’t seen any evidence of this. I suggest you all demand an explanation and keep a close watch.”Various Bitcoin experts including Tuur Demeester and Andreas Antonopoulos criticized Matchpool for this handling of an ICO.Likely $1.5M ICO exit scam: https://t.co/92RC81DBHxIn responding to Cointelegraph’s questions, Matchpool denied the allegations of its co-founder and accused him of ill intent in order to delay the development and growth of the company.Matchpool wrote to Cointelegraph:“There was a miscommunication within the team. The public post from Philip took us all by surprise. Philip [co-founder] decided to try and prevent the success of the project which we had all worked so hard on and we’re not prepared to sacrifice this opportunity. We would have announced this to the community prior to the hedge, however, Ether was extremely volatile and the decision was made quickly in the interest of the project’s future.”According to Matchpool, the user funds are safely stored in their cold wallet:“We sold the Ether for Bitcoin to hedge against the volatility of the Ether price. We have the responsibility to build a great project and that is what we are going to do. You can see all the evidence of the cold Trezor wallet here.”But, the company did not specify how much of the $5.7 mln is stored in their Trezor wallet and if the $1.7 mln withdrawn by its CEO is also stored in the Trezor wallet.The company informs it has appointed Or Demri to the position of CTO:“Or specializes in system architecture on Ethereum and is highly qualified for the role and recommended by the community. Or won the Consensys NY EtherCamp Hackathon last year so we’re in a great position now to move onwards and upwards. Or will also inspire other developers in the community to join our future developer platform DevPool. Matchpool offers developers a chance to create custom matchmaking DApplets (Pools) that plug into the protocol where they can earn from matchmaking. With the raised funds, Matchpool is also hiring at matchpool.org.”Matchpool has also given its answers on the ICO handling.Cointelegraph: How would you defend the decision to allow full access to accrued funds from the ICO for project leaders?Matchpool CEO Yonatan Ben Shimon: Some of the funds are held in an ETH multi-sig wallet and some in BTC. The ETH multi-sig doesn’t give full access to the funds and the cold storage was the best viable option. The reason I made this decision was to protect the investor’s fund until the bank account is opened. I’m responsible for delivering the project. The team and community felt I made the right measures in order to protect the funds. When the bank account is opened, all the BTC will be transferred safely.CT: Were you surprised by the speed of the Crowdfunding (not ICO)? What are your major intentions in terms of investment?YBS: Yes, I was surprised and very grateful for the response to Matchpool. We are going to publish an article in the coming week about our intentions. We will publish this with a future roadmap and budget.CT: What steps are you undertaking now?YBS: We are focusing on new informative creative for the platform. We are opening the bank account and as soon as this is operational and restructuring the team, including the appointment of a new CTO.YBS: How soon the whole situation will be resolved, according to your estimates?Within the coming weeks, we are looking to start on the production of the project.Cointelegraph team has also tried to reach Steemit CEO Ned Scott who advises Matchpool on the ICO. Unfortunately, Mr. Scott has canceled Thursday afternoon the interview arranged beforehand.Cointelegraph will get the readers updated about the case development.UPDATE 04/07: Matchpool's CEO Yonatan Ben Shimon has published a statement on Medium, where he offers his own point of view on the recent events."
148,https://cointelegraph.com,"May 19, 2017",Can Applications Communicate Over Blockchains?,https://cointelegraph.com/news/can-applications-communicate-over-blockchains,"Decentralization is a promise because the Implications of using Technology 
in the way Bitcoin does, suggest it is possible to defeat large ...","May 19, 2017",The author Benedikt Herudek pushes the frontiers of decentralized systems in describing how Turing Machines can communicate over Blockchains.,"We will suggest introducing Turing Blockchain Machines, using Blockchains as a Turing Tape. Turing Machines are a simplified yet powerful Model for Computability and the every-day life programs we design and use. We introduce them as a ‘Gedankenexperiment’ on an abstraction of Blockchains as Turing Tapes with specific features to try to answer the question, if applications could communicate over the Blockchain.This endeavor is connected to the question, how far we can push Software Decentralization and with them human relations and society organized by them? Decentralization is a promise because the Implications of using Technology in the way Bitcoin does, suggest it is possible to defeat large cartel-like organizations, which sit right and accepted in the middle of society.Technology does have a liberating power if designed right: kicking out ‘middle-’ or ‘highwaymen’ is one of them.The question raised here (we are not ready to give an answer) is a connected precursor to the vision to endow Blockchains with a ‘Turing Complete Language’. Such Blockchains, foremostly Ethereum aim to have ‘programmable money’ and want to allow decentralizing any application logic, (not ‘just’ money).The approach suggested here aims to have any kind of signal (not ‘just’ money) exchanged via Blockchains, such that it is clear ‘what it means’. Both approaches have in common to attempt to generalize Bitcoin‘s Blockchain approach.If you purchase a good or a service from someone, who doesn’t happen to be your neighbor or a family member, you typically need these three ingredients.One form of trade trading over the Internet, private-public key cryptography and browsers are practically indispensable but taken as a given here. When you want to decentralize trade in this sense you needRegarding (1): Bitcoin. Bitcoin solves the double spending problem with a distributed System and a ‘hardened’ Ledger based on the proof of work mechanismRegarding (2): we can solve this problem if we can prove that Turing Machines can teach each other languages over a Blockchain. This is the focus here.Regarding (3): Turing Complete Blockchains, e.g. Ethereum. If we can establishsmart contracts which are distributed, verifiable and ‘unstoppable’ we have a good chance to digitalize and decentralize important and relevant parts of governanceAbove listed ‘smart contracts’ realm is sometimes referred to as ‘Internet of law’ as opposed to ‘Internet of money’ referring to Bitcoin and other digital currencies. In the digital realm you can easily imagine one get music files delivered, based on cryptocurrency payment was done or certain conditions (amount of clicks on your post) are fulfilled. Where conditions and delivery lap over into the real world (like delivering a book after you successfully ran a marathon) currently it takes a bit more imagination (and IoT, sensors and maybe even Artificial Intelligence) to imagine the general working of such smart contracts.Note that questions like ‘Can Machines teach languages’ or ‘Can Machines understand each other’ are rather ‘fuzzy’ questions. They can easily lead astray into questions like ‘Can Machines Think?’ With Chomsky and others, it is important to realize that these questions are ultimately questions as to which metaphor one wants to choose. A better way is to reuse Alan Turing’s approach and try to formalize the question such, that it can be answered.Imagine you ‘don’t mind’ a translation layer as described above in (2). You only mind (1) the decentralized payment and (2) a Turing complete language as part of the Blockchain. Then, you set out to build a new kind of marketplace, a ‘decentralized eBay’ on top of it. Your infrastructure and your payment are decentralized, still, you will end up with a ‘large monolithic application’.Even on decentralized platforms, for applications, some kind of organization has to define the rules, e.g. how to offer and purchase goods, which data formats they need to use and so on.Everyone will have to abide the rules that ‘decentralizes eBay’ set up. Even if the founders have best intentions to not monopolize the process, centralization will have to happen because of the basic architecture of the System.A typical answer to this centralization on the Turing complete Blockchain is the so-called ‘Decentralized Autonomous Organization. The idea is essentially the organization defining all rules needed to run the applications, is itself democratic and decentralized.But however well intended and efficient a Decentralized Autonomous Organization would be, it is still an institution to force parties into agreements on how applications should be set up. The more successful a DAO is the less an individual voice will count, the less autonomy there will be and the more centralized the DAO will look to the individual.Seeking Decentralization in rich applications on top of a decentralized turing complete platform will lead to centralization on the Blockchain.The ‘trick’ to avoid this ‘successful DAO dilemma’ is to not place entire Applications on an immutable Blockchain. Rather, only the transactions that concern Communication between two parties should go to the Blockchain and only on those (but not on the entire Application Logic) should parties have to agree. To allow innovation you need to give autonomy to their applications and force them under agreements on the shared Blockchain, only where absolutely necessary. You want to keep your network dumb, allow autonomous edges to run innovation.With ‘decentralization’ we foremostly target towards certain effects on power and social relations we would like to see in the real world, like e.g. making banks unnecessary for payment traffic and central banks obsolete for monetary (specifically inflationary) policies. Technology is an enabler only and technically, decentralization these days is typically implemented by a Distributed System with a consensus system, to ensure there is just one truth in spite of many copies of the shared database. If you stress values like ‘autonomy’, ‘resilience’ or ‘simplicity’ in your system you could with some right also claim that paradigms like ‘Service Oriented Architecture’ or ‘Micro Architectures’ should be seen as part of the Decentralization Paradigm. Those are architecture patterns, describing how Systems can communicate while being decoupled. They are typically mentioned in an enterprise context and do not have the privilege of carrying the subservice odor of Bitcoin but they certainly are architectures carrying the possibility to not build ‘huge monolith blocks’, which is really just another expression for ‘not Centralizing’. Some describe Microservice as Service Oriented Architecture without the so-called ‘Enterprise Service Bus’. This is the Integration Layer, which tends to take over a lot of logic like routing and translating different nomenclature. How ‘smart’ you want to design your network and how much logic you want to put into it, is a recurring theme in designing Systems and can have surprising effects, what power relations Systems can implicate.Of course, there are legitimate usages of a turing complete Blockchain, e.g. for the Internet of Things. Nothing stops one (e.g. if one prefers DAO’s over conventional companies and that does hold a lot of promises) to rewrite known applications on a turing complete Blockchain. However, for the context we are looking at it, turing complete Blockchains main usage would be to - one fine day-(semi-) automate governance with smart contracts.Here is why you should care about (2), the translation layer: Your main reason, why Amazon or Ebay has a website you go to, is that it allows you get in touch with the creator or owner of something you would like to have. It allows you to pay (1) and when you paid, it gives you a governance framework (3) to ensure the process (like shipping) works for you because there are legal frameworks behind both the platform and the vendors offering their goods. Somewhat hidden is the fact that the platform delivers a significant (2) ‘translation exercise’ for you. That would be obvious if a Spanish person offers a good offered over eBay by a Chinese person and both only speak English. The platform just sets a common standard (English), how these people can interact. But that would be just the UI surface, the platform itself sets all kinds of standards that enable interaction: The vendor has to accept a certain User Interface and with that, a certain data format prescribing, how the article pictures and descriptions are rendered. That Data format to offer goods then works perfectly with the data format prescribed by eBay to purchase goods, which is the format working ‘under the hood’ when you press the order button. Ebay, in fact, acts as your translator, you have to pay for that. This might be more obvious if we think through this situation in a B2B context where companies would offer and order good via message Systems, automated and without a User Interface. The messages to offer goods would need to be matched with the messages wanting to buy goods. Someone needs to translate these messages into each other.Typically this just happens via the man in the middle setting a standard. This is the common way these days to establish common terminology allowing applications to talk: per definition. In a typical enterprise, if you want two applications to talk to each other, you make a design, where both parties agree with which messages eg in formats like JSON or XML they will communicate. Whoever went through this, knows this can be a painful process and doesn’t make your projects ‘exactly agile’. On a broader scale, you will have entire bodies with the goal to set standards, like eg the World Wide Web Consortium. Many have good intentions, but the necessary effort and time for meetings and achieving agreements is not a healthy environment for fast innovation. Worse, there are ‘information-cartels’, whose business model eventually depend on establishing and dominating standards allowing people to connect. Ebay and amazon would dominate, even if we would all pay with Bitcoin and even if they were rebuilt on ethereum and ran as a DAO. But all they do is make sure technically people get in touch with each other.Establishing a common nomenclature per definition is not only stifling innovation it also opens up the backdoor for monopolists and decentralization.A different way of establishing communication could be to use an approach similar to how we translate natural languages with machines like google translate, essentially we just have a look at how so far parties communicated and draw our conclusion for the future. One could easily imagine building a general machine translation ‘google translate for apps’: all kinds of messages connecting different Systems would be fed in, working translations (typically initiated by humans via above described ‘definition’ approach) would be used to bootstrap the engine and then a self-learning ‘google translate for apps’ would be set up to translate message formats into each other. With the size and clumsiness of the Application Integration Business, it is a surprise, enterprises didn’t use Neural Networks to widely automate this part of the Application Integration Business, just as a decade ago cloud computing started automating (in the sense of ‘hiding from the client’) hardware setup.Even more so because you don’t have to come up with fancy neural networks to predict, how some Systems will communicate. You could just say if two applications are part of the same industry, they probably use standard XYZ, if they are from the same vendor they probably use standard ABC, if similar Systems have used message formats 123 before for similar cases these two fellows might need just the same, maybe you can parse an XML and reassemble it with some other names and the target system will ‘eat it’. Sometimes a ‘nice & long if then statement’ is just about right.But doing trade predicting future terminology based on the past just isn’t good enough in many circumstances. Sending Bitcoin over the Blockchain and establishing smart contracts on platforms like ethereum is a binding agreement, which absolutely cannot or should not be changeable: immutability leaving no room for disputes is the cornerstone of such use cases. If you inject now a level of uncertainty as to what your terminology was really supposed to mean, you open the backdoor for irrefutable disputes Imagine Application A sends a message, B takes the translation from an Integration layer, reasoning (‘messages XYZ usually mean in other contexts ABC for applications like me’) and delivers an expensive good. Now, A can always claim ‘well, you misunderstood me. The fact that in cases before the message XYZ translates into ABC doesn’t hold here. I want my money back.’Predicting future translations based on past successful translations isn’t good enough for Blockchains and the level of trust and binding agreements to base smart contracts on them.Another way of thinking of this is the following thought experiment. Imagine, a Mars-UFO lands in Amsterdam, Central Station. It’s an unmanned ship, but there is a pretty smart Computer inside. We want to communicate with this device. Connect it to the best and super-trained machine Language Integration layer. It will deliver no results, because saying that our ‘earth-machines’ communicate in ways XYZ, doesn’t mean anything for ‘mars-machine’. Even if we think we ‘understand’ the machine (with an assumption as ‘there are only so many ways how digital systems can operate’), we never really know, if we understand the machine correctly.Now, if ‘setting standards’ stifles innovation, fosters centralization and ‘predicting based on the past’ isn’t a safe enough bet, one way out of the deadlock could be machines teach each other the language, unambiguously and retraceable over an immutable Blockchain, with which they will transact.A ‘Blockchain Turing Machine’ is a conventional Turing Machine with the following specifics:State Machines would be any Applications behind an address, which write transactions onto the Blockchain to communicate with other Applications. There would be no Turing Complete Language, the endpoints, however, could have any Turing Complete Language and any rich features they like. The logical translation and communication layer would be connected to layers for payment and governance, the latter potentially turing complete.Here is a simple example, Bit Inversion. The Sender holds a State Machine with the Following State Table.StateSymbol ReadWrite InstructionMove InstructionNext StateState 0BlankNoneNoneStop State0Write 1Move Tape to the RightState 01Write 0Move Tape to the RightState 0The machine will first read the symbol under the head, write a new symbol accordingly, then move the tape right, before repeating the read-write-move sequence. After every instruction, there is a new machine state. As soon as the machine reads a blank symbol, the machine terminates.The current symbol under the head is 0....110...so we write a 1...111...and move the tape right by one square....111...The symbol being read is now 1, so we write a 0...101...and move the tape right by one square...101...Similarly, the symbol read is a 1, so we repeat the same instructions....001......001...Finally, a 'blank' symbol is read, the program tells the machine to stop.If, in any case, the Receiver can ‘figure out’ the state table of the sending Turing Machine only if the Sender presents ‘all he got’ (operations, symbols) within a fixed time limit. With that in mind, our question is:Can we describe a Blockchain Turing Receiver Machine, that is capable of noting down any Blockchain Turing Machine Sender state table unambiguously while watching all the Senders operations and symbols on a shared Blockchain Tape?If this is the correct question, then one way of investigating is going over the numerous theorems proven over Turing Machine to see what they can contribute. Some other interesting questions to investigate could be:We will not discuss those but ask, how we could interpret a ‘yes’ to the question we ask. My conjecture: It means ‘quite a bit’. Take a Computer Program that essentially ‘figured out’ what another Application does, of which it ‘just sees’ some messages. It means this program ‘knows’ what these signals mean and can, therefore, initiate appropriate action. Now, it’s a quite a leap from the Turing Machine sparse notation towards a full Web or Enterprise Applications sending JSON or XML message (‘Clients want a uber- ride Berlin Brandenburger Tor to Tiergarten right now’). But that’s the beauty of Turing Machines, they are simple but can simulate essentially ‘anything’ you need in the digital world. Note also that Applications absolutely do not need to know everything about each other, lots of the typical application logic (how the app works to order an Uber ride, what internal states are saved, how the UI works) is entirely irrelevant to the trading partner (the individuals offering the ride application): Only the transactions counts and that is often much simpler than the entire application producing the message.Having such a Blockchain Turing Machine Translation Mechanism (transforming a Blockchain into a ‘Babel-chain’ if you will), would have considerable advantages over the above-listed Mechanism to connect Application. The Mechanism wouldn’t offer any ‘wiggle - room’ and no room undue transaction fees. Take the approach, where we assume Application ABC ‘probably meant that’ because similar applications ‘meant that’ in ‘similar cases’. You can’t base important transaction on that unless a human checked it. Because whoever ordered, could always argue there was a misunderstanding, and in this case, the machines cannot just conclude from the past to the future. If you involve humans to review Machine translations or simply set standards for communication from the beginning, you will have all the disadvantages that ‘middlemen’ bring along, best studied with the example of Banks: They will want a share of your transaction, even though they add little value other than facilitating a transaction. They tend to inflate their importance beyond their due position.If you can automate the translation between Machines and run this over a public and immutable Blockchain, you leave no room for misunderstandings no backdoors as to what ‘was meant’. Everyone can check the ‘understanding handshake’ and the language the two machines agreed upon for their transaction. There is no place for humans or organizations taking an undue tax on your producers and consumers transactions.After the terminology is agreed, the transaction itself goes into an immutable and verifiable Blockchain, payments and governance can be processed.If we can’t make turing machines teach their language we need to revert to one of the two other ways to make machines talk. Agreements can work, the internet, for example, is widely build on accepted standards like http and smtp - it works, but it is hard to imagine how you could get monopolists agree to standards today. Making a prediction based on past experience can take us far but also only so far as to the binding character we would like to see on Blockchains. A hybrid approach could be another interesting option, where you agree for example on an algorithm to generate translations based on past working translations. And the agreement is that whatever a certain algorithms spits out, will be the agreed message format.Decentralization is the task of relieving us of the ‘middle-man’ tax. Gain and fame should be with the producers of goods and much less with cartels dominating trade - just like banks should have a serving, not a dominating role in the economy. Technology allowing true peer2peer transactions with no room for centralisation can play a liberating role. Avoiding centralisation in Networks implies placing the rich application in autonomous endpoints of the network. Doing this requires making ‘Applications talk’ such that there is no human intervention required and certainty over common nomenclature. Asking the question, if Turing Machines can communicate over Blockchains is a way of trying to push the frontiers of Decentralised Systems."

Blockchain News · Business News · Technology News · Policy & ...","May 24, 2017",More than 80 companies have entered the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) and Ethereum price has displayed a new wave of long-term growth.,"Following a correction towards the $87 resistance, Ethereum price has stopped, due to the support from big bulls, and a new powerful long-term growth wave has followed. The support of a big buyer, or buyers, could be determined at short-term scales. At the five-minute graph, we can see how the level of sell deals and overall activity have been growing around the $87 area, but the price has formed a flat-like movement. It seems that this rebound has been used to get rid of the bulls, which have been buying between $87 and $95, so as to make these traders unable to prevent growth, closing their deals with sell orders.After a powerful surge of more than 100 percent, there were several big sell deals. At the very peak of this trend, the activity, as well as the volume of buy orders, has been at maximum levels. But the price has plummeted nevertheless. It has subsequently stopped inside the flat. That is a tactic employed by a big seller, who is making their profit.The big sell deals at the peak of the upward movement signal the upward trend end from $87. The wave of the current scale has been finished. Because of that, new growth can display a similar upwave and go beyond $250 under the same conditions.But before we determine the most likely outcome, Ethereum price has to fortify at a new peak. At the moment, we can see the growth of the volume, as well as the number of traders willing to buy at the peak of $183. Also, there is a large stop orders volume in that area. Similar to the previous fall to $138, this situation may be profitable for a big seller. That’s why there is a decent chance of a new fall, at least towards the wave of the flat. If a downward reversal takes place at $175.5, the chances are there’s a new fall towards at least the next resistance line.Ethereum Classic price, after several weeks of flat movement, is experiencing a new period of long-awaited growth. The price hasn’t managed to reverse downwards at $6. Big buyers have supported Ethereum Classic.That support didn’t last long. This is a typical example of the price going against the will of the majority. On the short-term scale, we can see how both the volume and the number of buy orders have been growing, but that is only beneficial to the big bear. The price has fallen and, after it has renewed its previous position, the scenario has repeated itself. Following the new fall, the majority of traders have started selling and that is a profitable outcome for the big buyer.In regards to the entire upward trend from $7, we can identify a key line near $12. Powerful growth has started at that mark in the past. Additionally, we can see large buy stop orders around that area. The point of $12 can be considered the most likely peak of the correction towards the entire upward trend. Provided a lack of a downward reversal at that point, growth is likely to continue.​Downward reversal at $175.5 can provoke a new fall.The maximum correction peak may be before $12."

Has Brexit begun to affect the thinking of Fintech firms about the viability of the UK as a hub? We got in touch with TransferWise to find out in detail about their thoughts about Brexit and its likely impact.TransferWise was founded in 2010 and it began its operations in 2011. The company sees a million users each day use its services as they send £1 bln each month. According to TransferWise, their services help users save more than £1.5 mln each day compared with if they had used another provider.On the question of whether the company would move out of London due to Brexit, TransferWise tells us:“If the UK loses passporting rights as a result of Brexit, then in order to serve our customers, we will need to get licensed in another European country and this means we would set up an office there. London remains our global HQ.”On the question of what impact Brexit will have on the broader money transfer business, a TransferWise spokesperson says:“Two of the main benefits of being a part of Europe for a Fintech business are passporting but more importantly the free movement of talent. We have no idea yet what the impact of Brexit will be but losing those two things are critical for a Fintech business.” The free movement of talent across borders is indeed an issue that would need sorting out post-Brexit.According to a report published by GP Bullhound, TransferWise is one of Europe’s fastest growing unicorns. Also, according to the same report, the UK has the largest number of fastest growing unicorns, which are fast-growth, profitable businesses at 18 with a cumulative value of $39.6 bln.Despite the clouds of Brexit looming, British tech deals hit a high in 2016 according to GP Bullhound. Whether the growth in the tech sector can be maintained post-Brexit is an interesting question.The Sunday Telegraph’s figures show that there has been a decline in the number of deals that were signed up by the tech industry post the June 23 referendum, with post-referendum deals coming in at 1,583 and pre-referendum at 2,426."

With Waves integrated into BaaS, developers are getting vast opportunities for offering a wide range of Blockchain solutions.","The introduction of Waves Platform on BaaS provides new opportunities for companies and software developers who would like to issue tokens using a Blockchain.“Microsoft was one of the first major IT companies to officially acknowledge the potential of Blockchain technology. Azure was designed to offer affordable solutions to companies that, due to their size, wouldn’t have enough resources to launch their own software platforms. Blockchain as a Service is a quick, economical, low-risk platform for deploying open Blockchain protocols,” says Alexander Ivanov, CEO of Waves Platform.He adds:“As an open, flexible and scalable cloud platform, Azure has a lot in common with Waves. We are also looking at new ways of computing, and of making powerful functionality available to end consumers.”Konstantin Goldstein, Microsoft Russia’s Principal Technical Evangelist, comments:“Waves Platform enables developers to quickly launch ICO projects (a crowdfunding method), or issue tokens for loyalty programs.”He explains further: “This new addition to the BaaS pool of platforms contributes to shaping a unique environment for developers and for companies interested in Blockchain projects. Blockchain as a Service will enable them to set up a Blockchain infrastructure in one click, as well as integrate advanced technologies in their projects, such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and so on.”Cointelegprah asked Konstantin Goldstein what is Microsoft’s vision on Blockchain technology. Here are his answers.CT: Why does Microsoft need this integration?KG: Microsoft’s strategy in Blockchain is to develop market infrastructure with partners and clients.Expanding our platforms pool in Azure Blockchain as a service gets us closer to fulfill this task. Integrations like this in Azure BaaS forms unique possibilities for developers and companies, who is eager to make Blockchain-products.""Constantly improving instruments of Azure BaaS gives the possibility to create, test and implement Blockchain projects for systems such as Ethereum, Ripple, Сorda and now Waves. Developers in short timing can create new products and services, to make companies more competitive on the market.""CT: How does Microsoft see the future of Blockchain technology?KG: For the moment, Blockchain is one of the breakthrough technologies. It helps to create new business models in different economy sectors, for big corporations, as well as for small startups. We think, that Blockchain will be the main driver for digital transformation of majority economy sectors.In the coming years, we see the perspective spheres for Blockchain the following - finance, healthcare, insurance, retail, real-estate, music industry and real estate registry services.Processes, which took days and weeks, now with Blockchain can be done in minutes: to make documents flow between counterparts, to improve reliability and accessibility of services and products for clients.Blockchain technology is young and needs improvements for high scale implementation. In particular high capacity, scalability and integration of technology with existing services have to be solved.In Microsoft, we are working on architectural approach - Bletchley. It is the new step in developing Blockchain, since Bletchley will be able to integrate Blockchain-solutions with popular services as CRM, ERPm Data Base and with technologies such as IoT, Big Data etc. The advantage of technology is high performance, security, fault tolerance and transparency of all processes.Microsoft Azure already features a wide range of Blockchain solutions, including Ethereum, Chain Core, Corda, Nxt, Lisk, and Waves. Together, they form an elaborate ecosystem known as Blockchain as a Service, which supports the creation of all kinds of Blockchain projects for all kinds of purposes and for companies of any size.Waves Platform is a decentralized platform for launching crowdfunding campaigns and issuing digital assets. It is the largest Blockchain project to originate from Russia. With 100 mln Waves tokens and $16 mln in crowdfunding investment, according to Coinmarketcap, it has $95 mln market capitalization.The Waves encryption platform is primarily designed to support the issuance, trade and exchange of digital assets/tokens using Blockchain technology. The project is characterized by its emphasis on usability and widespread application. It is supposed to use Proof-of-Stake as its consensus algorithm. Waves Platform completed its Initial Coin Offering in June 2016, garnering more than $16 mln (30,000 BTC) and becoming one of the top three most successful Blockchain projects in terms of crowdfunding investment."

Blockchain News · Business News · Technology News · Policy & ...","Mar 25, 2017","Privacy-centric cryptocurrency ShadowCash absorbed many of CloakCoin's investors and community members after they abandoned ship back in 2014. Now, the ShadowCash team has done a similar exodus, leaving the project behind to focus on a new project, peer-to-peer anonymous marketplace Particl. The project aims to be currency-agnostic and private while avoiding the shady darknet uses of projects like the Silk Road.","Cointelegraph spoke with Ryno Mathee, lead developer of Particl, about the reborn project’s goals and future.Cointelegraph: First, what happened to ShadowCash? Is it gone? Just rebranded?Ryno Mathee: Currently I can't really say what will happen to ShadowCash, but the team has left the project. Particl is an entirely new project, where we are giving ShadowCash holders the first option to invest in it or to convert to it.There are going to be people who are unhappy with this decision, but in order for there to be a proper structure, as well as governance, we needed a clean break from ShadowCash.CT: Why is that? What restrictions did ShadowCash have?RM: As we explained in the blog post, we got into a situation where people thought we were out to deliver a DNM, which isn't the case.Shadow has a lot of bad PR, and in order to do things properly, we started Particl. We want Particl to have a clean image, and to stay pure.Sure DNM can attract some attention, but at the end of the day, it's a tiny target market compared to the real deal. Shadow went from A to B as the community dictated, without us putting much thought into it, until we actually realized we could potentially be releasing a system that could get a handful of developers and investors into a whole lot of trouble because we didn't understand the repercussions.Once we sat down and realized that we are enabling people to do nefarious things, we knew the only way forward was to do things properly and getting a structure in place to take Particl seriously.Regarding ShadowCash restrictions, could I add: It's not an easy task to find a balance between a system that provides free trade yet remains regulatory sound.There is no unified framework for which goods and services are legal, making the task sound rather impossible. We strive to find a solution that will allow the community to help shape the market.CT: So instead of a normal privacy-centric cryptocurrency, the new Particl is more of a market ecosystem?RM: We're still going for privacy-centric, but the market and e-commerce will be our priority. We want a free market, as far as we can take it, within reason. We need the token, as it preserves transaction privacy. It will be the fuel of the market.CT: I saw that Particl intends to be currency agnostic. So the token will be more for internal use in the ecosystem?RM: We intend to start with shapeshift for our MVP, but we have a few ideas around how we could shape shift currencies within the system in the long term. Users could potentially swap out PART for xx Coin, which would allow them to enter into escrow, and the seller would immediately be able to cash out, as they know they are getting their PART back once the deal is done. It will allow them to keep their stake, as well as accept currencies that they desire.CT: So it sounds like you're trying to build a private, peer-to-peer marketplace while avoiding some of the sketchiness of darknet markets. Sort of like a Slightly-Less-OpenBazaar?RM: Darknet markets are a really small target market to go after, and most of us aren't actually comfortable with things that get sold on the black market.It wouldn't sit right with us knowing we've enabled people to do the wrong thing. We absolutely want to keep the dark stuff off the market, it’s only the right thing to do.CT: How do you balance the goals of privacy and full legal compliance? For example, what if the EU mandates that all cryptocurrency transactions be AML/KYC compliant and tied to real identities?RM: If that's the case, then I guess exchanges would close down or tighten up. Users will start doing transactions off the books. It's not something that we're concerned with. Europe might be committed to tightening cryptocurrency rules, but I don't think it’s something that they will be able to enforce.CT: I see the Foundation provides for development funding for a while. What are plans for continuing development funding long-term?RM: In order to create a foundation, it needs revenue. We are planning on launching the network with a percent of stake rewards and transaction fees being donated to the network. Holders staking on the network will be able to vote on the percentage that gets donated to the network, as well as the ability for individuals to donate above the network agreed rate.CT: What does ultimate success for Particl look like? We're talking utopian dream vision here.RM: Particl's ultimate success would be an anonymous marketplace, governed by the holders of Particl, that accepts any cryptocurrency, or at least can integrate any cryptocurrency with ease and incentivises holders enough to want to hold with stake rewards as well as listing and transaction fees. The ultimate would be to have a system that is constantly generating value and attracting users, that will run and regulate itself."

That makes it very hard for entrepreneurs to share long-term incentives with their employees, specially for startups and other small enterprises.Besides, existing funding schemes like Seed Money or Series A funding for startups are high-risk and high-cost for investors.If you like challenges but don’t have much initial cash, and can’t give long-term incentive shares to your supporters, it’s difficult for you to successfully fund your big idea and to find good team members to help you on your project.By using Starbase, innovative people can launch their ideas by sharing long-term incentives with collaborators. This is much faster, reaches a global scale, comes at a low transaction cost, and investors can individually commit a small amount of money.There are already more than 650 blockchain tokens in the world, with a 25 billion usd market cap. We make it easy for you to create a new token, so join them and get funded. Starbase has 3 innovative features and STAR token ecosystem mechanism as described below.The Starbase Platform provides multi-signature accounts for every user. So users can hold their BTC, ETH and ERC20 type tokens(Ethereum standard type tokens) by themselves, not depending on Starbase’s platform. These are called “STAR Accounts”.The STAR Account system makes users able to own their private keys, one key is signed by user, the second key is signed by the Starbase server, and the third key, unknown to Starbase, serves as the user’s backup. This way, users are able to use the multi-signature transactions easily.This makes it easier and safer for users to send and receive Bitcoin, Ethereum and ERC20 type tokens.STAR Account system is the basis for most of Starbase platform’s transactions.Starbase provides a web application for reward deposits and withdraws. Any project can deposit Bitcoin, Ether, and ERC20 type tokens to reward contracts, while token holders can withdraw these rewards in a decentralized way. We mainly develop for Ether and ERC20 type tokens. ERC20 type tokens can be such as DGX, decentralized gold, StabL, which fix their prices on fiat currencies such as USD, EUR, CNY or JPY. and Dai which is fixed after the IMF’s international currency basket: SDR.And thanks to the STAR Account system, users can deposit and withdraw Bitcoin, Ether and ERC 20 type tokens on the Starbase platform being certain that they own their private keys.Starbase platform provides token investor protection from a technical and operational perspective.From the operational point of view, in order to prevent scams or the emission of fraudulent tokens, Starbase company works with rating and due diligence partners around the world. Any project can issue tokens using Starbase platform, but without due diligence by Starbase or our partner companies, they can not sell their tokens on the Starbase platform.From the technological point of view, Starbase provides an escrow system for innovative projects. Project owners can choose whether to the escrow system or not. Using this will likely increase the chances of a successful fundraise.The escrow system also protects investors. Not only in the ICO or crypto token funding world, but also in traditional reward-based crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter or Indiegogo, there are projects that may fail and the money is not returned to investors.When escrow partners release the funds only if the promise is fulfilled to fundraisers, there’s virtually no risk involved.Starbase will also provide a “Put Option smart contract”. Put option smart contracts can be used for innovative projects that sell tokens on the Starbase platform.The contract has an Ether security deposit provided by the project’s team, and if a token purchaser wants to get a refund from the project, he can deposit the token and withdraw Ether from the contract. This put option contract can be combined with the escrow contract.The Starbase platform uses STAR tokens as a rewardable, consumable token in the Starbase ecosystem for people with investor like minds who want to support global innovations.With STAR, holders can support global innovative skyrocket projects and get revenue as ETH or as ERC20 type tokens from these projects.The are 3 types of revenue:All fees go to STAR holders, and the fee payments are executed by deposit & withdraw type smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.Starbase crowdsale plan to start between May~July 2017, and now accepting some early purchases.The Starbase platform official launch is in Q4, 2017. For more details you can check the whitepaper on Starbase’s website.Alpha Starbase: https://alpha.starbase.co/ Bounty campaign website: https://bounty.starbase.co/ STAR Early Purchase website: https://earlypurchase. starbase.co/ Crowdsale website: After STAR Early purchase reached to the goal, we’ll release around July, 2017.Presentations: http://www.slideshare.net/ StarbaseGlobal Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ StarbaseCo/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/starbaseco Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/ company/starbaseco Slack: https://starbase-community. slack.com Blog: https://blog.starbase.co/ Github: https://github.com/starbaseco###Company name: Starbase Company site: https://starbase.co Company contacts: Contact: Arthur Cabral Email: support@starbase.co, tomoaki@starbase.co"

NEM and Mijin are both important Blockchain products with their roots in Japan. Recently it has come to light in a book titled Virtual Currency and Blockchain, authored by Toshihisa Kinouchi that Makato Takemiya was an inventor of NEM and a lead in the NEM and Mijin Blockchain project. NEM has since then released a statement which explicitly states that Takemiya was not an inventor, founder or developer of NEM and Mijin.A logical question to ask would be that if Takemiya did not found NEM, then who did?When the NEM project was announced on Jan. 19, 2014 by ‘utopianfuture’ the post regarding it was very clear in who the team members were.As is clear from this link, Takemiya was not part of the founders of NEM. In messages made available to us by NEM, we have established that Takemiya asked to join NEM after Feb. 4, 2014. The request was made in the form of a private message to ‘Jaguar’.Interestingly, there is also an audio clip available online on the Let’s Talk Bitcoin Network, where Takemiya can be heard denying in his own voice at 48s that he is the founder of NEM.Why would Nikkei and Kinouchi make an incorrect claim that Takemiya founded NEM or was a lead at Mijin?Is it convenient if such claims are allowed to pass on unchallenged?Would it benefit a person in their individual capacity or an organization?In order to clarify our doubts and to give a chance to Makoto Takemiya, co-CEO of Soramitsu at present to respond himself, we asked him the question if he was the founder of NEM or a lead at Mijin. He says:“I am Makoto Takemiya, the co-CEO of Soramitsu. This present story has no relationship to our company. While I used to be involved with NEM personally, I left the project last year and have no relationship to the project whatsoever at this time. Therefore, I feel unqualified to comment.”We also talked with Lon Wong, President of NEM.io Foundation and CEO, Founder of Dragonfly about Takemiya’s role.Lon tells us, “As for the Mijin, not a single line of code was contributed by him since the launch of our project as he was already in the marketing team. There is no evidence other than private discussions where he was “drafted” into the marketing team from thereon. The only evidence is shown in the GitHub where he contributed nothing to the further development of the NEM core, and where the Mijin was premised on, here.”There are serious allegations against Takemiya, which could have potential reverberations in the future.According to Lon Wong, Takemiya told him that a Venture Capital company was to invest JPY 200 mln into Dragonfly, but that opportunity was squandered and lost to competition.Lon also tells us that Dragonfly suffered reputational damages because of Takemiya sidelining the importance of the company.Finally, Dragonfly had to withdraw from the Japanese market even though it was one of the pioneer Blockchains in that country.As for NEM Lon says that Takemiya sowed discord in the NEM core team. Lon tells us that they have had to “fight against him in the open, watching every word we had to say in the open for fear of spoiling the name of NEM and thus making it into a farce.”We were also told that Catapult was interrupted because of Takemiya due to chaos in the core team: all because of Takemiya.We asked Takemiya if he had contacted the author of the book Toshihisa Kinouchi and try to have some corrections made.In the response we received he says:“I do not know Kinouchi and was not interviewed for his book, nor was I consulted about the content. Obviously, NEM was created as a team and I was never the inventor of the project but rather just one of the members contributing to open source project and helping with Marketing. It is not good to have misinformation about me printed, so we are in contact with the publisher to try to have my name removed.”We have to ask ourselves is it too late and too little? Is NEM correct in expressing its anguish publically when its legacy is being squandered?We have to also ask why Nikkei did not fact check before they declared Takemiya to be the inventor of NEM in a book. Takemiya has been in the news lately because of his company Soramitsu’s tie-up with the Bank of Cambodia’s in order to develop a new payment infrastructure. Surely as a person of repute, he could have done more to correct misinformation about his role at NEM? We ask Lon if he was contemplating any legal action in this matter and his response was:“This is an option that we should consider. In hindsight, the damage has been significant.”"

We recently shared our excitement about Deloitte Germany becoming a sponsor and a partner at BlockShow Europe 2017 organized by Cointelegraph Events which is to come to Munich in just two days.","Cointelegraph Events is on a great mission educating and connecting people in the Blockchain industry to ensure it continues changing the world. With a partner like Deloitte Germany, Cointelegraph Events will certainly do more.Anticipating the largest international Blockchain-related event to commence, Cointelegraph had a chat with Milan Sallaba, Partner at Deloitte and Technology Sector Head, and one of the key speakers at the BlockShow Europe 2017, and Jens Hermann Paulsen, Senior Consultant and Deloitte Blockchain Institute.Sallaba and Paulsen shared their thoughts on the blockchain revolution marching across industries, and the contribution of Deloitte in its facilitation through extensive research of technology and bringing it into practice.For this very purpose Deloitte has established the Deloitte Blockchain Institute (DBI). As Paulsen explains, DBI has been consciously set up as industry- and platform-agnostic, function spanning (consulting, legal/tax, audit) center of competence for blockchain technology and is embedded in a broader EMEA and worldwide Deloitte network.Sallaba continues:“Our holistic approach enables us to not only focus on the technical capabilities of Blockchain but to also e.g. understand the legal enforceability of a use case, or to consider impact on credit ratings or to bring out the nuances in a particular business case. Our holistic approach enables us to not only focus on the technical capabilities of Blockchain but to also e.g. understand the legal enforceability of a use case, or to consider impact on credit ratings or to bring out the nuances in a particular business case. We constantly work to trigger new ideas through our point-of-views, in addition to developing proof of concepts. For our clients we develop minimum viable products (MVP) which facilitate a broader, often Board-level debate, and we also work with clients in e.g. insurance or energy sectors to integrate blockchain-based functionality into ERP-systems.”Deloitte Blockchain Institute is actively researching Blockchain technology looking for areas that could indeed be improved with Blockchain. Implementation of technology is not an easy process which often meets a huge number of challenges.For instance, adoption of public Blockchains might be hindered by regulatory hurdles, while severe security issues create obstacles on the way of integration of private Blockchain networks.We have seen examples when investors and Blockchain partnerships came to an understanding that Blockchain might be not the best solution for financial and banking systems. In Sallaba’s view, instead of focusing on efficiency improvements e.g. for the way stocks are traded globally across markets, we should initially aim smaller to reap immediate benefits, and the big use cases will follow in due course.He explains:“The issues and challenges referenced should be seen in the context of unrealistic expectations that blockchain is a silver bullet enabling massive, game-changing improvements almost instantaneously. Regardless of the industry or sector, use cases should focus on a limited scope and functionality where blockchain can make a tangible difference from the outset.”Sallaba refers to energy certificates verifying a particular renewable power source, or bonded loans, which conventionally are heavily paper based, and representing certain difficulties for banks in tracking actual ownership. Blockchain can add transparency and value in these type of examples quickly.Blockchain technology is often referred to as the “perfect bureaucrat”, having a huge potential to improve the efficiency of relations between the governments and citizens. A number of projects popped up in Estonia, Sweden, Russia and Switzerland, which embraced the value of Blockchain for upgrading government services.Sallaba told Cointelegraph:“Blockchain could offer a tremendous opportunity for governments to improve processes and to provide innovative services. We are confident we will see increasing adoption and rollout in the coming years. Digitisation facilitates direct communication between citizens and governments, and opening up access by overcoming issues around distance, opening hours, process speeds etc. “While believing that Blockchain technology might have found one more perfect niche to revolutionize, Sallaba thinks that adoption, nevertheless, will differ by countries. He continues:“Nordics/Baltics traditionally are first movers in terms of governmental digitalization and it is no surprise to see Sweden’s effort to record land titles on a blockchain. Japan just started to recognize Bitcoins as legal tender, and Switzerland has experimented with local authorities that would accept Bitcoins to pay administrative fees.”At BlockShow Europe 2017, Milan Sallaba will share company’s updates on bringing Blockchain technology into operations.There are numerous “clubs” nowadays which have been put together to research Blockchain technology. R3 suddenly fell out of love with Blockchain. Another open source collaborative effort, Hyperledger, is now working on promoting cross-industry Blockchain technologies. Certain questions arise concerning the motivation and efficiency of such efforts.Sallaba comments:“Success of ‘clubs’ or consortia depends on the setup and governance, the stated aim, and also on the degree of alignment of interests of member organisations. As we have seen with R3 / Corda, bigger is not always better, and smaller consortia may be more successful in commercializing blockchain.”Sallaba emphasizes the power of a community of interested experts in open source collaborative projects, compared to an inevitably more narrow, ‘closed’ members-only attempt. In his opinion, models such as the open-source, collaborative Hyperledger effort ultimately appear more promising when the aim is mainstream, commercial adoption.Sallaba continues:“There are some industry consortia, such as e.g. b3i (Blockchain Insurance Industry Initiative) or the recently announced TBCASprint, which have the potential to be successful provided they focus on platform elements where mutual benefits are readily evident.”Paulsen agrees:“Creating a “one-size-fits-all” consortium is indeed problematic from my perspective. Further I think working in a closed shop anticipating to create a better platform than a whole community of interested experts is unrealistic.”A community of Blockchain technology enthusiasts has already proved, and not even once, to be more flexible, open, and ready for a change, sometimes even disrupting their own industry.Inspired by a decentralized technology, the community showed that innovation really knows no borders, with regions eager to learn from each other, share knowledge and expertise. For instance, Asia seems to be a region to extract lessons from.While the global fintech is growing rapidly, the industry seems to be booming in Asia and particularly in China. Here we turn to numbers - last year Asia surpassed the US and Europe in terms of investment volume in fintech industry reaching $1,2 bln vs $900 mln in the US and $200 mln in Europe.Sallaba explains:“Asia’s financial services sector is fast-growing in general. And in China in particular, the regulatory framework is seen as comparatively flexible, nurturing Fintech activity and innovation, with investors doing their bit to drive markets higher. Investments in the US and Europe arguably have been more conservative, possibly underpinning the view that whilst the financial sector may have its fair share of problems and inefficiencies, banks as organisations are not about to vanish.”One cannot deny that Blockchain revolution is marching across industries, but how to facilitate it? Industry experts often point out the lack of talents in the sphere. Let me disagree.Recently, at Cointelegraph we ran a Blockchain Oscar, results of this awesome competition you all will see in Munich. But that’s not the point I am trying to make here. The amount of applications we have got exceeded all our expectations, so what kind of lack of talents are there?There are talents, dozens of them, they only need to be supported and guided by more experienced colleagues, who would connect them to the industries needing their innovative solutions. This is one of many purposes of various accelerating programs.Sallaba says that Deloitte is strongly emphasizing collaborative work with startups. He explains:“Deloitte does support many startups including some which specifically focus on blockchain-based industry solutions, and we have strategic partnerships with some blockchain startups and even create joint solutions. In addition, we have invested in startups (such as SETL) and we haves spun-out a part of our team to create Nucoa and continue to work closely with established programs such as nexussquared.”Nevertheless, Sallaba points, Deloitte consciously chooses not to run an accelerator specifically for blockchain startups.Sallaba and Paulsen agree:“Blockchain is not a use case in itself, of course, and evaluating whether an accelerator should e.g. focus on a technology (primarily facilitating a tech community) or an industry (emphasizing industry-specific solutions and provision of access for startups to global players) is not straightforward and provides advantages and drawbacks both ways.”The Deloitte Digital Disruptors is one example among a few focusing on supporting talented teams. With “Bridge by Deloitte” Deloitte attempts to purposefully match enterprises and startups to accelerate innovation."

mechanisms - e.g. possibilities to use Bitcoin and other 
cryptocurrencies ...","May 25, 2017","Online gambling is a rapidly growing field and the number of players worldwide is expected to almost double by 2021, as forecasted by a report from Juniper Research. The industry is developing as the number of online gambling websites is increasing with emerging new payment mechanisms - e.g. possibilities to use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for betting.","Indeed, accepting cryptocurrency so far has been the most common encounter with Blockchain systems for the traditional gambling industry. But there is so much more that Blockchain technology now allows us to do. Over the past two years, we have seen the development of new forms of gambling games - those powered by Ethereum. It now becomes possible to build a protocol that triggers a true paradigm shift in the online gambling industry - enabling new markets and new business models. In the same way the Internet enabled new markets through the removal of barriers in data transmission and exchange, decentralized systems like Ethereum enable new business models and disrupt industries through the removal of barriers to the transfer of value - it has never been possible without trusting this value to some third party.Cointelegraph had a chat with Ilya Tarutov, CEO at DAO.Casino, as he explained how to solve some of the key challenges in the gambling games industry.As Tarutov believes, systems powered by Ethereum have the potential to trigger a significant paradigm shift in many industries, including the online gambling industry, through eliminating the need to rely on third parties. There are many implications of this which all come down to decreasing the costs of operating casinos and eliminating risks of fraud. However, building individual gambling games on Ethereum doesn’t entirely solve the problem - one needs a broader approach. As explained by Tarutov, games are just the tip of the iceberg, as the gambling industry has many different actors, including game developers, referrers, casino operators, software providers that build account system management software and others.DAO.Casino suggests approaching this in a holistic manner and covering the whole gambling industry value chain - from building gambling games fair-by-design to improving mechanisms of value distribution among contributors.Tarutov elaborates:“Game outcomes are determined by equally unpredictable pseudorandom values, and anyone can audit this. Once the game software is audited and deployed, no one can fiddle with it and change it. This is not the case with traditional server-based online casinos. Games run exactly as programmed without any fraud or third party interference.”Business models deployed by online casinos have very limited flexibility and opportunities to benefit - neither for the user nor for the casino. “Currently, casinos might have business models that benefit from the fact that they can fiddle with the user account balances,” Tarutov explained. “They do not benefit from interoperability with other casinos either. But the possibility of being in control of your user account balance is now here, so traditional online casinos can either accept it and provide this, or be pushed out of the market by those who can innovate their business models and provide better service.”The last missing piece that could allow a significant paradigm shift is building a layer enabling P2P open markets. As shared by Tarutov, the integrity of data and code provided by systems such as Ethereum enables a greater degree of cooperation between industry players - casinos can list games from independent developers - as they don’t have to trust each other and whatever value a game generates is distributed automatically.DAO.Casino is building a decentralized public system for the gambling industry consisting of an automated value distribution protocol acting as a mechanism of incentives powered by Ethereum smart contracts along with a system that is capable of providing equally unpredictable pseudorandom numbers for the gamers.Thus, automating crucial elements of the online gambling industry that normally requires trust can potentially reduce the risk of fraud, minimizing overheads for casino operators, allowing higher payouts for the players and monetizing game developers’ efforts. This will eventually enable the development of new and more sustainable business models.Tarutov summed up some of the key challenges that could be eliminated with the Blockchain technology in the gaming industry.The concentration of trust and the risk of abuse of trust and corruption are relevant for any industry. Trust has long been considered to be one of the biggest concerns for online gamblers and Blockchain technology is often said to entirely remove this concept as a source of uncertainty. Tarutov believes that if it doesn’t entirely remove it, it certainly significantly minimizes the need for it.He explains:“Of course, we can’t expect every player to audit the code of the game, but when the whole system is open and transparent it is likely that an interested party, let’s say a competing game developer, can do it. Transparency and integrity of data and code enabled by Ethereum are not only a foundation for the fair-by-design games, but the fairer gambling industry at large - apart from the players no longer being cheated by a casino, all core contributors - i.e. game developers can be rewarded automatically for their work.”Transparency enabled through open source software and integrity of this software enabled by public Blockchain, in Tarutov’s opinion, is what does the trick. It can be audited by anyone at any time, providing a constant and uninterrupted recording of all data and code, bringing a great deal of honesty and fairness to the industry.Tarutov shares his view:“If the software is proprietary and runs casino’s servers, casinos can potentially do anything with it. Even in the case of strict regulations over the certification of software, there is potentially a risk of trust abuse because the lack of transparency and integrity of data and code allows a casino to cheat. You can prevent cheating by stricter regulations and more frequent checks of casinos, but if the software runs publicly, there is no temptation to cheat. On top of making it fairer, it makes security and customer protection potentially cheaper.”Gambling software that runs on a decentralized global virtual machine once audited, can be fiddled with without everyone noticing. In fact, it becomes easier for the regulators to ensure better customer protection.Although Blockchain would not solve everything, it does provide a way of building a system that is less prone to corruption and fair-by-design. In his opinion, it happens on multiple levels. For instance, on the gambling software level, casinos are not able to fiddle with the game results and with the user account balances.On the crypto economic and business level, casinos would be able to find a way to make different nodes able to cooperate. Thus, they would have to display games from independent game developers and they won’t need to trust each other.He explains:“If a player discovers a game through a specific online platform, the platform would be rewarded for discovery automatically, so the developer gets a reward as well as the casino. They can agree on the percentage, but it will be written as solidity contract on Ethereum, like an escrow. Besides, they don’t have to trust each other in order to cooperate. A casino will do their job - game discovery, platforms that players can use to discover the games. Game dev will do her job - build awesome games - and can keep the IP in the game. Normally, an independent game developer would never be able to enter a gambling games market.”What’s more that Blockchain brings to the table is the potential for interoperability.Tarutov says:“When we roll out our MVP and develop the protocol further we will be able to work with projects that are using Ethereum public or permissioned chains in the context of identity management. Right now, we just need to test everything, make sure that everything works fast and is as good as or better in terms of user experience than in a server-based old school gambling and that random generation is reliable and equally unpredictable. We are working a lot on that and implemented a very special fast PRNG that no one implemented before. Further, we are planning to collaborate with online casinos who are willing to play fair, open to innovation and competitive, and together with those projects work on identity systems to see how we can make the whole industry safer.”Tarutov points to one interesting potential feature that Blockchain technology can provide for the gambling industry apart from gambling software - it comes down to better identity systems, and gives an example:“Imagine that a regulatory authority wants to enforce age restriction for online gambling. What would you do to prove your age to the casino? Send them a copy of your passport? Apart from trusting a casino with your money, you have to also trust them with your identity, and this is ridiculous. In Europe, for example, it would be difficult in regards to data protection regulations, but people want to play gambling games anyway and they will go to casinos outside of the given jurisdiction, which can lead to other consequences. Instead, one can have a federated identity system, based on cryptographic signatures, where you can first prove your age to the authorities and then just prove it to anyone with your signature without giving your entire identity to everyone on the Internet.”Tarutov expresses a huge interest in partnering with projects working on federated identity systems to cover all aspects of the gambling industry and provide consultancy to the regulators as well.The Blockchain is an extremely powerful technology - alongside a public virtual machine, it provides a new way of communication - as it allows the transfer of value without relying on a third party. In Tarutov’s opinion, it can provide a lot of benefits and businesses, as well as regulators, are beginning to understand all the tradeoffs and advantages. The Internet itself only allows the exchange of information - and yet it still changed the way we communicate and enable new business models. But up until recently, one couldn’t transfer value over the Internet as easy as you can transfer information. This really opens up a new era of communication again. It will change not just the gambling industry.He concludes:“It will be adopted very fast because it allows people to transact P2P across the globe, which was never possible before. All parties involved should do their homework and learning takes time.”"

following the multisig ceasing to function because of Bitcoin making ...","May 17, 2017","Look at this decentralization movement gaining in scope and marching across the industries. Uberization is unstoppable and we certain about it. Data storage market is getting largely influenced by the trend as well. Cointelegraph caught up with James Prestwich, Storj Co-Founder, an open source and cloud storage platform, that can’t be censored, monitored, or have downtime. In an interview with Cointelegraph Prestwich shared his views on the ongoing trend, the place of Storj in this decentralization revolution, and some of the security concerns.","Developers are diving into exploring ways to allow sharing of computing power, hard drive space and bandwidth, it is interesting to watch this trend developing further, and Cointelegraph asked Storj where they see this trend going further.Looking at the projects trying to build a platform for computing power sharing, Prestwich emphasizes that they are taking on a difficult task.He explains:“There’s no efficient proof for arbitrary computations. This means that if you don’t trust the person performing the computation, you can’t believe the result. Some problems, like Proof of Work, Equihash, or sorting a list, have results that are much easier to check than create. But most problems are very difficult to ‘prove’ the result of. And if you’re paying someone to do work for you, you’d really rather get the right answer. So there’s a trust problem there.”While we might still be a few years away from seeing supercomputers working, distributed storage is already here.He continues:“Storj is real, and it works. Computing is likely still a few years out. You might see some application-specific tools but there’s a major breakthrough required before secure distributed computing is real. Storage is really the low-hanging fruit here. It’s expensive, necessary everywhere and easy to verify. Both Storj and Sia use auditing schemes that are fast and compact, so you can be 100 percent sure that a file is being stored: there is no trust required.”Storj is the first decentralized, end-to-end encrypted cloud storage that integrates Blockchain technology and cryptography to allow for higher security of data. It started as a platform to allow for crowdsourced P2P data storage. By decentralizing the data storage, Storj team was aiming at building a service similar to existing, but faster, cheaper, and more secure.Thus, guys are aiming at building a service that is 10 times faster and 50 percent less expensive than traditional cloud storage solutions. It can be achieved by taking advantage of parallel downloads.Prestwich explained to Cointelegraph:“Rather than getting the entire file through a single download, Storj takes a more Bittorrent-like approach. Shards of the file come in from different farmers all at once, as fast as you can download them, and the file is rebuilt on the fly. If you get 10 people delivering you shards at once, they can upload faster than you can download.”Therefore users get faster service, however, sometimes slow famers can be a bottleneck. Over time Storj has learned how to identify slow farmers and optimize shared distribution to ensure everybody gets the speed they want. For that Storj has hired a full-time data scientist who is working on this problem and is planning to add few more people to the team in the nearest future.Following numerous recent data leaks and security breaches, the question of ensuring privacy and security of the stored data inevitably come to the fore. Storing data in a decentralized fashion, how one can be sure that the devices that are used for storing data are hack-proof? Prestwich explained to Cointelegraph:“We’re not building a fortress for your data - Storj is a next-generation adaptive distributed system. Storj works whether or not the farming nodes are secure. To protect the data, it’s encrypted before it enters the network. So right away, no one can read it without that encryption key.”In the Storj platform all data is sharded before being sent out to renters of the hard drive space (or farmers) and each shard is sent to a separate node. As Prestwich explains, it is already hard enough to find all the shards, even if someone possesses the key. Redundant shards are created via a process called Reed-Solomon erasure coding, even if a few shards disappear, one can still retrieve the file and redistribute new shards. Storj is trying to make sure data is secure even if many farming nodes are compromised. Assuming that it will happen sooner or later, developers are putting systems in place now to beat it.Storj started as an open source project in 2014 and was launched with a crowd sale. Storj has designed its own token to act as a means of exchange to buy and sell space within the network. SJCX token allowed users to purchase storage and bandwidth, and get paid for renting out hard drives and bandwidth. Storj managed to raise half a million dollars through a crowd sale and kickstarted the project and launched Storj Labs Inc, a company built on top of the Storj platform to provide additional services and support. Since then the ICO industry has definitely evolved into a more established setup. Prestwich says that ICO industry has really exploded within the last few years. He explains:“We were one of the first token sales back in the day and the entire market was much smaller then. It’s fascinating to see projects with a white paper and an explainer video raising millions of dollars in such a short amount of time. We hope there will be some major successes coming out of it, but it’ll likely be awhile before any real results come in.”Since its inception, Storj has been on a mission to transform the centralized system of data storage by building a platform where no one except the owner of the data can get an access to it. Prestwich shared some of the key achievements the team accomplished in the last years:“Storj has been several years of solid research, development, trial, error, and constant work. We’re competing heads up with household names and that’s a little daunting. We’re way behind in terms of tools and brand awareness. That being said, we’ve come a long way. We designed a novel interactive storage audit protocol. We built an effective publish/subscribe system on a peer-to-peer network. We bootstrapped a distributed network to thousands of nodes, storing petabytes of data. We built a high-quality library to upload/download files in C, and used it to create a major integration (TBA soon). We built a SaaS billing platform from scratch. We published everything as free and open source software so that everyone can benefit from this work.”Developers have figured out how to make Storj content delivery work natively in browsers, they are still working on it, but it is already available to be tested. Beside that Storj has partnered with Microsoft Azure and Heroku to deploy Storj development tools. Prestwich shared that the team will be expanding these tools over time, as well as bringing new partnerships and integrations to new platforms.At the moment, they are adding certificate generation automation for farmers, to make it work over TLS, and designing new and expanding existing platform tools.Prestwich explained:“We’re years behind the rest of the object storage world and we’ll be cranking out tools to catch up. More libraries in more languages. More interfaces. More management options. Ethereum migration and related smart contracts. We have plans and initial dev work done on some awesome smart contracts to enhance Storj’s functionality.”Prestwich shared that over the past couple of months there have been numerous discussions within the Storj team and community about the Counterparty platform. A few important aspects came to the fore, including the need to significantly update the official Counterparty wallet software, a significant increase in the transaction processing times due to issues with backlogs in Bitcoin Blockchain and increase in the transaction fees. Additionally, there has been uncertainty over the future of other features following the multisig ceasing to function because of Bitcoin making multisig transactions non-standard, a decision to migrate the token powering the Storj platform from Counterparty to the Ethereum ERC20 token standard.As Prestwich shared with Cointelegraph, the use of an Ethereum-based token offers clear solutions to some of the problems:“Development is extremely active. Features are added regularly and bugs are dealt with quickly. Ethereum transactions are usually confirmed in seconds to minutes, while Ethereum fees are currently negligible. The ERC20 standard provides out-of-the-box interoperability with a wide variety of wallets and tools. Ethereum’s smart contract platform can be leveraged to build a more robust and decentralized storage system, opening exciting opportunities to provide data services to smart contracts and Dapps. As a result, we will be migrating SJCX to a new Ethereum-based ERC20 token that we feel better serves the Storj ecosystem and its stakeholders.”Storj is about to embark on a token sale to spread awareness of the project, expand the ecosystem and distribute the tokens people need to interact with the platform. As explained by Prestwich the proceeds of the sale will go a long way to helping Storj realize their vision of an open, accessible, distributed storage system. For more details about the upcoming token sale, please visit Storj web page.In the current Blockchain revolution, opinions are largely divided. Some think that Blockchain technology is being overhyped, while others believe that it is actually underhyped and the actual impact of it will be much greater than we can imagine. Prestwich explained to Cointelegraph:“We have some complicated feelings about this. We’re all fascinated by Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other Blockchains, and we’re building something incredible with them. That being said, here’s our advice for people thinking about using a Blockchain: Try very very hard not to. Blockchains are expensive, inefficient, and hard to scale. Blockchains are brand new, so there’s no technical, legal or financial roadmap. Everyone is still trying to figure out what they’re good at, and there will be a lot of projects that fail because they used a Blockchain when they didn’t need one.”Storj has limited their use of Blockchains to things they think they’re good at payments between machines, provable computing, trustless interaction. The team has focused on building a distributed system, and Blockchains are just a tool helping to achieve that. He continues:“We think that Blockchains will change the world. Everyone says they cut out the middleman, well, we’re going to realize that in these technical and financial systems humans are mostly just middlemen moving information around. They open the doors to a new generation of machine-to-machine transactions. Entire automated marketplaces trading without human intervention. It’s a long road to get there. And it will be a transition made in fits and starts. But it’s inevitable.”There is also an opinion that wider adoption of Blockchain technology is often hindered by its being too difficult to understand. But do we need to understand how the technology works to get how and why it is so beneficial? Prestwich shared his opinion:“One of the well-known things about cryptography is that you should never write your own encryption algorithm. It’s complex and easy to make a subtle mistake. Mathematicians make cryptographic libraries. Developers use those libraries without understanding them to serve users. Blockchains are the same way. A highly specialized group can make tools that developers use to serve users. Most developers will never need to understand this technology.”At the end of the day, all technology works this way - plumbing, electricity, physics, marketing - we can get all the benefits without users ever knowing it exists."
