","The abrupt bitcoin price rally was largely put down to the escalating U.S. China trade war that's being stoked by president Donald Trump and yesterday caused China's yuan currency to weaken to its lowest point in more than a decade, prompting Trump to label Beijing a currency manipulator—but new data suggests there could be more to the latest bitcoin bull run. The bitcoin price has been climbing most of this year as some of the world's biggest companies take ... [+] an interest in bitcoin, crypto and blockchain technology. Many cryptocurrency experts and analysts were quick to suggest that bitcoin's rise in tandem with the fall in the yuan means it's becoming a safe haven asset, despite its extreme volatility and no one being able to accurately predict what bitcoin will do next. However, it would appear the bitcoin price suddenly soared last night before China announced an increase to the yuan’s reference rate, with analysis of trade volume data by The Block, a bitcoin and cryptocurrency industry website, finding the catalyst was unusually high bitcoin volume on Binance, the world's largest bitcoin and crypto exchange.Bitcoin, despite being the most widely-traded cryptocurrency with volumes into the billions of dollars every day, still struggles with wild price swings due to so-called market whales moving large volumes of bitcoin at above or below the current market value.When this happens it can cause the market to suddenly and unexpected move in one direction, often to soon return to where it was trading previously.Some closely-watched bitcoin and crypto analysts were unconvinced the rapid rise in the bitcoin price was solely due to the falling yuan. ""Some people have gone so far as to say that the rally we had in bitcoin is a direct result of the falling yuan,"" Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at brokerage eToro, wrote in a note to clients. ""Due to the anonymous nature of bitcoin, it's extremely difficult to tell exactly where the demand is coming from. The supply factors, of course, have not changed by much.""Meanwhile, there are a number of other triggers that could have pushed the bitcoin price higher over the short term. Over the weekend, litecoin, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, halved its block reward for miners, reducing the number of litecoin tokens miners receive from 25 to 12.5.These so-called halvening events have come to be seen as a positive for cryptocurrency prices as they put a squeeze on demand, with litecoin up some 300% over the first half of this year.Bitcoin itself is due to undergo a halvening in May 2020, where the bitcoin reward to miners will fall to 6.25, from 12.5 currently. The bitcoin price has been climbing steadily over the last week, with last night's brief surge ... [+] happening shortly before the People's Bank of China announced an increase to the yuan reference rate, sending its currency sharply lower. Elsewhere, it is looking more likely the U.K. could leave the European Union without a trade agreement in place come October 31, its scheduled date to formerly quit the bloc, putting significant pressure on the pound and sending it to below $1.21 for the first time since January 2017.""Of course, [the falling yuan] is one possible explanation, but so is Brexit for that matter,"" added Greenspan. ""The possibility of a no-deal Brexit could very well have people hedging themselves against the potential of another large leg down for the pound sterling.""U.S. retail giant Walmart is also reportedly looking to develop its own cryptocurrency, with some speculating that the one-time world's largest retailer could be looking to compete with Facebook's beleaguered libra project—something that many believe to be behind bitcoin's rally so far this year.

""As we see financial institutions move more into the world of crypto, it is important that ordinary investors can take advantage of these technological developments, which is why we're excited to be adding coins like tezos to eToro,"" said eToro co-founder and chief executive, Yoni Assia.The latest positive developments for tezos follows a number of high profile wins for the smart contract and security token focused blockchain, which supports the XTZ cryptocurrency, following its rocky but successful 2017 fundraising initial coin offering (ICO).""[Tezos] seems like a really cool blockchain,"" eToro's senior market analyst Mati Greenspan wrote in a note to clients following the addition of tezos to eToro.The tezos ICO raised a record-breaking $232 million, though it wasn't without its hurdles, with Greenspan describing it as ""shrouded with controversy and plenty of drama.""Tezos came close to collapse in late 2017 due to dispute between tezos’ two young founders– Arthur and Kathleen Breitman–and Johann Gevers, the president of a Swiss foundation the couple helped establish to handle the ICO and promote and develop the tezos computer network, it was reported by Reuters at the time.In June, major Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual announced plans to shift its security token offerings onto the tezos blockchain, while investment platform Dalma Capital is also planning to use tezos to tokenize a variety of assets from real estate, equity, and lending, to sports clubs.The tezos price has risen 21% over the last month adding to its already strong gains for the year ...

""We see tezos as one of the critical protocols for the burgeoning security token market, and look forward to securing future deal flow on the tezos blockchain,"" said Zachary Cefaratti, Dalma Capital chief executive.Meanwhile, Tezos hired a former PwC executive as the company’s CFO in June.Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investor Tim Draper has also talked up tezos, calling recent developments ""exciting"" and saying: ""We are believers in the tezos project and see a strong use case for security tokens."""

""It is technically true that cryptocurrencies have no ‘intrinsic value’ when compared to share ownership in actual companies, however there are many examples where a marketplace bestows value on an intangible asset,"" Jon Ostler, of comparison site Finder.com, told the U.K.'s Telegraph newspaper.

[+] Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago on June 04, 2019 in Chicago, Illinois. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)","A new report from digital asset research firm Delphi Digital describes current trends in the global economy that could lead to a “perfect storm” for the Bitcoin price. Notably, Delphi Digital’s May Bitcoin Outlook report indicated a return of a bull market in Bitcoin right before the price more than doubled over the next two months.According to this latest report from Delphi Digital, factors such as monetary easing and the potential for an economic downturn in the near future have made the “digital gold” narrative around Bitcoin more relevant than ever. However, it’s also unknown exactly what would happen with the Bitcoin price if a global recession were to occur.This new Delphi Digital report follows a claim from Pantera CEO Dan Morehead that there’s a “good shot” the Bitcoin price will reach $42,000 in 2019.Monetary EasingMonetary easing is discussed in the report as perhaps the most important macroeconomic factor that will affect the Bitcoin price.“First, and arguably most important, sentiment from global central banks took a drastic turn towards more dovish monetary policies,” says the report. “The Fed, ECB, BOJ, PBOC, and many others are now preparing market participants for more rate cuts and additional stimulus measures as they attempt to keep the current economic expansion going.”Rationales for monetary easing listed in the report include: the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China, risks related to a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, and tepid GDP growth in Germany.“The rising risk of currency devaluation, especially among reserve currencies, is a longer-term catalyst that should propel BTC higher along with gold,” claims the report.During his time in office, U.S. President Donald Trump has been strongly pushing for a devaluation of the U.S. dollar, among other policies that help illustrate Bitcoin’s value and utility.An Inevitable Economic SlowdownAccording to the Delphi Digital report, there are also indications that a global economic slowdown could be around the corner, which would create a greater incentive for central banks to lower interest rates and use other forms of economic stimulus.“The global slowdown everyone feared was on the horizon has begun to show up in the economic data as well,” says the report. “Global PMIs, GDP growth forecasts, and inflation expectations are all trending lower, which helps support the case for looser monetary policy. Increased stimulus measures are likely to get more extreme this time around given the already low starting point for short-term interest rates.”As the report points out, the New York Fed’s own data puts the chances of a recession in the United States within the next twelve months at roughly 30%. This is the highest probability measured by the New York Fed in more than a decade.According to Delphi Digital, Bitcoin’s positive price performance in 2019 has been due to the prospect of the crypto asset acting as a “digital gold” in a situation where the world’s major fiat currencies are further devalued during an economic downturn.“A key reason behind Bitcoin’s outperformance in recent months is the strengthening narrative around its value proposition as ‘digital gold,’” says the report. “The macro backdrop that’s emerging is the perfect storm for Bitcoin to thrive as it has the potential to benefit from both secular and cyclical trends in the coming years.”Although the report notes that the U.S. dollar may not weaken over the short term, Delphi Digital does see the continually rising national debt as a key indicator to watch in the coming years.“[The] idea that we can keep digging a deeper debt hole with no end in sight is naive in my view,” says the report. “If foreign holders of U.S. treasuries lose faith in the viability of repayment, then sentiment towards the dollar will shift drastically. This is not going to happen overnight, but the gradual shift away from the dollar as the global reserve currency is a long-term threat to its strength. Look no further than the recent Congressional hearings on Libra to see why policymakers are so intent on keeping the status quo when it comes to the dollar's influence.”While some have argued that a ban on Bitcoin could prevent it from acting as a hedge against a potential devaluation of the U.S. dollar, multiple members of Congress have made it known that they don’t think they would be able to implement such a policy.Bitcoin or Gold?While gold has been known to act as a safe haven asset in the past, questions remain as to how Bitcoin would perform during a recession.“Bitcoin was forged in the depths of the Great Recession over a decade ago and, therefore, lacks historical precedent,” notes the report from Delphi Digital.That said, the report also indicates that the relatively small size of the Bitcoin market could make it an attractive option for investors looking for larger returns.“Longer-term, we are strong proponents of the ‘digital gold’ narrative for Bitcoin that continues to gain relevance amid extreme monetary policies and rising geopolitical tensions,” says the report. “However, the relative size of Bitcoin’s market value compared to the investible gold market, for example, makes it a tempting opportunity for investors starving for assets with above-average growth potential as well.”The report adds that the total investible Bitcoin market may eventually grow even larger than the investible gold market over time.“There are only a handful of assets that largely sit outside the purview of any single government, so the demand for such non-sovereign assets could be even greater in the decades to come depending on how the effects of unconventional monetary policy shake out,” says the report.Blockchain Capital’s Spencer Bogart also recently noted that Bitcoin’s potential for disruption is much larger than the $8 trillion worth of gold in the world during an interview with Bloomberg."

","The bitcoin price, which began the year at under $4,000 per bitcoin, has soared to over $10,000 in just a few months, pushing bitcoin and cryptocurrencies back into the limelight after a disastrous 2018. Now, Apple, amid plans to diversify away from its ailing iPhone cash cow, has said its closely-watched new credit card will not allow users to purchase bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies when it launches next month. Interest in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies from the likes of iPhone-maker Apple have this year caused ... [+] the bitcoin price to soar. Apple revealed that users of its credit card, which is being developed in partnership with Wall Street's Goldman Sachs, will not be permitted to purchase bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in a user agreement posted to Goldman's website, adding the card also cannot be used to purchase cash advances or cash equivalents, including casino gaming chips, race track wagers, or lottery tickets.Apple's credit card, announced earlier this year, garnered a lukewarm reception, with some branding Apple's approach as lacking innovation. Apple has so far taken a cautious approach in its early forays into finance, putting into contrast the plans of Facebook, which is planning to launch its own bitcoin-rival some time next year, and Twitter, whose chief executive Jack Dorsey recently declared his love for bitcoin. However, the pressure is on for Apple, revealing in its latest quarter that it took in less than half its revenue from sales of its iPhone smartphone, the longtime cash and profit driver for the company—with iPhone revenues down some 12% between April and June.This is not the first time Apple, which is now battling with computing giant Microsoft and Jeff Bezos' Amazon for the title of world's most valuable company, has struggled with the concept of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, having banned crypto mining apps from its App Store in early 2018. The bitcoin price, after climbing earlier this year in response to tech company interest, hit a brick wall last month after global regulators poured water on Facebook's plans for its libra cryptocurrency and with Apple seemingly trying to keep bitcoin and crypto at arms length, fears are likely to emerge Silicon Valley's interest in crypto could be overblown. The bitcoin price has risen by over 200% so far this year but remains far from its all-time highs of ... [+] almost $20,000 per bitcoin set in late 2017. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs is still trying to get its head around bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, after David Solomon took over as chief executive last October. Solomon, who previously said the New York investment bank was looking to add bitcoin and cryptocurrency services to its portfolio, has swung away from decentralized tokens and appears more interested in so-called stablecoins.Apple's bitcoin and cryptocurrency buying ban is, however, far from unusual, with U.S. high street banks JP Morgan Chase and Citi prohibiting their customers from purchasing crypto due to fears volatile prices could leave them heavily in debt.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)","Note: This is a follow-up post to a previous article that covered three of U.S. President Trump’s policies and talking points that are good for the Bitcoin price and general awareness of this technology.Donald Trump’s time as U.S. president has been filled with events and talking points that illustrate the utility a digital, apolitical money like Bitcoin.While the precursor to this post covered Trump’s policies and talking points that have been beneficial for the Bitcoin price, this post will cover Bitcoin-related events that directly involve the president in one way or another.Most recently, Trump tweeted about his dislike for Bitcoin, but it appears members of Congress are now realizing they wouldn’t be able to implement a ban on the crypto asset.Every time there is a major event that involves Bitcoin in some way, it’s another chance for more people to learn about the value of the peer-to-peer digital cash system.1. Trump and RussiaThe Democratic National Committee (DNC) was hacked during the 2016 election cycle, allegedly at the hands of hackers associated with a branch of Russian intelligence. Email records that were a part of the hack were eventually published by WikiLeaks, which has a long and storied history with Bitcoin.The DNC emails revealed a preference for Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders amongst the leaders of the DNC. One obvious beneficiary of all of this was Donald Trump, as the contents of the emails fed into his “Crooked Hillary” narrative.The U.S. Department of Justice eventually revealed a Bitcoin connection to the DNC hack in the form of an allegation that the Russian government used the digital currency to fund some of its activities related to the attack. Specifically, a Russian hacking team is said to have used Bitcoin to make payments related to the operation, in addition to mining the cryptocurrency.As a side note, NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has also said he used Bitcoin to pay for servers as he was providing documents to journalists back in 2013.There was also the story of Jared Kushner, Trump’s senior advisor and son-in-law, receiving an email threatening to release the president’s tax returns unless a ransom of 52 Bitcoin was paid. The sender of the email was impersonating the hacker or hackers behind the DNC hack.2. Cambridge AnalyticaDuring the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the Trump campaign worked with political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, which is most well-known as the company that was able to gain access to the personal data of millions of American Facebook users without their consent. Last year, executives at the company were caught bragging about coming up with the “Crooked Hillary” campaign during Trump’s run for the presidency.The whole Cambridge Analytica scandal has made the general public more conscious about how much of their personal data is accessible to governments and corporations via the internet. Much like limiting what sort of data is put in the hands of Google, Facebook, and other tech giants, part of Bitcoin’s selling point is limiting the level of access and control large institutions have over one’s finances.In other words, more interest in online privacy and protecting personal data is good for Bitcoin.As an added bonus, former Cambridge Analytica executive Brittany Kaiser revealed that she once donated to Wikileaks via Bitcoin in the new Netflix documentary The Great Hack.3. Darknet Market CrackdownsA third incident that connects Trump with Bitcoin is his focus on shutting down various darknet markets. According to former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, President Trump ordered various law enforcement agencies to go after “internet transnational criminal organizations” like AlphaBay and Hansa.Much like Senator Charles Schumer’s public outrage over Bitcoin and Silk Road back in 2011, these sorts of media spotlights on the darknet markets tend to bring more attention to the fact that people can get drugs delivered to their homes at the click of a button — almost as easily as ordering normal items from Amazon.Indeed, the data shows that darknet market activity has continued to grow since the AlphaBay and Hansa shutdowns in 2017.Whether it’s Russia’s election meddling and darknet market crackdowns illustrating Bitcoin’s utility or the Cambridge Analytica scandal simply making internet users think more deeply about their online activities, President Trump has found himself connected to some of the biggest Bitcoin-related stories over the past few years.And as Trump’s own book The Art of the Deal claims, bad publicity is sometimes better than no publicity at all."

(PIERRE TEYSSOT/AFP/Getty Images)","Over the past few years, the use of Bitcoin for payments has taken a backseat to the increased focus on the digital asset’s use as a store of value. However, the payments use case is now making a comeback thanks to the development of the Lightning Network, which is a secondary protocol layer that enables cheaper, instant transfers for Bitcoin users.Apps like Bitrefill and Fold, which both help people spend their Bitcoin at major retailers, have integrated the Lightning Network in an effort to create a more user-friendly and cost-effective experience for their users. Additionally, the relatively new startup Lolli has a master plan for eventually taking Bitcoin payments mainstream.Longhash recently covered the general resurgence of payments-focused Bitcoin startups powered by the Lightning Network.While the Lightning Network is improving the Bitcoin payments experience from a technical perspective, a serious regulatory hurdle remains for the cryptocurrency in terms of how it is taxed.Bitcoin’s Tax IssueIn the United States and many other countries, Bitcoin payments are treated as taxable events. In other words, Bitcoin users should be tracking the capital gains they accrue when they buy something with the cryptocurrency. From a tax perspective, a Bitcoin payment is treated the same as a sale of one’s Bitcoin holdings.Technically, this policy applies to everything from the purchase of a house to buying a coffee in the morning on the way to work.How Serious is This Issue?But how serious is this tax issue? After all, part of the cypherpunk philosophy behind Bitcoin is that the rules and regulations of the traditional financial world do not apply to this new digital cash system.The seriousness of the tax problem was debated by Bitrefill CEO Sergej Kotliar and ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees during a panel discussion at the Bitcoin 2019 conference in San Francisco.For Voorhees, the tax implications of making Bitcoin payments are too much of a burden for many potential cryptocurrency users.“An average person on the street that wants to buy something for $20 with Bitcoin, they’re not going to care if they’re not reporting taxes on that. Those types of people, in terms of spending power, represent a very tiny amount. The actual [majority] of spending power generally comes from people, by definition, with more money. Those people tend to, by definition, care more about tax consequences,” explained Voorhees.The ShapeShift CEO went on to note that the tax burden associated with using Bitcoin for everyday payments overshadows the potential benefits of using the peer-to-peer digital cash system.“Even if they’re totally cool with the volatility, even if they totally understand the technology, even if they’re okay with a $5 fee on a $50 transaction — having to spend a while reporting that and tracking that and the risk of not tracking that correctly actually becomes the real cost,” said Voorhees.While Kotliar admitted that Voorhees brought up a fair point, he also added that there are plenty of people who would take their Bitcoin payments as an opportunity to make a political statement of sorts.“If you want to change a certain regulation, it helps doing things that will make an attacking regulator look silly. So, if the government goes after everybody who buys a cup of coffee for $5 [with Bitcoin], they’re going to look silly,” said Kotliar.Kotliar then clarified that he was not saying everyone should go out and use Bitcoin to avoid taxes. Instead, this is more about making regulators’ jobs difficult.Voorhees responded by pointing out that, while everyone at the Bitcoin conference would understand the point of using Bitcoin to make a political statement, the average person simply does not care about this sort of thing.“If you combine making a risky political statement with your payment versus just pulling out your credit card, they’re always going to choose the latter,” said Voorhees.Kotliar responded by saying Bitcoin payments can be a useful alternative for traders who would rather sell their Bitcoin in a manner that is not closely tracked and reported, as is the case with exchanges.“For us at Bitrefill, we don’t see the credit card as the competitor. We see the exchange [as the competitor]. If you’re going to dump [your Bitcon], then dump on Bitrefill instead,” said Kotliar.At this point, Voorhees concluded this part of the panel discussion by pointing out the increased mental burden of tracking the tax implications of every Bitcoin payment rather than simply dealing with the tax obligations of one large sell order on an exchange.Coin Center is Pushing for a SolutionDuring the discussion at Bitcoin 2019, Voorhees also pointed out that this tax issue is not something that can be solved via technical means, although perhaps some Bitcoin wallets could make the problem much more manageable. Instead, the issue around taxes on Bitcoin payments needs to be solved at a policy level.Coin Center has pushed for legislation in the U.S. that would exempt Bitcoin payments of up to $600 from capital gains taxes. This would effectively provide Bitcoin with the same tax treatment as foreign currencies like the euro and the Chinese yuan.Kotliar also pointed out that Facebook’s lawyers may be helpful in pushing this sort of legislation forward now that they have skin in the game via their Libra cryptocurrency project. This was just one of the roundabout ways Bitcoin could benefit from Libra that was covered at Bitcoin 2019.Although U.S. lawmakers are realizing they won’t be able to implement an outright ban on Bitcoin, they can certainly slow down its progress by not changing the tax policy around Bitcoin payments. That said, there will likely still be plenty of Bitcoin users who simply ignore this tax requirement."

In: ...","Aug 8, 2019,12:46am EDT","Bitcoin recently joined the ranks of safe haven assets, according to Chris Reinertsen, Chief Marketing Officer of Rhythm Technologies.","Safe haven assets are assets where investors park their cash at time of rising global uncertainties, as they flee risky assets like stocks.Traditionally, US Treasuries, gold, and the Swiss Franc have been considered  safe haven assets. And more recently, so has Bitcoin.At least, that’s what seems to have been the case in recent weeks as the US-China trade war raised global uncertainties, says Reinertsen.  “The devaluation of China’s yuan has just hit an 11-year low against the dollar,” he says.  “There is a flight of capital to safe-haven assets across the board, which now includes Bitcoin. Throughout the last few years, we have been seeing the trend of Bitcoin increasingly becoming fundamentally correlated to more macro moves as increased economic uncertainty in the world increases.”Safe-haven asset performance as of 8/5/2019Kirill Bensonoff, CEO of OpenLTV, agrees. “I believe that Bitcoin is becoming a ""safe haven"" asset similar to gold,” says Bensonoff. “While the correlation has not been fully established yet, we saw a major market downturn yesterday, while Bitcoin rallied. I believe we are going to see more capital flight to Bitcoin in the near future.”Still, not everyone thinks that the buying into Bitcoin following the yuan devaluation against the dollar is a prudent investment strategy. Keith Hilden, Founder of Relex Capital, is one of them. Hilden thinks that the recent spike in Bitcoin prices is rather an act of speculation, as markets try to find their equilibrium point.  “The recent devaluation by China's PBOC has shown the willingness to act in order to normalize external economic pressures impacting its economy, yet the tremors of such a forex move was felt in equity and currency markets around the world-- with the coming aftershocks yet to have occurred,” he says. “Economic energy expended by way of markets looking to regain back a sense of equilibrium is not harnessed, and instead lost to speculation, causing even more economic turmoil in the process until normalization is again achieved.”Regardless of recent analyst opinions, conservative investors should be very cautious in pouring money into a “store of value” with an enormous volatility like Bitcoin."

Bitcoin is the trade of the week and given the massive uncertainty and the risk-off attitude,  I think it is highly likely that Bitcoin could easily top this year’s high of $14,000 . The Bitcoin price had several battles with the 50-day moving average during the past few weeks, but finally, the bulls have conquered this battlefield.","Photocredit: GettyBitcoin chart showing important levels of support and its battle with the 50-day simple moving... [+] average.There is no doubt in mind that the Bitcoin price is going to break this year’s high.Bulls need to thank Donald Trump for this move because it is completely driven by the geopolitical tensions. Donald Trump introduced new tariffs on China last week and I talked about the retaliation action by Beijing. China has unleashed its nuclear weapon on the U.S. This retaliation has come in the form of China introducing the most fearful factor for the markets, a currency war.The Chinese Yuan crossed the level of $7 for the first time and this is only because China clearly wants to devalue its currency. Donald Trump will have no choice but to retaliate against this action. After all, it is an ego issue for him. This means that he is going to do everything in his power to not let Beijing win this war.Simply put, the escalation in the currency war means that the Fed will have to adopt an ultra-dovish monetary policy. The odds for another interest rate cut have jumped, and the only direction for the dollar index is to the downside. We all know what this means for Bitcoin; it is going to explode and continue to move higher.Another reason that I think the Bitcoin price is likely to go beyond this year's high is because Warren Buffett has increased his cash pile to an eye-popping level. What does this mean? Well, an investor like him will only increase his cash position if he believes that the equity market is out of whack.In my previous note, I did say that the bulls need to run for the hills and now given that Warren Buffet has already done that,  I strongly believe that the trend for the equity markets in the coming weeks is going to be a bearish one.The benchmark index for the equity markets, S&P 500, has already retraced nearly 3.37% from its recent high of 3,027 (reached on July 26) and given the current uncertainty in the markets, I believe that this index can go down as much as another 7%.To conclude, this leaves only a few options to traders: draw blood out of the equity markets by going short, fuel the gold rally which has crossed $1,460 today, show their love for the volatility index (VStoxx is up over 35% today) and seek shelter under Bitcoin’s umbrella. "

Vinnik headed BTC-e, an exchange that was indicted by a U.S. court in 2017 and now faces a $110 million civil suit.","Last month, acting director of the United States Financial Crime Enforcement Network Jamal El-Hindi filed a $110 million civil case against Russian national Alexander Vinnick and BTCe, a cryptocurrency exchange he ran that allegedly served 700,000 customers around the world without taking necessary steps to prevent money laundering. Just days before, New Jersey attorney general Gurbir Grewal filed paperwork in his state’s superior court alleging that ethereum startup Pocketinns violated the state’s uniform securities laws when it raised $410,000 to build decentralized marketplaces to compete with Uber, Airbnb and Amazon.In spite of being in wildly different jurisdictions, the cases are among more than 250 that can now be found on the newly launched Blockchain Litigation Database (BLD), created by the New York-based financial law firm Murphy & McGonigle to bring cryptocurrency cases from different jurisdictions into a single, searchable location. To capitalize on the precedent these early cases could set for its current clients and others, the law firm, which represents banks including Capital One and Morgan Stanley and cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase and Bittrex, charges $5,000 to access the technology and $2,500 a month on an ongoing basis.Law firms are increasingly becoming involved in the development of technology, each racing to attract and hold onto highly technical, highly lucrative blockchain and cryptocurrency clients. What results is a new kind of law firm that looks as much like a fintech startup as a legal outlet, according to Daniel Payne, a partner at Murphy & McGonigle and the founder of its 12-person blockchain practice. “It’s been extremely helpful in giving us added credibility when we market to blockchain-related clients,” says Payne. “We’ve probably used the database on at least a dozen pitches.”The court cases tracked in the database go back to the very first case on record, filed in November 2011, involving the United States versus Theresa Tetley, known as the “bitcoin maven,” who was eventually sentenced to a year in prison for money laundering. In addition to such early, little-known court cases, the search engine includes court documents on higher-profile convictions like that of Ross Ulbricht, the mastermind behind the Silk Road black market, and ongoing cases like one involving the disappearance of $850 million from Bitfinex, a cryptocurrency exchange that allegedly hid its losses using another cryptocurrency it had the power to create. Data tracked by the BLD includes total cases, annual trends, whether a case is criminal or civil, whether the case involves oversight by the SEC or the CFTC, and the ability to search for terms that might relate to other pending or potential cases. A review of the BLD’s first full year in action that Murphy & McGonigle sent to its clients showed that about 150 cases, representing more than half of all cases related to cryptocurrency and blockchain, were filed in 2018, following the market-wide collapse of the price of cryptocurrency and a clampdown by the SEC on companies that raised capital by selling digital tokens issued on ethereum and other blockchains. Of the cases filed last year, nearly half involved alleged violations of federal securities laws, according to the search engine, with 23 being filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Murphy & McGoniglePayne says other notable trends discoverable by the search engine include that the Southern District of New York is, not surprisingly, the most active jurisdiction in the country, followed, surprisingly, by the Middle District of Florida, where a single law firm is filing a disproportionate number of cases. Following a peak in 2018, the number of cases filed this year has decreased, but are still on pace to be higher than 2017. “We are seeing an uptick over time,” Payne says.The history of the BLD goes back to 2008, when rotten mortgage-backed securities triggered the global financial crisis. At the time, Murphy & McGonigle compiled a database of 700 securities to help clients whose mortgages were included in those assets track their exposure, in case anything went wrong. By January 2018, weeks after bitcoin hit its all-time high of $19,800, the law firm realized the lessons it had learned from mortgage-backed securities could be applied to cryptocurrencies. “We felt like there was going to be another wave of litigation not all that dissimilar from the wave of mortgage-backed securities litigation,” says Payne.The database is part of a larger trend of even bigger law firms seeking to serve clients in the fast-changing world of cryptocurrency by assuming the guise of tech startups. Linklaters, the 12th-largest law firm in the world, with over $2 billion revenue last year, according to data from research firm ALM, founded Nakhoda, which operates like a stand-alone tech startup within the firm, to explore how blockchain could be used to automate legal procedures, and invested in capital markets startup Nivaura, using blockchain as a settlement method. Washington D.C.-based Steptoe & Johnson, which generated $382 million revenue last year, has a 30-person blockchain practice and helped found the nonprofit Blockchain Alliance. Law firm BlankRome, also in D.C., with $443 million revenue last year, helps clients write blockchain code that complies with regulations.In total, 694 lawyers working at the 200 largest law firms in the United States based on revenue include either “blockchain” or “cryptocurrency” in their bio, according to data provided to Forbes from ALM, the research firm behind the AmLaw 200 list. While the average revenue per lawyer on the list is $906,000, the vice president of ALM legal intelligence, Patrick Fuller says lawyers practicing in blockchain and cryptocurrency can charge a premium and may surpass $1.5 million revenue per year. That means lawyers who practice blockchain in the 200 largest law firms in the U.S. may bring in between $628 million and $1.04 billion annually. While blockchain lawyers represent only about 0.53% of the lawyers tracked on the AmLaw 200 list, the growth is remarkable in that it only started in 2016, according to Fuller, who oversees research for the list. Fuller says the rapid growth is largely due to the entirely new fields of legal study the technology generates, from new ways to raise capital and to exit, to entirely new regulations. Washington, D.C.-based blockchain advocacy group Value Technology Foundation has identified at least 20 bills related to blockchain and cryptocurrency currently passing through various U.S. Congressional offices.“Blockchain is not a gimmick,” says Fuller, who is also a fellow at the College of Law Practice Management in Wisconsin. “In fact, it’s one of the things that keeps creating demand.”Perhaps no one exemplifies this demand more than Lewis Cohen, who last year left his job as a partner at Hogan Lovells, the ninth-largest firm on American Lawyer’s list of the largest firms in the world, which generated $2.1 billion revenue in 2018. Cohen is now the cofounder of DLx Law, a crypto-first firm in New York that accepts cryptocurrency as payment and eschews more traditional law firm titles that he believes go against the spirit of blockchain. “I am not sure how many other law firms are comfortable doing this,” says Cohen. “It is a relatively modest accommodation, though.  The other guys should jump in—the water is warm.”"

That’s why they have become the new consumer craze among younger generations, who are the  most sensitive to these problems.As has been the case with previous consumer crazes, vegan products have fueled an investor frenzy on Wall Street for publicly traded companies that stand to profit from this trend, like Beyond Meat.And that’s what has happened with Bitcoin, a digital product which to some holds the promise of saving the world from the tyranny of big governments.""Bitcoin and Beyond Meat have one thing in common: their meteoric surge has been fueled by investor frenzy to make quick gains without fully understanding the risks involved,” says Haris Anwar, analyst at financial markets platform Investing.com.“There is no doubt that Beyond Meat has a great product in a growing market for vegan products, but investors should remember that the company isn’t yet profitable and it will soon face growing competition.

However, when it comes to regulators around the world, there is a certain fixation on the privacy aspect of cryptocurrency. While it is important that everyday people are able to maintain their personal and financial privacy, anonymous transactions have the potential to facilitate money laundering. So in order to address this issue, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) put forth a new regulation in June designed to break the privacy of cryptocurrency. This regulation is called the ""travel rule”. A quick background on the FATF: it is a group of 37 member countries with the purpose of setting international anti-money laundering standards. It is essentially the United Nations for fighting financial crimes. While regulations put forth by the FATF are not law, the member states are obliged to turn FATF regulatory suggestions into locally enforceable regulation.So what is the travel rule? It requires all financial institutions to identify both the sending party and the receiving party within a payment transaction equal to or greater than $3,000.It turns out that this already happens within today's traditional financial systems when conducting bank transfers. However, accomplishing this directly within the Bitcoin is close to impossible. There is a technique to embed text data by converting the data into a wallet address and sending that address a small amount of funds. However, this would be giving away private consumer data publicly with no way to remove it, forever. Even if it can be figured out technologically, there are many other non-technical questions. Will bitcoin custodians or exchanges be able to send directly to user wallets in amounts above $3000? If they can, how would they be able to confirm the recipient? Will exchanges only be allowed to send funds above $3,000 to whitelisted addresses? What happens when an exchange or wallet receives funds from an outside source above $3,000?I decided to speak with Neal Reiter, Direct of Product Management of Identity Mind, a leader in international KYC and transaction monitoring industry, and Juan Llanos, a compliance professional for over 17 years to many startups and previous regulatory technology lead at ConsenSys to learn more about the travel rule and how it might affect the industry.Neal ReiterThe Travel Rule states that financial institutions, including virtual currency exchanges, pass specific customer information to the next financial institution. According to Reiter, if an individual wants to transfer bitcoin from their exchange account to an address outside of their platform, the exchange must also send seven different pieces of information: the sender's name, the sender's account number, the sender's address, the sender's financial institution's name, the amount, the date, and the beneficiary's financial institution's name.Reiter added that these new regulations would make it nearly impossible for crypto currency – a fledgling industry – to comply. When I asked how likely the rule will be applied in the United States, he said:These new regulations were passed under the final days of the US leadership, meaning the US wanted them. I would expect the US to come out with new regulations by the end of this year and give companies 12 months to comply. So while the US both created the rule and will likely implement it, it is still a question as to whether the rest of the world will follow. Llanos explains that they likely will.Juan Llanos""This rule is currently applicable in most of the world for traditional financial institutions, but not yet for the cryptocurrency industry,” he said. “So, theoretically, the new president of FATF, a Chinese national, could propose a different type of standard. However, this is highly unrealistic, given that most FATF member countries march in lockstep to the beat of the largest countries in the world, all of which agree that anonymity is anathema.”Both Reiter and Llanos agree that with the new rules, privacy is likely to be a thing of the past. Reiter explains how the rule will likely be implemented:“Exchanges would have to whitelist addresses and only transact with those addresses. These will be the compliant exchanges, there may be a very small group of them. Certain exchanges would not want to comply, these will be called non-compliant exchanges. Compliant exchanges would not be able to deal with compliant exchanges.”The anonymity of cryptocurrency is gone. Llanos discussed how the tradeoff between privacy as a civil right versus the deterrent to financial crime is often treated. He said “the value proposition of pseudonymous and anonymous or privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies will soon be challenged by law and regulation (and possibly general public opinion). I have been educating the industry that anonymity is anathema to national security and law enforcement for years.”He left a somber warning too, saying that Law enforcement and national security public policy have prevailed over civil liberty. In other words, good-bye privacy; hello full transparency and surveillance. Situations such as the capital one data breach – where the data from over 100 million credit card applications and accounts were stolen – speak to the innate risks of having major centralized siloes of human data. Regardless of whether or not this rule is possible to comply with, the attempt by financial institutions may very well force many individuals to move off current platforms in pursuit of decentralized exchanges. Decentralized exchanges, while currently new and not very popular, run natively on the blockchain and cannot be shut down or regulated. The travel rule may cause an acceleration of adoption. Privacy coins – cryptocurrencies that cannot be easily tracked on a blockchain – may become more popular as well. In either case, it makes it much harder for law enforcement to take down money launderers or for regulators to protect consumers for financial market manipulation.Maybe this ends up as a controlled scenario where Bitcoin only moves between financial institutions. Perhaps Bitcoin becomes just a back-end value transfer protocol for financial intermediaries, leveraging the blockchain as a third party ledger to facilitate 10 minute settlement between all parties.Either way, the implementation of the travel rule in US financial institutions and abroad is likely to have industry changing effects. Just like the banking institutions of today, cryptocurrency institutions will further deprivatize consumer financial data and become centralized data silos for opportunistic hackers to pursue. But will this be the end of Bitcoin? Likely not."

First, we had the Fed who found a way to disappoint the markets causing the dollar to move towards the sky and the stock markets to suffer a dramatic loss. To make matters worse, Donald Trump threw another sucker punch that took the markets by complete surprise when he announced his new decision on China. President Trump announced to levy 10% tariffs on the rest of $300 billion worth of Chinese goods starting from September. The news was enough to break the back of the markets with the S&P 500 futures tanking on the back of it.","(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)US futures and European markets are in a massive turmoil as a result of new tariffs announced by Donald Trump. This has come at a time when many market participants were expecting a cease fire between the US and China. However, this option is out of the window and everyone is worried about one thing: the retaliation. China isn’t going to sit on its hands and take the slap quietly . This isn’t Iran or other similar country. The second biggest economy of the world is going to hit back, and this time it could be such an upper hook that it may take the floor out of its opponent’s feet.From the perspective of investors and central bankers, this situation has escalated their problems. As a result, investors are going to move on the side lines. They were hardly getting their confidence back due to the earning season. It wasn’t as bad as expected. Central banks have their own qualm with the slower economic growth. The economic data has been immensely sick since this trade war started. They thought that the renewal of a dovish stance may cure this curse and restore confidence or at least they had hopes for a placebo effect.Nonetheless, if you are a bull, it is time to run for the hills because the hell is about to break. The chances of ceasefire are out of the window and central banks can really cancel their summer plans. For now, expect central bankers to be on their toes and this means they will use every single tool in their bag to fight the effects of this decision.The Fed can forget what they said this week because now I am looking at a string of interest rate cuts and this means weaker dollar.The gold price has already experienced a massive spike overnight and the chances of it tearing the resistance of 1,500 are robust.Stock traders can throw their hopes that Q3 earning season is going to be a bright one. The upcoming ultra-dovish monetary policy stance by Fed may provide an initial support for the markets but it would not have any real effects.Over in Europe, German’s manufacturing sector has been in chaos throughout this year. The economic readings have flirted with recession levels and this escalation of war is going to make the nights sleepless for the president of the European Central Bank who is already short on remedies.From a risk off perspective,  Bitcoin price surged overnight as HODLERs clearly see how Donald Trump is destroying the status of the dollar . Picking a fight with China means abolish the importance of the dollar on the global stage. There are already strong rumours that something robust is about to come out of China which is going to support the price of Bitcoin. Guess what, these levies and any future levies are going to push the Chinese regulators to start thinking seriously to adopt Bitcoin. Believe me that the day China lifts the ban on Bitcoin and supports this new currency with their supreme regulation, Bitcoin is going to crush the $100,000 mark in no time.(AP Photo/Kin Cheung)As for the US NFP data, due later today, it can no longer occupy the centre stage. I am not saying that this event is going to be meaningless. I believe the importance of this event is going to be in a different way. A good number isn’t going to support anything, and traders should not expect any cautious stance from the Fed on the back of this. These new levies (introduced by Donald Trump) have made the Fed’s monetary policy path an one-way street. So, no matter how strong the reading is today, I do not expect it to be above the 200K mark anyway. Traders should start pricing in a lower dollar. "
18,https://www.forbes.com/,"Aug 7, 2019",Digital Assets Beyond Bitcoin: Three Blockchain Opportunities In Tech,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/08/07/digital-assets-beyond-bitcoin-three-blockchain-opportunities-in-tech/,"Bitcoin, newer cryptocurrencies, tokens and other digital assets attract 
thousands of speculators, professionals and amateurs alike.","Aug 7, 2019,07:00am EDT",,"The attention is largely focused on the figures: prices, highs and lows and multimillion-dollar deals.These numbers, however, are superficial.For anyone in the tech industry, I believe it’s more important to understand the major trends stemming from the distributed ledger technology (DLT). In this article, I aim to summarise some of the opportunities that my team is watching.1. Virtual Assets In GamingDigital collectibles have existed in computer games for decades, including swords, skins, game currencies, and more. In 2018 alone, Newzoo (via CNBC) projected that gamers worldwide would spend $138 billion on games, which represents a huge potential market for in-game items.Currently, in-game artifacts reside on the game publishers’ servers. The owners of rare items don’t actually own anything. Meanwhile, in-game currencies are prone to inflation; for example, the USD value of World of Worldcraft gold has reportedly fluctuated multiple times.The tokenization of virtual in-game assets would create a provably limited supply. As a result, users might spend more, possibly even treating their in-game expenditures as investments. If Lego toys have already outperformed stocks and bonds, why couldn’t in-game virtual property emerge as a new alternative investment?Widely adopted and frequently exchanged virtual in-game assets will likely require a much higher transaction throughput than most existing blockchains can offer. However, game developers can already experiment with tokenizing parts of their in-game economies. To get around current scalability and usability limitations, you can use on-chain transactions only for in-game transfers of items between players. Other operations could still be done off-chain on your servers. That way the gameplay would remain unchanged for most players. Yet heavy spenders might pay more knowing that their items are freely tradable and that you have a limited supply.2. Identity Management On The BlockchainMore worrying than publishers’ stronghold on in-game items to me is the fact that companies like Google and Facebook have a lot of control over our online identities. DLT-based digital IDs might become a viable alternative to centralized identity management by large corporations or governments.  In the future, I expect solutions will emerge where users control their own private identifying information (name, address, date of birth, et cetera) and use a distributed ledger to selectively confirm or reveal it. For example, a user might locally save documents to a mobile app that acts as a digital wallet with public-private keys cryptography — similar to what’s used in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Companies and other external parties could then request a confirmation of the user’s ID by creating a transaction with the user’s public key. The user would then sign the transaction with their private key, agreeing to confirm the requested information without revealing it.The actual implementation of the DLT logic doesn’t really matter because the biggest challenge and opportunity lies in creating a smooth user experience of creating and managing their decentralized identity. The simplicity of using Facebook or Google logins sets a high bar for any alternative solutions. But anyone can experiment with new decentralized technologies.3. Tokenized Digital CollectiblesFinally, a more exotic application is the idea of digital collectables. You might have heard about CryptoKitties selling for upwards of $100,000, and I believe that's just the beginning.Crypto wallets may soon be a common feature on smartphones, thanks to new browsers (for example, Opera) and smartphone manufacturers such as Samsung. As a result, wallets could also hold non-fungible tokens (or NFTs) that could represent any digital collectible.It might seem silly, but people already hoard GIFs, sticker packages for messenger apps, and even digital “gifts.” Unlike GIFs or any other media assets, NFTs are often scarce and unique. This adds a whole new dimension to the experience of digital collecting and brings it closer to the world of traditional collections such as stamps, coins and a myriad of other items.For apps with gamified elements, I believe that NFTs could strengthen the appeal of badges and other achievements. These rewards could enable new functionalities, be limited and tradable, create demand from other users and increase engagement.NFTs could even be used by offline marketers as digital alternatives to traditional giveaway merchandise, such as silicone wristbands, pin badges and medals. It’s hardly possible to wear all charity merch at once, but you could collect NFTs on a single wallet to showcase the causes you support. UncertaintyThere is a lot of uncertainty around the new opportunities we’ve explored in this post. Most of these use cases still depend on advances in user experience, transaction throughput, and general acceptance of the digital asset as something that is used beyond speculation.To prepare for new opportunities, I believe it’s best to follow a range of use cases that are most relevant to your business and pay attention to the distributed ledger platform that is gaining the most traction. Right now Ethereum looks to be in the lead in terms of developers and applications building on top of it, but new generations of platforms will keep competing and pushing the industry forward."

crypto-to-crypto trades (i.e., Bitcoin for Ether) are taxable capital 
gains. The letter ...","Jul 31, 2019,01:49pm EDT","The massive tax bust of crypto owners has begun with the IRS mailing 10,000 letters to crypto account owners. These letters educate crypto account holders about the rules and tell taxpayers to review their tax reporting for crypto transactions to be sure they reported income correctly. If necessary, taxpayers should file amended tax returns and or late returns. These tax returns should be marked with the corresponding letter type (i.e., Letter 6173, 6174 or 6174-A) and mailed to a particular IRS address. In other words, these tax filings won’t be a needle in the haystack and the IRS will take a close look. Many audits may follow.","IRS Letter 6173We have information that you have or had one or more accounts containing virtual currency and may not have met your U.S. tax filing and reporting requirements for transactions involving virtual currency, which include cryptocurrency and non-crypto virtual currencies.”The IRS might know there is unreported income based on tax information obtained through enforcement actions, which include the summons against U.S. Coinbase customers. You received the letter because you didn’t file a tax return, which should have included virtual currency transactions. Alternatively, you filed a return but did not report virtual currency transactions. You must reply to this tax notice by submitting a correct late tax return or an amended return. If you disagree with the IRS, the letter requires a full explanation with a signed statement declared under penalties of perjury.Letter 6173 is a severe tax notice, and you should not dig yourself into a bigger hole with an incorrect reply. In some cases, perjury could be a felony. The letter states, “If we don’t hear from you by the “respond by” date we may refer your tax account for examination.”I wonder how the IRS will conduct its audits of virtual currency transactions. They will need a list of all coin exchanges and private wallets and probably have to use trade accounting software in the same way a taxpayer would.IRS Letter 6174We have information that you have or had one or more accounts containing virtual currency but may not know the requirements for reporting transactions involving virtual currency, which include cryptocurrency and non-crypto virtual currencies. After reviewing the (educational) information below, if you believe you didn’t accurately report your virtual currency transactions on a federal income tax return, you should file amended returns or delinquent returns if you didn’t file a return for one or more taxable years.”The key phrase is that the taxpayer “may not know” crypto tax treatment. It sounds like the IRS does not have sufficient information indicating unreported income. Letter 6174 is an “educational letter,” and it states, “you do not need to respond to this letter.” If you received this tax notice, then you should review your crypto tax reporting and consider filing an amended tax return, if appropriate. Consider the IRS advice a warning shot across your bow.Letter 6174-AWe have information that you have or had one or more accounts containing virtual currency but may not have properly reported your transactions involving virtual currency, which include cryptocurrency and non-crypto virtual currencies. After reviewing the information below, if you believe you didn’t accurately report your virtual currency transactions on a federal income tax return, you should file amended returns or delinquent returns if you didn’t file a return for one or more taxable years. You do not need to respond to this letter.”The critical phrase is “may not have properly reported.” That’s different from Letter 6173, which states “may not have met” your tax requirements. Letter 6174-A implies the taxpayer reported crypto transactions, but perhaps not in the proper way. For example, maybe the taxpayer used Schedule C (business income) instead of Form 8949 (capital gains). Perhaps they used like-kind exchanges, and the IRS might not allow that. Conversely, Letter 6173 indicates the taxpayer did not report crypto transactions at all.The IRS has various types of tax information for virtual currency account owners, and it selected the letter that best matched their knowledge base. The IRS is also using third-party services to obtain more tax information. It’s wise to come clean now if you know you have errors in reporting crypto transactions. Historically, taxpayers have performed better in seeking abatement of penalties if they come forward to the IRS before getting busted first.Civil and criminal prosecution and FBAR reportingThe IRS stressed, “Taxpayers who do not properly report the income tax consequences of virtual currency transactions are, when appropriate, liable for tax, penalties, and interest. In some cases, taxpayers could be subject to criminal prosecution.” The IRS sent mob boss Al Capone to prison for tax evasion, which was less challenging than indicting him for unlawful bootlegging. Learn about accuracy-related penalties and what constitutes reasonable cause for reduction of penalties.The IRS Virtual Currency Compliance campaign reminds me of IRS initiatives to hunt down hidden offshore bank and brokerage accounts. FATCA legislation forced foreign banks into reporting on U.S. resident accounts. The IRS Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program (OVDP) helped taxpayers come clean with voluntary reporting. That led to reduced penalties, which otherwise were onerous. Some tax cheats used foreign bank accounts to conceal business income from the IRS. Others protected assets with offshore structures and only did not correctly report portfolio income.In retrospect, it seems the IRS made a mistake in (unofficially) waiving foreign bank account report FinCEN 114 and Form 8938 for offshore virtual currency accounts. Virtual currency is “property,” which did not meet the requirements for FinCEN 114 and Form 8938 (Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets). There are significant penalties for not filing FinCEN 114 (previously known as FBAR) on time with the U.S. Treasury. Once you put Treasury on notice of owning these accounts, it dissuades you from hiding income from the IRS on those same accounts.Coin-to-coin exchangesIn the educational section of these IRS letters, it states that crypto-to-crypto trades (i.e., Bitcoin for Ether) are taxable capital gains. The letter does not mention Section 1031 or like-kind exchanges being allowed on pre-2018 trades. (The new tax law TCJA restricted like-kind exchanges to real property only, starting in 2018.) Many crypto traders did not report deferred capital gains on coin-to-coin trades. Some may have, but they omitted the required Form 8824.I’ve questioned whether coin-to-coin trades qualify for like-kind exchange treatment in years before 2018. Different types of virtual currencies might not be eligible as like-kind property, and coin exchanges are not qualified intermediaries. Multi-party like-kind exchanges require both.Tax information statements and trade accountingThe IRS letters say to report all transactions whether tax information statements (Form 1099) were sent, or not, for crypto accounts held in the U.S., or abroad. Cryptocurrencies are “property,” not a “security,” so it’s not a “covered security” for purposes of 1099-B reporting. Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange, appeased the IRS during their fight for obtaining taxpayer information, by issuing a Form 1099-K for larger accounts. The IRS intended Form 1099-K for third-party network transactions for merchants; not traders or investors. Only U.S. exchanges might provide 1099-Ks. Coinbase also provided capital gain and loss reports for later years.Taxpayers should consider using a trade accounting solution or software program to download virtual currency transactions from all coin exchanges and private wallets. Many crypto owners have accounts around the world, and accounting issues are more challenging when trading on margin. The IRS will likely use this same software in an exam.Additional IRS guidance coming soonThe IRS keeps promising to publish further advice on crypto tax treatment soon. Why did they send 10,000 education letters if they plan to update their education guidance shortly? Perhaps, it would have been better to publish updated guidance before mailing them. This letter campaign seems a bit like a fishing expedition: The IRS wants more tax returns to analyze before it tackles tax treatment issues further.Additional guidance is expected to address like-kind exchanges; chain splits, permissible accounting methods, wash sales, Section 475, and more. The AICPA issued a letter containing suggested questions and answers. The basics are clear, and the delay in additional guidance is no excuse for non-compliance.IRS data analyticsThe IRS said it would continue to use data analytics, and perhaps other blockchain technology to uncover more non-compliant crypto taxpayers. The IRS successfully used an independent company Chainalysis on recovering tax information from U.S. Coinbase customers. That may have been one of the sources for this first batch of 10,000 account letters.What tax evaders didn’t initially realize is that virtual currencies may not be an ideal medium of exchange for concealing income and assets from tax authorities. Unlike using cash (dollar bills), blockchain is a distributed ledger which is available to the public. Non-crypto virtual currency may have a private company centralized ledger, but the IRS might be able to get that through a summons, too. AI, blockchain tools, and crypto trade accounting programs will help the IRS bust crypto tax evaders and taxpayers who are honest but misinformed.TakeawayThis IRS letter campaign is just the beginning of virtual currency enforcement activities to come. You should take this opportunity to get fully educated, review your reporting, and be sure you are tax compliant. Pay tax liabilities and interest expenses, and then seek abatement of penalties when assessed. Some crypto users might try to claim ignorance or argue they received terrible tax advice. Others might assert that the crypto tax rules were too vague and uncertain at the time of filing. Some tax treatment issues are unknown (i.e., like-kind exchanges and hard forks), but the basics are clear. After receiving these education letters, which are warning shots, there are no grounds for continued non-compliance.Consult a crypto tax expert immediately after receiving any of the above IRS letters. The CPA can reply to Letter 6173 soon and request more time to file amended returns. The 2018 tax return deadlines are coming up on September 15, 2019, for entities, and October 15 for individuals. Plan to work with your CPA after those dates on amended tax return filings.Breaking news and more resourcesIRS IR-2019-132: IRS has begun sending letters to virtual currency owners advising them to pay back taxes, file amended returns; part of agency’s larger efforts. WSJ quotes my partner in IRS Sending Warning Letters to More Than 10,000 Cryptocurrency Holders. “When it comes to preparing tax returns involving cryptocurrencies, Darren Neuschwander, a certified public accountant, said many tax preparers are frustrated because the IRS has long promised new guidance on cryptocurrencies that it hasn’t yet released.” “It’s ironic that the IRS is issuing these letters because we’re still waiting to know more rules,” he said.IRS Sends Out 10,000 Letters to Virtual Currency Investors, Some of Which Demand a Response, By Ed Zollars CPA for Kaplan Financial Education.Blockchain Analytics Firm Chainalysis Outlines User Data Policy Amid Coinbase Allegations in CoinTelegraph.The IRS Has Special Software to Find Bitcoin Tax Cheats.

Now phishing defense specialist Cofense has published more than 200 million email addresses, that the company says are ""being targeted by a large sextortion scam."" The reason for publishing the data? ""To ensure potential victims and their employers can address the threat of sextortion and prevent lost wages and productivity.""You can search the database for your own email address here.According to Cofense, the company's researchers analyzed ""more than 7 million email addresses impacted by sextortion in the first half of 2019 alone."" This, the company says, resulted in $1.5 million in payments to bitcoin wallets.The sad truth here, is that most victims have little to lose. It's a ""spray and pray attack,"" a volume play executed by botnets, targeting a vast list of email addresses whereby a small percentage return will be lucrative. It's the ultimate in self-selection—the people targeted with the most to lose are most likely to respond.""If your email address is found in a target list used by the botnet,"" says Cofense's CTO Aaron Higbee, ""it’s highly likely you will receive a sextortion email—we felt it was critical to get this information out. We hope that victims receiving a sextortion email will find our resource center so they can avoid the anxiety and stress of trying to figure out whether to pay a bitcoin ransom.""If you do receive an email, there's a good chance it will also come laced with malware—so don't click on any links or open any attachments.

And we all know that most people recycle or never change passwords. Nothing makes the heart stop faster than receiving a malicious email with a real password listed. We immediately assume the worst. And so if your email is in the database—and even it if isn't—it makes sense to change your passwords now and frequently. Not to use the same passwords across multiple accounts. And don't use silly easy to remember—and therefore easy to crack passwords. Cofense also lists more basic password advice in its release—use multi factor authentication where it's available, think about the use of a password manager, and covering webcams when not in use doesn't hurt either, even if that threat is more perception than reality for most of us. In the meantime, if you are unlucky enough to receive a sextortion email, Cofense's advice is don't panic and don't pay."

Алексей М / Flickr. And, in a highly ...","Aug 6, 2019,04:54pm EDT","In June 2019, Facebook and a consortium of 28 founding members including Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Uber Technologies, Inc., and eBay announced the launch in 2020 of a new digital currency called Libra, promoted as “a simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people.” In a White Paper introducing Libra, the consortium promises accessibility to the 1.7 billion adults globally who remain outside the financial system but who have access to mobile phones and the internet and pledges trustworthiness and support for “collaborating and innovating with the financial sector, including regulators.” Yet Libra’s global reach and potential for misuse has alarmed U.S. regulators and central bankers worldwide. At a July 11, 2019 Senate Banking Committee hearing, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell expressed concern that no single regulator currently has authority to oversee Libra, stating that “Libra raises a lot of serious concerns, . . . [including] privacy, money laundering, consumer protection, [and] financial stability.” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, in a White House press briefing on July 15, 2019, acknowledged the great interest in Libra and other cryptocurrencies but voiced Treasury’s serious concern “regarding the growing misuse of virtual currencies by money launderers, terrorist financiers, and other bad players.” Concerns have also been articulated by private citizens. In an Opinion piece published by the Financial Times on June 21, 2019, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes warned that Libra will permit companies that will put their private interests ahead of public ones to exercise monetary control and will “disrupt and weaken nation states by enabling people to move out of unstable local currencies and into a currency denominated in dollars and euros and managed by corporations.”","While Libra’s potential scope has increased the call for regulation, because they facilitate rapid, secure and often anonymous financial transactions, digital currencies have long been attractive for criminals involved in a wide range of illicit activities. In recent years, the digital currency Bitcoin has facilitated criminal activity ranging from funding the Russian hacking of the 2016 U.S. presidential election to purchasing child pornography and selling opioids online. Speculators have also lost billions of dollars in schemes that marketed allegedly fraudulent cryptocurrencies such as OneCoin and My Big Coin.The lack of central financial authority oversight also means that digital currencies can be used to facilitate rampant tax evasion and, recently, the IRS and Tax Division of the Department of Justice pledged to focus on digital currency-related offenses. Thus, at the New York University Tax Controversy Forum in June, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard Zuckerman announced that the Justice Department already has pending cryptocurrency-related criminal cases and will continue to target such offenses.BitcoinAnd, in a highly publicized move, on July 26, the IRS announced that it is sending 10,000 letters to taxpayers who potentially failed to pay taxes on digital currency transactions or who may have reported those transactions improperly. The announcement states that the taxpayers were identified through ongoing IRS compliance efforts, which included a “John Doe” summons that the IRS served on the virtual currency exchange, Coinbase, Inc., that called for the production of records identifying taxpayers who utilized the exchange. The IRS announcement identified three variations of the letter. The most severe (Letter 6173) states that the IRS has information that the taxpayer may not have met tax filing and reporting requirements for virtual currency transactions and requires the taxpayer to file returns, amend incorrect returns, or submit a written explanation under penalty of perjury explaining why previously filed returns are correct. Taxpayers receiving this letter must respond within 30 days or risk an audit. A second letter (Letter 6174) states that the recipient may not have properly reported digital currency transactions, while a third (Letter 6174-A) suggests that the recipient may not know reporting requirements for virtual currency transactions. Both of these “softer” letters advise the taxpayer to consider filing amended or delinquent returns, and they both seek to educate taxpayers about their obligations arising from digital currency transactions, but note that failure to accurately report may result in civil or criminal enforcement activity. The IRS’s announcement also warns that the “IRS will remain actively engaged in addressing non-compliance related to virtual currency transactions through a variety of efforts, ranging from taxpayer education to audits to criminal investigations.”Current IRS guidance treats digital currency as property (rather than currency), with capital gains and losses realized every time it is used in a transaction. The IRS recently acknowledged, however, that since its most recent guidance was issued in 2014, ""virtual currency as a medium of exchange and investment has continued to develop,"" necessitating clarity on ""basic issues"" such as methods for calculating cost basis and cost basis assignment and tax treatment of “forks” (splits that create both an old and new version of a digital currency).  In a letter to Congress dated May 16, 2019, IRS Commissioner Charles P. Rettig confirmed that the IRS intends to publish additional guidance for taxpayers relating to virtual transactions. It remains to be seen what guidance will be forthcoming, but in the meantime, in order to comply with their tax obligations, users must track the value of digital currencies from the time of acquisition to the time they are spent, which is a taxable event.The tax compliance issues surrounding digital currencies mean that while the Libra consortium is promising that the new digital currency will be accessible to anyone with internet access and will be easy to use to pay for everything from rides provided by Uber and Lyft, to merchandise sold on eBay and goods and services provided by other companies expected to join the consortium, unless the IRS shifts course, Libra users who wish to remain tax-compliant will have to undertake complicated record-keeping and tax reporting. Even if Libra follows through on its intention to provide tools to track transactions and generate reports for users, the IRS’s treatment of digital currencies is likely to be a substantial obstacle to the widespread adoption of Libra and other digital currencies by law-abiding individuals.

Managing a weak yuan has been the centerpiece of the economic plan that has driven its ascent from relative insignificance, to the second largest economy in the world (over the past 25 years or so).So, predictably China turned to its trusted economic tool, a weak currency, to offset tariffs. Since Trump’s bark turned into bite early last year, China has devalued the currency by 13% against the dollar in response to tariffs.This has been expected, and it has happened, but it becomes concerning for global market stability when the prospects of a big one-off devaluation increases. And that's what happened overnight. That's why global markets have been shaken.Remember, back in August 2015, the Chinese surprised markets with a devaluation of the yuan. It was (also) a modest adjustment in the currency, but global markets fell sharply on the prospects that a big one-off devaluation may follow, to support its flagging economy.It didn't happen then and shouldn't happen now. It would be a deadly move for China. It would be an affront, not just to the U.S but to all global trading partners. And that would likely induce a more global response against China's trade advantage. China would be put in the global penalty box. That would be damaging for the global economy, but the biggest loser would be China.With that, I suspect this will prove to be a warning shot. And perhaps it will bring both parties (the U.S. and China) back to the negotiating table this month (i.e. sooner rather than later).In the meantime, as we've discussed in my daily notes, bitcoin continues to be among the big winners when the yuan is weakening. Bitcoin was up 13% on Monday. As I've said, the rise in bitcoin has everything to do with money moving out of China, and less to do with Silicon Valley genius/global monetary system disruption.Bitcoin futures and off-exchange (peer-to-peer) trading are liquidity sources for Chinese citizens, allowing them to circumvent government capital controls (which restrict individuals from moving more than $50,000 out of the country a year).With that, as we've discussed, the bitcoin bubble may not deflate until/unless Trump makes concessions to do a deal.In addition to the yuan, the chart to watch will be U.S. stocks.aug 5 spxThe 200-day moving average (the purple line) on the S&P 500 futures is about 1% from Monday's low. If we hit it, that would give us a 7.8% correction in seven days.Learn more about my premium stock-selection and portfolio service here."

(Full disclosure: Author holds ...","Aug 1, 2019,08:00am EDT","With bitcoin breaking $10,000 again in recent weeks, public interest in cryptocurrency is picking back up. (Full disclosure: Author holds investments in bitcoin.) But one thing that keeps some people on edge about crypto is volatility. With all their price swings, cryptocurrencies are still seen by some investors as just too risky. Stablecoins offer a way to protect against this volatility.","Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are linked 1:1 to a fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar or British pound. This means that the value of a stablecoin always remains the same as the fiat currency to which it is linked. Since most fiat currencies rarely experience wild price fluctuations, a cryptocurrency linked to them is inherently more “stable” than a regular cryptocurrency.But why use them in the first place? There are two main benefits to stablecoins: The first is that you get the advantages of a cryptocurrency without the volatility. They offer the stability of a trusted fiat currency like the U.S. dollar in digital form. Most stablecoins are built on top of Ethereum, which means they can be sent and received as easily as any other cryptocurrency. Essentially, this means you can access U.S. dollars without a banking account — something that could be life-changing to millions of “unbanked” people in the developing world.The second advantage of stablecoins is for people who view cryptocurrencies as an investment rather than something to use every day. For example, say you’re waiting for bitcoin to reach almost $20,000 again, as it did in late 2017. Once it happened, you could swap your BTC for a USD-backed stablecoin like USD Coin, and your $20,000 would be safe from any sudden drops in BTC’s price.Simply put, stablecoins provide a way to help lock in gains and protect against losses. For this reason, many major exchanges, such as Coinbase and Poloniex, offer trading pairs with stablecoins.Stablecoin Examples• Tether (USDT): This is the largest stablecoin by market capitalization and also the most controversial. For years, USDT has been plagued by rumors that it was not fully backed by dollar holdings, which would mean that Tether Limited (the company behind this project) was “printing” digital dollars out of thin air. They’ve also never released audit results publicly, which hasn’t done much to dispel these rumors. More recently, Tether was caught up in a legal case involving a missing $850 million.The full list of allegations around Tether is too complicated to get into here, but it has caused USDT’s value to briefly fluctuate several times when traders began to lose confidence in it (which remember, is never supposed to happen with a stablecoin). Scandals like this would be enough to bring down most crypto projects, but if there is one thing that stands out about Tether, it is its sheer resilience. Despite the controversy, USDT has always found a way to bounce back, and it remains the leading stablecoin.• USDCoin (USDC): This one remains a popular option, because it is the only USD stablecoin available on Coinbase. USDC was the result of a joint project by Circle, Inc and Coinbase to build a reliable USD stablecoin that is meant to be easy to use and trustworthy. Every token issued is backed by actual dollars held and is attested monthly.• TrustToken coins: TrustToken has gained a reputation as a reliable stablecoin provider. Their most popular coin by market cap is TrueUSD (TUSD), which is held in escrow by trust company bank accounts. Holdings undergo monthly attestations, which are available on their website. The company also offers stablecoins linked to the British pound and Australian and Canadian dollars. One interesting thing about their coins is that you can purchase and redeem their stablecoins directly from their website, rather than relying only on exchanges.Other major stablecoins include Paxos (PAX), Dai (DAI), Stasis Eurs (EURS — it’s linked to the euro) and Gemini Dollar (GUSD), launched by the Winklevoss twins. Binance also just announced it will be launching its own stablecoin in a matter of months, a move that could seriously challenge Tether’s dominance for the first time.Facebook Enters The Stablecoin GameProbably the biggest development with stablecoins right now is the announcement of Libra, a stablecoin created by Facebook (it will be run as a separate company). Unlike most stablecoins, which are linked to a specific fiat currency, Libra will be backed by a group of “low-volatility assets, including bank deposits and government securities.”Some in the cryptocurrency world are alarmed by Libra and not simply because of the privacy concerns surrounding the company in general. Some also object to the technology itself, saying it is not a true cryptocurrency from a technical perspective but that the company is still representing it as such in its marketing.No matter what you may think about it, Libra will be one of the biggest and most ambitious fintech projects to date, and it could change the crypto landscape when it launches in 2020.So, How Do You Decide Which One To Use?Look for stablecoins that undergo regular audits or attestations to ensure they do, in fact, hold enough fiat currency to back up each new token that is generated. Study the price history to make sure there have not been price fluctuations, and if there have been, do some research to find out what happened. Go to their websites, and see how long it takes for deposits to arrive in your bank account.Generally, the more “boring” a stablecoin project might seem, the better. They’re not supposed to be exciting; a stablecoin won’t take you to the “moon,” but it may help you stay there once you arrive.One thing is certain — as long as volatility remains a major issue for cryptocurrencies, there will be a demand for stablecoins.The information provided here is not investment, tax or financial advice.

","Jennifer Campbell is cofounder and co-CEO of Tagomi, a prime brokerage for crypto assets that helps investors make large trades, in sizes ranging from hundreds of thousands of dollars to tens of millions. Since its 2018 founding, Tagomi has raised $28 million in venture capital from investors like Peter Thiel’s Founder’s Fund and $400 million crypto fund Paradigm. It has 200 institutional clients trading on its platform and is based in New York. Forbes: Tell me about your background, starting with what you did before Tagomi.Jennifer Campbell: At Union Square Ventures, I spent a lot of time researching crypto, and I became the go-to person whenever someone wanted to invest. Especially for anyone investing in size, there weren’t great solutions. These investors were used to someone making their trades for them and providing much more sophisticated execution. They weren’t seeing that in crypto, and it really was a barrier to entry for them.I ultimately decided to start Tagomi with my partner, Greg, who is the O.G. in the electronic trading space. He was a partner at Goldman Sachs for ten years and their head of electronic trading. He’s very familiar with many institutional clients and their needs.Forbes: How does Tagomi’s product work?Campbell: You only need to onboard once with us, and you get to trade across all the different liquidity venues—including exchanges and market makers—across the globe. You get much better execution and pricing, because you’re sitting across multiple exchanges, and we’re always monitoring each of the exchanges to make sure you’re getting the best price.Forbes: How many exchanges do you link into?Campbell: About ten.Forbes: Who are your customers?Campbell: It’s a really wide range. We have a high number of individuals who just want to buy some bitcoin and really want to find a trusted counterparty, and they want more high-touch services. In the middle we have a lot of crypto funds. We have almost all the top crypto funds onboarded—folks like Paradigm and Multicoin Capital. We have a couple registered investment advisors (RIAs) who trade on our platform on behalf of their own clients. And then we have some broker dealers who bring their network of clients.Forbes: What coins can you trade on Tagomi?Campbell: It depends on the jurisdiction. In New York, you can trade the top five, including bitcoin, ether, XRP, litecoin and bitcoin cash. Outside of New York, you can trade the top 15 coins. Forbes: If you think back to 2017, what was the pace that institutional investors were coming into the market that year, and how does that compare with today?Campbell: I don’t think there has been that much change. I think when the average person thinks about institutional clients, they’re thinking about Fidelity and iconic names, and those companies are not trading a lot of volume. The smaller crypto funds, for example, are really in the market, not just today but also in 2017, 2018 and 2019. That’s what has been most consistent. What has really changed a lot has been the narrative. In 2017 a lot of the bigger institutions said they were coming in, and in 2018 they kind of pulled back. Then in 2019 there’s a lot more conversation about that as well.Forbes: Many people I’ve spoken with recently have said institutional investors are starting to come into the market more quickly. You don’t necessarily think that’s the case?Campbell: They’re definitely coming in more than 2018. There are more traditional folks like smaller hedge funds that have come into the market. We’ve had more conversations with the large institutions, but none of the top five institutions are actually trading today.Forbes: Do you think that will change a year from now?Campbell: I think they’ll definitely be coming in; it’s just a matter of time. There’s just a long set of approvals. There are 12 different committees before it can go to the next stage, then you have to go through another 20 committees, so it’s a very long process. I think a lot of these institutions are genuine in their curiosity, but I don’t think any of them are really that close yet.Forbes: Are there certain areas of institutional investor interest that you’re monitoring closely?Campbell: Not so much. We’re still watching the ETFs pretty closely. We have talked to a few of the large institutions that are interested in building index funds, but most of these are still conversations.Forbes: For some institutions that haven’t invested yet but are considering it, what’s holding them back?Campbell: It’s really the regulatory clarity that they’re looking for. They’re trying to understand, “Okay, bitcoin’s not a security, but what about everything else? Can we get some clarity from the SEC? What is their stance?”Forbes: What are the most important issues in regulation that you’re watching?Campbell: The space needs some legal safe harbors so that entrepreneurs who are well intentioned get some guidelines and reassurances that when they’re trying to do the right thing, they get some protection. In the 1990s, we had laws like the Communications Decency Act and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which created safe harbors and really limited the legal liabilities for a lot of entrepreneurs in the internet age. Now we have very valuable companies like Facebook and Twitter, and it’s very exciting that the U.S. is where a lot of those companies were founded.We need more clarity on what the regulatory paths should be. Should I be getting a broker dealer license? There should probably be some sensible legal reclassification of blockchains and cryptocurrencies, because a lot of the current regulation is a force-fit, and it’s unclear which paradigm cryptocurrencies really fit into. So what happens is that instead of just picking a bucket, you have to apply every single bucket to it, which doesn’t make a lot of sense.Forbes: So you think there should be new legislation?Campbell: Absolutely.Forbes: Why do you think the SEC is moving more slowly than many people expected?Campbell: Perhaps one reason is that people thought the internet was clearly something different. It clearly did not fit into any traditional legal paradigm or bucket, so it seemed obvious that we needed different laws. Whereas with cryptocurrencies, there are some competing tensions and overlap with securities laws. So it’s not quite obvious to some people that it should be a completely new category, even though I think it definitely should be. That’s why it might take a little bit longer to come to that conclusion.Excerpted from the June 2019 issue of Forbes CryptoAsset And Blockchain Advisor."

BitCoin and Ethereum, rank high in their ability to guarantee.","Aug 5, 2019,12:25am EDT","Once the need for a physical medium for currency disappears, the potential for radical change in ... [+] financial systems rises dramatically. We're entering into this era now.","In the 18th Century, a venture begun in England established an outpost in the New World around Hudson Bay. The Hudson Bay Company was given license by the crown to exploit the bounty of the Northernmost parts of North America, and eventually a trading network was built out, trading fur, woods, and mineral resources. This network manifested itself primarily through a series of forts that protected general stores, extending as far south and west as Oregon, along the Pacific Coast, forts that would in time become cities like Portland, Vancouver, Toronto and so forth.An example of Hudson Bay Company ScripThe Hudson Bay Company used its own special scrip within its territory, the scrip holding value because it could be traded for British pounds as well as establishing more or less standard prices for goods. When Canada was founded in 1867, it established its territory by buying the land from the HBC, and making HBC's scrip fully convertible to the new Canadian Dollar. In effect, a privately held scrip became the de facto currency of a nation.Empires, kings and potentates have long coveted the right to put their face on coins, but until comparatively recently, the value of those coins was determined primarily by the assayed weight of the metal that made them up. Indeed, the Dutch, during the 16th century, actually scored their gold coins so that a person could break it apart into octants, from whence was derived the term ""Pieces of eight"" so beloved in pirate tales. They also created coins from the silver mine of Joachim's Valley ('Joachimsthal' in Dutch) which were in turn heavily used by first the Spanish territories then eventually English North America, the name frequently shorted first to 'Thaler', and then via Spanish as 'Dollar'.Pieces-of-Eight, so named because the Spanish dollar coin of the 1600s was frequently broken upon ... [+] into eight bits or reals, which in time became known as pesos (pieces). Following the death of Louis the Fourteenth of France, the French economy was in tatters given the financial excesses of the Sun King. The Duke of Orleans, the regent of the new five-year-old King Louis the Fifteen, turned to a friend, Scottish financier John Law, for help. Law, for his part, made a proposal that had been tried on a smaller scale, but never really at a national level: the concept of creating a paper currency, backed by the government and in theory redeemable with silver.While the experiment worked for a little while, speculators made the currency unstable, which was then exacerbated by the government producing more Francs than it could support, causing the currency to crash and significantly diminishing the ability of France to compete in the colonization in North America. It also destabilized the French court by reducing the influence of the King over his aristocrats, many of whom had been severely burned in the crash, and not coincidentally laying the groundwork for the French Revolution several decades later.Despite this, as Europe went from Feudal vassalages to nation-states, the ability to control the minting of paper currency based upon its status as a promissory note became one of the key prerogatives of nations. It was one of the reasons, when the first American Confederation, created in the aftermath of the US Revolutionary War, realized they needed a stronger government, the one thing that the Federal government reserved to itself rather than allow to the states was the exclusive right to mint coinage and currency. Currencies have long been the prerogative of nations, though that may be changing as electronic ... [+] coinage hearkens back to most currencies' merchantile roots.Fast-forward two hundred and fifty years, and you can see that history is in fact repeating itself. A currency system works by having a few essential characteristics:These three conditions place some real constraints on currencies, though not always obvious ones. For instance, if you increase the supply of a given currency, you might think that it would dilute the value of that money. Maybe yes, maybe no. If demand is high for money, increasing the money supply may actually accelerate economic growth, though if demand for money is low, increasing the supply may simply cause inflation. If currency is only redeemable in certain places, then it has less utility as a store of value. If a currency has only half the value today that it had yesterday, then people will get rid of that currency quickly in favor of something that is more stable.It turns out, in fact, that most paper currencies don't completely satisfy the above constraints over a long time period, and what's worse, the relationship between money and value can be quite non-linear. This is because currency by itself represents buying power. A gallon of gas in 1971 cost twenty nine cents in most places. Today, that same gallon of gas costs $2.90. Ironically, a loaf of bread cost $.29 and $2.90 respectively as well. The average wage in 1971 was $10,000. Today, its $50,000. This is worth highlighting, though more from an economic rather than technical standpoint. Put in stark terms, the typical worker's wages went up 400%, but the price of most goods went up 1000% percent over roughly the last fifty years (or, the money you earn is worth 60% less today than it was in 1971, relative to the cost of living). The actual utility of a gallon of gas has actually not changed much in that time, which means that what has changed is both buying power for a given amount of money, and the change in wages relative to the cost of goods. Why? That's a topic for another time.Electronic currencies, such as BitCoin and Ethereum, rank high in their ability to guarantee ... [+] uniqueness, but are struggling with exchangeability and are still very heavily influenced by speculators, making them less than ideal for stable currencies.So, where do cryptocurrencies play into all of this?At the moment, of the three points highlighted above, cryptocurrencies arguably are really, really good with the first point, are getting better (though still not great) with the second point, but really suck on the last point. Consider this. One of the biggest arguments in favor of cryptocurrencies is that they are hard to forge. It's possible - throw enough computation power at it and you could in fact do it, but the salient point is that the cost to do so likely outweighs the value of the coin. Now the downside to that is that many of the current mechanisms for determining uniqueness (such as mining prime numbers) are also very expensive, not just in terms of computational cycles but in terms of energy costs. It's one of the reasons why a few of the primary coins actually are too large by themselves to be used for currency - you have to divide a coin up to say a 1000 different micro-coins to get to the point where you can buy a cup of coffee and a sweet roll at Starbucks, and this in turn still requires effective uniqueness algorithms. However, even with weaker algorithms for division, such micro-coins are still orders of magnitude harder to forge than your average US $20 bill, which is far and away the most popular currency in the world in terms of forgery. However, this point is actually becoming less and less of an issue for the simple reason that paper currency itself is becoming obsolete, except among the very poor (who often have difficulty in being able to set up bank accounts). For much of the latter twentieth century, credit cards made significant inroads in eliminating paper currency, and most recently, the introduction of chipped cards, both credit and debit, have significantly reduced the incidences of fraud.The bigger issue today is online card fraud, though even there, the introduction of electronic wallets (and the growing liability that retailers are facing with each hacking incident via class action suits) are spurring much better encryption of data, as well as better control by consumers. This is not to say that credit card fraud isn't still a problem, but it is a problem that shows signs of abating.Another, perhaps far more reaching consequence of the rise of credit cards, debit cards, digital rewards cards, gift cards and EBTs has been that it has been destroying the physicality of currency, and with it, one of the last vestiges of control that most nations have over their currency.The reason for this is simple. Today, it is possible to set up foreign exchange transfer accounts in which a given currency is in Yen, or Euros, or Pounds, and draw upon them as readily as you can a US funds account. You can set up a crypto account in much the same way, and can even, with some creative work, set up accounts that let you play currency arbitrage across multiple such accounts. If Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple or Facebook (or their counterparts in other countries) set up their own digital currency, you could do the same thing. Amazon is actually creating a highly synergistic ecosystem that is nearly a full bore economy in its own right.In ten to twenty years time your paycheck could very well be made in private e-currency rather than ... [+] a country's native currency, which will send shockwaves in political circles.Put yourself ten years in the future. Amazon (as an example) puts out a cryptocurrency called the bezo (one bezo, two bezos, ....). You can continue to set up a US dollar account for Amazon prime, but you can also open up a bezos account, based upon a blockchain like construct under the control of Amazon. Prices begin to creep up when measured in US dollars, because the US economy has for the most part had net positive price inflation even during recessions, but prices in bezos stay fixed.Other companies look at this and offer the option of paying their employees in bezos. Some are resistant, but especially younger employees take the plunge, and after a while, older employees see that their net buying power continues to decline while the ones in the Amazon ecosystem are seeing wage power stability, and you see a shift as older employees begin to do the same thing. Other companies do this on their own, but discover that they don't have quite enough people in their network to maintain stability, and so they reach out and affiliate themselves with the Amazon network. Banks have taken notice, and all of a sudden you see Amazon currency replacing the US Dollar in more and more transactions, many of them for millions or even billions of dollars. And then Amazon moves the Amazon Currency Network to the Cayman Islands. Overnight, the United States sees 35% of its tax base disappear. Too many people are no longer using US Dollars for transactions. The US Debt, which has been a ticking time bomb for decades, goes off as the US can no longer even pretend to service its deficits, let alone the total debt. States, given the conundrum of having a central Federal government that has become increasingly hostile and demanding (while providing less and less value for the tax money that their citizenry have paid) vs. working with a more stable currency and more autonomy, begin to think the unthinkable at a policy level: choosing to join a different political alliance based upon a common protocol for sharing currencies. One very distinct possibility of the intermixing between private and public e-currencies is the ... [+] possibility that it could very well exacerbate an already growing divide along geopolitical lines.Another scenario can be envisioned. Recently, Walmart announced that they had a patent on a new blockchain currency, with the implications that they would be issuing a currency within the relatively near future. Amazon and Walmart are seen as competitors in the general goods sector, and while there is some overlap they tend to service different regions (and their customers often have very divergent political leanings).Over time you end up with two competing currencies, the Bezo and the Walton. Each of which provides a premium within their respective networks and a double penalty within the opposite network - the double being the fact that in order to convert from Bezos to Waltons, you would have to convert one currency to USDs and then to the other currency, with fees at each transaction point (something often happens in existing currency exchanges, where you have to find a common currency to exchange between two different currencies that don't otherwise have exchange rates). Over time, the economies diverge, with frustrations mounting as the Bezo and the Walton respond to different economic strategies, and changes in political power in Washington DC bring with it a distinct preference for one currency or the other, with all that this implies for policy. Attempting to peg either of the private currencies to the dollar ends up with a situation similar to that which the European Union experience in 2008, when economic policy that was right for the northern countries with strong industrial bases proved ruinous for the southern countries that were primarily agrarian in nature (and is in fact a part of the current problem between red and blue America).What is likely to happen in this scenario is the rise of compacts - agreements between states that standardize upon specific policies regarding economic action, taxation, representation, immigration, public programs, defense, ecological policy, education and so on. Put another way, the currency networks that emerge (and it is likely they will be networked, not just one single currency) will begin looking and acting more and more like autonomous countries. With this comes the reduction of power in Washington, DC and the federal government as states hew more closely to their compact alliances. Now, to be clear, these are both hypothetical scenarios, and I'm using Amazon and Walmart here just to illustrate the point. Nor are these the only scenarios that may play out. It's also worth noting that what is at issue is not so much cryptocurrency by itself as it is the ability of currency networks to effectively capture the tax base of parts or all of a country. Will this result in civil war? Hard to say. We may very well end up in a situation where the US becomes a Confederation along the lines of Canada, with a weaker central government, a common defense agreement and stronger regional blocs. The US may split peacefully into several distinct regions based upon the degree of economic connectivity. It's possible that smarter heads prevail and some agreement is worked out to keep the status quo. However, the likelihood of that decreases the more that mechanisms for separation get implemented, and eCurrencies, whether national based or privately based, have the potential to exacerbate an already stressed situation.One of the major issues that most eCoins have is that they are still highly unstable, due to a ... [+] comparatively small pool of investors, the potential for volatile speculation, and the potential that a government could make such transactions illegal. This will likely change over time.The primary mitigating factor from this happening now is the lack of stability of crypto-currencies, which is something of a chicken and egg problem. Stability ultimately comes from the number of participants involved, which in turn determines the degree to which speculation can take place within a currency. Speculation and stability are counter-weighted - most speculators prefer an asset class to be volatile, because such volatility can make for higher returns with less capital, though it can also lead to higher losses. You can speculate with stable currency (as George Soros managed to do successfully against the British pound in the 1970s) but it requires deep pockets and a great deal of leverage, and being unsuccessful can ruin you.Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies are still very unstable primarily because they lack both the installed base of users and because they are not yet fully convertible or redeemable. It is arguable whether any of the first generation of ICOs will ever meet that bar alone, though that changes once you begin seeing mergers and adoptions between ICOs and large financial or network concerns. This also moots one of the other major selling points that ICO promoters themselves try to make. No currency is going to survive if transactions in that currency remain anonymous, and keeping such transactions anonymous will become increasingly difficult over time. The reason for this is relatively simple - any transaction has real world implications, those implications can be tracked, and once one thread of a transaction begins to get picked apart, then it becomes possible to determine how these connect to other transactions. Government opacity (which is one form of anonymity) will keep many existing ICOs from ever being recognized as legitimate, and may very well be seen as perfect channels for money laundering and black market transactions, putting these ICOs under deep scrutiny. It is likely that currencies based upon (semi-) transparent block-chains (something you're increasingly seeing developed by financial institutions) will likely overtake the anonymous block-chains currently being deployed. The future of finance (and of bank accounts) may very well be that a typical account is, in fact, an ... [+] index made up of different e-currencies, both public and private. In the longer term (fifteen to twenty years), it is likely that the average consumer will likely not interact much at all with ICOs directly. Instead, what I see happening is that banks (and bank-like-entities, such as credit unions) will controls portfolios of currencies and accounts will then consist of baskets of different coins on various networks. Consumers can then determine the mix of their coin holdings, and can designate the default currencies they wish to be paid in (or pay out) when they make a financial transaction. However, at the micro-level, these networks and baskets will be treated in much the same way national currencies do today, with the added wrinkle that these private currencies can push and pull on the national currencies at a level unprecedented until now. What happens when the Bezo replaces the Japanese Yen (or the US Dollar) as the primary instrument for carry trades. What if the Iranian eDinar becomes the preferred currency for pricing oil, or an international incident causes investors to buy up Chinese eYuan and sell the USD, raising the potential for price increases in the United States (or vice versa). What will almost certainly happen is that the distinction between international corporations and nations, already somewhat blurry, will erode even more with time. Businesses will increasingly find themselves having to establish comprehensive foreign policies, fielding security forces and dealing with issues that traditionally have been the domain of countries. At the same time, fundamental questions, including the deceptively difficult one of what constitutes citizenship, will become pressing sooner than we'd like to believe.The upshot of this is that Bitcoins and related electronic currencies are likely here to stay, will become progressively more influential in both political and economic policy as they become more stable, and will almost certainly introduce stresses and potential breaking points in economies globally throughout the twenty-first century.

[+] cryptocurrencies to fund the nation’s military weapons program.,"North Korea has raised an astonishing $2 billion from launching cyberattacks on banks and cryptocurrency exchanges, according to reports. The money was used to fund the nation’s purchase of military weapons, a leaked draft United Nations report states. According to the report submitted to the Security Council committee last week, the widespread and “increasingly sophisticated” attacks saw North Korean hackers stealing funds and attempting to launder the stolen money. This allegedly took place under the direction of the nation’s military intelligence agency The General Bureau.The leaked UN report, seen by news outlets including Reuters, cited 35 instances that saw the DPRK hackers target the financial institutions and crypto exchanges across 17 countries.  ""Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) cyber actors, many operating under the direction of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, raise money for its WMD (weapons of mass destruction) programs, with total proceeds to date estimated at up to $2 billion,"" the report said. It comes at a time of escalating cyber and physical threat from North Korea as talks between the nation's leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump stall. The report was revealed just as Pyongyang fired what are believed to be two short-range ballistic missiles on August 7, according to CNN. It is the fourth missile launch in less than two weeks.It’s important to note that the UN report was completed before last week’s missile launches by North Korea. However, the report stated that “missile launches in May and July enhanced its overall ballistic missile capabilities.”The North Korean cyber threat: A big deal? Cryptocurrencies were targeted by hackers because they are less easy to trace. According to the leaked UN report, the attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges allowed North Korea “to generate income in ways that are harder to trace and subject to less government oversight and regulation than the traditional banking sector.”But the news North Korea is using cyberspace to steal cryptocurrencies and mine bitcoin isn’t new. In March, a UN report said North Korean hackers had stolen around $571 million across at least five cryptocurrency exchanges in Asia between January 2017 and September 2018. Also in March, cybersecurity firm Kaspersky found attacks targeting cryptocurrency businesses that it believed were perpetrated by the North Korean hacker group it calls Lazarus. The leaked UN report shows just how developed the nation’s capabilities are becoming, says Philip Ingram, MBE, a former colonel in British military intelligence. “The worrying thing is: If they can do this, they are just as capable of stealing intellectual property (IP), enabling them to maintain their scientific and engineering development,” says Ingram.In addition, he says, it also throws up more questions about who the country is buying its weapons from. “Who are the countries ignoring international sanctions and supplying advance engineering capability and weapons or weapons parts to North Korea? They don't need the money for internal in country use.”Ian Thornton-Trump, security head at AMTrust Europe says the move shows the regime “looking at cyber to level the playing field”. However, he doesn’t see North Korea as a big threat when compared with the combined power and funding of the big ""five eyes"" nations Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K. and the U.S. “I am 100% certain the public and black ops budget of the five eyes community could be an order of magnitude more than $2 billion,” says Thornton-Trump. “North Korea has a very limited internet presence and it’s my belief from a cyber perspective they could be squashed like a bug.”And indeed, countries are preparing to respond to the cyber threat from China, North Korea, Iran and Russia (CRINK). For example, the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) has announced its intention to create a cybersecurity directorate this fall in a bid to defend the country against foreign adversaries.But at the same time, the news that North Korea is becoming so capable should send shivers down the spines of anyone working in cybersecurity. Ingram asks: “If a country like North Korea–which doesn’t send their students to the best universities in the world and who don't have access to the internet and modern technology–can build a cyber capability capable of stealing this amount of money, what are other states that do have access to this doing?”"

portfolio ...","Aug 7, 2019,11:14am EDT","How much of an investor’s portfolio should consist of alternative investments like cryptocurrency is a hotly debated topic, because that percentage is highly investor specific. Because cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are extremely unpredictable, balancing alternative assets as a slice of the pie in your investment portfolio is risky business. But there is a fairly reliable sweet spot for alternative investments, and it may be much smaller than many investors are tempted to bite into.","Investing more in cryptocurrency than you can afford to lose often has dire consequences, especially in an unpredictable and largely unregulated market. No matter your age or income bracket, you should never invest more money in cryptocurrency than you could stand to part with in an instant without flinching. Many around the world are learning this lesson the hard way. A wise cryptocurrency investment might provide a safety net, but it should never be glorified as a golden ticket.A good rule of thumb for investors seeking to balance their portfolios is to invest no more than 5 to 10% in cryptocurrency. Because the return on cryptocurrency is potentially monumental, even a small investment could yield big gains. And because the chances of losing your entire cryptocurrency investment might be slightly higher, you will suffer less for having invested so little.Make small investments in big coins.  Unless you’re a cryptocurrency connoisseur, it’s almost always better to invest in larger, older currencies, such as Bitcoin (considered digital gold) and Ethereum (considered digital silver). Smaller alternative currencies sold in limited initial coin offerings (ICOs) might seem like opportune investments because their newness and exclusivity promises investors a chance to “get in early.” But many of these coins are engineered as payment methods for entrepreneurial software platforms that never come to fruition, in which case all correlated currency would be rendered worthless.Use a tool the way it’s intended. Because it usually performs asymmetrically to traditional investments like stocks and bonds, cryptocurrency can be a smart tool to balance your portfolio. “Balance,” in this context must, of course, weigh risk. Because digital assets are generally, at present, considered much less stable, they are sufficient in much smaller doses. Many investors might be best-suited to invest even less than the standard 5 to 10% of their portfolio in alternative assets. I believe a 1 to 2% investment is advisable for many people.Commit to have and to “hodl.”When it comes to investing in cryptocurrency, age isn’t just a number. Though they may not have accrued as much wealth as those nearing retirement, millennials are more able to afford cryptocurrency’s inherent risk. A cursory litmus test for someone considering investing in cryptocurrency is whether or not they can speak the language.Last year, cryptocurrency slang word “hodl” was invoked in a Senate Banking Committee hearing by Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo, who classified cryptocurrency as a commodity because, “If you go on to the Twitter universe you’ll see a phrase ‘H-O-D-L,’ which means hold on for dear life.” He continued to describe his then 30-year-old niece, a cryptocurrency investor, as a hodl.The cryptocurrency language (and generation) gap may be slowly closing. However, as the founder of an international alternative investments firm, I don’t presently advise or authorize cryptocurrency investments for anyone over the age of 70, due to risk. Because cryptocurrency is still in its infancy, much like early AOL email and the Netscape 6 web browser, I believe only younger investors should purchase cryptocurrency, because they have much more time to hodl.It’s important to note that even though millennials are more familiar with cryptocurrency and better positioned to assume its inherent risk, they don’t always make smart investments. A growing number of college students using student loans to invest in cryptocurrency is cause for concern. Young investors should still invest with the long run (retirement) in mind.Remember the big picture.In the grand scheme, it’s important for any investor to avoid getting carried away with cryptocurrency’s glitz and glamour. Bitcoin isn’t the only asset that can perform well and potentially yield big returns. There are plenty of other fruitful investment opportunities. Designating a small sliver of your portfolio to cryptocurrency is the best way to balance risk with reward in a market that swings between extremes. If you lose, you only lose a small percentage, but if you win, you win big.The information provided here is not investment, tax or financial advice.

– ...","Aug 1, 2019,05:58pm EDT","Blockchain technology has become relevant to the market following the appearance of Bitcoin, as it represents its backbone and the innovation that makes digital currencies so exciting and full of potential.","Blockchain technology allows the transfer of data/assets/value between two parties while eliminating the need to rely on a third party to facilitate the said transfer. Therefore, it provides a trust layer that did not exist until now, for all types of transactions – as all members of the network have access to the same information via the ledger, thus making it easy for participants to verify and authenticate past transactions.In business-to-business scenarios, blockchain networks allow for increased trust between parties and instant access to relevant, authentic information. This is so thanks to the fact that blockchains provide a historical record of all transactions, alongside the means to record these entries.Blockchain TypesA single, universal blockchain network cannot possibly serve all industries, granted the vastly different needs of businesses, and individual users. This has led to the creation of numerous blockchain networks, each with a slightly different set of protocols, while the back pillars remain the same. Despite the vast number of blockchain networks available at this moment in time, the market has two types of blockchains: permissionless (public) and permissioned (private).Permissionless BlockchainsPermissionless blockchain networks power up most of the market’s digital currencies. They allow every user to create a personal address and begin interacting with the network, by submitting transactions, and hence adding entries to the ledger. Additionally, all parties have the choice of running a node on the system or employing the mining protocols to help verify transactions.In the case of Bitcoin, mining is done by solving complex mathematical equations which in return validate the transactions saved on the network – anyone is free to download the bitcoin blockchain and begin mining operations, in exchange for mining fees and block rewards.Additionally, for digital currencies such as Ethereum, the blockchain network also supports smart contracts, which are automated transactions that self-execute when specific criteria are met. As Ethereum also employs a permissionless blockchain, anyone can develop and add smart contracts onto the network, with no limitation imposed by the developers.Apart from allowing anyone to get involved in the network, there are few more characteristics associated with the permissionless model. These are:And, in the market, there are different examples of it as well. Cypherium is one of the public and permissionless network to deliver the speed and security of the HotStuff algorithm to its users. By nature, the HotStuff algorithm is permissioned, Cypherium amends HotStuff to become public and permissionless“Cypherium’s new CypherBFT consensus amends HotStuff so that users will be able to admit themselves without central administrative permission, making the network fully decentralized and permissionless. Of course, users will control their private keys, transact autonomously, and freely associate”. Said Sky Guo, Founder, and CEO Cypherium. It is an entirely permissionless and decentralized public blockchain. Users do not need the approval of any trusted authority to join the network and participate in the protocol. Anyone can use the blockchain to transact and participate in block generation. The data is public so that every participant can read every block. And every participant can write a transaction in a future block.On the other side, when we look at Facebook’s Libra, they just use this technology to speed up the communication between its handful of centralized, permissioned nodes. It seems it’s usage kind of primarily when thinking about the great network capacity that HotStuff enables. Also as Joseph Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum states  Libra ""is a centralized wolf in decentralized sheep's clothing”.Based on everything that has been outlined so far, permissionless blockchains are bound to be more open to users and tend to have very strict protocols. Transactions are usually verified by all nodes on the network using highly secure consensus protocols."

It is best known as the technology behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but it has lots of other potential uses—including the potential to revolutionize the HR industry. In particular, blockchain will transform the way companies hire temporary workers; in the near future, hiring reliable temps will be faster, easier and more efficient than ever.So what is blockchain? It’s a system where information is stored in batches, or blocks. These blocks are linked together in chronological order in a “chain.” Information contained in a block cannot be changed or deleted; rather, changes are stored in a new block. Copies of the blockchain are spread across a network of computers, which must also verify the information in each new block before it is added to the chain. This makes data stored in a blockchain extremely hard to tamper with. Blockchains can be public, private or a hybrid of both.All of this means that information stored on blockchain is secure, transparent and trusted—so how can it help make more efficient and effective workplaces?1. Hire reliable temporary workers fast Trusted job historyTemporary workers are the lifeblood of many modern-day companies, but sourcing reliable, efficient temps can often take as long as hiring full-time employees. If candidates are able to put their credentials on the blockchain, this could provide an easier way for staffing agencies to find and verify qualified temporary workers quickly and efficiently.Universities would upload degrees and certifications, and employers would upload job titles and dates. Other information such as a police background check could be added to the chain as well. Candidates would then be able to make these records available to staffing agencies. Because all of this information is verified at the source, recruiters wouldn’t need to spend time and resources calling previous managers to confirm the information. However, it’s important to note that this system would need to be on an opt-in basis. Any candidates uncomfortable with putting their information on the blockchain would need to be protected.Some startups are already working on developing tools for hiring agencies to make use of the blockchain. Recruit Technologies and Ascribe have teamed up to develop a blockchain resume authentication service for job hunters that would digitally verify official certificates and resumes. At the same time, it’s worth noting that it’s unlikely all employers and universities will adopt blockchain technology at once. HR professionals will still need to do their due diligence in verifying the histories of job candidates, making use of blockchain verification one part of a more thorough background check. In this sense, the blockchain will provide support to more traditional forms of background checking and will be a powerful new tool in the HR professionals’ arsenal.A digital IDWhen we use the internet, we leave a lot of information behind. Downloading and using a language app, wearing a smartwatch to track your exercise, or streaming your favorite show all leave a digital footprint. Today, many “everyday” items—including your car, your smart home hub and your fridge—may also be connected to the internet.This data can map our likes and dislikes, habits, skills and interests. Pulling this information onto blockchain could create a “digital dossier” of a candidate’s hiring potential by creating a more rounded picture of them than would be revealed by a cover letter or interview. For example, the data from a language app could tell more about a candidate’s language proficiency than a standardized test. Again, this wouldn’t replace the deep due diligence done by human HR professionals, but it could certainly enhance it.2. Easier and more effective salary payments If you have an international staff, you know that overseas payroll payments are expensive and inefficient. International bank transfers can take a long time to process, incur heavy bank charges, and experience currency exchange volatility, all of which cause a headache for both the employer and employee.But payment transfers through blockchain could simplify international payroll. By partnering with banks and payment services around the world, Bitwage transfers money into bitcoin, which can then be paid out in local currencies. Payments are fast and have very low transaction fees, roughly 1% compared to an average of 8% for bank transfers. Moreover, as the payment is transferred via bitcoin, the payment can be tracked so you know staff received their wages.A similar pilot project is having a positive impact for migrant workers in Thailand. Everex, an Asian blockchain startup, helped 100 employees from Myanmar transfer money home instantly, without transaction fees, which are usually around 7% total.Gender pay gapA Pew Research Center study of average hourly earnings of both full- and part-time employees in the USA found that women earned 18% less than men in 2017. In the same year, the global average pay for women was $12,000 compared with $21,000 for men.Blockchain could address this huge pay gap by making salaries and work performance more transparent. As workplaces introduce more connected devices—such as door and lighting sensors, telepresence technology and wearables—more data will be available that can track employee performance. Employers will be able to track the number of hours worked, meetings scheduled and attended, and projects progressed. This would make it easier to align pay with performance.Additionally, salaries and bonuses will be more transparent if they are put on an open blockchain, which could make differences in pay open to scrutiny.3. Help employers outsource tasksNew startups are showcasing the possibilities of bitcoin for outsourcing work. For example, Earn.com lets people earn cryptocurrency by replying to emails and completing tasks. After creating a profile on the platform, users join lists matched to their skill sets and interests (there is a list for Python programmers, for example). Based on this information, they start receiving targeted paid “microtasks,” such as completing surveys from recruiters, startups and researchers who can set the number of participants they need and how much money they are willing to spend.Taking the idea one step further, workplaces could use the power of blockchain to track work outsourced to independent or freelance staff, having a verified and tracked record of completed tasks. This would increase the transparency and trust between both employers and employees.Most of these startups are still in the early stages of building and scaling their product, and it’s still early days for blockchain overall. However, I’m excited to try these new technologies for my own businesses when they become widely available. It might not happen overnight, but blockchain has the potential to completely transform the HR & staffing industry. The companies that will be most successful in the next 5, 10 or 20 years will be the ones who not only adapt to but also embrace and welcome that change."

(Anthony Kwan/Bloomberg)","As the CFO and Chief Product Officer of a late-stage private company now valued at $22.5 billion, Will Gaybrick is no stranger to the challenges that all startups face when trying to scale their business. Gaybrick’s company Stripe, offers software that allows companies and individuals to quickly set up online billing and payment systems on their respective websites. In less than a decade, the company has managed to simplify and streamline payments for clients ranging from small startups to large corporate behemoths including Spotify, Lyft, Deliveroo, Kickstarter and Slack.Founded in 2010 by brothers John and Patrick Collison, Stripe began as a startup catering to other startups. Startups, in general, represent a particularly challenging customer base for any type of service provider because while they are willing to experiment with new technologies, they also move extremely quickly, which can be very demanding. As time went on, many of the companies that Stripe first partnered with grew to become large public companies. It was then that Gaybrick realized the true mission of Stripe was not catering specifically to startups but to the single basic need of all companies regardless of size–growing revenue.“So we started with these startups, and over time we found that we weren't actually catering to startups. We were catering to companies with ambition. So that framework of ‘grow your revenue faster with less effort’ is sort of a guiding principle across our user base,” Gaybrick explains.Startup strugglesAny entrepreneur will tell you that because of the internet and technology, it's easier now to build a business than it ever has been. From a purely financial perspective, the cost of starting a business has gone down by an order of magnitude over the last decade. At the same time, regulations have been tightening and it is actually harder now to deal with the regulators responsible for starting companies, especially in Hong Kong. One of the biggest pain points that many entrepreneurs have locally is opening a simple bank account. Other struggles include setting up a payment processor, finding a merchant bank and being able to collect payments on a global scale. These are precisely the kinds of problems that Stripe aims to solve for their users around the world. “Over a third of companies here in Hong Kong have reported that it's getting harder rather than easier to internationalize their businesses and to be a cross-border business,"" says Gaybrick. ""At the same time, nearly 90% of online businesses here in Hong Kong are cross-border businesses or operating in multiple geographies or geographies outside of Hong Kong. So investing in making that easier is obviously a highly leveraged and powerful investment.”By forming deep partnerships and working directly with regulators, Stripe has found success in finding the right balance between protecting consumers and businesses while allowing companies to grow. Asia’s global economyGaybrick says one of the most important themes for Stripe as a company is globalization. The company remains incredibly optimistic about Asia as a whole and launched a dedicated engineering hub in Singapore, which now staffs over 100 employees. Taking into account the strong population growth of the developing economies in Asia, Gaybrick describes a “perfect storm” of commerce that will soon hit the internet in the next several years and the subsequent challenges associated with tackling this next wave. “Only about half the population of APAC is online today. And you have about half a billion people across India and Southeast Asia coming online over the next couple of years,"" says Gaybrick.  ""In order to serve users globally, we actually have to be hyper, hyper local. You have payment methods cropping up all over the region. You have Alipay, WeChat Pay dominant in China. You've got GO-PAY ubiquitous in Indonesia. You've got Grab doing amazing things with Grab Financial and GrabPay. You've got Paytm and Google Pay leading the way in India. And we have to work with all of these and take a lot of the complexity out of the equation for our users.”The future of paymentsStripe was one of the first major payment players to allow bitcoin as a form of payment. However after taking the time to gather feedback from their users, the company quickly scaled back due the underlying volatility risk and costs associated with the cryptocurrency. While Gaybrick still sees a lot of promise in cryptocurrencies, bitcoin itself didn’t work well as a payment instrument. Whether cryptocurrencies will have a role in payments of the future remains uncertain, but Gaybrick admits the company is monitoring the space closely. On a broader level, however, Gaybrick remains extremely optimistic about the future of payments. In the twenty five years since the internet went mainstream, “only about 8% of commerce has come online and we’ve barely scratched the surface,” explains Gaybrick. “If you think about phases of the internet, you had the first phase that was really about organizing information,"" he says. ""The second phase was about social connections—companies like Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter and WeChat. I think we're now into the third phase, which is where you're going to really see the commercial internet come of age, and the convening and coordinating power of the internet drive new economic connections online. I also think we'll look back in five years and be almost embarrassed by some of the rails that the economy runs on today.”In the meantime, Stripe will continue to do what they do best—leverage the coordinating power of the internet to let buyers and sellers, who wouldn't otherwise ever find each other, transact. With a fresh $100m investment from Tiger Global Management, Stripe’s future is bright as they rapidly scale their product line and services internationally.  "

Yet these currencies aren’t natural phenomena.People created them. People can also abandon them for something else, just as they abandoned older currencies.There are good reasons to think we could once again see some fiat currencies disappear. If so, what “something else” will be money in the future?I can hear the chorus now: Fiat currencies come and go, but gold is forever. And now there is a drumbeat for cryptocurrencies.Five years ago, I said that I expected to see a commodity-backed cryptocurrency to eventually emerge and potentially become the currency of the future.Facebook’s recently announced Libra project may eventually be one. But at this point, it’s really just an idea, and I am not convinced it is ready for primetime.Trust IssuesLibra is Facebook’s idea, but the company—obviously aware it has public trust issues—has assembled a consortium to manage the project.This “Libra Association” currently has 28 members. They are mostly payment processors, tech and telecom providers, venture capital managers, and a few nonprofits. Facebook itself is represented by a newly formed subsidiary, Calibra.Unlike Bitcoin, Libra won’t be “mined” by solving math problems. It will be fully backed by financial assets, which the association says will consist of cash in various currencies, government bonds, and similar short-term debt.All will go into a “Libra Reserve” as users contribute money, and each Libra unit will be a share of that account. Its value will fluctuate against conventional currencies, but not by much (or so they hope).How do you know the reserve assets are really there? This requires a lot of trust, something Facebook hasn’t exactly earned from the public it supposedly serves. But MasterCard or Visa? Since most of us have at least one of their cards, we seem to trust them.Another problem is that Facebook uses your data in unexpected ways most of us would never consent to if it specifically asked us, which it doesn’t. Not to mention the large, profitable firm’s seeming inability to securely store our data.With this in mind, Mark Zuckerberg is making some gestures toward segregating Libra customer information from the Facebook social network. I’m not sure it will be enough to satisfy the public, not to mention politicians and regulators around the globe.Know Your CustomerLibra faces another challenge that may be even greater. Much of the “unbanked” economy likes being in the shadows.People use cash and cryptocurrencies as part of tax evasion, fraud, crime, or terrorist plots. Facebook says it doesn’t want to facilitate such activity. But how to stop it?Regulators have forced the banking industry to adopt robust “know your customer” practices. You must identify yourself to open an account. Banks report any suspicious activity to the authorities. It is a pain for legitimate businesses and investors, but a necessary one.US and European regulators may not demand that level of scrutiny from Libra, but they will certainly impose some requirements. There is no way they will let it turn into anything like Bitcoin.Facebook has millions of fake accounts engaged in all sorts of less-than-honest activities. That’s core to its business model, actually; more eyeballs mean more revenue. The firm is beginning to police the audience more rigorously, but its sincerity is questionable at best.So the Libra project’s DNA, so to speak, tells it to a) collect lots of data b) not worry too much about its accuracy, and then c) use the data to make money. That is inconsistent with the way Libra will have to operate, if it is to do so legally, as Facebook and its partners say is their intent.Security IssuesBut say Libra implements whatever safeguards the various governments demand. That still leaves it holding a lot of sensitive, private information about people’s assets, spending habits, travel, and more.Can we a) trust Libra to keep the data out of Facebook’s clutches, and b) trust Libra, Facebook, and whoever else is involved to protect it from cyberthieves?Just look at all the data breaches that have occurred at large, supposedly sophisticated banks and other institutions that spent billions protecting their systems. Is Libra going to invest that kind of money on security? If so, where will it come from?Where’s the Money?Libra itself intends to make revenue from the “float” on its assets. In theory, you will give your dollars or euros to Libra and they will convert it into a basket of currencies, banking assets, and so forth.The organization will live off the interest, paying you nothing while (you hope) not using your information to its own benefit.Let’s go back to that stable coin concept. A basket of currencies is not very stable. Fortunately for me, my friends at Gavekal took the trouble to measure the stability of both the dollar and the IMF’s Special Drawing Rights (SDR).They found that for at least US dollar holders, the dollar would’ve been more stable. It even works out that way for holders of the Indian rupee and other currencies. (Of course, if you live in a country like Venezuela, Libra may be a godsend for you, if you can figure out how to get some.)
Source: Gavekal ResearchSo, if Libra isn’t going to pay me any interest and it’s not really a great store of value, what’s my motivation to “invest?”Tough Road AheadSo, Libra has a tough row to hoe. We’ll see how it goes. But the point remains: Fiat currencies aren’t working so well, either. What would work better?I continue to think a properly designed, well-regulated commodity-backed cryptocurrency is the best option. But it can only work if governments allow it. They don’t need to ban alternative currencies; governments have many ways to render them impractical.For instance, in the US, the IRS considers Bitcoin an “investment.” Any change in its value between the time you acquire it and the time you spend it is a capital gain or loss.Tracking that for every cup of coffee you buy would be a chore. Libra will likely face this same problem.And speaking of taxes, the IRS accepts only dollars. You must have enough of them to pay your taxes.Similarly, the government pays its millions of workers and contractors in dollars. Ditto Social Security and other benefits. An enormous part of the economy won’t use any Libra-like alternative money. This will further limit its growth.Those barriers will fall eventually, but it won’t be tomorrow. I think we will see a lot of experimentation in the next decade. New money is coming. We just don’t know what it will be.Throwing Down the GauntletAll that being said, I wouldn’t bet against Libra actually making it. While I’m a tad skeptical of our privacy in Facebook’s hands, hundreds of millions if not billions of Millennials won’t even think about it.And if you are one of the major banks that has been working on a blockchain cryptocurrency? Many are doing so.Facebook’s just sounded the starting gun. And they are doing the banks the courtesy of running the regulatory gauntlet first. Will that give Facebook a first-mover advantage? Hard to say.Remember MySpace? Not all first movers are created equal.I predict an unprecedented crisis that will lead to the biggest wipeout of wealth in history. And most investors are completely unaware of the pressure building right now. Learn more here."

And they are betting that students will follow.Meeting Rising DemandAs technological changes are racing forward, businesses are compelled to reinvent themselves and are desperately looking for trained workers who will help them keep up and adapt to this new work revolution. “The demand for graduates and the skills they have has changed profoundly,” says David Yermack, professor of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency at New York University’s Stern School of Business, the first U.S. college to offer the major. “There is great interest from companies such as JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, Bank of America and so forth, who realize that if they don’t incorporate technology into their business models, they will be at great risk of becoming irrelevant.” Cornell University is a leading Ivy League when it comes to crypto and higher education — it offers one of the largest selections of crypto-related courses. The 28 courses offered on the subject include ""Anthropology of Money,"" which explores “the social and cultural meanings of numbers, mobile money, cryptocurrency, and other alternative currency systems,” according to the course description.Also known as a hub for blockchain discovery, Stanford University opened its Center for Blockchain Research last fall. It’s location as the locus of Silicon Valley’s academic and entrepreneurial scene puts the school in an enviable position to offer world-class conferences for the crypto community. It is no surprise, however, that the vast majority of the workforce does not have the access to these programs or the sophisticated skills that companies need.While 69% of employers say they would favor job candidates with proficiency in data science, only 23% of educators say their students will have those skills by the time they graduate, according to a poll conducted by Gallup.But the tide is turning. Students appear to be closely following the signals from the labor market, with universities seeing increased enrollment in their tech programs. In 2015, when UC Berkeley first offered their course on Foundations of Data Science, also known as Data 8, 100 students signed up for it. By this spring, enrollment dramatically increased to around 1,500 students, and the course has even been adopted by community colleges, such as San Jose City College, who are starting to incorporate data science into their curriculum.“Data 8 is hugely popular. We are just trying to keep up with it,” says Paul Alivisatos, the executive vice chancellor and provost at UC Berkeley. Other universities are launching new centers that seek to address the demands from specific areas within data science, such as the University of West Florida, which recently launched its Center for Cybersecurity.Cybersecurity is a rapidly-evolving field and it has become a national security issue for the United States since there are more than 300,000 unfilled cybersecurity jobs across the nation, according to Cybersecurity Ventures.“Our university wanted to develop a center that could connect with the community and offer innovative solutions that meet real world needs, meet the growing cybersecurity workforce crisis and that can move at a much more rapid pace compared to traditional academic programs,” says Eman El-Sheikh, director of the center.However, while universities strive to open more routes to jobs within the data science sector, they also face the challenge of finding and retaining qualified faculty who can teach it. For example, Yermack says that because cryptocurrency and blockchain are such new topics and most professors are tenured, they may not be anxious to learn new material. But many others are lured into the private sector by the shortage of qualified candidates and the ensuing lucrative salaries. According to a 2018 study by Burtch Works, a leading recruiting firm, the median salary for a data scientist can be as high as $250,000.“Developing incentives that will keep talent and expertise within academia is equally important,” says El-Sheikh.Data Science Beyond TechWith 95% of employers saying that data science skills are hard to find, the need for data-savvy workers extends beyond the tech industry.“More fields want to incorporate data science because important developments in statistics, computation and artificial intelligence have led to a point where diverse data sources can be integrated together to create a more meaningful picture,” Alivisatos says.There has been a 52% growth in the number of accredited programs in data science and analytics since 2010, the Business Higher Education Forum reports. And nearly 25% of open faculty jobs at UC Berkeley are looking for applicants who will analyze data science through the humanities, sciences and engineering fields.A multidisciplinary approach will rise as a hallmark in data science education as universities increase the amount of departments that offer classes on the subject..This fall, MIT will launch the Schwarzman College of Computing, a $1 billion investment that represents an ambitious initiative to equip students in the field of artificial intelligence and educate them to consider the ethical and societal responsibilities that come with the powerful tools of computing.Julie Shah, associate professor in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT, says that the college is meant to facilitate the types of interdisciplinary opportunities and collaborations for the benefit of the larger enterprise.“Computing is changing the nature of how we do research, how we do science, how we do engineering across every discipline,” she says. “The tools coming out of it provide new opportunities and methods of inquiry for everything from biology and chemistry and into the social sciences and the humanities.”The high demand in data science is not only creating new professional disciplines, but it is also transforming the practice of established fields of study. Such initiatives will allow students to graduate with high levels of data proficiency, regardless of their majors and equip them for the jobs openings that are in desperate need of being filled.“Graduates do not only go into tech⁠ — they go all around different disciplines and that’s what makes it so exciting for the students,” says Alivisatos. “There might be areas low in data science and there are even whole aspects of careers that can be created once you have these kinds of foundational tools in your tool belt.”"

Wannacry",https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/08/02/two-years-later-windows-xp-devices-can-still-make-the-health-care-industry-wannacry/,"More than mere bitcoin-induced bankruptcy, the escalating issue with 
installing so many patches to your systems becomes clear with stack ...","Aug 2, 2019,07:15am EDT","In May of 2017, health care facilities experienced one of the most damaging and quickly widespread viruses of all time. Within hours, the contagion had claimed over hundreds of thousands of victims across 150 countries.","I’m not talking about Ebola or a new, hyper-transmittable version of influenza. The virus I’m referring to that achieved such infamous notoriety just over two years ago was aptly named WannaCry. WannaCry took aim at the machines in these buildings that were running Windows legacy operating systems, which, in turn, threatened the privacy and data security of people visiting hospitals and doctors’ offices around the world. The vulnerability of those machines did extend to critical medical devices like infusion pumps, EKG monitors, medical imaging technology and others.Well, at least that’s over… or is it?Looking Backward And Forward Although many of us think of WannaCry in a historical context, the truth is that copycat versions of it remain a profoundly viable threat. Its spread was initially halted due to the discovery of a killswitch within days of its release. Like a particularly nasty drug-resistant bacteria, however, the attack has evolved, and new strains of the virus still pose an immediate threat to vulnerable devices all over the world.Yes, it looks as though history is once again bound to repeat itself. After all, 71% of medical devices still run on those older OS versions, namely Windows 7, Windows 2008, and Windows Mobile. ""WannaCry — the most damaging cyberattack of 2017 — continues effectively unabated, with at least 3,500 successful attacks per hour, globally,"" TechRepublic author James Sanders writes, citing research from Armis. ""The research estimates that 145,000 devices worldwide continue to be infected, noting that 'a single WannaCry infected device can be used by hackers to breach your entire network.'""Targeted attacks on health care organizations are on the rise because it’s easy for hackers to monetize personal health information (PHI) on the dark web. Even worse, they can cripple a medical staff’s ability to deliver patient care by shutting down access to critical systems and patient records. Last year was a record-breaking year for data breaches and continuing at an unprecedented level. April 2019 was the worst month ever for health care data breaches, according to a recent study by Carbon Black.Protecting PHI data is a must for the health care industry, and the expanding internet of things (IoT) has made this requirement much more difficult to achieve. Consider that everything, from pharmacy vending machines that dispense correct dosages for medications to the electronic cash registers in hospital cafes, is severely vulnerable due to the increased attack surface from older Windows operating systems.Microsoft has become so concerned that another attack of epic scale could soon occur, they released a security patch for Windows XP, which hasn’t been supported in over four years. This only speaks to the critical nature of the threat posed by WannaCry and WannaCry wannabes.Suppose you’re an IT administrator at a health care facility, and you’ve successfully installed the security patch that prevents similar ransomware from disabling your systems until you pay a hefty ransom in bitcoin to get up and running again. That’s great, but what happens next year when another version of the devastating attack surfaces? What happens the year after that?  Malware such as this creates a vicious and unrelenting circle of difficulty. After all, how much bitcoin can you possibly come up with?More than mere bitcoin-induced bankruptcy, the escalating issue with installing so many patches to your systems becomes clear with stack fatigue. Adding endless layers of security policies and firewalls only adds complexity to your network, which results in an added need for IT expertise, greater cost and a bloated environment that can impede innovation due to its unwieldy functionality and inefficiency.Installing endless security patches to address every new piece of malware is akin to a dog chasing its tail... an old, overweight dog.How to Avoid Exposure?Rather than endlessly chasing your tail by trying to keep up with every security patch that addresses every new system hack, place your faith in modern technology that can put an end to the insanity.Traditional IT solutions can’t keep up with all the ""things"" such as infusion pumps, PACS systems, EKG monitors and more that require connectivity to hospital networks, nor match the security, intuitive orchestration and low-cost nature of modern networking. Not all networks are equal, though. When choosing a solution, IT leaders must look for these key capabilities:1. Segmentation and cloaking (the ability to hide your IP address) of wired/wireless devices — down to individual device — to shield from threats and downtime.2. The ability to provide granular (to a specific device or machine) network access for authorized clinicians, technical support staff or vendors3. The capability to readily isolate non-critical care devices (building controls, point of sale technology, vending machines, etc.) on a shared network.One such version of networking exists in the recent breakthrough of Host Identity Protocol (HIP) technology, which addresses the inherent flaw of TCP/IP networking that is the root cause of the WannaCry outbreak and virtually every other form of cybercrime.HIP effectively separates the flawed duality of the IP address also serving as a device’s identity. By inserting HIP within the TCP/IP model, it eliminates this overlooked security loophole that has plagued safe and efficient networking for decades.Solutions via HIP-enabled networks could be a great fit for health care and other industries relying on legacy systems because no tear-down of existing architecture is necessary. Legacy operating systems are just as compatible as the latest and greatest system in the most modern environment.Who Wants To Cry Now?We recently passed the two-year anniversary of the attack that caught so many unsuspecting health care users by surprise. Don’t let more ransomware and other malicious acts of cybercrime make you WannaCry any longer. Instead, take advantage of recent advances in technology and seek out optimal networking, with baked-in security, cloaking and mobility. Then, the question for hackers becomes, “Do you WannCry now?”"

It is even routinely used as a verb. Under 1031, if you exchange real estate for 'like-kind' real estate, gain is postponed until you sell your replacement property. Starting in 2018, swaps of Bitcoin for Ethereum, exchanges of private aircraft, paintings, or coin collections don’t qualify. Only real estate qualifies, and it must be of like-kind. It has to be business or investment property, not your personal residence. Still, like-kind is actually pretty widely interpreted. Improved real estate can be exchanged for unimproved real estate. And city real estate can be exchanged for a ranch or farm. ","Real estate signs advertise the sale of three homes in a row in Encinitas, Calif. Thursday, July 13, ... [+] 2006. (AP Photo/Denis Poroy)The replacement property must be identified within 45 days after the transfer of the relinquished property. Then, the closing of the replacement must occur by the earlier of: (1) 180 days after the date of the transfer of the relinquished property; or (2) the due date (including extensions) of the transferor’s tax return for the tax year in which the transfer of the relinquished property occurs. Section 1031 requires relinquished property be exchanged for replacement property, but the IRS allows the use of qualified intermediaries (QIs). The QI sells the property for cash, uses the cash to purchase the replacement property, and transfers the replacement property to the taxpayer. There are tricky rules about debt, equity, and “boot.” Under Section 1031, boot is any form of property other than like-kind property that is transferred in a Section 1031 exchange, such as cash, personal property, and the assumption of liabilities. You generally have to recognize taxable income to the extent you receive any ""boot"" in a Section 1031 exchange. However, you can generally offset some types of boot received with certain types of boot paid. The general rule is that if the boot received is the assumption of a liability, it can be offset by any type of boot paid, whether cash, other property, or the assumption of a liability. Even so, if the boot received is cash or other property, then it cannot be offset by the assumption of a liability. A mortgage payoff at closing is generally treated as the assumption of a liability — i.e., a receipt of boot — even though the buyer may not be taking the property subject to the mortgage. Although the taxpayer can offset this receipt of boot, the general rule is that the offset must be in the form of a mortgage on the replacement property in an amount equal to or greater than the debt on the relinquished property. Any cash the taxpayer receives as a result of the exchange will also be treated as the receipt of boot.When a taxpayer walks away from an exchange with cash due to an increase in mortgage debt, the taxpayer may have taxable boot. Some taxpayers place a mortgage on the replacement property after (and independent of) a Section 1031 exchange. Some commentators have suggested that as long as a later mortgage is truly independent of the exchange (in form and substance), the cash taken out should not be treated as boot.Complications can arise where multiple states are involved. For example, issues may arise where California real estate is substituted for non-California real estate, or when taxpayers change their state of residency after an exchange. If the taxpayer is a California resident, then all of the taxpayer’s income is generally taxable by California, regardless of its source. California does conform to Sections 1031, and the golden state does not require that the replacement property also be located in California. Thus, California allows for deferral of gains that are realized on like-kind exchanges and involuntary conversions. However, if the replacement property is out-of-state, California aggressively tracks when the replacement is ultimately sold. When the replacement property is sold, California treats the gain as California source income to the extent of the original deferred gain.  That is so even if you no longer live in California and if you are selling the non-California property twenty years later. A number of other states follow this rule, but California may be the most aggressive in enforcing it.To enforce it, California has a special reporting requirement on taxpayers who do Section 1031 exchanges and acquire out-of-state replacement property. California requires you to file an annual information return (Form 3840) every year until the deferred gain from the Section 1031 exchange is ultimately recognized. When the taxpayer ultimately sells the out-of-state property, California will treat any gain as California-source income to the extent of the gain deferred on the original exchange. Obviously, the state where the property is located (and your then home state of residence) will also want to tax at least some of the gain. Some states will tax this gain only if it represents appreciation that occurred in their state. However, there may be risks of the second state being overly aggressive and trying to tax the entire gain. If the taxpayer is a California resident at that point, the sourcing rules will generally be irrelevant. In that case, the entire gain will be subject to tax in California. You might be allowed a credit for taxes paid to the other state. If you are a California nonresident at the time of the sale, then you may be subject to tax in both states on a nonresident basis. Bottom line, Section 1031 allows you to swap real estate tax free, but it can be tricky. Apart from the unforgiving 45 and 180-day requirements, many 1031 exchanges are confused when it comes to debt on either or both sides of the transaction. Big dollars can hang in the balance.This is not legal advice. For tax alerts or tax advice, email me at Wood@WoodLLP.com."

Not all Special Needs Plans are available all over country.For in-home care, homemaker and home health aides often run about $4,000 a month each with the per-hour rate close to $20. Medicaid can be an option for a dementia plagued senior 65 and over with yearly income of up to 100 percent of poverty (close to $13,000), depending on the state, Hounsell and Beedon added.A particularly attractive Medicaid component for dementia patients in some states are long-term services and supports (LTSS).LTSS can provide a nursing facility equivalent of care in a home, in the community or in a facility.Common sense can ease the financial pain for family caregivers as well, Hounsell and Beedon asserted.Caregivers are setting themselves up for trouble in the near-term and the long-term if they don’t make their own finances a priority, they warned.Family members are advised to ease the financial strain not paying for the dementia patient’s everyday expenses,such as purchases at the grocery and drugstore and by avoiding trying to pay for everything for the relative when they can’t afford it.The obligation for the son or daughter of a senior with dementia can be legal, as well as emotional.Here is a list of the 30 states that require adult children to care for their parents from The New York Times along with citations of the laws that an attorney can view to tell you your specific responsibilities:The laws haven’t been enforced as much as they could be but that could change as long term care rise, Hounsell and Beedon said."

I heard from some of the top people in business and politics, learned about the pros and cons of investing in bitcoin and the marijuana industry, and met individuals whose companies and organizations are making a huge impact for good in the world.With so many companies nowadays professing to be pro this or that and touting that their company is helping to change the world, it's hard to know which companies are making a difference. That's why I wanted to give some attention to four companies you might not have heard of that I feel are worth supporting.The mission of Operation Underground Railroad is to rescue children from sex trafficking. The nonprofit organization does this through coordinated rescue efforts as well as recovery planning. O.U.R. was founded five years ago and in that time it has rescued 2,603 victims and played a role in the arrest of over 1,000 traffickers across the globe. With human traffic on the rise in all 50 states and slated to surpass the sale of drugs in the next few years. The mission of O.U.R. is more important than ever. Donations to Operation Underground Railroad are used to fund rescue missions and technology.Khan Academy aims to provide a free, world-class education for everyone everywhere, regardless of background or financial circumstance. The nonprofit offers courses in math, grammar, science, history, SAT prep, AP prep and more, as well as resources for teachers, school districts and parents to help their students succeed. Khan Academy says one of the main keys to its success is that it provides a personalized learning experience -- students work to fill in gaps in their understanding and advance their knowledge at their own pace. As of 2017, Khan Academy had over 60 million registered users and provided learning materials in more than 30 languages and in over 190 countries.If you want to donate to Khan Academy to help it with its mission to provide educational tools to millions of children around the world, you can rest easy knowing your funds are going to the right place -- a full 87% of its funding goes toward program costs.The Female Quotient is working to advance equality in the workplace. It does this by bringing women together at pop-up experiences at conferences, corporations and college campuses; helping businesses become a more equal place through boot camps, as well as data and research that shows why equality can be a good return-on-investment; and giving back to nonprofits that support women through its sales of clothing and jewelry.One of the best ways to become involved with The Female Quotient is to become a mentor through its program to help other women advance in their workplace and to do what you can to promote equality in your own workplace. If you're interested in collaborating with The Female Quotient, visit the company's website to get connected.Medical treatments have not always been the most compassionate, convenient, or affordable. But, there are companies with the help of their CEOs trying to change the face of medical care. As CEO of 21st Century Oncology, Kim Commins-Tzoumakas is one of them who is making a difference. She has been part of the company since 2014. Kim is leveraging her healthcare thought leadership to transform how the company delivers cancer care. Intent on making a difference in underserved areas like rural communities, the organization is bringing cancer treatment to these patients. Rather than traveling to big city hospitals and research facilities, cancer patients can remain with their friends and family as they undergo treatment.In return, these cancer patients get access to advanced technology, the latest treatments, and care from the nation’s top cancer specialists. It’s this focus on the human factor that has also set this organization apart. In fact, cancer patients report that they feel good going into these clinics.

Yes, they can cure certain infections or control chronic conditions, but there is a reason some pharmaceuticals cannot be bought over the counter. Regulation is key and processes exist to protect patients from adverse events. It is an ever-evolving landscape and continuous improvement and vigilance is crucial. That said, no system is perfect, and we have much to fix.","It is by no means an exaggeration to say there is an opioid crisis in the U.S. More than 42,000 deaths in 2016 were as a direct result of overdose of these drugs  – 40% of those involving a prescription. A 2017 survey on drug use and health estimated 11.4 million people misused prescription opioids. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the total ""economic burden"" of prescription opioid misuse alone in the United States is $78.5 billion a year, including the costs of healthcare, lost productivity, addiction treatment, and criminal justice involvement. And the problem is not confined to North America. Globally, it is estimated that 27 million people suffered from opioid use disorders in 2016.Analgesics aside, there are many other groups of medications that can cause serious harm – both to individuals and at a global level. The European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) published a study in 2015 which estimates that about 33000 people die each year as a direct consequence of an infection due to bacteria resistant to antibiotics in the EU/EEA. Whilst we would love to give bacteria all of the credit, there is good evidence that antibiotic stewardship and prescribing practices are somewhat to blame. Antibiotic use has risen by 6.5% in the past four years in the UK and estimates suggest that as many as half of all patients who visit their family doctor with a cough or cold leave with a prescription for antibiotics. Viruses cause many of these infections, meaning antibiotics are of no use.It’s not just inappropriate prescribing that is encouraging resistance to the drugs. The way people use antibiotics is also a big problem. Skipping doses, sharing medication with others and stopping courses early also contribute significantly. Education alone is insufficient to meet the challenges of medication mishaps. We may not be able to control patient behaviour, but all should be done to ensure the systems are designed with safety in mind.
For decades, prescriptions have been written on paper. While this method is certainly easier for doctors, it presents many risks which need to be mitigated. The use of e-prescribing is up 500% in the U.S. since 2015. Though the UK and Europe are lagging in adoption, there is a significant drive to make Electronic Prescribing Systems (EPS) the norm.International evidence shows that EPS may improve the safety of inpatient medicines management processes, reduce medication errors and, to a lesser extent, reduce adverse drug events. However, unintended consequences, including new errors, may occur. Evidence on the effects of EPS on workflow is limited and in my experience, e-prescribing can add significant time and administrative burden for busy doctors.Of course, as with many hospital IT systems, the issue of data silos and interoperability remains. In-hospital prescribing systems are generally isolated from local pharmacies and family physician practices. The medicines data landscape is fragmented, and programs are underway to improve the understanding of use, spend, safety and effectiveness of drugs in the NHS. An estimated 237m medication errors occur in the NHS in England every year and the estimated NHS cost of definitely avoidable adverse drug reactions is £98.5m per year, consuming 181,626 bed days, causing 712 deaths, and contributing to 1,708 deaths. There is certainly good reason to make improvements.There are clearly potentially great advantages to electronic prescriptions.Incorrect spelling, dosing or inappropriate medications can be filtered out. Patients can’t add a zero onto the Morphine dose or photocopy the prescription for their friend. An electronic record allows for inventory management, audit trails, research possibilities and cost analysis. Digital signatures enable accountability, enhanced security and when checked against the database of licensed prescribers can help reduce fraudulent activity.But like all things digital, there are several hurdles to overcome. Centralised systems are single points of failure, suffer down-time and can be hacked and altered. The user interface may not be intuitive, and the system may not link to the myriad of other related patient information systems in the practice or hospital.My own family doctor surgery does input prescriptions on a computer – only to print out a paper copy for me to take to the pharmacy. They do also have an electronic system where prescriptions can be sent to a nominated pharmacy, but knowing when this has been authorised, has arrived, been reviewed and is ready for collection often remains a mystery. It is not uncommon to need to make several phone calls to both organisations to track down the status of repeat medications. Also, the nominated pharmacy may have received the prescription but not have stock of the medication in store. A fact to be discovered after a wasteful journey in the car.In an ideal world, all participants along the value chain would have access to a real-time, unalterable record of the status of prescriptions, medication inventory and use. To achieve this, we would need data from pharmaceutical company production facilities, pharmacies, hospitals, doctors, patients and ultimately a view of the way drugs are disposed.It would be fanciful to imagine a system like this to develop overnight. Notwithstanding resistance from incumbents, costing and building a centralised system for something like this is unlikely to occur without top down mandates from governments. Trust between participants and willingness to share data are equally obstacles to progress with this model.It should not come as a surprise to the astute reader that this article might suggest distributed ledger technology (DLT) or blockchain as a possible part of the solution. Consider the value proposition:Pharmaceutical firms have begun dipping their toe in this water with pilot studies in the drug supply chain. The ability to track and trace medication from materials in the ground to pills being dispensed promises to add significant value to the reduction in counterfeits as well as bring innumerable efficiencies to the relevant parties. Digital asset provenance, however, is certainly not infallible. It remains possible to track a rock in a box labelled as penicillin from source to destination. That said, DLT does enable a log of transactions that helps pinpoint the accountable culprit along the chain. The immutability and decentralised nature of the record makes it virtually impossible for nefarious actors to alter the general consensus.The solutions that are currently being developed could equally link into the prescribing systems for useful inventory feedback. Near real-time views of the state of the chain could have a significant impact on how supply and demand are managed, with rich data sets that may bring enormous insights over time.Of course, the data collection doesn’t need to end when the medications have been dispensed. The consumption chain (a phrase coined by a respected Catena colleague, Bedie Moran) is equally important in the circular economy. Part of that cycle is where unused or near-expiry drugs can be repurposed.Bedie’s work with Remedichain as Chief Strategy Officer and Director of International Relations, highlights an incredibly valuable program where unused meds are re-distributed to areas of need with economic benefits for all stakeholders. Unbelievably, an estimated $100 billion of medication is destroyed each year in the U.S. (up to 20% of manufactured medications!).On the consumer side of this equation, there are other advantages for using DLT. Prescriptions are valuable items, and what better way to exchange value electronically than as digital assets on a blockchain? Smart contracts can facilitate repeats and consensus mechanisms keeps the system in check. And with patient-centric care becoming more of a focus, control and choice become incredibly important.Once added to a record, a prescription’s ownership can be transferred from physician to patient for use at a pharmacy of their choice. Then, after the digital asset has been exchanged for a physical one, the token can be sent to a blockchain address where it can no longer be spent. There are many technical options for how this can be achieved, but the end result should be peer-to-peer transfer of ownership of a digital asset with no possibility of double spending or fraud.Reconciliation in this system is again virtually instantaneous and a full audit trail with all the granular data sharing features become feasible. It goes without saying that there are efficiencies, cost savings and potential new revenue models that emerge with this method.Pharmeum, with Zain Rana as CEO (disclosure, I am advising them on medical strategy) has built such a system and incorporates AI to improve safety and to generate clinical insights. Scalamed and Blockmedx are claiming to provide similar solutions and all are in their very early stages.The final dream state involves coordination across the supply chain, and this will probably take a decade to be realised, if at all. In spite of this, I believe DLT is a good place to start.Blockchain/distributed ledgers are not a panacea for these serious challenges. As standalone products they are unlikely to replace the legacy systems and cure all ills. As with many emerging technologies, we will have technical and cultural hurdles to overcome before any significant adoption can occur. The solutions will probably incorporate many elements in a technology stack which include AI, IoT, DLT and systems already in use.The push for digitised health is important. There is much to be gained from machine learning, big data sets and coordinated care. As a doctor, occasionally on the front-line, all I ask is that companies make it easier than using paper. "

plan remain in the estate of the parent. Ownership never transfers to ...","Jul 31, 2019,04:26pm EDT",College fund. Piggy bank with coins. Money for education.,"529 plans and custodial accounts are two of the most common ways to save for college, but they have distinctly different benefits for families. Understanding the differences between the two savings methods is essential to choosing the right one for you and your children, so below we outline the major distinctions between the two and suggest some important considerations for those who want to open one of these accounts.Type of AccountThere are two basic types of 529 plans: general savings plans and prepaid tuition plans. A savings plan simply allows the parent to put aside money for any college expenses, whereas a prepaid tuition plan allows a parent to pay for future tuition at today’s rates. For example, a parent might prepay for one semester today, and when their child goes to school, one semester’s tuition will be paid for regardless of tuition increases. Every state has its own plan and may offer either variety of 529 plan or both. Parents aren’t limited to 529 savings plans with their state of residence (though there are often financial incentives to do so) but are typically limited to their home state with prepaid tuition programs.A custodial account is a taxable investment account that is opened on behalf of a child. There are two types: Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) accounts and Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) accounts. UGMA accounts are limited to assets like cash, securities, and annuities, whereas UTMA accounts can hold almost any kind of asset. In both cases, a custodian sets up the account for a minor and controls the account until the minor reaches legal adulthood. Different states have different rules for the age of legal adulthood and how custodians are named. Otherwise, these accounts function like any other investment account.Ownership of the FundsFunds in a 529 plan remain in the estate of the parent. Ownership never transfers to the beneficiary of the account, which allows the parent to transfer ownership as needed. For example, if one child does not need all their 529 funds for college, the remainder could be transferred to a sibling to fund their education. The parent maintains control of the funds regardless of the child’s age.A custodial account is considered the asset of the child being supervised by the parent. At the age of majority, the funds in the account legally become the property of the child for him or her to use. Even before the age of majority, the funding is still part of the child’s estate, not the parents’. Because a custodial account transfers assets to the child’s estate, these accounts often have a greater effect on financial aid eligibility than a 529 plan, which leaves the money in the parents’ estate.Contributions to the AccountOn an annual basis, there is technically no limit to the amount a parent can contribute to a child’s custodial account or 529 plan, but gifts above a certain threshold ($15,000 per parent in 2019) may have lifetime gift tax consequences. In a 529 plan, a parent can also make a lump-sum gift to cover five years of plan contributions with no gift tax consequences; in 2019, one parent could contribute $75,000 or a married couple could contribute $150,000 with the five-year election option. Parents using custodial accounts have no such lump-sum contribution option.Overall contribution limits do apply to 529 plans but not to custodial accounts. The IRS restricts the contribution amount of a 529 plan to the amount required for the beneficiary’s education expenses, and each state sets a specific limit for their own plan.Neither 529 plans nor custodial accounts have contribution limits based on income, so even high-earning parents are able to save into these vehicles.TaxesA 529 plan is a tax-beneficial way to save for college, at least at the point at which you withdraw funds to pay for educational expenses. Contributing to a 529 plan does not provide any Federal tax benefit, but it may provide relief on state taxes.Withdrawals from a 529 plan, however, receive very favorable tax treatment. The nearest comparison to a 529 plan is a Roth IRA; the investments in a plan grow tax-free, and as long as the funds are used for educational purposes, no taxes are owed upon withdrawal of the funds. Qualified expenses (like tuition, room and board, and books) can be fully offset from 529 plan withdrawals at the undergraduate and graduate level, and up to $10,000 per year can be used to offset qualified expenses at the K-12 level.If funds are withdrawn from a 529 plan for purposes other than education, however, gains will be taxed at ordinary income tax rates and a 10% penalty will be assessed. In some states, you may even have to pay back state income deductions that you claimed. There are a few exceptions that allow for withdrawals without penalty if the child receives a scholarship, dies, or enrolls in a U.S. service academy, but generally any non-qualified withdrawals will result in both taxes and penalties on the gains.There are no special tax benefits to using funds on education with a custodial account. Gains in the account are typically taxed at “kiddie tax” rates rather than the custodian’s income tax rate. Before the child turns 18, interest and dividends may be taxed if they total more than $2,100.Weighing the Pros and ConsParents choosing between 529 plans and custodial accounts for college savings have to consider the pros and cons of each plan, their own financial situation, and their child when deciding which to use. A 529 plan can offer the parents considerable tax benefits, but the use of the money is highly restricted: if a child chooses not to go to college, a parent would have to transfer the money to a relative or pay significant penalties. Custodial accounts do not have the same usage restrictions which makes them far more flexible, but they also lack the tax benefits of a 529 plan. Funds in a custodial account also are the property of the child, and once the child reaches adulthood, they can use the money however they want.Parents who are trying to determine which account is most appropriate for their family should consider all of the differences above, and perhaps consult with a trusted financial advisor for help making the choice.Disclosure:  This article is for informational purposes only and is not a recommendation to buy or sell a security.  The views are those of Adam Strauss as of the date of publication and are subject to change and to the disclaimers of Appleseed Capital and Pekin Hardy Strauss Wealth Management.  "

Management consulting, those so-called outside experts called ...","Jul 31, 2019,06:31pm EDT","Supporting materials accompanying Accenture’s (ACN) latest earnings release point to “‘The New’ — Digital, Cloud, Security Services” as accounting for “More than 60% of revenues” and “experiencing strong double-digit growth.” In a stock market obsessed with FAANG stocks and so-called “unicorn” IPOs, what’s not to love about that! As many have learned the hard way, however, sometimes cutting edge talk is supported by the numbers, and sometimes, it’s just talk. With Accenture, the combination of old-time classic fundamentals and technical stock characteristics combine to look good, enough so to suggest this outfit is for real. ","People in conference© Can Stock Photo / pressmasterWhy Look At AccentureI rely heavily on stock screening to narrow my focus from the big unwieldy market to a small numbers of stocks for which there are objective indications that they are particularly worthy of attention. Accenture appeared recently in the Chaikin Analytics Bullish Swing Trade screen, which identifies stocks with strong technical and fundamental profiles that present as being short-term “oversold.”  Though the name of the screen may conjure images of a quick in-and-out trade, my testing of the screen suggests it presents well even if we assume three-month holding periods. A 21st Century Consultant-Outsource FirmAccenture’s basic businesses are hardly new. Management consulting, those so-called outside experts called in to supposedly help senior executives figure out what they should be doing and how they should be doing it, is an age-old activity well known not just to the brass that cuts the checks for the billable hours but also to the rank-and-file who leerily eye the suits and wonder what sort of trouble they’re cooking up. Outsourcing, meanwhile, is now so well established as to have become a Hollywood theme and, lately, inspiration for a political crusade. But rather than sticking around within the business landscape, these endeavors may actually be moving the forefront, as the still-emerging digitization-automation-robotization of just about everything is pulling us into an economic (and societal) transformation no less and possible more profound than the industrial revolution. Discussion of the socio-political ramifications of all this is for other forums. As to the investment implications, there are many choices such as ETFs dedicated to this theme (see, e.g., the Ark Invest innovation-ETFs product line and many others that pursue the same theme, the multitude of shares of companies offering relevant products and services, and even pre-packaged equity portfolios offered by outfits such as Motif Investing).For those interested in individual stocks, as the focus of a stake in this area and/or as a supplement to positions taken via ETFs, Accenture stands out for the way it has its fingers in so many aspects of all this. Here are examples of such activities, as quoted from the transcript of Accenture’s 6/27/19 earnings call:As one example, we’re helping a leading fashion retailer with a global implementation of SAP S/4HANA that leverages myConcerto, our proprietary AI-powered development platform. myConcerto brings together our deep industry knowledge and differentiated tools and methodologies to help clients innovate and accelerate platform implementation. Our work is driving greater synergies across the retailer’s global brands and building a strong foundation for future growth.As an example, we’re helping Swisscom, Switzerland’s leading telecom company, transform into a digital service provider. By leveraging our proprietary Digital Omni Channel Platform — with AI, machine learning and analytics — we are increasing the precision and personalization of the customer experience across all their channels.A good example is our work with Del Monte Foods to unlock innovation and streamline their operations by migrating hundreds of servers and critical SAP enterprise-wide applications to the cloud in less than four months. They are benefiting from a more agile operating environment, real-time customer insights and a 35% reduction in IT costs, freeing up resources to grow the core business.As interesting as such anecdotal tidbits are, the reality is that they’re just three drops in a nearly $43 billion (in annual revenue) bucket. On what basis might we infer that matters such as these are sufficiently representative of the entire company, or at least the growing parts of it, to warrant accepting a bullish investment case? There can never be a precise answer when we deal, as we must, with the unknowable future. But strong inferences can be drawn from historical fundamental numbers as well as additional data-points consistent with favorable assumptions regarding the future on the part of market participants based on quantitative and qualitative evidence.The Chaikin Analytics PresentationFigure 1Chaikin Analytics Presentation on ACNFigure 1 depicts as positive a profile as we’re likely to see. Using our traditional bottom-up reading of the chart, we note:Figure 2, the Chaikin checklist for this stock, which provides a quick summary of the presentation’s salient features, is firing on all cylinders except for overbought/oversold, the short-term oscillator that suggests the stock has started the process of edging its way out of its oversold status. Figure 2Chaikin Analytics Checklist for ACNFigure 3, a 5-year view, of the presentation shows that the Power Gauge has not been bearish during the period and that prolonged intervals of a bullish rank, a bullish personality and bullish money flow, such as what we now have, have been accompanied by strength in the stock. In other words, the present situation is not an aberration but an often-recurring phenomenon.Figure 3Chaikin Analytics 5-year presentationDrilling DownBeing a 20-factor ranking system, Power Gauge provides latitude for stocks/companies to look bad, sometimes very bad, in some respects but exhibit enough strength in certain key respects to pull the overall rank up into bullish territory. This is an important feature since perfection, situations that look good in all respects, are hardly ever, if ever, seen in the real world. We’re always balancing pros and cons. Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7 below show, however, that Accenture asks very little from us in the way of compromise, less at least than many other situations we’re likely to encounter.Starting with Earnings, we see that this category, based entirely on historic data, is the weakest area, relatively speaking. It’s not by any means bad relative to the investment universe; it’s neutral. But what we’ve seen thus far might have suggested we should expect more.Figure 4Earnings component of Chaikin Analytics Power Gauge rankActually, though, I’m fine with this being the weakest area (again, I’m speaking in relative terms). The Street has an unfortunate and often financially-damaging (to investors) habit of assuming that visible growth rates will persist indefinitely. The truth is very different. Growth rates accelerate and decelerate all the time (if you took calculus, think less about growth rates and more about the first derivative of the growth rate function). Super-strong growth is much more likely to falter. I tend to prefer buying into growth rates that have more room to accelerate going forward (the digitization story) particularly when, as here, the Earnings Surprise rank is no less than neutral (suggesting management, when it guides analysts, has a realistic picture of what’s going on out in the field) and when the company is maxing out on the Earnings Consistency rank.Table 1 provides more color on the growth picture. Revenue growth, as noted, has so far been OK. But even to this point, where “The New” is still in the process of kicking in, we see earnings as having grown more quickly as the company improved margins.Table 1Growth-related dataI’m particularly impressed by the extreme bullish ranks for Return on Equity and Long-Term debt, both of which are in the Financials category.Figure 5 Financials component of Chaikin Analytics Power Gauge rankReturn on Equity is the penultimate measure of company quality combining margin, turnover and debt leverage.Accenture’s Return on Equity Score is top of the line. Table 2 shows how extreme (in a good way) Accenture is in this regard.Table 2Data related to company qualityReturns combine turnover and margin, We see, here, that Accenture is fine in both respects. (Don’t get too carried away with the gross margin comparisons. Companies vary in terms of how they categorize expense items that could arguably be deemed “cost of goods sold” or “selling, general & administrative expenses.” Difference impact gross margin comps, but by the time we get down to operating margins, the differences are washed away and the comparisons are apples-to-apples. Normally, we would be concerned about trailing-12- month figures that are below 5-year averages; a deceleration. But the numbers are not normal. They are way, way above normal. In such cases, deceleration is to be expected. Accenture’s returns have a long way to go before we need to worry about them becoming unspectacular.Anyway, strong returns are not just a matter of bragging rights. Return on Equity is an important indicator of the company’s ability to generate growth in the future; it gets a lot of bang for every buck it reinvests.It’s worth noting that some of this reflects share repurchases that reduce equity (the denominator of the income divided by equity return-on-equity equation. (The company pays dividends, too, so a lot of excess cash flow is being given to shareholders.) Note, though, from Table 5b, that funds for repurchasing are not coming from new debt (in other words, the company is not getting fancy or aggressive with its balance sheet). Hence the top-position for the Long-Term Debt score.Figures 6 and 7 reflects the behavior of key investment-community constituencies and the market itself.Figure 6Experts component of Chaikin Analytics Power Gauge rankFigure 7Technicals component of Chaikin Analytics Power Gauge rankThe Analyst Rating score is interesting. It’s actually a contrary indicator. The top score here reflects not a tendency of analysts to fall all over themselves pushing out Strong Buy ratings. It’s the opposite. Analysts have plenty of room to raise ratings and produce the impact such events often produce; mark a high point in the stock’s trajectory.But with a good estimate revision trend and a strong industry group (being a lone wolf is romantic in many aspects of life, but on Wall Street, the best stocks often run with a big posse in the form of comparably strong peers), it’s not hard to envision analysts finding reasons to boost ratings in the future and, hence, motivate potential buyers to take our shares later on, when we’re done with them. Meanwhile, the Technicals are fine,Wrapping UpLet’s conclude by considering whether, as often happens, potentially good news is already baked into the stock in the form of exorbitant valuation ratings.Amazingly, though, Power Gauge presents no bearish valuation components:Table 3 adds further context.Table 3
* Click here for more on the P=V+N (Price - Value + Noise) framework.It reminds us that neutral Power Gauge value-related metrics aren’t subtle code words for bearish. In contrast to Wall Street culture, where a “Hold” analyst rating is often a coded “Sell” message, here, “Neutral” really and truly means “Neutral.” It’s hard to justify running in fright from a price/sales ratio, for example, that is not extreme relative to the S&P 500 median. While the P/E ratios are above those of S&P 500 stocks, they are in line with Industry norms. P/B, the most extreme ratio, was addressed above and in our overall rating, the near-bearish score it gets is overwhelmed by strong scores in the more-growth-oriented factors.So on the whole, Accenture, despite gains the stock has achieved to date, shapes up as a worthwhile play on the ongoing, and likely to accelerate, digitization of our economy, and it’s available at an acceptable valuation.

within many plans sometimes aren't that broad or flexible.","Editors' Pick|Aug 3, 2019,07:43am EDT","529s can help you save for college costs, but sometimes the limitations can offset the tax benefits.... [+] photo credit: Getty","529 plans offer a useful and tax-efficient way to save for your kids' education. Still, they aren't for everyone. Limited options can offset some of the potential tax benefits. Plus options for using them beyond college costs are currently limited. As such, 529s might be considered the icing on the cake after your own retirement is taken care of. Even then you should be aware of the pros and cons of 529s before jumping in.Start EarlyThe main benefit of a 529 is that the money grows and can be withdrawn free from tax. Of course, with these sort of tax shields, they are generally more useful the longer you can save for. This means that opening a 529 when your child is born (or even before they are born) makes potentially more sense than when they are, say, 16 years-old. By starting saving for a teenager and saving over just a few years until college arrives, you run a couple of risks. Firstly you may be unlucky and the markets could decline over a relatively short period. That's easy to forget after such a long bull run, but U.S. markets could be considered pricey today. Bear markets do happen. Secondly, even if they do rise then, unless those returns are spectacular, then chances are the tax savings probably won't be worth all that much.Related: The Best And Worst 529 PlansIf you're reading this with teenage kids, then this advice, short of time travel, may not help. However, the real point is that they are other tax-efficient ways to save out there. IRAs, 401(k)s and even 403(b)s and 457(b) plans can be better bet. So it probably makes more sense to consider one of those options, than to go through the complexity of the 529 process for a relatively mild tax-benefit. Remember, you can still help your kids out with college if you want to, whether you have a 529 or not. Furthermore, once college arrives, you'll be able to assess accurately if you're securely in a position to help or not.Make Sure Your Own Savings Are In Order FirstJust as in airline safety videos, it makes sense to put on your own oxygen mask first before helping others. So it makes sense to have your own basic retirement needs met and any debt under control before saving for your kids' education. Worst case, they can always borrow to fund education costs. It's much trickier for you to borrow to fund retirement. As a rule of thumb, if you're not a decade or two from retirement and saving 15% of your income, then double check your own retirement plans are ok before looking to 529s, which are more the icing on the cake of personal financial planning.Limited OptionsUnfortunately, 529 options within many plans sometimes aren't that broad or flexible. If you like to pick stocks or build your own portfolio then the 529 options at many providers could disappoint. This is something to consider. The limited set of 529 options from many providers may mean that your investment portfolio is a bit less efficient than you would like. Maybe you're paying slightly higher fees than some of the lower cost ETFs out there, that aren't included the plan. Perhaps you have a particular bias in your investing style that can't be implemented through vanilla 529 fund choices.Either way it's possible that constraints in how you can invest your 529 plan means that your investment returns are a bit lower than they otherwise would be, perhaps due to fees, perhaps due to limited investment options. Yes, of course, there is a tax benefit to be factor in should things work out, but if your investment performance suffers there's an obvious trade-off. There's less tax to pay if your investment returns are worse and if you lose money, maybe there's no tax benefit at all, but limitations may still apply.Don't Save ExcessivelyUnlike other forms of tax-efficient saving the uses for 529 plans are relatively locked down. You can use up to $10,000 a year for elementary or secondary school and you can typically use 529 to fund certain education-related computer costs for your child. Plus the SECURE Act with its changes to IRAs and 401(k)s may also expand the use of 529s if Ted Cruz gets his way to include potentially home schooling and various special needs costs. Today though, the bulk of 529 costs are typically spent on university education. That can be a problem, because if you child doesn't go to college or even goes with a cheaper option, such as an in-state choice, then you could be hit with a 10% penalty and additional tax on a 529 balance that you may struggle to use for educational purposes.If you have multiple kids or are feeling generous with nieces, nephews or grandchildren, that can work, because moving the balance between eligible beneficiaries is often an option. Though here you should be aware of estate planning concerns. For example, giving over $14,000 a year to any beneficiary may create tax issues. Therefore, trying to cover absolutely all of college costs with a 529 can be risky. If costs run less than expected and you don't have another child to transfer the 529 balance to, you may endure various penalties.529 offer tax efficiency, but they are inflexible both in many investment choices and how they can be used. Plus you likely want to make sure your own retirement is in order first. 529s can be helpful, but make sure you're aware of the pros and cons going in. Whereas 401(k)s and IRAs can be broadly useful, 529s despite their tax benefits can also carry some limitations.Related: The Best And Worst 529 Plans"

In 1991, Wexner gave Epstein power of attorney, meaning that he could borrow money, buy and sell property and sign checks on Wexner’s behalf, the New York Times reported.Epstein purchased Wexner’s Manhattan mansion in 1989 for over $13 million through a corporation the two men jointly controlled, and Epstein took possession of the property about a decade later.News Peg: Jeffery Epstein was arrested last month for sex trafficking girls as young as 14. In a sprawling indictment, prosecutors say Epstein operated a sex ring for underage girls in his Palm Beach and Manhattan homes, including the mansion formerly owned by Wexner.Tangent: While Forbes has debunked the widely-held notion that Epstein is a billionaire, precisely how he made his money remains a mystery. "
