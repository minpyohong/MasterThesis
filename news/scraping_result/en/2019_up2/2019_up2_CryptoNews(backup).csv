________________________________Compared to the previous week, the flow increased but it didn't reach considerably higher levels seen during the rally in June.Meanwhile, many are attributing the rally today to the fact that China on Monday let the yuan tumble beyond the key 7-per-dollar level for the first time in more than a decade. It may be a sign that Beijing might be willing to tolerate further currency weakness in the face of an escalating trade row with the United States. As reported, Arthur Hayes, co-founder & CEO of cryptocurrency trading platform BitMEX, already in May warned that similar to 2015, a sharp and sudden yuan depreciation could lead to the beginning of another ""epic bull market.""""With the turmoil in markets and the streets, suddenly digital gold doesn?ôt seem like such a bad idea,"" Jehan Chu, managing partner at blockchain investment and advisory firm Kenetic Capital, told Bloomberg.

August 04, 2019
","If you are a regular reader of crypto media, you may be under the impression that Zimbabwe is one of the hottest bitcoin trading hubs in the world. Faced with a struggling economy and the re-introduction of a previously-failed sovereign currency, the Southern African state has been labeled as a picture book use case for bitcoin as both an alternative currency and as a store of value. However, how much bitcoin is really being traded in Zimbabwe? ","To find out more about what is happening in the Zimbabwean cryptoasset market, Cryptonews.com analyzed the little publicly available bitcoin trading data for the African country and reached out to a local bitcoin community member for more insight. On the world?ôs largest peer-to-peer bitcoin trading platform, LocalBitcoins, there are five offers for bitcoin in Zimbabwe, at the time of writing, with a total supply of less than USD 30,000 (excluding the off-market bid that no one will trade on). Interestingly, one seller is willing to part with bitcoin in exchange for the newly re-introduced Zimbabwean dollar (ZWL). One Zimbabwean dollar is worth around USD 10 if you believe official rates. On the bid side, there are five traders who are willing to purchase a combined total of almost USD 250,000. One buyer is willing to buy up to ZWL 100,000 worth of bitcoin (BTC). Paxful, which has managed to establish itself as one of the most popular peer-to-peer exchanges in Africa, also markets bids and offers for Zimbabwe-based users. On first glance, there seems to be more activity in the Zimbabwean bitcoin market than on LocalBitcoins with dozens of listed advertisements. Closer inspection, however, shows that there are no cash in person, EcoCash or local bank transfer purchase options that local Zimbabweans would typically use to trade bitcoin. There are also no available advertisements for transactions in the Zimbabwean dollar (ZWL). Zimbabweans are seemingly not using the platform. Coindirect, an up-and-coming peer-to-peer exchange operating in Africa, showed no bids or offers in Zimbabwe while Remitano only had one small buyer located in Zimbabwe at the time of writing. Interestingly, little-known peer-to-peer exchange, Cryptogem, which launched operations in Zimbabwe in November 2018, shows more activity. Around a dozen traders are offering to buy and sell BTC for EcoCash and other digital payment methods. When looking at peer-to-peer exchanges, it is important to note that not all traders who buy and sell bitcoin in Zimbabwe are necessarily also located there. For example, traders using payment methods such as PayPal, for example, can be based anywhere in the world provided they use the U.S. dollar or another major fiat currency for the bitcoin transaction. Therefore, the limited amount of bid and offers on the continent?ôs most popular peer-to-peer trading platforms may be overstating Zimbabwean bitcoin trading activity on these platforms. Zimbabwe has been home to a bitcoin exchange since 2014 when Golix (previously known as Bitfinance) opened its doors to provide a bitcoin trading platform for local bitcoin users. In early 2018, Golix stated that it has grown its userbase to over 50,000 and has experienced USD 20 million in transaction volume in the three years since its launch. Despite the regulatory pushback against bitcoin, Golix managed to grow its platform and userbase and announced that it will expand into South Africa, Kenya, and Uganda after a successful ICO (initial coin offering) in 2018. In May 2018, however, the exchange was ordered to shut down by the country?ôs central bank. Despite a high court overturning the decision in the same month, Golix decided to shelve its Zimbabwean exchange business. Zimcoin, another Zimbabwean bitcoin exchange, launched in 2018 but is currently not operational. According to its website, Zimcoin plans to reopen its doors at the end of August. The void in local exchange activity and seemingly low trading activity on leading peer-to-peer exchanges, the only remaining avenue for Zimbabweans to buy and sell bitcoin is on a peer-to-peer basis on via WhatsApp and Telegram. Direct peer-to-peer trading via messaging apps is very popular across the continent and active trading groups are also found in the Southern African nation. Terence Zimwara, a Zimbabwean journalist following the cryptoasset industry, told Cryptonews.com: ?úThere are [chat] groups where trades are conducted and they are invitation only. Here both sellers and buyers can advertise.?ùWhile it is impossible to find out what kind of bitcoin trading volumes Zimbabwe is really seeing due to the peer-to-peer nature of the majority of its local bitcoin trade, it seems that media reports about bitcoin thriving in Zimbabwe are overstating the real impact of bitcoin in the country. The ?úbitcoin is saving Zimbabwe??narrative may make for a great story but the reality is that bitcoin usage in the South African country is lower than in other African bitcoin economies, such as South Africa, Kenya, and Nigeria, despite the reasons for adopting bitcoin being more pressing in Zimbabwe. When asked about the size of the local crypto community, Zimwara said: ?úI would say the crypto community is growing but for me, it is still in the hundreds of people. However, just like the size of the foreign currency black market here, no one can really tell the size of the crypto community because people have gone underground.??When asked about the recent media hype around bitcoin in Zimbabwe, Zimwara responded: 
?úA few weeks ago we were amazed by a story that bitcoin was selling at a huge premium of USD 79,000! Of course, there was a retraction of some sorts. Apparently, the writer may have been referring to the local Zimbabwe dollar equivalent when he wrote that figure. I know bitcoin trading happens like this: a buyer pays the current price plus a premium of between 7% and 10% on top and all that is settled in USD cash. However, if the seller prefers receiving the funds either in cash or in a mobile money wallet like EcoCash, it is then when the exchange rate is applied.???úA few weeks ago we were amazed by a story that bitcoin was selling at a huge premium of USD 79,000!

There is a premium but not as high as some might think,??he added.While Zimbabwe has one of the highest internet penetrations in Africa (which generally correlates with bitcoin adoption on the continent), the recent ban of foreign currency use plus the regulatory pushback against cryptocurrencies by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) makes trading bitcoin and other digital assets more challenging than in most other places across the globe. A combination of increased awareness about cryptocurrencies and the ability for local bitcoin exchanges to operate would be required for bitcoin adoption to truly spread in Zimbabwe, concluded Zimwara."

","Yesterday, we saw the start of a strong rise in bitcoin price above the USD 11,200 and USD 11,500 resistance levels. Later, there was a downside correction, but dips remained supported in BTC/USD near USD 11,400. As a result, the price resumed its upward move today and climbed more than 5% above USD 12,000. Similarly, there were steady gains in major altcoins, including ethereum, litecoin, ripple, bitcoin cash, EOS and monero. ETH/USD is back above the USD 230 resistance and XRP/USD surpassed the main USD 0.320 resistance area. ","Total market capitalization After a successful break above USD 11,500, bitcoin price  extended gains. BTC/USD surged above the USD 12,000 resistance and even broke the key USD 12,200 resistance. The price is currently (08:00 UTC) up around 5%, with an immediate resistance near the USD 12,400 level. The main resistance is near USD 12,550, above which the price could climb towards the USD 13,000 resistance.
If the price corrects lower from the current levels, the USD 12,000 level may perhaps act as a support. If there is an extended downside correction, the USD 11,800 level could protect additional losses.Ethereum price  remained well bid above the USD 225 level and it recently climbed above the USD 230 resistance. ETH/USD is testing the USD 235 resistance and it seems like the bulls are aiming more gains above the USD 240 and USD 242 resistance levels.
If the price fails to climb above the USD 235 resistance, it could correct once again towards the USD 226 and USD 225 support levels. The main support for the current wave is near the USD 220 level.Bitcoin cash price  is following a bullish path and it recently broke the USD 340 resistance level. BCH/USD is currently flirting with the USD 350 resistance, above which it could accelerate towards the USD 365 and USD 370 levels. On the downside, immediate support is near the USD 340 level (the recent resistance area).
EOS  finally climbed above the USD 4.400 resistance and it seems like it could even climb above the USD 4.500 resistance level. If there is a successful daily close above USD 4.500, the price could continue to climb towards the USD 4.800 and USD 5.000 levels.
Ripple price  corrected lower after a rise towards USD 0.330. XRP/USD is currently trading above the USD 0.320 support and it could rise once again towards the USD 0.325 and USD 0.330 resistance levels. Conversely, a break below USD 0.320 might call for a test of USD 0.315.In the past three sessions, many cap altcoins climbed sharply and gained more than 6%, including TRXC, ABBC, DGB, CCCX, QNT, DCR, BCN and NEXO. Out of these, TRXC surged more than 300% to move into the top 100 in terms of the market cap.To sum up, bitcoin price is trading with a strong bullish momentum above USD 12,000. There might be a short term downside correction, but there are high chances of more gains in BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC and BCH in the near term.

EOS  struggled to break the USD 4.500 resistance and trimmed most of its recent gains. The price declined more than 6% and broke the USD 4.300 and USD 4.200 support levels. If the bulls fail to defend USD 4.050, the next stop could be the USD 3.800 level.
Ripple price  declined below the USD 0.322 and USD 0.320 support levels. XRP/USD even declined below USD 0.310 and it is currently correcting higher. On the upside, the USD 0.315 and USD 0.318 levels are likely to act as strong hurdles for the bulls.In the past three sessions, many cap altcoins trimmed gains and declined more than 8%, including DGB, EGT, NEXO, VEST, HC, SOLVE, REN, ABBC, BCN, THETA, BSV and KMD. Out of these, DGB is down around 14% and EGT declined 13%.Overall, bitcoin price is currently correcting gains below USD 11,650.

August 06, 2019
","The perpetual swaps market for cryptoassets is growing. First brought to market by leading crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX in 2016, perpetual swaps on bitcoin have started to gain more traction among crypto traders in the past twelve months. Today, several exchanges offer perpetuals while market leader BitMEX claims its perpetual contract sees five to ten billion dollars notional per day.","In this guide, you will discover what perpetual swaps are and why they have become so popular among experienced bitcoin traders. Perpetual swaps, also known as perpetual contracts, enable traders to bet on the price developments of bitcoin using leverage without having to own physical bitcoin. Perpetual swaps are financial derivatives that are very similar to a futures contract. The key differences between the two are that perpetual swap contracts have no expiry date and that the price of a perpetual contract trades closer to the spot price of bitcoin than a futures contract. As the name suggests, perpetual contracts go on ?úforever??and do not come with an expiry date, such as futures or options. The main idea behind perpetual swaps on bitcoin is to enable traders to trade bitcoin without having to own the asset using high leverage. BitMEX, for example, offers up to 100x leverage for its XTB/USD perpetual contracts.Futures are a contract between two parties to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specific date for a predetermined price in the future. Perpetual swaps have no expiry or settlement date. Instead, traders can buy and sell them at any time for the prevailing price. Moreover, the price of bitcoin perpetual contracts trades closer to the underlying reference index (i.e. the spot price) than futures contracts because the difference between the perp and the spot price is only the funding rate. Futures contracts, on the other hand, has a basis that creates the difference between the futures and spot price. The funding rate for perpetual swaps is either paid or received by the holder depending on whether their position goes against or with the current market trend. The perp?ôs funding rate exists to mimic interest payments between margin trading on spot markets with long and short positions. The funding rate can make trading perpetuals more expensive than other bitcoin derivatives when traders hold onto their positions for a longer period of time. Aside from pioneer BitMEX, other cryptoasset derivatives trading platforms that offer perpetual contracts include Deribit, OKEx, and bitFlyer. Futures are generally cheaper than perpetual swaps for taking long positions or hedging digital asset portfolios. However, perpetual contracts are substantially more popular among traders (most likely) due to their ease-of-use.While perpetual swaps are relatively easy to use and understand, for the inexperienced investor, buying digital assets outright is probably the better option due to the somewhat advanced funding mechanism that perpetual swaps use. Moreover, a perpetual contract position can end up becoming quite costly over time. Hence, for hodlers and newcomers, buying the ?úphysical??cryptoasset is probably the better option. A clear sign of the growing crypto derivatives market is OKEx?ôs recent launch of a derivatives big data platform that provides ?útrading data for customers to understand the derivatives market.?ùOKEx?ôs Futures & Perpetual Swap Market Data??platform enables traders to monitor real-time data of OKEx?ôs futures and perpetual swap markets for nine cryptoassets, including BTC, LTC, ETH, ETC, XRP, EOS, BCH, BSV, and TRX.The idea behind the new data platform is to provide insight into key crypto derivatives market indicators, including basis, open interest, trading volume, buy/sell taker volume, long/short positions ratio, and more. Andy Cheung, Head of Operations of OKEx, stated: ?úDerivatives trading requires a steeper learning curve, as it involves the use of margin and leverage. Once we realized that there isn?ôt really much data available in the market to help users analyze market trends, we decided to build a tool that can benefit our users.?ùThe more sophisticated the cryptoasset market becomes, the more advanced crypto trading products will emerge. The perpetual swap is one of several bitcoin derivatives on offer at the moment, but we can expect more innovation in the product space as the market continues to mature."

August 07, 2019
",An American court has ruled that cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase will be charged with negligence for allegedly botching the launch of the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) token.,"Bloomberg reports that San Francisco District Judge Vince Chhabria described the launch as an ?úincompetence born of haste,??although he dismissed claims that the case should be handled in arbitration.The judge also ruled that only buyers of BCH could move forward with claims against Coinbase, rejecting moves from sellers of the cryptocurrency.Chhabria said the suit filed against the exchange gives a ?úplausible account that Coinbase breached its duty to maintain a functional market.?ùCoinbase began USD trading in December 2017, but it suspended the service after just two minutes, claiming it had experienced ?úsignificant volatility,??and has been hit with allegations of ?úinsider trading??as a result of the incident.Meanwhile, Canadian messaging app Kik has filed a fierce response to the regulatory Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States, who accuse Kik of making an illegal USD 100m initial coin offering (ICO) for the Kin (KIN) cryptocurrency.Kik has responded to the lawsuit by saying, in a 131-page document, that the regulator has ?úrepeatedly twisted??facts in its allegations. Kik has accused the SEC of ?úmisrepresenting the documents and testimony that [the regulator] gathered in its investigation,??and says the SEC has displayed an ?úapparent contempt for the idea that a company would sell a product to generate revenue.??____________________________________________The document also goes on to allege that quotes made by Kik directors had been used out of context or misrepresented in the SEC?ôs filing.The Financial Times says that case will be an ?úan acid test for whether certain digital tokens count as securities,??and quotes a Kik representative as saying the company was ?úpushing??in court ?úfor an accelerated timeline??on the case.Stephen Palley, a partner at U.S.-based corporate law firm Anderson Kill, reacted:It's hard to say who is right here. The Kik people no doubt felt backed in a corner w/ no choice. And those first three pages of the answer look bad for the SEC. But at the end of the day it's a legal question. And who said what, when may be less important than they think.As reported, the Kin Foundation has set aside another USD 5 million in order to fight the SEC in a legal battle, considered to be ""the most important storyline in the world of crypto securities law in 2019.""At pixel time (05:56 UTC), KIN trades at c. USD 0.00001562 and is down by 1% in the past 24 hours and by 4% in the past week. Also, it fell by 91% in the past 12 months."

Meanwhile, another major token, Tezos (XTZ) is still down by almost 3% despite another popular trading platform eToro, with more than 6 million users worldwide, announced yesterday that it is adding XTZ to its platform. The addition of the token brings the total number of crypto assets available on eToro to 15."

","One of Russia?ôs biggest airlines, S7 Airlines, says that its blockchain-powered ticketing platform processed over USD 1 million worth of sales in July alone.","S7 said that it is also planning to expand the scope of its blockchain operations and sales network, and pledged to ?údeploy online agents??on the platform before the end of 2019. And S7 said the number of operations it processes on its platform is ?úgrowing every month,??claiming it has seen a tenfold rise in payments made on the blockchain platform since the start of 2019.The company added, in a press release, that blockchain technology was making it ?úeasier for agents to work directly with the airline.??The airline uses an Ethereum-powered, Hyperledger Fabric platform that it co-developed with major Russian bank Alfa-Bank. The airline claims it sold its first blockchain-powered ticket on the platform over a year ago.S7 says that its platform has let it link its ticket booking system to the Russian banking system, expiate payment processes and cut down on paperwork, as well as enabling ??4/7??sales service. And S7 claims to have been the ?úfirst airline in Russia to refuel an aircraft using smart contracts based on blockchain technology,??working in conjunction with both Alfa-Bank and Gazpromneft-Aero, the aviation refueling arm of oil giant Gazprom.The parties claim that using blockchain technology means that ?úthe process of debiting funds and transferring reporting documents between the fuel supplier and the airline takes only 60 seconds.?ù‚ÄúThe good results of our project with S7 Airlines show that the blockchain technology creates value and is largely decisive for the B2B [business-to-business] market. Agents left behind the guarantees and deposits, reduced transaction costs and now can make payments 24/7. We see great potential in the use of smart contracts and external business logic in accounting and paperwork in various sectors of the economy,??Pavel Ryazanov, Director of Transaction Business at Alfa-Bank, said.

","Disclaimer: The text below is a sponsored article that was not written by Cryptonews.com.
_________","If there?ôs anything we have learned so far about the cryptomarket currency after the Bitcoin
craze in 2017 is that it?ôs highly volatile and unpredictable. Even though this makes crypto
unappealing to those looking to make safer investments, it has actually made millionaires
overnight around the world.It?ôs time to check back with some of the most popular cryptocurrencies to see how they?ôre doing.
Is it still a good time to invest in cryptocurrencies? What is the current status of Bitcoin,
Ethereum, Litecoin and other crypto coins? Take a look at this report to find out.Bitcoin has started out and remained the absolute king of cryptocurrency since its beginning
cause of the following reasons:After its biggest uphill run in 2017, this year has been an amazing year for Bitcoin once again.
At this moment, 1 BTC is worth around USD 9,800 (over GBP 8,000). Given that Bitcoin
actually started out 2019 at the price of around USD 3,700, it?ôs safe to say that it?ôs been a wildly
turbulent year for this crypto.The biggest spike in 2019 happened on July 10, when 1 BTC was worth over USD 12,500.
What can we expect from Bitcoin in the following period? Just like the time so far, it?ôs downright
impossible to say what will happen to Bitcoin and when. But, one thing is for sure: it?ôs
guaranteed to be exciting!Since all cryptocurrency prices are pretty much dependent on Bitcoin, it has been a turbulent and volatile year for Litecoin, too. In terms of pricing, Litecoin is much less valuable
than Bitcoin: 1 LTC currently costs around USD 90. However, this doesn?ôt mean that it will stay
in the 2-digit value realm forever. More than a few times, Litecoin has gone over the 100
threshold and remained there for quite some time. This had happened in 2019, too.LTC had been valued at more than 100 dollars for more than one consecutive month (end of
May - mid-July). Currently, Litecoin is very volatile and its value is known to change for up to 10
percent in a single day. So, if you?ôre in for some thrills, Litecoin will definitely give you some!Even though Ripple has the lowest price of all cryptos on our list, it doesn?ôt mean that it didn?ôt
have a successful year as well. Ripple, otherwise referred to as XRP, has started out the year at
around 0.35 USD, after being steadily over 0.45 only one month prior.Ripple has seen its biggest price spike in May, just like other cryptocurrencies, when it set the
year record at 0.45 USD. Now, Ripple is somewhat more stable than other cryptocurrencies and
it features lower volatility. The price of XRP is expected to increase significantly in the years to
come as more and more banks start introducing it as their crypto mechanism.Ethereum is another powerful currency in the crypto arsenal. ETH was once the second most
valuable crypto after Bitcoin, but this has changed after many new currencies entered the
market. Ethereum is currently priced at around 216 USD.At the beginning of the year, ETH featured a similar journey to other cryptos. After a major dip
from August 2018?ôs 420+ USD, Ethereum has fallen to around 130 USD at the beginning of the
year. It started recovering until then, while its biggest peak was on June 27 at over 324 USD.When it comes to new cryptocurrencies, it?ôs safe to say that Libra was definitely the crypto that
marked 2019. It was only announced in June and it?ôs expected to be launched in 2020, but it
has shaken the cryptocurrency market to the core. Some government bodies have already
started voicing concerns that Libra will disrupt the financial market too much.It?ôs expected that Libra will launch at around 1 GBP, and all users will be able to purchase it
through Facebook?ôs Calibra wallet. As you can see, 2020 will definitely bring a lot of fresh
excitement into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. All that?ôs left to do is to track the progress of our
favorite cryptos, buy low and sell high!"

","Crypto baskets were the hot trend of the end of 2018, and multiple companies started offering their own crypto bundles. But we haven?ôt heard a lot about them since. Huobi, Abra and OKEx replied to our requests for comment. ","As a reminder, crypto baskets come with a select suit of coins that are often weighted against the market, which means that the percentage of market dominance is also often the percentage that the coin makes up in a user?ôs bundle. It?ôs meant to make things easier for the users and lower the risks.U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and a popular digital currency wallet and exchange Abra, announced their respective bundles within days of each other in 2018. Coinbase offered its Coinbase Bundle, with five tokens within the basket. However, as it was recently reported, Coinbase quietly removed its Bundle product less than a year since its launch. Their reason for discontinuing the bundles is unknown and the company haven?ôt replied to our request for comment.What about the other baskets then? Singapore-based crypto exchange Huobi was more open about their HB10 Index and its digital asset HB10, that help to invest in 10 coins. Since its launch in June 2018, ?úwe?ôve reconstituted and rebalanced our HB10 product 5 times and it still works well?? a spokesperson of the company told Cryptonews.com, adding that just recently, their average daily trading volume was USDT 955,430.?úIt?ôs been a good fit for certain types of client?? the spokesperson said, adding that ?ùTraders with very high risk appetite may prefer to trade in tokens that give them a chance at higher returns. However, HB10 it is popular amongst traders coming from traditional institutional markets because its overall volatility rate is small as compared with other single coins, its risk diversification effect is significant, and its overall price performance is stable.?ùHB10?ôs initial net value upon its launch on June 11th, 2018 was USDT 0.9158, while its latest net value is USDT 0.6757. Its asset size stands at USDT 36,7 million, according to their website. The HB10 Index consists of BTC, BCH, BSV, EOS, HT, ETC, XRP, ETH, LTC, ADA.
__________________________________Meanwhile, the aforementioned Abra, in cooperation with Bitwise Asset Management, provides Bitwise 10 (BIT10) index, which tracks the price of 10 coins. There is a USD 5 minimum investment, no restrictions on entry or exit timing, and no fees. Since June 6th though, Abra no longer offers BIT10 in the United States because of regulatory uncertainty in its market. Nonetheless, Abra told Cryptonews.com that it?ôs ?úseeing solid growth??for this product among the international users. ?úIt's a great option for retail investors because it gives them a simple way to get exposure to the crypto market and benefit from the diversification and rebalancing of index investing?? Abra explained without providing any numbers. Just a week ago, due to regulatory uncertainty, the crypto wallet was forced to make changes that impact its U.S. customers.Bitwise 10 Large Cap Crypto Index is rebalanced each month and now includes BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC, BCH, EOS, XMR, XLM, DASH, ADA.Also last year, major crypto-to-crypto exchange OKEx introduced its two indices, OK05 and OK06. However, it serves as an index only in providing a benchmark of the market. ""The indices demonstrated our commitment in bringing a fair neutral marketplace for traders to trade - by serving as a benchmark of the whole digital asset market that allows investors to track and replicate easily, hence suggested a reference for news traders,"" Andy Cheung, Head of Operations of OKEx.These indices are tracking five tokens (BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, and EOS) with a capitalization-based weighting methodology, as the website states, with the difference that OK06 adds a sixth coin ??OKB, the native token of OKEx."

",It's no wonder that the U.S. companies are among the world?ôs top 10 blockchain patent acquirers when even non-blockchain businessess are seeking for patents in droves. And no one knows how serious those companies are.,"After Nike filed for a trademark for the term ?úcryptokicks?? now, American retail giant Walmart is making waves in the blockchain patent world again. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in a single day, August 1, published nine patent applications filled by Walmart Apollo, a subsidiary that controls Walmart?ôs trademarks.One of those, that is now making the biggest buzz in the cryptoverse, is titled ?úSystem and Method for Digital Currency via Blockchain??and  discusses a possibility to create their own stablecoin. The document describes ?úgenerating one digital currency unit by tying the one digital currency unit to a regular currency?? adding that ?úthe regular currency is U.S. dollar????which means creating a USD-pegged stablecoin. The document also states that, one of the advantages of using digital currencies, is that low-income households to whom banking is expensive, that is, credit cards and carrying cash present a problem, ?úmay have an alternative way to handle wealth at an institution that can supply the majority of their day-to-day financial and product needs.??Some other possibilities regarding the potential new stablecoin include:In the meantime, Walmart has filed a number of blockchain-related patents already, but some of the ones published on August 1st specifically, include:Meanwhile, quite a few people have compared Walmart?ôs potential coin to Facebook?ôs Libra ??some in terms of the size of the companies, others in similarities in goals, given that both aim to serve the underprivileged in their respective ways, and some have noticed the difference in reaction, or lack thereof, when it comes to the two companies.WTF  - Facebook announces  Libra cryptocurrency and all hell breaks loose.  Walmart releases cryptocurrency and no one cares ??? ?ôÉ ""All or part of a paycheck can go into a Walmart currency"" https://t.co/6A1kvI9PV3 pic.twitter.com/10ODa4SxuqHowever, just because a patent is approved, doesn?ôt mean anything will be done with it. Companies file patents for various reasons. For example, the research group Brookings Institution?ôs paper shows that many people apply for patents on obvious, vague, and already existing ideas, while the USPTO is incentivized with fees to approve applications. We'll update the story should Walmart respond to our request for comment.
