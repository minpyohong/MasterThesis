means Bitcoin is a perfect storm. 15179 Total views. 220 Total shares.","Aug 6, 2019","Bitcoin (BTC) price has staged a remarkable rally in recent days, but the reasons behind it could mean higher prices stick around much longer. ","With BTC/USD now at $12,200, here are the main reasons the cryptocurrency industry considers lie behind Bitcoin’s latest surge higher.As Cointelegraph continues to report, the ongoing impact of the United States-China trade war is increasingly considered a boon for Bitcoin. On Tuesday, as tensions continued, stocks around the world showed considerable strain. As serial investor Tim Draper noted, the Dow Jones and Nasdaq fell by 2.9% and 3.4% respectively. For the Dow, it was the worst trading day of the year.At the same time, Bitcoin gained 3.2%, the latest in a series of rebounds which ended several weeks of bearish sentiment. Just a week ago, BTC traded closer to $9,500.Current price performance is fuelling attitudes that Bitcoin is becoming increasingly useful as a hedging instrument.As cryptocurrency and blockchain lawyer Jake Chervinsky noted on Tuesday, this quality is an essential use case, with Bitcoin designed to reduce dependence on the centralized financial system.“Bitcoin is doing exactly what it's designed for today,” he summarized. His comments were echoed on mainstream media, with the CEO of consultancy firm Agecroft Partners telling CNBC Bitcoin’s hedging properties will make it a firm favorite for funds in future.As part of the trade war, the U.S. this week described China as a currency manipulator. The accusation came after Beijing significantly changed its policy of supporting the yuan, allowing it to slide against the dollar.This in turn allowed China an unfair competitive advantage in global trade, treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin claimed. China retaliated by warning the U.S. was “deliberately destroying international order.”For the average investor, an alternative thus makes perfect sense, Hayman Capital Management founder Kyle Bass explained to mainstream media.“If you’re in Asia and China and you’re in a closed currency system, or if you’re in Hong Kong and you can’t seem to get a big conversion of Hong Kong dollars to U.S. dollars what are you going to buy?” he said in an interview with Yahoo! Tuesday.As Cointelegraph reported, Jeremy Allaire, CEO of crypto payments firm Circle, also thinks the situation is spurring on Chinese investors to interact more with the cryptocurrency market.“Humanity has now created a non-sovereign, highly secure mechanism to store value that can exist anywhere the internet exists,” he told CNBC Monday."

landscape is creating the “perfect storm” to ignite Bitcoin price ...","Aug 2, 2019",Digital asset research firm Delphi Digital says that the macroeconomic landscape is creating the “perfect storm” to ignite Bitcoin price appreciation.,"In a fresh report cited by Forbes on August 1, the researchers isolate the dovish turn in global central banking policy as the stand-out factor likely to propel Bitcoin’s price skywards:“First, and arguably most important, sentiment from global central banks took a drastic turn towards more dovish monetary policies. The Fed, ECB, BOJ, PBOC, and many others are now preparing market participants for more rate cuts and additional stimulus measures as they attempt to keep the current economic expansion going.”Central bankers’ consensus around the need for quantitative easing stems a geopolitical landscape shaped by protracted trade tensions between the United States and China, disappointing GDP growth in Germany, and the anticipated aftershock of a possible no-deal Brexit.Beyond monetary easing, the increasing risk of fiat currency devaluation represents a longer-term catalyst that is likely to further drive the price of both Bitcoin and physical gold, the report argues. As is often discussed, Bitcoin’s scarcity by design and its potential to serve as a store of value in a faltering world economy has earned it the moniker of “digital gold” — a narrative consolidated in Delphi’s new analysis. In a discussion of the two assets, the report argues that the digital gold view is ever more relevant amid “extreme monetary policies and rising geopolitical tensions” and that:“The relative size of Bitcoin’s market value compared to the investible gold market, for example, makes it a tempting opportunity for investors starving for assets with above-average growth potential as well.”Delphi Digital, in fact, predicts that given its unique non-sovereign properties, the investible Bitcoin market could in future outgrow the current gold market — over $7 trillion as of fall 2018.As reported just yesterday, a former top-level executive at Goldman Sachs has similarly predicted that Bitcoin’s market cap could hit around $8 trillion in future. Delphi Digital’s view of Bitcoin’s correlation with macroeconomic factors has been echoed by the likes of Anthony Pompliano, who recently stated that the European Central Bank’s expected dovish turn will be “rocket fuel” for Bitcoin. Also this summer,  the head of global fundamental credit strategy at Deutsche Bank remarked that central banks’ dovish policies are positively impacting “alternative” currencies such as bitcoin while hurting investment banks."

could be made from investing in Bitcoin, even if the chances are ...","Aug 1, 2019","Raoul Pal, a former head of equities and equities derivatives at Goldman Sachs UK office and the founder of Global Macro Investors and Real Vision Group, believes that Bitcoin (BTC) is worth betting on in the long term — even if it’s just a 1% chance. This and other insights Pal shared while speaking on the Stephen Livera podcast this week. Pal said: ","“I know all these macro guys, they’re all in it. They get it. They get the optionality. They may be complete believers, part believers, partial believers. But even then, if it’s a 1% chance of being right and the upside is 100x from here, you’d do this all day.”According to Pal, the potential reward of buying Bitcoin far outweighs all the accompanying risks. In his abstract approximation, $8 trillion is a possible figure the BTC market cap could hit in the future. He explained: “So if it’s worth 80 trillion dollars, let’s say you have a 10% probability, that’s 8 trillion dollars. It’s currently worth 200 billion dollars. So even if there’s a 1% chance of it working […] what it’s telling you is that it’s ludicrously underpriced if any of these probabilities play out.”He adds that these numbers are “crazy attractive” and “that’s why it’s sucking in so many of these macro guys, because they’re like, ‘Damn, nothing else has this payoff.’”  He also referenced crypto analyst PlanB’s tweets containing a couple of different stock to flow models based around the tapering off in supply due to scheduled halvings of BTC block reward.Notably, PlanB’s most recent chart suggests the Bitcoin price will increase to $100,000 after next year’s halving, and to an astonishing $1 million after 2024, which Pal says is not impossible.“Yeah, it’s an option,” says Pal. “And, okay, it’s less of an option than it was when it was much cheaper, but if you look at PlanB’s stock flow model, stuff like that, you can see the comparative upside. And if you try and get your head around the digitization of everything, if you try and get your head around an alternative financial system, even if it has a low probability, right?”The ex-Goldman Sachs exec also mentioned that he has a long history with Bitcoin and was “probably the first person to put together a valuation using the above-ground supply and below-ground supply of gold, and imputing that into Bitcoin, which was basically the Stock-Flow model at a very simplistic level.” Pal says that he first found out about BTC when it was still at 17 cents. He said:“I first discovered Bitcoin […] because some of my clients had begun to mine it when it was at 17 cents. They were running a hedge fund, and they happened to have electricity included in their office space, and somebody talked to them. They were very, very early adopters […] So, I wrote an article. I got long, around $200.”On July 30, former Bitcoin bear Joe Kernen also predicted that BTC could hit $55,000 by May 2020, the date of next halving.At press time, Bitcoin is trading at around $10,000 — up 2.12% on the day, according to Cointelegraph’s Bitcoin Price Index."

After revealing the malpractice, the company raided 33 premises located near the state capital of Pahang, Kuantan.Distributing network general manager Siti Sarah Johana Mohd said that the facilities had been mining Bitcoin for six months:“TNB collected evidence that 23 premises were running Bitcoin mining activities while the other 10 premises were aware of our raid this time around and destroyed the evidence.”The mining equipment deployed electric power directly from the distribution board passing the meter. “The metered 3 Amp was used only for one lamp and a suction fan. They paid a bill of only 219 Malaysian ringgit ($52) whereas they should have been billed 108,000 Malaysian ringgit ($25,674) a month for the unmetered 1,500 Amp,” Mohd explained.While digital currency exchanges and blockchain-based companies in Malaysia previously faced some testing times following regulatory changes in the country, the Malaysian government expressed positive sentiments toward cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, even though they have classified all cryptocurrencies as securities.According to Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng, the Malaysian government sees the potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain to improve a number of sectors of its economy:“The Ministry of Finance views digital assets, as well as its underlying blockchain technologies, as having the potential to bring about innovation in both old and new industries. In particular, we believe digital assets have a role to play as an alternative fundraising avenue for entrepreneurs and new businesses, and an alternate asset class for investors.”Meanwhile, Malaysia allows Bitcoin mining and trading with no restrictions.

Source: Bloomberg OpinionNonetheless, the present geopolitical and macroeconomic climate plays into a possible interpretation of the data. The article notes the adverse impact of escalating trade tensions between the United States and China on the world economy — against which, as investor Tim Draper argued earlier this week, Bitcoin can offer a “remarkable hedge.”Mounting recognition of Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset is being spurred by the relevance of its non-sovereign characteristics amid an unpredictable geopolitical backdrop. The coin is “doing exactly what it's designed for today,” cryptocurrency and blockchain lawyer Jake Chervinsky argued earlier this week.Jeremy Allaire, CEO of crypto payments firm Circle, has this week said that macroeconomic turmoil is driving the price appreciation of Bitcoin as “a non-sovereign, highly secure mechanism to store value that can exist anywhere the internet exists.” Macro factors — including central banks’ dovish policy turn — have also been cited in relation to Bitcoin’s bullish price performance by various analysts in recent weeks.While this broad sentiment has been recently echoed by Morgan Creek Digital Assets founder Antony Pompliano, he conversely noted that Bitcoin’s unique value might be best preserved if it preserves its “non-correlation to the rest of the markets, especially in times of global instability.”"

Unicode 10.0 was released in June 2017 — just shy of a decade after the coin’s invention.Its inclusion into Unicode 10.0 was thanks to the hard graft of software engineer Ken Shirriff. Responding to the increasing number calls to formalize a symbol that would help drive broader adoption of the Satoshi, Shirriff tweeted on July 29:“Some random possibilities: 𝕊 Ꭶ ş ᔑ ﮔ § ᗸ ƃ 🝅 ᚑҌ þ ꝧ Ⴉ. I strongly recommend using a symbol that’s already in Unicode. While it’s fun to invent a new character for the satoshi, it would be mostly unusable and cause problems. ”Enthusiasm nonetheless remains apparently unstifled, as community members avidly attempt to crowdsource and promote their favorite possibilities for the new character. One commentator quipped — attaching a .jpeg of the USD symbol “$” — that:“The real Satoshi symbol has been here all along. Now we can stop posting s-----y drawings here.”As reported, the term “Satoshi” has its origins in the first “name” of the much-mythologized figure behind Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakomoto, whose disappearance in late 2010 has spawned a legend almost as famous as the cryptocurrency he, she, or they invented on Oct. 31 2008 with the publication of the Bitcoin white paper."

The study also included 7,500 articles from national and international news outlets.","Articles were scored based on positive and negative sentiment in relation to other articles included in the study.Talk about cryptocurrency in general started to increase in March 2017, when Bitcoin (BTC) became more valuable than gold. This grew in volume to peak with Bitcoin price in December 2017, only to fall away again as prices across the board started to tumble.However, frequency jumped back to those peak levels in November 2018, when cryptocurrency prices were bottoming out. Since then cryptocurrency discussions on subreddits have surged, as prices have gone back up and Libra was announced.It is estimated that 85.5% of conversations on the topic were deemed positive in sentiment. The analysis of media articles painted a different picture, however, with the majority of outlets publishing more negative articles than positive. The most guilty of this were HuffPost, Business Insider and the International Business Times, which posted twice as many negative articles as positive. Only Forbes bucked the trend, with 80% of its cryptocurrency-related pieces having a positive sentiment.Facebook’s Libra currency tops the charts when it comes to positive sentiment on Reddit.

According to the report, central banks accounted for almost one-sixth of total gold demand in the period.While the World Gold Council expects geopolitical uncertainty to keep pressure on central banks to build gold reserves, Pompliano now predicts that banks will turn to Bitcoin as a store of value that is unrelated to traditional assets. He wrote:“Wait till they find out about the non-correlated, asymmetric upside profile of Bitcoin.Every central bank will be buying Bitcoin.”The new forecast follows a recent debate on CNBC Africa between Pompliano and gold bug Peter Schiff, who said that Bitcoin became some form of religion, and that investors are only hoping to get rich from their holdings while blind to reality. Schiff said, “When you’re in a bubble, you can’t see the bubble,” and maintained that the Bitcoin had no intrinsic value. Previously, Forbes editor-in-chief Steve Forbes published an open letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, advising to back their cryptocurrency Libra with gold. According to Forbes, the stablecoin project will become “one of history’s truly seminal creations” if backed by the yellow metal."

As such, the information for the month of August should be provided until the last business day of September.According to the rules, local crypto exchanges will have to inform the RFB about all the operations regardless of value.

accepting deposits obtained from cryptocurrencies. 6866 Total views.","Aug 6, 2019",Israeli Bitcoin (BTC) investors are unable to pay their taxes as banks do not accept deposits obtained from cryptocurrencies.,"Israeli newspaper Haaretz reports on Aug. 6 that local crypto investors are unable to deposit the returns of their Bitcoin investments into bank accounts due to money laundering and terrorist financing concerns. Bitcoin is not recognized as a currency in Israel and earnings made by trading them are subject to a 25% capital gains tax for individuals and a 47% corporate tax rate for corporations.Those two factors reportedly result in the Israel Tax Authority expecting taxes from Bitcoin investors, who find themselves incapable of paying them since they cannot deposit the earnings resulting from their investments as local fiat currency onto local bank accounts. The outlet outlines the experience of local BTC investor Ron Gross, who invested in the coin in 2011 and reported his earnings to the local tax authority.In 2017, his bank, Hapoalim, reportedly started refusing to allow him to deposit his Bitcoin trading profits into the account. Gross also met with bank officers and showed them 70 pages of deposit records of Bitcoin earnings, but the bank continued to refuse to accept the funds. He stated:“I’ve tried working with almost all the banks, but the minute they hear the word ‘Bitcoin’ they freeze up.”Since he was unable to pay his dues to the Israeli tax authority, a lien has been put on his bank account, home, and scooters. He also declared that “the tax authority is aware of the problem, but they say the ball isn’t in their court.” Haaretz further writes that the local tax collector is aware of 300 million shekels (over $85.7 million) in unpaid tax due on the earnings from Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but the figure is probably much higher.The outlet also cites the case of Roy Arav, another Bitcoin investor who held his profits on a trustee account at Discount bank operated by local cryptocurrency exchange Bit2C. Still, Discount refuse to move the money from the trustee account to Arav’s personal account.The reason behind the refusal is that the bank’s policy does not permit funds in client accounts deriving from distributed virtual currencies due to anti-money laundering and terrorist financing risks. Because of this, Arav could not pay his taxes and filed a lawsuit against the bank.He also reportedly admitted that the tax authority understood the problem and let him delay paying until the lawsuit he filed could be ruled on. Lastly, the outlet admits that there are ways to circumvent the issue by buying shekels in the grey markets or move money through investment houses, paying high fees.As Cointelegraph reported at the beginning of June, the Supreme Court of Israel has declared that Leumi Bank cannot block the local cryptocurrency exchange Bits of Gold’s account on the grounds of regulatory concerns."

According to the report, 65% of nodes were located on the current tip, while 17% were stuck on the 210 MB  block and 19% had not even upgraded and were on the old pre-hard fork chain.Bitcoin SV node chart. Source: TwitterAccording to data from Coin Dance, the 210 MB block was mined on Aug. 3 by CoinGeek miner and involved 808,633 transactions.Bitcoin SV, a hard fork of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which is in turn a fork of the major cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC), successfully ran its own scheduled hard fork on July 24 as part of plans to increase its block size from the previously set limit of 128 MB up to 2 gigabytes.Prior to the three-chain split, Ryan X. Charles, a BSV supporter and CEO of BSV-powered payment system MoneyButton, published a post on the Money Button blog about his issues running a BSV node. Specifically, Charles stated that Money Button went down for three hours because their Bitcoin SV node ran out of memory and crashed during a stress test. He wrote:“Running a node is expensive. Our new instance will cost thousands of dollars per month to operate. As blocks continue to get larger and we have to upgrade the instance many times, this cost will balloon. Since we do not earn money from transaction fees like miners, it will be too expensive for us to run a node.”According to tech news outlet TrustNodes, Coin Dance service is now on the new Bitcoin SV chain, while the older chain will likely be discarded. According to the report, this could mean that miners who got stuck on the old chain may have lost some money as those blocks could now be discarded. The report notes that, while the recent split appears to be the first of its kind, giga-sized blocks may generate splits with more than three forks. Bitcoin SV has previously experienced problems due to what some consider to be an unwieldy blockchain size. In April, the coin’s blockchain underwent a series of block reorganizations — a situation in which two miners discover a block simultaneously in a blockchain, which causes a temporary forking in the network. In general, block reorganization happens when a network is too slow to reproduce blocks efficiently."

Dorsey said:“We love you, Bitcoin [...] we saw 3.5 million customers use Cash Card in June, typically using it to purchase multiple times per week. Our seller and Cash App ecosystems have incredible roadmaps ahead to deliver on our purpose of economic empowerment.”In a tweet posted on August 1, investor Kevin Rooke noted that Square’s $125 million figure for Q2 2019 means that around “7% of all Bitcoin mined in the past 3 months was acquired via a single app that didn't exist two years ago,” adding: “let that sink in.”As Cointelegraph has previously reported, Square first announced in November 2017 that it would release a BTC trading option to a select 3 million of its Square Cash App customers. The announcement caused its stock to jump $1 billion in just five days. When the company rolled out support for BTC trading for customers across a more extensive range of U.S. states this February, Square’s stock increased yet again.Last November, Square reported it had generated $43 million in Bitcoin revenue for Q3 2018, up from $37 million the preceding quarter. In Square’s Q1 2019 report in May, the company revealed that it achieved a new revenue high from Bitcoin sales via Cash App, with a stated Bitcoin revenue of $65.5 million — meaning that its latest figures are over twofold higher than the preceding quarter."

Rate cuts are adding liquidity. Liquidity is pushing money into all these risk assets and also hedges, which is helping Bitcoin.”Lee delivered a couple more general remarks about Bitcoin, which climbed back above the $10,000 mark earlier today. In terms of price, Lee thinks it is plausible for the coin to retake its all-time high by the end of the year. He remarked:“We don’t have a target for Bitcoin, but the prior high was $20,000. I think there’s a good possibility that Bitcoin reattains that high this year.”Lee also commented briefly on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s stated concerns about Facebook’s proposed Libra stablecoin. Powell said in a recent hearing before the House Financial Services Committee that Libra, “poses serious concerns regarding privacy, money laundering, consumer protection, and financial stability.” Lee told Fox that he does not think those worries are applicable to Bitcoin:“Libra is quite different in its architecture from Bitcoin, so I think that some of his comments are fair about Libra, but they don’t actually apply to Bitcoin.”Similar to Tom Lee’s remarks about Bitcoin being increasingly a macrohedge investment, the CEO of VC firm Social Capital, Chamath Palihapitiya, recently went so far as to call it the single best hedge against the traditional financial system. Palihapitiya said in a CNBC Squawk Box interview on July 9:“It is the single best hedge against the traditional financial infrastructure. Whether you support fiscal and monetary policy or not, it doesn’t matter: this is the shmuck insurance under your mattress.”"

Multiple countries —  including the U.S. — consider Maduro’s last election victory to have been fraudulent and support Venezuela’s opposition leader and self-declared interim president Juan Guaido’s attempts to dislodge him from power.While the administration’s decision has stopped short of a full trade embargo, the restrictions resemble the U.S.’ actions against staunch opponents such as Cuba, Syria, Iran and North Korea, as AP reports.Trump’s executive order prohibits U.S. citizens from engaging in transactions with any Maduro or government supporters and also prohibits the latter from travelling to the U.S.The order excludes most private sector transactions as well as the delivery of essential humanitarian aid.

Rather than merely gaining exposure to Bitcoin, investors take delivery of it, requiring them to understand how to interact with it in addition to betting on its price. LedgerX’s debut follows receipt of the requisite license from U.S. regulator the Commodity Futures Trading Commission late last month. Trading on Omni is open only to U.S. and Singapore residents, subject to a minimum deposit of $10,000 or 1 BTC (at press time equal to $9,995).The U.S. market was previously vacant, with LedgerX the sole incumbent despite the promise of several competitors issuing their own physical futures offerings this year.Among them is Bakkt, perhaps the most hotly-awaited operator, which began testing of its product last week. Regulatory uncertainty has resulted in multiple delays to Bakkt, a problem which has resulted in other businesses needing to shut out U.S. traders from using their services. As Cointelegraph reported, earlier this month, derivatives giant BitMEX became the subject of an investigation over allegations U.S. users were circumventing blocks to trade anyway."

Coinbase initially added the altcoin to its platform, but doing so produced a spike in its price, while a subsequent decision to close trading left users unable to sell at higher prices.Following the debacle, Coinbase was widely accused of insider trading, with executives allegedly manipulating markets by buying up BCH based on prior knowledge of the plans.“The plaintiffs identify three potential laws for the ‘unlawful’ prong: the Commodities Exchange Act, the FinCEN rules, and New York state regulations,” Chhabria summarized. He continued:“Even assuming Bitcoin Cash is a commodity subject to the Commodities Exchange Act, the complaint does not sufficiently explain how the launch manipulated the market for Bitcoin Cash or for Bitcoin. Nor does it plausibly or coherently describe Coinbase and Armstrong’s motive to manipulate the prices.”Plaintiffs will now have to move forward based on a negligence lawsuit. The BCH launch, Chhabria claimed, was enacted too quickly, engendering problems from the outset.“The motion to dismiss the fraud claims is granted. The plaintiffs have not particularly pleaded their reliance on Coinbase’s allegedly fraudulent statements,” he continued. The document also absolves Coinbase’s CEO, Brian Armstrong, and head of product, David Farmer, from fraud: “Moreover, while the factual allegations paint a compelling picture of an incompetent launch by Coinbase, the complaint does not outline a coherent account of fraud by Coinbase, Armstrong, and Farmer.”"

This is seen as a retaliatory move by China on the latest tariff hikes by the U.S. If the nations enter into a currency war, it will only strengthen the case for cryptocurrencies and investors are likely to flock to digital assets to protect their investments. Unlike the previous crypto bull market that had risen on hope and future prospects of cryptocurrencies, the current bull phase is being buoyed by strong fundamentals. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz said that macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical unrest have given “real legs” to Bitcoin’s current rally. Anthony Pompliano of Morgan Creek Digital Assets said that Bitcoin is responding appropriately to global instability. Max Keiser, host of the RT program Keiser Report, expects the momentum in Bitcoin to carry it to $15,000 this week alone.The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has risen to $311 billion and Bitcoin’s dominance has hit 67.8%. This shows that Bitcoin is leading from the front. How far can this rally continue and which altcoins are likely to participate in the rally? Let’s find out. Bitcoin (BTC) broke above the moving averages on Aug. 3 and triggered our buy recommendation given in an earlier analysis. It is now attempting to sustain above the downtrend line. If successful, it will indicate buying at higher levels that can carry the price to $13,156.96 and above it to the recent high of $13,973.50. If the digital currency hits new yearly highs, it can rise to $17,208.84 and above it to lifetime highs. The BTC/USD pair was forming a descending triangle. However, a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above the downtrend line invalidates the bearish setup. The failure of a bearish pattern is a bullish sign. It forces the short sellers to cover their positions resulting in a short squeeze. The momentum following the breakout of the downtrend line will provide more insight on how fast can the pair reach $13,973.50.Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in positive territory, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand. While all signs on the chart point to a rally, the traders should be ready for any eventuality. If bears sink the price back below the downtrend line, it will indicate a lack of buyers at higher levels. There is support at both moving averages, below which the bears will gain the upper hand.Ether (ETH) has broken out of the 20-day EMA and has reached the overhead resistance of $235.70. A breakout and close (UTC time frame) above this level is likely to resume the uptrend that can carry the price to $320.84. The traders can buy as suggested in our earlier analysis. The ETH/USD pair might face some selling at the 50-day SMA, but we expect it to be crossed after a minor dip or consolidation. The flattening 20-day EMA and RSI above 50 show that selling has subsided.Contrary to our assumption, if the price reverses direction from just above $235.7 and dives below the uptrend line, it will signal weakness. The trend will turn down if the pair drops below $192.945.XRP has cleared the first hurdle. It has broken out of the 20-day EMA and is on its way towards the 50-day SMA. It might face resistance at $0.34229, above which it is likely to pick up momentum. The 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI is just below 50, which suggests that the selling pressure has abated.Traders can initiate long positions on a close (UTC time frame) above $0.34229 with a stop loss of $0.2750. The target objective is a move back to $0.45.Our bullish view will be negated if the XRP/USD pair turns down either from $0.34229 or from the 50-day SMA and plummets below the critical support of $0.27795. If that happens, the downtrend will resume, which will be a huge negative.Litecoin (LTC) spurted higher following the halving, but the price is facing resistance at $105.6760. If bulls fail to scale this level, the digital currency might remain range bound for the next few days. The flattening 20-day EMA and RSI just above 50 also points to a consolidation in the near term.The LTC/USD pair will turn bullish if it breaks out and closes (UTC time frame) above $105.6760. There is a minor resistance at the 50-day SMA, above which the pair can move up to $120 and above it to $140.3450. Therefore, traders can buy on a close above $105.6760 and keep a stop loss of $90. The trend will turn bearish on a breakdown of $76.7143–$83.65 support zone.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has broken out of the overhead resistance at $345.80, which completes the ascending triangle pattern.  If the price closes (UTC time frame) above $345.80, traders can initiate long positions as recommended in an earlier analysis. This pattern has a target objective of $440.37, above which it can move up to $500.The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI has climbed into positive territory, which suggests that the bulls are making a comeback.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the BCH/USD pair reverses direction from the 50-day SMA and plunges below the support line of the ascending channel. In such a case, a drop to $227.70 is possible. Though Binance Coin (BNB) has been below the uptrend line for the past few days, bears have not been able to capitalize on it. The bulls are attempting to push the price back above the uptrend line once again. If successful, a rally to the 50-day SMA and a retest of the lifetime highs above it is likely.Traders can wait for the price to either break out of $32.60 or sustain above the uptrend line for three days before initiating long positions. The stop loss can be kept at $24 because if this support cracks, the BNB/USD pair can plunge to $18.30. Contrary to our assumption, if the price fails to rise above $32.60, the pair might remain range-bound for a few days.EOS has bounced off the uptrend line, which is a positive sign. If the price sustains above the 20-day EMA, it will move up to $4.8719. A breakout and close (UTC time frame) of this level will complete an ascending triangle pattern. Though the 50-day SMA is just above it, we expect it to be crossed. The target objective is $6.4438 and above it $7.60.Traders can buy on a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $4.8719 and keep a stop loss of $4. We will raise the stop loss at the first available opportunity. The 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI has risen close to the midpoint, which suggests that bears are losing their grip. The bears will make a comeback if they defend the overhead resistance and sink the EOS/USD pair below the uptrend line and the critical support zone of $3.8723–$3.Bitcoin SV (BSV) is gradually moving higher. It has reached the resistance line of the descending channel. If the price breaks out of the channel, it will indicate a change in trend. The first target is a move to $188.690 and above it a retest of lifetime highs.However, the 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI is just below the midpoint, which points to a possible consolidation in the near term. The BSV/USD pair might remain stuck between $188.690 and $136.890 for a few days. As sentiment has turned bullish, aggressive traders can buy on a close (UTC time frame) above the channel and keep a stop loss of $136.Our view will be invalidated if the price fails to sustain above the channel and plummets below $136.890. Below this level, a drop to $107 is probable.While most major cryptocurrencies are participating in the recovery, Stellar (XLM) has hardly moved. This shows a lack of interest among both buyers and sellers. After this period of relative quiet, volatility will expand. If volatility expands to the upside and the XLM/USD pair scales above the 20-day EMA, it can move up to the 50-day SMA. We expect the pair to pick up momentum above $0.10 and start its journey towards $0.145. Therefore, traders can buy on a close (UTC time frame) above $0.10 and keep a stop loss of $0.071. Contrary to our assumption, if volatility expands to the downside, the pair can drop to $0.076 and below it to $0.072545. Monero (XMR) has risen to the tenth spot in terms of market capitalization, hence, it has been included in today’s analysis. The correction stalled just above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent rally. The bulls have resumed the up-move and pushed the price back above both moving averages, which is a positive sign.The 20-day EMA has started to slope up and the RSI has jumped into positive territory. This shows that bulls have the upper hand in the short-term. The price can now move up to $107, above which a rally to $120 is possible. Traders can buy at the current levels and keep the stop loss at $71. If the price fails to scale above $107, we might suggest booking partial profits and raising the stops to breakeven. On the downside, support exists at the 20-day EMA and below it at $72. A break below this level will indicate weakness.Market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. "

Novogratz delivered his comments in an interview with CNBC published on August 1.,"During the interview, Novogratz declared that Beyond Meat reminds him of the state of the crypto market in 2017, suggesting that the price is in bubble territory given its parabolic rise this summer. He further provided an analysis of the phenomena and some grim predictions concerning the stock:“I think big ideas grab the attention of people, you see. You get great bubbles on big ideas, this is a great bubble, I mean, it’s a ludicrous price, but everyone got sucked in. All the young guys on their Robinhood accounts are buying this, and this is their crypto […] And then reality does set in.”Novogratz also cited the recent reports that the company’s CEO, Ethan Brown, decided to sell more stocks, which increased the float. He said that, as the float increases, “the lockup comes off and everyone else tries to sell and the price will” react to it.Crunchbase estimates Beyond Meat’s annual revenue to be about $67.3 million, and reports say that the company received $122 million in funding so far. CNBC also reported earlier today that the company’s shares lost 18.6% of their value since last Wednesday, and according to their data currently trades at $178.8 at press time.CNBC data also show that Beyond Meat stock price peaked at the end of last month at over $239 dollars after trading at $65 in February. This is a 267.69% price in just a span of a few months. Beyond Meat stock price chart | Source: CNBC"

The message further states that the scammer is in possession of a photo or video of the victim looking at pornography websites, ostensibly obtained through a hacked webcam.In other cases, the author of the email claims to be a member of law enforcement who found child pornography on the receiver’s device.The author of the email further intimates that — if the receiver of the message does not send a requested amount of Bitcoin to the address provided — the embarrassing images will be shared with the victim’s friends, relatives or colleagues.Usually, the scammers ask for hundreds of dollars. A message published by Symantec asks the receiver to send $708.Syantec also notes similar emails containing bomb threats, claiming that a concealed bomb has been planted in the place where the victim conducts business, which will explode unless Bitcoin is sent by the end of the working day. In this case, the screenshot shows the scammer asking for $20,000.Example of bomb scare email scam. Source: SymantecAccording to Symantec, the scams are not targeted and the aforementioned passwords were likely obtained through one of the recent massive data dumps of potentially sensitive information. Per the report, in May 2019, 63 wallets associated with such scams received a total of 12.8 BTC, worth $106,240 at the time. Symantec estimated the yearly income of $1.2 million by taking the example of May as a likely monthly average. Symantec recommended that individuals take extra email security measures to protect against such scams, and advised not to open emails from unknown sources or open links and attachments in scam emails, should they receive one. As Cointelegraph reported last month, the South Korean Justice Ministry estimated that cryptocurrency-related crimes caused 2.69 trillion won (about $2.28 billion) of financial damage between July 2017 and June 2019."

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.","Market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.The United States Federal Reserve cut rates today for the first time since 2008, which some believe is unwarranted as the economy is on strong footing. The rate slash is seen by some as a means to appease President Donald Trump, who has been critical of the Fed’s monetary policy.The rate cut could attract investors to Bitcoin, which is not influenced by any political or central bank intervention. With its halving due in 2020, markets will also focus on the deflationary nature of Bitcoin. On Tuesday, U.S. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Michael Crapo said that even if the country wanted to ban cryptocurrency, it was unlikely to succeed. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said that the U.S. will need to create appropriate regulation to protect investor interests and “to allow the technology and industry to flourish.” It will be interesting to note how Bitcoin and altcoins react to the Fed rate cut. Let’s identify the actionable levels on the major cryptocurrencies.The failure by bears to sink Bitcoin (BTC) below $9,080 is attracting buyers. The bulls will now try to propel the price above both moving averages and resume the uptrend. If successful, the cryptocurrency will move up to the downtrend line, which might act as a resistance. However, if this line is scaled, the next target is a retest of the recent highs at $13,973.5. As the signs are positive, we suggest traders initiate long positions as recommended in an earlier analysis.The 20-day EMA has started to flatten out, which suggests that bears are losing their grip. The 50-day SMA is still sloping up, which shows that the medium-term trend is up. Our bullish view will be negated if the BTC/USD pair turns down from the moving averages and plummets below $9,080. Such a move will indicate selling at higher levels. Below $9,080, the next support is at $7,451.63.After holding the uptrend line for the past few days, Ether (ETH) has started a recovery. The bulls will now try to push the price above the 20-day EMA. If successful, a rally to the 50-day SMA is probable. There is minor resistance at $235.70, above which the digital currency is likely to gain strength. Hence, traders can buy as suggested in our earlier analysis. Contrary to our expectation, if the ETH/USD pair fails to rise above the overhead resistance and turns down, it will indicate selling at higher levels. The next dip might break below the uptrend line because it will force the aggressive bulls to liquidate their long positions. With both moving averages sloping down and the RSI in the negative zone, bears still have the upper hand. We might get a clear directional move within the next few days.XRP has moved up to the 20-day EMA, which is the first resistance. If this is crossed, the pullback can reach $0.34229, above which we anticipate the cryptocurrency to show strength. The traders can wait for the price to close (UTC time frame) above $0.34229 before initiating long positions. The stop loss for the trade can be kept at $0.275 and the first target is a move to the 50-day SMA and above it $0.45. As the cryptocurrency is stuck in a range, allocate only 50% of the usual position size for this trade.However, if the bulls fail to propel the XRP/USD pair above the overhead resistance, it might again slide back to $0.30, below which a retest of $0.27795 is possible. A break of $0.27795 will be a huge negative as it will trigger several stop losses and can result in a quick decline to $0.19. The bulls are attempting to push Litecoin (LTC) above the uptrend line. If successful, it will signal a probable change in trend. There is a minor resistance at $105.676 from where the pullback returned on July 20. After this is scaled, the cryptocurrency can move up to the 50-day SMA and above it to $140.345.Contrary to our assumption, if the LTC/USD pair fails to break out and sustain above the downtrend line, it can again dip to $83.65. A break below $76.7143 will extend the down-move. On the other hand, if the price breaks out of the downtrend line, but fails to scale above $105.6760, it will form a range. We will suggest long positions on confirmation that the uptrend has resumed. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has risen above the 20-day EMA, which is a positive sign. If it breaks out of $345.80, it will complete an ascending triangle pattern that can carry it to $440.37. Therefore, we retain the buy recommendation given in the previous analysis.Our assumption will be negated if bears defend the overhead resistance and sink the BCH/USD pair below the uptrend line. In such a case, a few days of range-bound action is likely. The trend will turn negative on a break below $251.23 and might enter a freefall if $227.70 cracks.The bulls are attempting a recovery in Binance Coin (BNB). It will face resistance at the 20-day EMA, which is close to the uptrend line. If bulls scale this level and sustain it, a move to the 50-day SMA is possible. Failure of bears to capitalize on the breakdown of the uptrend line shows strong demand at lower levels.Therefore, we might suggest long positions if the BNB/USD pair sustains above the uptrend line for three days. However, if the pair reverses direction from the 20-day EMA and breaks below $24.1709, it will indicate selling at higher levels. A break below $24.1709 can plummet it to the next support at $18.30.The small daily ranges in EOS suggest that it might enter a tight range without any clear direction. It has seen two such phases in 2019 (marked as ellipses on the chart). Our view will be invalidated if the EOS/USD pair either breaks down of $3.30 or scales above $4.7753. A break below $3.30 can plummet the price to $2.20 while a rally above $4.775 can carry it to the 50-day SMA, above which it will start a new uptrend. As we do not have clarity on the next probable direction, we remain neutral on it.Bitcoin SV (BSV) has stayed in the upper half of the channel since July 20, which is a positive sign. However, as the price remains stuck inside the descending channel, the trend remains down.The first sign of a trend change will be when the BSV/USD pair breaks out of the channel. It has minor resistance at $188.690, above which the pair can pick up momentum and rally to $255.620.On the other hand, if the price fails to breakout of the channel and slips below $136.890, a retest of $107 is probable. We do not find a reliable trade setup that offers a good risk-to-reward ratio, hence, we are not proposing a trade in it.The price action of the past three days shows that neither the bulls nor the bears are taking any directional bet. This has resulted in the formation of doji candlestick pattern on all three days. This state of indecision is unlikely to remain for long. We anticipate Stellar (XLM) to either break out or break down decisively in the next few days.  The next directional move on the XLM/USD pair will happen either on a breakout of $0.10 or on a breakdown of $0.072545. If the price fails to escape these levels, the pair might end up forming a range for the next few days.While there is no bullish setup for swing traders, investors who are willing to hold through the volatility can buy at current levels with a stop loss of $0.070. The target objective is $0.0145. Though the risk-to-reward ratio is attractive, it might test investors' patience. Hence, we recommend keeping the position size about 50% of usual.If Cardano (ADA) does not break out of the symmetrical triangle within the next couple of days, the price will reach the apex of the triangle, which will invalidate the pattern. The daily range has been shrinking for the past two days, which increases the possibility of a sharp move in either direction.If the move happens to the downside, the ADA/USD pair will extend the decline and plummet to $0.041. Conversely, if the breakout happens to the upside, traders can initiate long positions as suggested in our previous analysis. As the pair is not in an uptrend and we are trying to take a reversal trade, we suggest traders keep the position size at 50% of usual.Market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. "

Despite being an economic leader, many within the crypto industry argue that the United States in particular has not yet gained a leading position among governments actively working to regulate this new technology. ","We asked the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Julie Stitzel, the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission’s (CFTC) Heath P. Tarbert, NYU Blockchain’s Timothy Paolini and other industry experts to comment on the current situation with regulation U.S. regulation of crypto and blockchain.The U.S. — the economic powerhouse home to Wall Street and Silicon Valley — faces some challenges in creating a cohesive regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency. Various U.S. regulatory agencies have different stances toward crypto. Back in 2013, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) classified Bitcoin as “an example of a decentralized virtual currency.” The following year, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) proposed treating Bitcoin and other digital currencies “as property for U.S. federal tax purposes,” and in 2015, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) considered digital currencies as commodities. Earlier this summer, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) had jointly outlined regulatory compliance issues for cryptocurrency custodians and had not discovered those circumstances in which crypto could comply with the SEC’s Customer Protection Rule. Resulting from complex legal and tax requirements imposed by several U.S. regulatory agencies, some of which has been named above, the U.S. still does not have a clear regulatory framework for the crypto industry at the federal level.  “The United States’ history of adopting and amending legal frameworks in the financial sector have resulted in a robust regulatory structure that enables market stability and effectively manages risk. Although the digital assets market is still nascent, there is a risk and concern that the United States may be left behind — missing an opportunity to cultivate innovation, create jobs and grow the economy by leveraging the emerging technology. “As the largest economy in the world, the United States must think differently about how we apply existing regulatory and supervisory principles to digital assets—including cryptocurrency. Appropriately classifying digital assets and determining the federal entity with the jurisdiction to regulate and supervise them is one way to provide regulatory clarity for innovators and signal that the United States is a leader in the digital asset space.”— Julie Stitzel, vice president, U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness “U.S. markets are the global standard with respect to their breadth, depth, and integrity.  This is the result of a careful balance of innovation, well-calibrated regulation, and a pro-business environment.  While the U.S. regulatory landscape is by no means perfect, there are always tradeoffs with any system. U.S. regulators have been careful not to stifle innovation during the development of this nascent space. “As we move forward, applying solid, principles-based regulations that appreciate the transformational potential of new technologies—such as crypto assets and other 21st century commodities—will be key to ensuring America’s free enterprise system remains the envy of the world.” — Heath P. Tarbert, chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission “Regulatory authority in the U.S. is split among too many diverse agencies, and they all have their missions and their interests to assert. In addition to FInCEN, the SEC, the CFTC, and the IRS all chiming in on how to categorize and treat cryptoassets, you have 50 state governments to think about as well.  In the hurry to assert authority, many of these over regulated, based on what they thought they understood. So we are stuck with thinking about cryptocurrency as if all crypto was the same kind of interest, and could be regulated monolithically by each agency. Congress cannot fix the situation because Congress is too busy being divided along party lines. States cannot fix it because they simply do not agree on how to address the myriad issues that genuinely are posed by cryptoassets.“Our regulatory scheme is split among too many diverse agencies and authorities, and tends to be too monolithic is its approach and too slow to react to the rapidly developing new technology.”— Carol Goforth, law professor at the University of Arkansas, former Arkansas Bar Foundation professor of law “Who said that the U.S. isn’t the leader in crypto regulation? On the contrary, from an anti-money laundering (AML) regulatory perspective, the U.S. is certainly the leader. The U.S. provided formal guidance on how crypto exchanges should be regulated as far back as 2013. Last year, I coauthored a study with Tom Robinson of Elliptic where we analyzed Bitcoin transaction data from various Bitcoin conversion services around the world. We found that the proportion of illicit bitcoins going into exchanges coming from darknet markets and mixers was much lower in North America compared to Europe. The likely reason: U.S. Treasury’s FinCEN – the organization that enforces AML regulations—had provided much clearer guidance than you had in Europe. “Another example of U.S. leadership in crypto AML regulation is how the Financial Action Task Force, the global body that sets standards for AML and counter-terrorist financing, recently provided guidance for regulating digital assets. This guidance was driven by the U.S. and largely reflects the framework already enforced by FinCEN.”— Yaya J. Fanusie, adjunct fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, chief Strategist for Cryptocurrency AML Strategies, LLC “One issue in the US is that this asset class falls on the borderlines of multiple regulatory agencies so jurisdiction has caused uncertainty. The SEC has stepped up as the primary regulator and is taking decisive action when it comes to enforcement but a more measured approach when it comes to actual regulation. There are many that feel the existing laws on the books are sufficient. This has caused many in the industry to look to Congress (despite significant hurdles there) for rules. “In addition to the above, many in the US feel that we already have robust capital markets and opportunities for innovation and don’t have the same incentives as other jurisdictions that may be using this new industry to spur their economies. We, however, do not think this is the right approach for the US.”— Georgia Quinn, general counsel of coinList “For the most part, U.S. governmental entities are allowing cryptocurrency regulation to evolve incrementally from existing laws, some of which have been in place for eighty or more years, rather than proposing a new regulatory framework.  The advantage of this approach is that the government is allowing guidelines over the development and use of the technology to develop organically rather than establishing premature oversight which could inadvertently stifle a technology that is still in its infancy.“The disadvantage is that the lack of regulatory oversight makes it difficult for cryptocurrencies and related businesses to operate in the US without bright-line rules. A number of foreign countries (e.g. Switzerland, Gibraltar and Bermuda) have taken the opposite approach in an effort to establish cryptocurrency governance frameworks to lure investment.“By allowing crypto regulation to evolve organically rather than developing a new framework to accommodate it, the U.S. is deliberately taking a wait and see approach on crypto. While there are undisputed advantages to blockchain technology that are being explored throughout government and the private sector, the advent of cryptocurrencies threatens to disrupt the way the U.S. has traditionally regulated securities and commodities.  As important, some cryptocurrencies allow a simple by-pass of the myriad regulations promulgated under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Investment Advisors Act that are designed to protect consumers and prevent financial crimes such as money laundering. Those complexities, combined with the challenge of addressing issues that fall under the jurisdiction several different regulatory authorities, are key factors preventing the U.S. from becoming a world leader in crypto regulation.”— John S. Wagster, co-chair of Frost Brown Todd blockchain and digital currency industry team “Regulatory uncertainty is one of the biggest obstacles to advancing blockchain technology. Specific to the U.S., the sheer number of regulatory bodies and variety of interpretations has made it difficult for U.S. firms to operate. “Until the U.S. can articulate a single set of standards to govern the industry we expect to see more innovations coming from other regions, which is why we established Bittrex International—to advance our mission of fostering blockchain innovation on a secure and reliable platform—while continuing our active dialogue with the appropriate U.S. regulators.”— Bill Shihara, co-founder and CEO at Bittrex “When new technologies are introduced, regulators are often faced with a similar set of key challenges: how to best protect consumers while fostering innovation, promoting competition, enforcing legacy regulations and resisting the urge to overregulate.  “With respect to blockchain, policymakers have been hesitant to introduce specific regulations for a variety of hurdles.“First off, blockchain-enabled digital assets are not a homogeneous asset class—they may feature characteristics of securities, commodities, currency units, or a combination thereof—and affect markets that cross national borders.  In the U.S., we have various agencies exercising overlapping authority; for example, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Financial “Crimes Enforcement Network, the Federal Trade Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and the Securities and Exchange Commission may have concurrent or overlapping jurisdiction over a particular blockchain-related matter. “Secondly, while the standard policy cycle often takes several years, emerging companies often develop disruptive technologies with global reach in just a few months. And history has taught us that regulations that are too fast can be just as bad as regulations that are too slow.“Despite these challenges, U.S. policymakers are calling for action and are showing a strong effort to engage with participants in the blockchain space – a crucial step on the path toward meaningful regulation and guidance.”— Dario de Martino, partner in the corporate department of Morrison & Foerster, co-chair of MoFo’s Blockchain + Smart Contracts Group ""The U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued its first guidance addressing cryptocurrency companies in 2013, and since then regulatory action for digital assets has been slow to develop but has picked up in the past few years as an increasing number of federal and state agencies see the unique opportunities and risks associated with the sector. “Crafting sensible regulations to provide a stable regulatory framework for digital assets without choking their innovativeness is a difficult task and not one a federal or state agency should undertake without a solid foundation of experience with digital assets.  “There is a growing buzz complaining that the lack of regulations has impeded progress for digital assets, but it would quickly become a loud scream if regulations were issued in a way that missed the mark altogether.  “The slow, deliberative nature of the regulatory process in the U.S. can be frustrating to be sure, but it reduces the type of big swings and misses risked by reactionary and under-informed regulations."" — Michael Nonaka, partner and a co-chair of the Financial Services Group at Covington & Burling LLP, member of the American Bar Association and Banking Law Committee “In my 8+ years of dealing with the government, I can tell you that there is significantly more red tape, formalities, and bureaucracy than you can imagine to deal with prior to getting anything done in DC. Even bringing up issues for discussion takes immense effort as there is always a never ending barrage of topics competing for attention. “Also, probably the biggest contributing factor is the huge educational gap that currently exists in DC. Many of the regulators are only now trying to wrap their heads around crypto and blockchain. Thankfully we have people like Kristin Smith and her team at the Blockchain Association to help educate DC and speed up the process towards much needed regulatory clarity.“Washington is also notoriously reactive. We saw this in the case with Facebook’s Libra initiative, which caught regulators completely off guard and led to a scramble of fact-finding hearings.

contracts in the U.S., but report was later debunked by LedgerX.","Aug 6, 2019","Earlier this week, United States-regulated crypto derivatives and clearing platform LedgerX was reported to launch the first physically settled Bitcoin futures contracts in the country, therefore stealing a march on Bakkt and ErisX. However, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) soon refuted that information by stating that the exchange has not yet been properly cleared by the agency. ","Now, a LedgerX official has told Cointelegraph that the media publication that broke the news — CoinDesk — had “misunderstood the scope of the launch,” which in turn led to the confusing publication. Meanwhile, the exchange’s CEO is threatening to sue the CFTC on social media while his company offers no comment on that. Cointelegraph has also reached out to CoinDesk regarding the comment obtained from LedgerX, and was referred to a follow-up article that explained the situation from its point of view. On July 31, CoinDesk reported that LedgerX had officially launched the first physically settled Bitcoin futures in the U.S., citing information “revealed exclusively to CoinDesk.” On the same day, LedgerX announced the launch of its Omni trading platform, which, according to the company’s website, allows retail customers to “trade bitcoin, bitcoin options, and futures.” Trading on Omni is open only to U.S. and Singapore customers, subject to a minimum deposit of $10,000 or 1 BTC (which, at press time, is around $11,600). The since-deleted tweet read, without explicitly mentioning Bitcoin futures:“It's official: we're live with retail trading on Omni! If you signed up for our waitlist, you'll hear from us soon.”On Aug. 1, LedgerX posted a new tweet, clarifying that only spot and options trading are currently available on Omni, while the futures are “coming soon”:“It’s official: we’re live with retail trading on Omni! Bitcoin spot and options trading is now available to everyone (futures coming soon @CFTC)! Thanks to everyone who signed up for our waitlist, you'll be hearing from us soon.”Now, the company claims that CoinDesk misinterpreted the exclusive information that LedgerX allegedly shared with the media in a phone call prior to Omni’s launch. “We launched Omni, they just misunderstood the scope of the launch,” LedgerX's chief operating officer, Juthica Chou, told Cointelegraph in an email, clarifying:“We launched our DCM (designated contract market) which allows retail + options + swaps + futures. We launched it with just retail + options + swaps, though it got picked up as being launched with futures.”Indeed, in June this year, the CFTC officially approved LedgerX’s application for designation as a contract market. Thus, effective June 24, 2019, LedgerX has been registered as a designated contract market (DCM). However, the platform still has to receive an amendment to its derivatives clearing organization (DCO) license in order to proceed with the futures launch, as the CFTC noted in the press release:“LedgerX has requested that the CFTC amend its order of registration as a DCO, which limits LedgerX to clearing swaps, to allow it to clear futures listed on its DCM.”As CoinDesk reported in a separate article, LedgerX decided to launch BTC futures regardless, since the deadline for its amendment had allegedly passed (per CFTC regulations, the regulator has 180 days to approve or deny a DCO application). “We submitted the amendment on Nov. 8, 2018, it’s been more than 180 days, we don’t know why that’s the case [that it has not been approved],” Juthica Chou is quoted saying in the CoinDesk report. That led the company to believe that it was clear to continue with the launch, the article suggested. However, LedgerX still needs explicit approval from the financial watchdog to launch BTC futures, the CoinDesk report continued, quoting an unidentified “senior” CFTC official: “Every new or amended DCO application needs to be affirmatively approved by the Commission. [...] The absence of a decision does not constitute approval, and entity self-certification is not an option.”Another cryptocurrency news outlet, The Block, also quoted a CFTC spokesperson saying that LedgerX does not have the necessary DCO license to trade futures, as it currently only permits the clearing of swaps, not futures. “We have a ton of retail demand for our current product offerings and will add futures when we get the DCO amendment for clearing,” Juthica Chou confirmed to Cointelegraph, adding:“We've been in constant contact with CFTC. We have three licenses right now, a SEF which allows us to list options & swaps, a DCM which allows us to list options, swaps & futures, and a DCO which allows us to clear options & swaps. We are awaiting a DCO amendment so we can clear options, swaps & futures.”After it became clear LedgerX has not launched BTC futures, Ryan Gorman, founder of communications agency RGPR, which the clearing platform was apparently a client of, tweeted that his firm has terminated its relationship with LedgerX “due to concerns over the events of the past 24 hours.” RGPR has not responded to Cointelegraph’s request to offer an additional statement. LedgerX was still listed among clients on the company’s website as of press time.Moreover, once the aforementioned CoinDesk article went live, LedgerX CEO Paul Chou took to the Twitter comments section to announce that his firm is considering taking legal action against the CFTC for “anti-competitive behavior,” “breach of duty,” and “going against the regs,” among other reasons.“If the government does not do the right thing, we will sue them, period,” Chou added. “Already talking to our lawyers about this.” LedgerX has repeatedly ignored Cointelegraph’s questions regarding the CEO’s tweets, despite addressing other inquiries. Nevertheless, Chou’s tweets have struck a responsive chord among community members like Michael Poutre, a managing partner at Terraform Capital, who told Cointelegraph of his own experience dealing with U.S. regulators:“We have seen first hand how the US Government has not only acted slowly, but has been harmful to businesses in the US that have proactively worked with the government to help them understand, be informed and responsible in their blockchain/crypto facing activities and regulations. When I was running The Crypto Company, we found out our stock had been halted from CNBC. The SEC never called us, never asked us for documents, and would not return our calls for almost 5 months, and when we did speak with someone, they had little to no clue who we were.”Essentially, futures act as an agreement to buy or sell an asset on a specific future date at a specific price — and hence represent a risk management tool that might be particularly useful in volatile markets such as crypto. It is not an entirely new concept for digital currencies, however — BTC futures have been traded on two major U.S.-regulated exchanges, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), since December 2017.The distinctive feature of physically settled BTC futures, in turn, is that once the contracts expire, customers receive BTC tokens as opposed to cash. “If your objective is to lock in the price toward a future purchase of the actual asset, physically-settled BTC futures is the better option,” Martin Weiss and Juan Villaverde of Weiss Ratings explained to Cointelegraph in an email. “You buy the contract by making a deposit. Upon expiration, you pay the balance and receive the actual Bitcoin tokens.” In contrast, if the contract is settled in cash, the process is much more complicated, Weiss and Villaverde added:“First, even after settlement, you’d need to go to another exchange to purchase the BTC. Second, in the interim, the BTC price you pay could be significantly higher (especially in a volatile bull market). And most important, if you’re a large institutional player investing large amounts, you might not easily secure the desired quantity of BTC. In effect, all this defeats the purpose of buying a futures contract to begin with. Thus, cash-settled contracts are useful mostly for speculators who have no intention of owning the actual asset.”Indeed, physically delivered futures might contribute to the market’s overall volume, as well as to its overall economy, says Mati Greenspan, a senior market analyst at eToro. He told Cointelegraph:“Physically settled bitcoin futures would open the door for more participants in the market, especially on an institutional level. This would almost certainly have a significant impact on volume and price.”Nevertheless, the progress has been extremely slow, and physically settled Bitcoin futures are still not available on the U.S. market, despite being on cards for a number of forthcoming U.S.-regulated exchanges like Bakkt and ErisX. “Many teams in the space have tried to build regulated offerings and found that the process is extremely slow and cumbersome. ICE [Intercontinental Exchange, the creator of Bakkt] and LedgerX are finding this right now in the US, but the same applies to several other jurisdictions,” Jose Llisterri, co-founder and chief product officer of Interdax, told Cointelegraph, adding:“The work required to launch these offerings is titanic and will be very positive for the space if they succeed. Although it is far from an easy or fast process, and could even reach a dead-end scenario.”Thus, LedgerX’s situation seems to illustrate the difficult, intensifying relationship between crypto players and U.S. regulators. Meanwhile, industry participants continue to call legislators for clearer guidelines on U.S. soil and are moving their operations to other jurisdictions due to regulatory gaps."

When asked what about his thoughts on the initiative, Buterin appeared to encourage the move, claiming further on the thread that the future of cryptocurrencies is “diverse and pluralist.”Earlier in July, Buterin proposed implementation of Bitcoin Cash blockchain as a temporary scalability solution for the Ethereum network.While Blockade Games believes that Ethereum will be crucial to the future of non-fungible assets and blockchain gaming, the firm also thinks that Bitcoin will be the future of money, the firm stated in the blog post. Blockade elaborated that a significant number of their players prefer to hold most or even all of their funds in Bitcoin.As noted in the post, the mechanism of integration of Bitcoin LN and Ethereum smart contracts could be a part of Blockade’s upcoming Ethereum-based role playing game Neon District.Blockade Games has deployed the project by using its code on the Rinkeby testnet, and is planning to launch it on mainnet using real Ether (ETH) in the next couple of weeks, Blockade Games CTO Ben Heidorn said, according to a report by CoinDesk.As previously reported, LN is a second layer over the blockchain of Bitcoin and intends to enable fast and commission-free transactions by creating payment channels between users. Recently, Cointelegraph reported that LN transactions became available on Blockstream’s Liquid sidechain."

last eight months has been a turning point for the industry, especially ...","Aug 7, 2019","Despite all of the bad press that the digital asset industry continues to receive on an almost daily basis, it appears as though the overall sentiment of the online communities in regard to this burgeoning domain is still pretty positive. For example, Comparitech — a research firm that provides its consumers with a host of specialized data that allows one to make more informed decisions — recently used a machine learning-based analysis tool to study more than 48K Reddit posts to determine which cryptocurrencies were viewed most favorably by the masses. Not only that, the study also took into consideration a total of 7,500 crypto/blockchain-related articles from a variety of different national and international media outlets.","All of the posts, tweets and articles analyzed by the researchers were scored on the basis of their positive/negative sentiment — primarily in relation to other articles included in the study. In this regard, there were a few notable trends that jump out at the reader upon first glance. While over 85% of the analyzed Reddit posts were deemed to be positive in nature, articles published by various mainstream media publications such as HuffPost, Business Insider and The International Business Times were, by and large, dismissive of the crypto market.To get a better overview of the matter, Cointelegraph has reached out to Craig Russo, owner of Peer, a Boston-based startup that is behind the popular crypto and gaming media outlet SludgeFeed. When asked about what the overall sentiment of the average social media user toward the crypto industry (at large) was like, Russo pointed out:“While there will always be different camps or schools of thought on the crypto industry, the overall sentiment across social media continues to be bullish, both on future price growth and mainstream adoption of the technology.”A similar point of view is also shared by Sritanshu Sinha, an independent crypto author and analyst, whose work has been shared online by the likes of John McAfee and Kim DotCom. Sinha pointed out that the overall reception that the crypto industry has received thus far on forums such as Reddit and Twitter has been quite warm. He is also quick to point out that, since the Reddit community as a whole views itself as being anti-establishment, the platform’s users are usually drawn to crypto much more than your average investor. Similarly, in the case of Twitter, he believes that there are a few independent analysts who have hundreds of thousands of followers and therefore have the power to influence the community toward fostering a positive view regarding various altcoins/digital offerings.Another pertinent question is how the crypto industry’s general perception has evolved since the novel asset class came into the spotlight a few years back. For example, it is no secret that all through 2018, investor confidence in this space has been dwindling. However, Russo believes that Bitcoin’s (BTC) financial upswing over the last eight months has been a turning point for the industry, especially across different social media outlets. Further elaborating on his views, Russo added: “This is in stark contrast to those invested in the altcoin markets, as many are in disbelief towards the poor performance of their assets. The regulatory environment definitely plays into the latter, as increasing pressure from the U.S. government has undoubtedly hurt investor interest in Bitcoin alternatives (i.e., Binance shutting down to U.S. customers).”When compared to the previous years, the general sentiment toward the crypto sector has certainly become less hostile. For example, back in 2017, a time when Bitcoin was witnessing astronomical growth, the industry was still facing a lot of heat from many financial experts of differing pedigree. And while the market, at the time, was replete with countless scams (especially Twitter bots) such activities have largely died out now. As mentioned earlier, a host of recent surveys seem to suggest that more than 80% of all crypto talk online is positive. This number seems abnormally large for an industry that is usually on the receiving end of a lot of criticism from various traditional media outlets. Sharing his thoughts on the subject, Sinha pointed out:“80% seems about right. Mostly, because that’s the nature of evangelism. Most of us on social media seems to be crypto-evangelists. However, positive sentiments and bull markets are highly correlated and they seem to be feeding off each other to create a positive feedback loop. If I have to prophesize, the 80% positive sentiment will not be the case during a bear run. Then the voices of the skeptics will become louder and sentiments will turn increasingly negative.”A number of hedge funds and asset managers are currently turning to software developers to help them interpret and harness sentiment signals to their advantage. Speaking to Reuters on the subject, Bin Ren — CEO of Elwood Asset Management — was quoted as saying that this latest trend of identifying price clues from tweets and other social media messages is slowly turning into an “arms race for money managers.”To put things into perspective, it can be seen that the costs involved with conducting such types of research analyses are quite steep. As per Andrea Leccese, president of New York-based investment firm Bluesky Capital, a simple bot-driven Twitter data exploration can cost firms anywhere between $500,000-$1 million.Ever since Facebook announced its decision to enter the digital asset market — via its much-hyped stablecoin offering called Libra, which is backed by the Libra Foundation — the regulatory noose surrounding this space seems to have tightened considerably. However, contrary to popular belief, a number of crypto analysts seem to believe that increased regulations can be a good thing for the industry. Cointelegraph spoke to Mohanned Halawani, the founder and CEO of Crypto PR, one of the first blockchain-specialized communication firms. He seems to be quite optimistic and believes that some of the latest regulations are actually quite advantageous for prospective investors, especially those regarding security token offerings (STOs) and initial coin offerings (ICOs). Halawani went on to add:“The SEC has facilitated the emergence of Security Token Offerings which it felt was a more worthy investment vehicle when compared to traditional Initial Coin Offerings... Security tokens allow their investors to get information about the issuer on a fully transparent framework, providing complete visibility on all token allocations. Thanks to the regulatory benefits of these assets, authorities are beginning to their raise their standards among tradable asset classes and even support their implementation.”Similar opinions are also provided by Joe Mercurio, project manager for Comparitech, who believes that the goal behind these regulations is to ultimately make consumers and businesses more comfortable with using cryptocurrencies on a regular basis. Mercurio shared his thoughts with Cointelegraph:“I think that government entities will eventually adopt blockchain technology and new cryptocurrencies will begin to emerge. That said, I do believe that the market will remain volatile.”Whether we like it or not, government regulations are crucial for any financial commodity — be it crypto or otherwise — to gain mainstream acceptance. And while these rules and guidelines may appear to hamper an asset’s growth at times, a majority of these regulations are a step in the right direction. Also, because Bitcoin and other digital currencies are basically tools for individual financial freedom, governments do not want to give up financial control over their citizens.Simply put, when we see the history of such revolutionary technologies getting adopted by countries en masse’, we are sadly faced with a long and painful path that eventually leads to widespread human well-being.Mercurio, whose core field of work includes the analysis of tweets and other online content to gauge public sentiment, is of the belief that there currently exists a strong correlation between the volume of social media posts related to a particular digital asset and its price. As part of his research, he claims to have often observed spikes in online articles when the price of a specific cryptocurrency changes. Mercurio went on to add:“Social media posts remain more positive during times of price fluctuation compared to media coverage overall. Online enthusiasm regarding crypto has been overwhelmingly warm. We found that cryptocurrency-related subreddits were 55% more likely than media publications to have content with positive sentiment toward various cryptocurrencies.” In a similar vein, to look at the impact that social media influencers have on the crypto industry, we can turn to a few high-profile individuals such as Elon Musk and LA Chargers’ star Russell Okung, both of whom have been advocating for the widespread adoption of crypto for quite some time now. In fact, Okung has sent out several requests to the NFL, asking the league (since the start of 2019) to provide its employees with the option of getting paid in crypto — a petition that is backed by fellow NFL star Matt Barkley.It thus appears as though the crypto market will continue to grow, mainly because people want to find newer economic avenues that are free from the involvement of any corporations or government-controlled agencies. However, a lot of this growth will depend on the use cases that emerge from this space. Also, as social media continues to play an ever-increasing role in arenas such as politics and public affairs, there is no reason to doubt its utility when it comes to crypto adoption."

Coin Metrics co-founder Nic Carter additionally mentioned that some of the USDT whales include major crypto exchanges, such as Binance and Bitfinex.The report additionally notes that this is staggeringly different from the distribution of Bitcoin (BTC), for which whales apparently hold only around 20% of the total token supply. Moreover, over 20,000 BTC addresses reportedly hold at least $1 million in equivalent assets.However, despite Bitcoin being more evenly distributed among its user base, the USDT whales may be able to swing the Bitcoin price on their own, as suggested by University of Texas at Austin finance professor John Griffin:“The concentration of Tether suggests that control of Tether is in the hands of a few central players who can swing Bitcoin prices, and have a vested interest in doing so [...] It also suggests that many exchange players have a vested interest in keeping the Tether game going.""According to the report, Griffin has purportedly linked USDT to market manipulation and its rally to an all-time high in 2017. Sid Shekhar, the co-founder of market tracker TokenAnalyst, says there are also market concerns related to volatility that come into play whenever a large sum of USDT is injected into the market.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, USDT is now being offered on Bitfinex via another blockchain protocol for Bitcoin — BlockStream’s Liquid Network sidechain. USDT has, in the past, been run on the Omni blockchain. Liquid is additionally planning to make Liquid-based USDT available on other crypto exchanges in the future, including OKEx, OKCoin, BTSE, BTCTrader/BtcTurk, RenrenBit and Sideshift AI."

Bannon expressed his admiration for the cryptocurrency in an interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box on Aug. 2.","Bannon argued that the leading digital currency Bitcoin could be a very important part in “this global populist revolt,” with cryptocurrencies having a big future.Bannon thus reiterated words from his lecture in Zurich this spring, when he stated that cryptocurrencies and blockchain will “empower movement, empower companies, empower governments to get away from the central banks that debase your currency and makes slave wages.”Bannon further stipulated that he anticipates that developing countries will use cryptocurrency to escape the dependence on the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency. Bannon said:“I happen to think that Facebook was principally against some of the Chinese Alibaba, Tencent, etc. — these payment systems. I think that what people have to confront now, and people have started looking at is how the Chinese and third world countries — in Sub-Saharan Africa, in South Asia, and I think potentially in Latin America — are starting to put these payment systems in. They are going to kind of give them — try to give them global dominance and be able to get off the reserve currency of the dollar.”In June, Bannon held private meetings with both cryptocurrency investors and hedge fund managers about the possibility of issuing an initial coin offering through his investment firm, Bannon & Company.Bannon’s current interest in cryptocurrency ostensibly addresses the possibility of countries creating their own cryptocurrencies based on their national wealth, bringing up the example of an Italian digital currency backed by the country’s marble deposits:“It was pretty obvious to me that unless you got somehow control over your currency, all these political movements were going to be beholden to who controlled the currency.”"

The lack of regulation in the crypto markets can be fertile ground for money laundering, terrorist financing, tax evasion, etc. Therefore, it is not surprising why the FATF guidelines are calling for the end of anonymity in the crypto market.","In fact, after the G-20’s determination to comply with the FATF standards, we are soon going to see their implementation around the world, and crypto users will be required to put aside their privacy — and for some, even their ideology — in order to use services under the control of the regulator.Related: ‘Not Everyone Is Happy but We Have to Move on,’ Some Challenges to the FATF’s New GuidancePretty soon, what we are going to get is two separate groups of crypto addresses: clean crypto and black-market crypto. To get into the clean group, you must declare your crypto addresses, account numbers, location information, beneficiary’s name, etc. If you choose not to disclose this information, you will be automatically assigned to the black-market group.   The standards require crypto exchanges to perform extensive Know Your Client (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures. Each address will be identified and linked to a specific person, and there won't be any anonymous addresses coming in and out of the exchanges. This might be the end of the crypto world as we know it.While many users will mourn the loss of their privacy, the bright side of these standards is the ability to integrate the crypto market into traditional financial markets, which can lead to a significant increase in usage and the ability to cash out crypto to fiat within the banking system.  However, because of the anarchist nature of some hodlers, there will be some who choose to retain their privacy and to be a part of the black-market group. As Jeff Horowitz, chief compliance officer at Coinbase, said:  “I get why the FATF wants to do this. But applying bank regulations to this industry could drive more people to conduct person-to-person transactions, which would result in less transparency for law enforcement.”Therefore, it is necessary to carefully consider which side to belong to — because once you go black, you can never go back. If you choose to have your addresses in the black market, it will be tough to ""come clean"" and use them without the risk of facing criminal charges. All eyes are facing the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) now, which, after pressure by U.S. Congress to provide clarity on reporting crypto taxes, is going to publish a clarification to tax reporting soon, as stated in the response letter to Congress from May 16. This clarification will determine the executable methods for crypto tax calculation, such as determine whether taxpayers need to use a specific identification method to report or if there are other acceptable methods.While the specific identification method identifies the exact Bitcoin (BTC) that the user sold, and calculates his/her tax liability on the sale of the actual Bitcoin based on the blockchain evidence, the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method is not taking under consideration real-time user activity. Basically, to calculate in the FIFO method, one has to make a list of all purchases and another list of all sales. Then, to do the matching: Take the first one in the purchase list and calculate the tax results as if he/she sold it at the price and on the date from the first sale in the sales list. This results in an over taxation, especially if you bought your first Bitcoin in the early years.In order to calculate using the specific identification method, one has to identify — using evidence from the blockchain — the purchase dates and sales date of all Bitcoin that came in and out of his/her wallet for the same tax year. Then, he/she must match the purchase and sale dates and prices of the same Bitcoin using blockchain data, and finally calculate the tax liability.The specific identification method, just like the new FATF regulation, will require the crypto taxpayer to disclose all his/her crypto addresses. Will the IRS enforce it? Stay tuned, and we will soon find out.Anonymity claimed to be one of the fundamental essences of crypto, but will this regulation destroy cryptocurrency? Probably not. Meanwhile, the European Union’s regulatory framework sets a goal “to unveil the anonymity,” calling it “the biggest problem for combating money laundering and countering terrorist financing.” Regulation is an inevitable step in the process of market maturation, and is a major and significant step toward a much broader adoption.  Will crypto exchanges successfully adapt to the new regulation or is it a technical challenge that they are unable to implement? Will the IRS also ask for a declaration of crypto addresses?

The service will purportedly be available to both businesses and the general public.The Fed believes that such a system will allow consumers to more flexibly manage their money and make time-sensitive payments and is requesting comment on the possible design and functionality of the new service.

The initiative intends to build “fast, safe and ubiquitous payments network in the U.S.”The Federal Reserve cut interest rates last week, a move which some experts say could be partially responsible for Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent price rally.

mined ... Searches for “Bitcoin halving” on Google are typically more ...","Aug 4, 2019","With just one day to go until Litecoin’s (LTC) next halving event, Cointelegraph sets out all you need to know about the cryptocurrency’s reduction in block rewards. In spite of their reputation for creating price hikes, the lead up to the halving has witnessed a 25 percent decline in valuation over the last month. ","Halving is a process that occurs when the mining reward for a cryptocurrency is reduced by 50%. Miners receive crypto rewards for solving problems that create each new block on a given blockchain. The rewards differ for each cryptocurrency. With Litecoin, miners are currently awarded 25 coins per block. After Aug. 5, miners will only receive 12.5 Litecoins per block. Litecoin rewards halve every 840,000 blocks, a process that occurs every four years. The block speed for Litecoin is roughly 2.5 minutes, with around 576 blocks generated per day. One of the key factors to take into account is that, according to the coding behind cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin, only a certain amount will ever be mined. This distinct characteristic sets it apart from fiat currencies, which can theoretically be printed infinitely. Although it’s difficult to say when the final Litecoins will be mined, the Litecoin Foundation estimates that it will be around 2142, when the maximum of 84 million Litecoins will be reached. As of press time, there are 62,983,450 Litecoins in circulation, representing 74.93% of all Litecoins that will ever be mined. This leaves roughly 21 million coins left to be mined up until 2142. Comparatively, it’s estimated that the final few Bitcoins (BTC) will be mined around 2140. Halvings are closely followed by investors, as the consequent reduction in mining rewards affects the profitability. Accordingly, this has a knock-on effect on the price. For investors, this can be a mixed bag. According to the theory of supply and demand, halvings should drive up the price of the cryptocurrency. As they receive fewer coins per block solved, miners stop producing them until the work once again becomes profitable. As fewer coins enter circulation, the price consequently goes up, as demand — in theory — will overtake the supply. Although this sounds like a sure-fire win for investors, halvings can bring about even greater instability to an already volatile market.Previous halvings have stoked investor interest, and the upcoming Litecoin event is no exception. According to Google Trends, searches for “Litecoin halving” peaked between June 9 and June 15, although data shows that this trend is once again increasing. Searches for “Bitcoin halving” on Google are typically more numerous than entries for Litecoin, although this trend has reversed as of July 30.In the time leading up to the halving, miners ramp up operations to maximize their returns until the whole process becomes unprofitable. Miners need to invest in powerful, specialized equipment to take on the computing challenges required for creating blocks. As the difficulty of mining blocks rises, so do electricity costs. Mining is no longer a game for individual hobbyists, with even the biggest mining farms struggling to remain profitable during the so-called crypto winter of 2018. Mining is now a big business, and businesses need to make a profit. So, when profitability falls, activities tend to cease. The fact that miners will feel the heat after the halving is no secret, with Litecoin creator Charlie Lee predicting that many will shut up shop after Aug 5. Lee told Australian crypto news site Mickey that halving the block rewards by 50% always has an impact on the Litecoin mining ecosystem: “When the mining rewards get cut in half, some miners will not be profitable and they will shut off their machine. If a big percentage does that, then blocks will slow down for some time. For litecoin it’s three and a half days before the next change, so possibly like seven days of slower blocks, and then after that, the difficulty will readjust and everything will be fine.”Despite the commonly accepted theory that a decrease in supply results in a corresponding increase in demand, Lee suggested that market sentiment also plays a role in ramping up the price: “In terms of the price, the halvening should be priced in because everyone knows about it since the beginning. But the thing is people kind of expect the price to go up. So a lot of people are buying in because they expect the price to go up and that’s kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy. So, because they’re buying in, the price does actually go up.”After Litecoin’s 2015 halving, the coin peaked in July of that year before losing nearly 50% of its value by the time of the reward reduction, culminating in a decrease of 75% in the aftermath, Mickey reports. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarketsFX, told Cointelegraph via email that reducing block rewards for miners is an effective filtering process and agreed that the effect on the price is usually positive:“Reducing the incentive for miners is good for LTC because only serious people will remain in the space. As for the price action, it is difficult and it depends a lot on the sentiment but usually this kind of action is positive for the price.”If the price bombs following the halving, the network hash rate will tail off as mining begins to shut down, leaving only the largest mining farms operational. Once the hash rate drops below a certain point, the mining difficulty will adjust itself and smaller miners may be able to begin mining once again. Although halving events are widely considered to result in a price hike for the given cryptocurrency, market experts do not foresee any dramatic changes in valuation. Mati Greenspan, a senior market analyst at eToro, told Cointelegraph that halving events are usually priced in before they actually happen:“It seems to be the case here as well. Litecoin has outperformed the rest of the market during this year's rally and some say that it was a root cause of the upward momentum in the first half of this year. It's difficult to say how or even if the price will react to the event in the short term. In the long term, reduced supply supports higher prices all else being equal.”Renowned crypto trader and technical analyst Crypto Rand also agreed in email conversations with Cointelegraph that the halving event has already been priced in:“I don't think the halving event will have much impact on Litecoin price, it's already priced in since one month I would say. LTC is looking pretty solid here. It just broke up the local downtrend channel after bouncing on the key $88 range support. If the downtrend of volume finally comes to an end I'm expecting a rise on the price back to $105-$110. Right now looks like a solid option among the rest of big caps.”For Aslam, those trying to jump on the halving gravy train are already too late: “The most important factor to remember is that these kind of planned events are already fully priced in and traders have already positioned themselves for this. Running up to the event, it is not usually wise to participate in that move because you are already too late for the party. Therefore, smart money always buy the rumour and sell the news.”Greenspan predicts that there won’t be many surprises in mining activity, due in part to Litecoin’s scrypt algorithm: “Litecoin's scrypt algorithm is pretty unique so the hardware used to mine it is not easily adaptable to mining other tokens. Therefore it doesn't have quite the same of competition over hashrate that some of the other cons have. My feeling is that LTC miners have had ample time to prepare for the halving so we shouldn't see any major changes.”When asked about what investors holding LTC should be doing, Greenspan had advice: “Holding. But more importantly spending. Litecoin's value proposition specifically involves being a more durable token for making payments. The more people use it for this purpose, the stronger the network gets.”Some members of the crypto community are commenting that the Litecoin halving can be viewed as a test run for the upcoming midyear 2020 BTC halving and that we can consequently expect similar results. For Greenspan, the comparison is sound, although he warned that results will not be identical: “The market has matured a lot since the last Bitcoin and Litecoin halvings. Though we couldn't possibly expect a mirror reaction, the LTC halving should give us some indication of what to expect when BTC does the same next year.”Crypto Rand is not so sure, however, stating that investor understanding and even awareness of Litecoin juxtaposed to Bitcoin is incomparable: “I don't think LTC halving can work as test for Bitcoin, I would say 95% of the traders/investors are not aware of the halving on LTC or they don't know what means. The coverage for BTC it's and will be a fully mainstream event, everyone will be aware of it.”A blog post published on July 21 by institutional-grade algorithmic investment management platform Strix Leviathan reported that cryptocurrencies do not outperform the market in the months leading up to and following block reward reductions. The report found that the supply and demand theory, while “certainly feasible as a logical theory,” does not result in a rapid increase in price. Per the report, Strix Leviathan analysts found that LTC outperformed the market twice prior to a reduction in block rewards, yet fell to the bottom 25% of the market in the ensuing six-month period. The report also postulates that the performance of a crypto asset both in and out of halving periods are more or less the same: “What we find is that the return distribution of an asset’s halving periods versus the return distribution outside of its halving periods reveals that they are statistically the same at a 99% confidence level. In other words, we did not find evidence that a halving event results in abnormal pricing action and we are dealing with a circumstantial illusion. It appears more likely that the return behavior before, during, and after a halving coincides more with increasing levels of speculation than with an underlying shift in sell side pressure.”A report published by Binance Research, an arm of major crypto exchange Binance, found that the impact of halvings for both BTC and LTC miners could be mitigated by merged mining. Binance researchers analyzed Charlie Lee’s prediction that many miners would have to halt operations and looked into how merged mining could help keep miners on-board even after rewards have been reduced. Merged mining uses the work done on a parent blockchain and spreads it across other smaller “child blockchains” by using auxiliary proof-of-work (AuxPoW). The three most prominent examples of merged mining are the Litecoin-merged Namecoin (NMC), Bitcoin-merged Dogecoin (DOGE) and Myriadcoin (XMY), a cryptocurrency merged with both BTC and LTC. The report theorized that merged mining could help mitigate the impact of reward reductions by future block rewards scheduled for both Litecoin and Bitcoin. Binance researchers also reported that smaller chains could incorporate AuxPoW in future to support greater network security and reduce the need for an independent mining operation. The report did, however, find some potential shortcomings. Researchers said that miners may not turn to merged mining due to the risk of operational costs when supporting child blockchains and potential declines in the market price. The report cites Dogecoin as the most successful examples of merged mining, which adopted the model in August 2014. After the switch, the coin’s mining hash rate skyrocketed 1,500%. The report also found that, as of July 2019, 90% of Dogecoin’s total hash rate is sourced from Litecoin mining pools."

The bill seeks to introduce amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which specifically determines:“No gain or loss shall be recognized on the exchange of real property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment if such real property is exchanged solely for real property of like kind which is to be held either for productive use in a trade or business or for investment.”The aim of the bill is to ensure that “the exchange of virtual currency for virtual currency of like kind shall be treated in the same manner as the exchange of real property for real property of like kind.”In effect, if the bill became law, it would preclude cryptocurrencies from double taxation under the Internal Revenue Code. In July, U.S. Congressman Tom Emmer reintroduced his Safe Harbor for Taxpayers with Forked Assets bill in order to foster blockchain industry growth in the U.S. by lessening the burden on businesses to figure out relevant tax laws. In Emmer’s own words, “taxpayers can only comply with the law when the law is clear.”The Safe Harbor bill is not intended to eliminate taxes on a hard-forked blockchain, but aims to provide a safe harbor to investors who do not properly account for a hard fork in calculating their tax returns.Budd previously testified to the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee on purported issues with current tax laws on cryptocurrencies in June. Budd argued that cryptocurrencies should have a de minimis tax exemption like foreign currencies."

While Bitmain was reportedly planning to file an IPO with the US SEC as of the end of June, this report — if accurate — would mean that Canaan Creative has beat them to the punch.In March, Canaan Creative raised additional capital in its latest funding round, with the exact amount remaining uncertain. No new investors came on board, with all new cash reportedly coming from existing backers.Now, the IPO filing means Canaan is the first Chinese market participant to successfully take its case to the U.S. market, claims the report.As Cointelegraph noted, previous attempts at IPOs had met with rejection, with Canaan, Bitmain and Yibang all trying unsuccessfully to launch the offering in Hong Kong. At the time of Bitmain’s failure in December 2018, rumors cited the then highly volatile nature of Bitcoin as a potential factor giving regulators cold feet. Mining had suffered a setback the previous month as Bitcoin prices plunged, sparking significant shifts as participants attempted to stay financially stable.Six months later, the landscape has transformed, with Bitcoin’s bull run seeing a dramatic reversal of fortunes across the mining industry. In June, Bitmain said it was looking to file a US IPO of its own."

This is 1/4 of the way to the next diff change. 21.65 hrs has elapsed since the halving. Normally on average it takes 21 hrs for 504 blocks. This means 97% of pre-halving hashrate still mining LTC.”Halving — or the pre-coded 50% reduction of the mining rewards for a given cryptocurrency — is an event that is closely watched by the crypto community for its impact on both the price and on miners. For Litecoin, rewards halve every 840,000 blocks — a process that occurs every four years. The block speed for Litecoin is roughly 2.5 minutes, with around 576 blocks generated per day, as previously reported. Ahead of Litecoin’s latest halving, Lee had notably warned that the block reward reduction could be a shock for the coin’s mining ecosystem, noting that:“When the mining rewards get cut in half, some miners will not be profitable and they will shut off their machine. If a big percentage does that, then blocks will slow down for some time.”Yet as yesterday’s data reveals, this shock does not appear to have materialized, with miners unfazed by the slimmer pickings offered to them in return for their hash power.Assuming that a cryptocurrency has a cap on the total coins that will ever be mined — as for Litecoin and Bitcoin (BTC) — the reward reduction should, according to classic supply-demand economic theory, have a bullish impact on an asset’s valuation.While Litecoin’s mining health appears to be steadfast, the halving event translated into something of a fleeting price appreciation. The coin saw a boost on its USD chart of 13% yesterday to hit $104, as of press time Litecoin is back circling just below $100, at $98.In regards to price, Lee had recently argued that market sentiment complicates the impact of halving on a cryptocurrency, proposing that traders’ anticipation of the event — rather than scarcity — is what creates a self-fulfilling prophecy to boost the coin’s valuation.Anticipation meanwhile continues to build ahead of Bitcoin’s (BTC) next halving in May 2020."

Justice Matthew Nicklin of the Queen’s Bench Division threw out the case earlier this week, according to a decision published on July 31.","Back in May, Craig Wright — an Australian computer scientist who claims he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin — served Ver with a libel suit in London. Wright accused Ver of calling him a fraud and a liar, among other things. Justice Nicklin wrote:“The Claimant has not satisfied me that England and Wales is clearly the most appropriate place to bring his action for defamation over the publications complained of. In consequence, the Court has no jurisdiction to hear and determine the action. The action will be struck out.”According to Nicklin, the evidence presented led him to believe that England and Wales were purview to very little of the alleged defamation. Rather, the vast majority of the complaints supplied fall under United States’ jurisdiction:“The evidence clearly demonstrates that the most substantial publication of the statements complained of is in the U.S. It is common ground that, of the global publication, only some 7% took place in England and Wales.”While Nicklin offered jurisdiction as the primary grounds for dismissal, he also went on to discuss his doubts about the extent to which Ver actually libelled Wright. The judge wrote that the claim of harm due to the alleged publications is “weak, lacks detail and the three paragraphs I have set out [...] put forward evidence at a level of generality that is almost entirely speculative.”Questions of jurisdiction have been central in another prominent crypto case. In a back-and-forth battle between the New York Attorney General (NYAG) and Tether, the NYAG claims that some of Tether’s financial activities violated New York law and could have harmed investors in the state. Conversely, the lawyers defending stablecoin operator Tether — as well as associated crypto exchange Bitfinex and its parent company iFinex — have been arguing that Bitfinex and Tether have not been transacting with any New York customers.The NYAG has tried to demonstrate that the firms have been operating in New York, therefore giving the office precedent to pursue the case under the Martin Act — a New York-specific finance law — to which the NYAG initially appealed."

The DApp enables users to track volatility of digital assets — including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), among others — by analyzing past records of market movements.The service thus provides forecasts of how cryptocurrency prices will change over the course of several hours. Samsung’s users will reportedly soon be able to receive in-depth analysis reports on blockchain token market and prices.The second app, Mars, lets users conduct peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transfers through QR code. “Complex address input can be avoided just by clicking on a QR code and therefore, typo error or entering wrong address can be avoided,” the release explains.Samsung initially announced its DApp kit in July, stating that it allows for account management and backup, payment and digital signature facilitation, Samsung Keystore and other cold wallet support.That same month, Cointelegraph reported that Samsung and cryptocurrency payments startup Pundi X’s new cooperation will allow users to integrate the XWallet app to their Samsung Blockchain Wallet.Samsung first revealed that Galaxy S10 series will have wallet functions for digital currencies in February. Later in May, news broke that Samsung’s budget smartphones will also feature cryptocurrency and blockchain features."

In order to mine cryptocurrency in Iran, local miners will have to get approval from Iran’s Ministry of Industry, Mine and Trade, as well as to ensure that their mining facilities are located outside a 30-kilometer perimeter of all provincial centers in the country.The capital Tehran and the central city of Isfahan are excluded from the list as they will be practicing stricter regulatory restrictions, PressTV notes. As a part of the new rules, crypto miners will be charged for using energy based on the prices applied for the export of energy from Iran. While mining is now legal in the country, the deputy president of the Islamic Republic of Iran Customs Administration recently noted that the agency has not issued licenses for importing digital currency mining equipment into the country.On July 31, Iranian provincial police arrested an individual for smuggling crypto mining equipment worth around $230,000.The new crypto bill was introduced in Iran in the light of increased popularity of cryptocurrency mining as a method of avoiding international sanctions."

built as a stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency that is designed to 
maintain a ...","Jul 31, 2019","The official announcement and details around Project Libra were provided to the world on June 18, 2019. Firstly, Libra was introduced: a new global reserve-backed cryptocurrency built on top of the new Libra Blockchain, with everything governed by a not-for-profit consortium dubbed the Libra Association. It was clear that each of these products and technologies will play an integral role in the project’s overall mission of creating a simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people. ","Additionally, Facebook also announced the creation of Calibra, which is developing the initial business of Libra and its own product outside of the Libra ecosystem (i.e., an eponymous digital wallet app). One way to answer the question is to look at how Facebook built Libra and how similar it is to that of the main and more prevalent Decentralized Applications (DApps) framework as it was originally presented in 2014 by David Johnston and a group of foundational experts — way before any public knowledge of Facebook’s cryptocurrency plans. When the entire Libra ecosystem is broken down, could Libra be the largest DApps network to date? If it checks all the required criteria laid out in the 2014 DApps white paper mentioned previously, and if the roughly 2.4 billion active users throughout Facebook’s platforms is considered, it may just be.Today, the main question on everybody’s mind is whether Facebook is a villain and, through the announcement, is trying to enhance its current hold on customer data, or if Facebook is genuine and is trying to make a contribution as a global citizen to a problem bigger than Facebook itself. After all, even the world’s largest companies like FedEx suggest that one company cannot control this entire DApps or blockchain movement, and that only “co-opetition” (i.e., cooperation and competition) and co-creation and regulations will help crack the problem. The most famous model of co-opetition is, of course, the open-source movement that was fully supported by IBM, one of the top-10 companies in the world in the 90s. IBM was later joined by the likes of Google, Facebook and Twitter to provide the mere foundation of what is today Software as a Service (SaaS) and cloud computing. So, one early community fully supported by the most prominent companies can go a long way without being preempted by the biggest companies. To the contrary, one of the biggest losers of this new technology was indeed IBM, which failed, for many reasons, to jump on the public cloud computing bandwagon by staying focused on hosted private clouds — even when public clouds showed far stronger growth. As the market evolves, IBM’s position may improve, but there is no doubt that, at this point, IBM didn’t benefit as fully as others of a movement that the company helped create and foster. Compared to open source, DApps are very young — probably as young as open source was in 1995, when IBM got involved. It is also struggling with many issues, with the main ones being adoption and the need of endorsement from major brands. So, is Facebook the IBM of DApps and the main contributor to something bigger than itself?When we begin to breakdown the Libra ecosystem and apply its structure against the 2014 white paper on DApps, how does it match up? According to the general theory, for any application to be considered a DApp, it must meet four areas of qualifying criteria. ✅Criteria #1 — “The application must be completely open-source, it must operate autonomously, and with no entity controlling the majority of its tokens. The application may adapt its protocol in response to proposed improvements and market feedback but all changes must be decided by consensus of its users.”Over the past year, engineers from Facebook's Calibra team have designed a blockchain from the ground up to meet the needs of the Libra ecosystem. Facebook has consciously open-sourced a prototype of Libra Core early so that the community can influence its direction. Facebook has irrevocably contributed its rights and code to the association under the terms of the Apache License and Apache Contributor License Agreement — just as any other contributor to Libra Core should.As it states, the application must be completely open-source. However, Libra is an undertaking from many different directions — unlike anything we’ve seen since the early days of the internet. Facebook understands this and has noted that it will continue to take a fundamental leadership role on the project's development through launch and then transfer over everything accordingly, becoming open source for the community after that.To ensure the first condition was achieved, Facebook did launch an open-source prototype version of Libra, called Libra Core — of which the testnet is now live — thus allowing the developer community to get an early preview of the soon-to-launch protocol, beginning engaging immediately. Even though Facebook can retract itself from this path, every communication seems to indicate that Libra will be open-source.This approach is very similar to how a majority of the most successful open-source projects have been initially developed, mainly by the most prominent companies and then contributed to by the community. Successful transitions include products like Hadoop, Kubernetes, and Ruby On Rails. Over the last 15 years since its creation, Facebook has continuously been open-sourcing products that are now standards in their respective industries and the approach taken for Libra follows the same path. Related: Facebook Libra Regulatory Overview: Major Countries' Stances on CryptoThe second condition to meet requires that the application must operate autonomously, allowing for decisions to be made by a consensus of its users. Facebook, as it stands, is leading the implementation of the Libra project while the vital decision-making resides with the founding members of the Libra Association. Facebook’s leadership will be transitioned to that of that Association as soon as an operating structure is in place — and hopefully no later than the end of 2019.The association, based in Geneva, Switzerland, is the acting independent, not-for-profit, membership-based organization and consortium, whose mission is to empower billions of people through the creation of a simple global currency and financial infrastructure.The Association has goals to:The Association's initial responsibilities will be to:There are three types of members in the Association: #1 -- Founding Members, who have been vetted and meet a series of requirements voted on by the other founding members, ensuring industry diversity of the members. Requirements include market value, scale (reaching more than 20 million people a year) and being recognized as one of the top-100 industry leaders by a third party. Some exceptions are allowed for newly emerging industries like cryptocurrency and blockchain infrastructure companies. Some companies may be extended invitations if their participation would make a meaningful contribution to the success of the network. Each must also provide a required investment of $10 million that will be used in the Libra Reserve, which backs the Libra coin and is used for operations. Additionally, each must act as a node validator (more details in Criteria #4) for the network. creating one with optimized performance. #2 — Social Impact Partners, who are nonprofit and multilateral organizations that must be elected by the other founding members and meet a certain number of criteria: alignment with Libra mission, global reach, trust and scale.#3 — Academic Institutions, who are selected by the other founding members and must meet the criteria based on trust and the strengths of their computer science departments.The second and third types of founding members are exempt of the $10 million capital contribution but would not benefit from the dividends provided to those holding Libra Investment Tokens.Today, there are 28 initial founding members, including Facebook/Calibra, that represent six different industries/categories. The goal is to have 100 members before the project is publicly launched during the first half of 2020. Here’s a breakdown of the 28 founding members.As the project continues, it will be interesting to see which categories expand (i.e., marketplaces) and which get added — real-estate, travel, entertainment? What’s clear is that the founding members are the cornerstone pieces to the bigger picture that Libra can become. The governing body of the Libra Association is the Libra Association Council, which is comprised of a representative from each member within the Association. Operating and policy decisions of the council require various voting thresholds, depending on the importance of the decision. The initial members of the council are the Association's founding members.If the main governing body is the council, the Libra Association will also have a board designed to oversee on behalf of the Libra Association Council the executive team. The executive team is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Libra.Related: US Congress on Libra Overview: Trust, Privacy and Genocide AccusationsEach founding member’s voting rights on the council are limited to not be greater than of one vote or 1/100. One vote is given for each $10 million invested. Any voting rights gained through additional activities or further investment are delegated to the board of the association, which can assign those rights to social impact partners and academic institutions. With increased privacy, security and data-use concerns coming from all directions, the most substantial outstanding question has been around Facebook’s role within the project. Facebook has continued to be transparent as to its role in the project to date and, going forward, in the fact that the company will not own or be the sole decision-maker for the overall project — excluding Calibra, its digital wallet. Everything created otherwise will be governed by the Libra Association and then be open source completely later on. Facebook will also act as a validator node on the network to validate transactions with the other consortium members, a requirement for those in the group. An initiation of this magnitude is not just disrupting a single market but instead is challenging the entire global economic foundation and the interactions among consumers, corporations and governments. For this and many other reasons around security, privacy, data, etc., one company cannot be the sole owner — also per the 2014 white paper on the general theory of DApps. Facebook knows this, and like any DApp, there needs to be an independent, not-for-profit organization in place: Thus, the Libra Association was born.  ✅Criteria #2 — “The application's data and records of operation must be cryptographically stored in a public, decentralized blockchain in order to avoid any central points of failure.”Since the goal of Libra is to create a “simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people,” it needs technology that can support such. Enter blockchain.The Libra Protocol will be the underlying infrastructure for the ecosystem, with the Libra blockchain being a permissioned — not public — blockchain. It was noted that, as the technical road map advances, there is a plan over time to move toward being permissionless (i.e., open). The blockchain is maintained by a distributed network of validator nodes — also known as validators — beginning with the nodes of the Libra Association’s founding members. Each validator collectively follows a consensus protocol known as LibraBFT, which is based on the protocol HotStuff, to agree on a total ordering of transactions in the network. To maintain accuracy and to prevent double-spend attacks, Libra’s validator nodes will use what’s called Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), which allows for the nodes to reach consensus even when the nodes can’t all agree on the state of the other nodes in the network. This process applies even if up to one-third of the voting power is held by validator nodes that are compromised or failed.With the Libra Protocol, Facebook has introduced the Move programming language for those looking to develop on the Libra Blockchain. According to its developer site, the language is a safe, flexible and executable bytecode language used to implement custom transactions and smart contracts.Facebook has chosen for Libra to be permission-based, which means the blockchain maintains an access control layer to allow specific actions to be performed only by certain identifiable participants. Libra is neither public nor decentralized at this point. Over the last few years, we’ve seen many blockchains shying away from the public model and redesigning themselves to be permissioned, due to increased performance and flexibility. Examples of this blockchain type include JPMorgan’s Quorum, R3’s Corda and the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger, along with others in the blockchain landscape. In the future, the stated goal of the Libra Association is to move toward a public or permissionless-based blockchain. These blockchains are entirely open, and anyone is free to join along by participating in the core activities of the blockchain network. ✅Criteria #3 — “The application must use a cryptographic token (bitcoin or a token native to its system) which is necessary for access to the application and any contribution of value from (miners / farmers) should be rewarded in the application’s tokens.”The Libra coin will be the network’s native token, while also being a stable, reserve-backed cryptocurrency built on top of the Libra blockchain and used throughout the Libra ecosystem, including Calibra. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, the Libra coin is built as a stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency that is designed to maintain a stable market price. Many stablecoins have their values fixed by pegging them to the price of another asset. While most of them are pegged to the United States dollar, there are stablecoins pegged to the price of other cryptocurrencies — or even commodities, like silver or gold.As such, Libra’s value will be backed by a basket of stable and liquid assets — such as bank deposits and short-term government securities in various currencies from stable and reputable central banks — which will provide the intrinsic value beginning on day one. Furthermore, the basket of assets will help to protect the coin against the speculative swings experienced by other cryptocurrencies. These assets will be apart of the Libra Reserve and managed by the Libra Association.It’s also worth noting that Libra coin will be accessible to users outside of Facebook’s Calibra wallet. ✅Criteria #4 — “The application must generate tokens according to a standard cryptographic algorithm acting as a proof of the value nodes are contributing to the application.”Due to Libra’s current and unique structure, there will be no mining reward system in place at launch for the community beyond Libra Association members, which must also run a validator node — of which will be provided transaction and new user rewards, along with dividends from Libra Investment Tokens. All transactions on the network will run through the validator nodes. This also allows for an improved transaction speed, the primary function of the network.However, the question remains: As the network evolves into a permissionless blockchain, will we see a proofing structure similar to that of proof-of-stake (PoS) be implemented? For reference, Bitcoin uses the proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm.As Facebook stated, it will be moving away from being the leader of the overall project nearer to the public launch of the project. However, that doesn’t mean it didn’t save a little something for itself. Welcome the shiny new digital wallet Calibra. We’ve seen several digital wallets rise and fall throughout the blockchain and fintech landscapes, but this one stands to be different from its predecessors because it will begin with approximately 2.4 billion global users on day one and provide them a unique ecosystem that only one other rival can provide — i.e., Tencent’s WeChat.Calibra will be built natively into all of Facebook’s platforms — including Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram — as well as having a standalone mobile app. Facebook has been transparent about it not only being the owners of wallet, but that Calibra will sit in a regulated subsidiary of the company, ensuring the appropriate handling of users’ social, identity and financial data. Why does Calibra matter even more so now than ever before? According to the 2017 Global Findex report from the World Bank, 1.7 billion people — 31% of the global adult population — remain unbanked, meaning they do not have access to an account at a financial institution or to mobile money. This will put Calibra in the position to provide instant financial, banking and remittance services to all of its current and future users. Other than the unbanked, Calibra undoubtedly will put Facebook in the position WeChat currently is as a platform — but with more than twice as many users (roughly 2.4 billion to around 1 billion respectively). With Calibra’s integration throughout the Facebook ecosystem, it becomes the de facto platform for everything in your life, beyond just social and communication. WeChat is this for almost a billion users globally, regularly providing users every reason to stay in the application and no reason to leave. WeChat has been able to accomplish this by allowing a user the ability to communicate socially via a social feed and privately through messaging or groups; be entertained through games, etc.; transfer money globally in seconds for little to no fee; donate to charities and causes; pay the majority if not all bills (utilities, etc.) and rent; and purchase digital and physical goods or services inside or outside of the app (restaurants, retail, etc.). Users no longer have to be concerned about currency conversion, reaching for a wallet, cash or a credit card — thus, almost completely replacing paper cash in China and other countries. With Libra and Calibra, Facebook could bring together global partners and all of WeChat’s additional features to create the single most significant digital currency (Libra coin) and marketplace ever in history — thus opening the door to a thriving future economy of DApps and introducing new business models, markets, products and services, all of which Facebook has successfully proven with its developer community in the past.Related: What Is Libra? Breaking Down Facebook’s New Digital CurrencyLibra is a permission-based blockchain dedicated to finding a solution for global payments, and it is a consortia with a set goal of 100 founding members. The concept of a consortium in the blockchain ecosystem is not groundbreaking, as there have been a growing number of them emerging around various industries, and with more to come. In a 2019 survey conducted by Deloitte, the researchers identified several consortia dedicated to financial services alone. In that same survey, it was shown that 41% of enterprise organizations select to join a consortium like Libra because the group’s objectives are aligned with theirs. Additionally, Deloitte found that a number of enterprises have either joined (35%) or are planning to join (34%) a consortium in the next 12 months.Libra is a cryptocurrency that's currently led by Facebook. Again, this is not new for an enterprise. There are at least three cryptocurrencies at the testnet level that are driven by major institutions.

However, there’s no reason to assume that it won’t achieve such a goal. Facebook has the ambition to transition toward a public blockchain while maintaining sustainable business models across the board for the parties that are investing in the greater ecosystem.Providing access to those who are unbanked and lowering the costs for remittances are solutions to well-understood problems of today’s global financial system, even though several attempts are ongoing to find other solutions.Facebook, of all institutions, knows how to be successful in such an environment, given its more than 10 years background of open-source development.Not long after Facebook's initial efforts, Libra's ecosystem will begin leading the way and providing a blueprint on how to disrupt industries, open new customer markets that have otherwise been unreachable, force new business models, change the interaction as we have known it between enterprises and consumers — all of this building toward the creation of the most comprehensive social and financial system in history.

the principles that informed Bitcoin's original, subversive ideology.","Aug 2, 2019","Ripple, whose business is built on providing financial institutions with an infrastructure to facilitate international payments and currency trades, has always been a more likely ally to governments and regulators than most other major blockchain projects and cryptocurrencies. Seeking to enhance rather than disrupt the operations of the legacy financial industry, the company has been long stressing the importance of a clear-cut policy framework for the banks to fully reap the fruits of blockchain-powered innovation.","The regulatory pushback against Libra, Facebook’s recently announced cryptocurrency, has apparently spurred Ripple’s determination to publicly take an even more pro-market-regulation stance. Late July saw the company’s leadership publish an open letter to the United States Congress (which also appeared as a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal), urging lawmakers to differentiate between the industry players and “not paint us with a broad brush,” but to promote regulation that recognizes fundamental differences between various actors in the space. In taking this potentially controversial step, what message did the creators of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen, want to convey?As noted in the letter, Ripple deploys blockchain-based innovations “in partnership with regulated financial institutions to enable the world to move money across borders” — a mission that is vastly different from the principles that informed Bitcoin’s original, subversive ideology. Some crypto purists even deny XRP the right to be called a true cryptocurrency on the grounds of the degree of the system’s centralization, as well as the fact that Ripple, the company, maintains control over a large share of XRP tokens.Related: SWIFT Vs. Ripple — The Importance of Speed in Cross-Border PaymentsWhile this debate is impossible to be definitively resolved absent a universal delineation of what a “true” cryptocurrency is, it is hard to argue that the way XRP is structured sets it apart from most other top coins, such as BTC or Ether (ETH), which operate on permissionless ledgers. This is perhaps the major fundamental difference that the letter emphasizes, the distinction between XRP and other high-cap digital assets.However, there is more to it, since it is worth keeping in mind that the company Ripple, which issued the letter, is not synonymous with the XRP cryptocurrency. Ripple offers banks and other financial organizations products, whose main function is to decrease the costs of cross-border transfers; some of these solutions make use of XRP token, while others do not.Clearly, the authors of the letter urge Congress not to lump them together with some other corporate entities that operate in — or are seeking to move into — the domain of payments traditionally served by institutional actors. Both the timing of the message and the passage about how “digital currencies have the opportunity to complement existing currencies like the U.S. dollar — not replace them” make it apparent that the jab is aimed at Libra, which President Donald Trump considers a threat to the dollar.As Ripple stands to benefit from a coherent and uniform set of rules governing international transactions, the fintech firm has long been vocal about its support of regulatory certainty across jurisdictions of its operation. The statement on Ripple’s website proclaims that the company is committed to building “a regulatory framework for global payments that is predictable, clear, consistent, and pro-competition.” The company touts having obtained a digital asset-specific charter, called a BitLicense, from New York’s Department of Financial Services — the first instance of getting such an approval for an institutional use case.Ripple also has a record of declarations supportive of heightened regulation of the blockchain industry akin to the recent letter. In 2018, Ryan Zagone, director of regulatory relations at the firm, addressed the United Kingdom’s government with a call to put an end to the Wild West of cryptocurrencies by instituting rules of the game that would mitigate risks without hindering innovation. Similarly to the letter penned by Garlinghouse and Larsen, Zagone’s appeal drew a comparison between the current state of the blockchain sector and the early years of the internet.These statements were not merely lip service to appease the regulators. Shortly after the international Financial Action Task Force issued guidelines that introduced more stringent Know Your Customer requirements for cryptocurrency-related businesses, Ripple entered partnership with the startup Coinfirm, which specializes in compliance and is reportedly set to furnish the new client with a range of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) information.Other reports allude that Ripple could be privy to potentially far-reaching discussions with international regulators, including the International Monetary Fund, in which the guardians of the global financial order discuss ways to integrate blockchain technology into the workings of traditional institutions.Such positioning looks logical for a company with a global focus, whose role is better defined as facilitator rather than disruptor. Apparently, Ripple’s ideal regulatory scenario looks very different from that of the majority of other companies that make use of cryptocurrencies. The company’s preferred arrangement would likely entail a uniform set of global cross-border payments regulations, complemented by stringent AML policies to limit the public networks’ capacity to facilitate such exchanges pseudonymously.Ripple’s position as a pro-regulation mediator between global regulators and the crypto industry has been unchallenged for a while, as other major blockchain systems simply lacked both centralized agency and the need to closely interact with legacy financial institutions by design. The game changed when Facebook upended the space with the announcement of Libra — a global payments system with a potential billion-user reach and enough clout to tailor global regulatory frameworks to its own needs by directly appealing to national governments.It is not just the status of the regulators’ darling, though, that was threatened by the prospect of Facebook’s megaproject materializing. While it may look like Ripple and Libra specialize in separate segments of the remittance market — the former concentrating on interbank payments and the latter primarily concerned with transfers between individuals — some recent developments point to the tendency toward convergence of the two. Perhaps the most indicative of all is the recently announced partnership between Ripple and the global payments network MoneyGram, illustrating the company’s interest in the retail remittances domain.As Libra’s initial momentum got bogged down in lawmakers’ suspicious hostility, Ripple’s leadership evidently seized upon an opportunity to counterattack. Speaking on Bloomberg TV on the same day that the open letter to Congress was published, Ripple’s CEO, Garlinghouse, offered ample criticism of Facebook’s “arrogant” approach to cryptocurrencies, again siding with the traditional financial system and supporting President Trump’s assertions of the dollar’s superiority over any other would-be global currency.Along with his remarks on Libra, Garlinghouse also took time to denigrate public blockchain systems such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are allegedly beholden to the disproportionate influence of Chinese miners — the kind of fearmongering that is ostensibly designed to impress a certain strain of U.S. policymakers.Ultimately, is Ripple’s pro-regulation crusade just another manifestation of the company’s longstanding public view or was it an outburst triggered by the imminent threat from the Libra side? It is likely both: a response to tectonic shifts in the crypto landscape evoked by Facebook’s ascendance to the scene and a vocal reminder to the authorities that the company’s behavior has always been different from that of the so called “irresponsible actors.” Lindsay Danas Cohen, chief operating officer and general counsel at digital assets platform Velocity Markets, sees Ripple’s recent actions as a manifestation of regulatory goodwill. She told Cointelegraph:“Similar to other industries, such as financial services, regulatory compliance in the blockchain and digital asset space requires commitment. Crucial to this commitment is ensuring that ‘regulatory compliance’ is a pillar of any company in the space and that such compliance is built into a company’s DNA. […] We believe it is crucial to work with lawmakers and regulators in the U.S. to ensure that we bring world-class emerging technology to the forefront while also developing a proper regulatory framework to address related risks.”Michael Poutre, managing partner of blockchain platform Terraform Capital, told Cointelegaph that the calculus behind the open letter has much more to do with the emergent competition rather than with Ripple’s penchant for regulation:“Libra is a direct competitor, and a superior one. If Libra gains traction, Ripple will fall to the ranks of an 'also ran'. The letter they authored goes against virtually everything Ripple was started for. They are attempting to kill Libra in the crib, so it can't grow up to kill them. The letter has the appearance of being disingenuous, and it lauds the institutions Ripple was created to subvert.” Poutre also believes that Ripple has been caught up in a difficult situation whereby it is having to side with a lesser evil:“Libra is a better solution — but has a lot of work to be done for it to work and go live. Ripple is speaking from both sides of its mouth by stating that governments have historically handled this well as are needed going forward. They don't believe that for a minute, but the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Ripple hates regulation, but needs the regulators this last time to try and kill a superior product. And you know what, it may work. Congress loves to be told how smart they are.”Whether it is one or the other, at the very least, the letter to Congress contributes to our ability to map the crypto space and Ripple’s place in it. In an industry in which ideology plays a considerable role, the company that owns more than half of all XRP ever to be issued has confidently put its stakes on the incumbent financial system. Even if the regulators won’t notice the move, the crypto community certainly will."

The hedge funds that have survived the crypto winter are now more mature, sophisticated and process heavy,” he said.Moody noted that funds are diversifying their strategies and allocation approaches, spurred by the need to seal a competitive edge in a 24/7 digital marketplace. He predicted that as more capital flows in from large-scale institutional players, the crypto space will see a host of new products, including advanced derivatives.This June, fresh data from institutional crypto lender Genesis Capital revealed a major increase in cryptocurrency activity from institutional counter-parties, with volumes 2-3x higher than they were twelve months ago. Reporters argued that this institution-led momentum could well have contributed to Bitcoin’s 2019 price rally."

According to the cited sources, the agency will probably only go back two or three years:“If they do only go back two or three years, I think the interesting thing here is, that the individuals who went into crypto very early on in 2012-13 will not be affected. The ones who probably made the largest gains won’t be affected, it will be the people who came in around the time crypto peaked.”HMRC reportedly confirmed that such requests are within the scope of its competence, specifically claiming:“These exchanges can retain information on their clients and the transactions that they have completed. These transactions may result in potential tax charges and HMRC has the power to issue notices requiring exchanges to provide this information.”Last December, HMRC published its first detailed tax legislation for private cryptocurrency holders following a lengthy consultation period. Specifically, it demands that individuals paid either Capital Gains Tax or Income Tax depending on the type of cryptocurrency transactions they are involved in.HMRC’s move echoes the United States Internal Revenue Service’s, when it sent letters to 10,000 crypto investors, asking some to amend their tax filings, while compelling others to pay back taxes and/or interest and penalties. The revenue service states that the letters should be delivered by the end of August.Cointelegraph reported that beginning Aug. 1, Brazil citizens are obligated to report on their crypto transactions with the country’s tax authority, the Department of Federal Revenue.

Their second tweet in the series reads:“For now, we're pausing new deposits and loans in Dharma. If you have an existing deposit or loan with Dharma, you'll still be able to access your account and will have the option to withdraw any funds that are not currently locked up.”While not appearing to offer any further details, Dharma assured the public in the rest of their posts that they were “hard at work” and that the “next chapter of this story is going to be exciting.”Dharma is a relatively young company. In February, the firm raised $7 million from investors such as Coinbase Ventures. The Block Crypto additionally specified that the funds would go toward Lever, it’s platform designed to support instant margin loans for crypto traders and high-volume investors.The head of the Dharma Labs’ marketing team, Max Bronstein, reportedly the claimed advantages of Lever as follows:“Investors can take out loans against a number of different assets in sheer minutes, counter-party risk can be eliminated by smart contracts, borrowers can freely move their principal anywhere they’d like, and most importantly, all of this can be done at almost half of the cost offered by traditional lenders.”As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Dharma launched its public-facing lending service in April. In the announcement, Dharma said that its service was compatible with any wallet, but that only Ether (ETH) and the stablecoin DAI were currently available. At the end of May, Dharma announced that it added support for the dollar-backed stablecoin USDC."

return to 2012, the time when Bitcoin and POW consensus began ...","Aug 5, 2019","From POW, POS to POC, people's awareness of the consensus mechanism is constantly being updated. The POC consensus mechanism redefines the consensus mechanism from the spatial dimension. It is the improvement and optimization of the POW, it is the evolution and continuation of POS. Based on it’s background, the first POC Consensus Conference and the establishment of POC Community was successfully held in Shenzhen China on July 30th.","The POC Consensus Conference was hosted by BHD Community and POC Community. The conference gathered blockchain industry leaders, POC consensus mechanism ecosystem academics, mining machine manufacturers and other relevant attendees to jointly explore the future development trend and application of BHD ecosystem and POC consensus mechanism. The event was successfully held supporting the POC consensus mechanism to innovate, expand their science and technology, and build an encryption based on the POC consensus ecosystem.Mr.Bug, one of the pioneers and very influential KOL in the Chinese blockchain industry, who is currently focusing on the evangelism of the POC consensus ecosystem made an opening speech. “POC consensus takes us back to 2012” -where Mr.Bug has said “The consensus mechanism is the core rule of blockchain. The proof of capacity is a brand new consensus mechanism that allows us to return to 2012, the time when Bitcoin and POW consensus began to attract attention.” He also mentioned POC as a shared consensus mechanism. POC mining shares the same database, and its network can support the mining of thousands of digital currencies at the same time. The coinage rights of all cryptocurrencies can be completed using the same consensus mechanism in the future. Regardless of the market value of a single currency, a database consisting of tens of billions of globally distributed random hashes based on mobile phone memory or hard disk capacity can be used to support consensus security. “The POC consensus is a unified system. This consensus will be a massive evolution for the entire blockchain industry!”Gary, the initiator of BHD community and POC community, stated that BHD uses the architecture of Bitcoin wallet and the consensus algorithm, conditioned proof of capacity, which is upgraded from Burstcoin. CPOC is a great innovation combining the advantages of both Bitcoin and Burstcoin. BHD is more secure and stable, and it is a self-governing community project as Bitcoin. BHD will give more rewards and support to miners who meet the mining conditions. All the changes have done by mathematical formulas and algorithms instead of centralized manual operation.Jessi, a Axonomy co-partner, has delivered a presentation titled ""POC community and POC Ecology"". He said: ""POC Ecology has created a new relationship to redefine the role of mining machine manufacturers, miners, project parties and currency users, the game between the four parties is more moderate than traditional POW ecosystem, meanwhile it is more secure, stable, and beneficial. User's portrait is more accurate. The hard disk consumed by POC mining is very small compared to the entire hard disk market. The future of POC Foundation is a land that can create more value for the miners, make the ecological network of the entire POC healthier, and make the existing POC miners gain more benefits. The future ecology of POC can completely reproduce the existing ones. Bitmart's founder and CEO Sheldon has delivered a speech titled ""Future exploration of the Exchanges"". He has said, POC consensus has a concept of currency sharing. The acquisition of BHD does not need to be done only through the Internet. This is the basis of a great way to shape asset for the future. POC is more decentralized, efficient and cost-effective than POW. From the overall management trend, the qualitative nature of digital currency commodities is gradually clarified globally. In the future, as the regulatory trend becomes more and more fierce, the dividends of small exchanges will become smaller and smaller with the performance of the underlying protocol of the blockchain. He thinks decentralized exchanges are the future trend.”POW, POS, and POC are recognized as the three major consensuses in the industry, and the advantages and disadvantages have been widely disputed. On the panel of ""POW, POS, POC Consensus Warfare"", HPool‘s CEO and POC ecology preacher Alex, Poolin’s co-founder Zhu Xi, and Hello EOS‘s founder XinCen debated and shared their wonderful views. In the debate,  Alex mentioned the biggest and most obvious shortcomes of POW currently occur in the mining industry. It is difficult for ordinary people to participate in the construction of the underlying consensus. The biggest problem with DPOS is that it is more similar to a traditional shareholding company. In this way, issuing currency is not much different from the national issuance currency. The key is to consider whether the projects, applications, and credit ratings are applicable.Poolin‘s co-founder Zhu Fa said it is impossible to use a mining machine with 3 billion dollars to attack a trillion-dollar network. One reason is that the object of a cyberattack is a transaction, not the value of the entire network ecology, and the amount of a single transaction cannot be equal to the ecological value of Bitcoin; the second reason is that the mining machine is difficult to obtain. The founder of Hello EOS Zicen said “when DPOS was created in 2014 and 2015, the conflict between DPOS and POW was very intense. DPOS requires lowest cost,  most running applications, and more users, it can use any currency system, and support any currency, but does not need to challenge the currency system based on POW or POC.There were also many other well-known entrepreneurs in the blockchain industry delivering a speech about the POC ecosystem. Kevin Shao, general manager of CANAAN BLOCKCHAIN, Hongyang He, BD Director of CMC in China, Fei Can,  CEO of HuobiPool, Gallen He, Co-founder of 51ASIC, and many more POC ecosystem builders shared their viewpoints and plans about the POC ecosystem in the conference. More guest speeches can be seen in BHD Community’s Medium Publication.The first POC Consensus Conference came to an end with a great atmosphere from enthusiastic exchange of ideas and discussions. The event delivered participants to have a deeper  understanding of POC consensus, and also brought more attention to the potential growth of POC. Will POC bring a revolutionary disruption to the industry and redefine approaches to mining and consensus? We will have to wait to see the answer. Website: http://www.btchd.org/Email: master@btchd.orgTwitter: https://twitter.com/CommunityBhdReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/bhdcoin/Medium: https://medium.com/bhd-community"

Pay-to-Play Gaming Is Flawed, Blockchain-Based Platform Says.","Aug 2, 2019","Southern District of New York Judge Katherine Polk Failla has ruled that purchasing cryptocurrency with a Chase Bank credit card does not necessarily count as a cash advance, as per Chase’s contract.","According to an opinion and order document dated August 1, Judge Failla has denied Chase’s motion to dismiss a number of the plaintiff’s complaints, which center on the bank charging a user cash advance fees for buying cryptocurrency with a Chase credit card.The plaintiffs are Brady Tucker, Ryan Hilton and Stanton Smith, who have brought a class action suit against banking giant Chase.In the document, Failla summarized their class action suit as follows:“This claim — indeed, the entirety of Plaintiffs’ suit — is built on an argument that acquisitions of cryptocurrency could not be classified as cash advances within the meaning of the Contracts. [...] Chase disagrees, claiming that cryptocurrency acquisitions are ‘cash-like transactions’ pursuant to the Contracts, and thus cash advances. The parties’ dispute thus boils down to a difference of opinion concerning the proper interpretation of the term ‘cash-like transaction.’” The reason that a number of Chase’s dismissal motions have not gone through is because Judge Failla believes that the plaintiffs have provided a reasonable interpretation of the term “cash-like transaction” in the context of Chase’s contract. As Failla also explains in the document, the plaintiffs are interpreting the word cash as referring only to fiat money, and cash-like as referring only to legally-recognized claims on cash — such as checks, money orders, and wire transfers, and notably not cryptocurrency. The defendants, on the other hand, believe that the term cash-like transactions applies to any means of payment, cryptocurrency-based or otherwise.Notably, Judge Failla has not sided with the plaintiffs and said that their interpretation is correct. Rather, Failla has simply noted that their interpretation is plausible enough for them to proceed with their class action case. Failla wrote:“At this point in the proceedings, however, it is irrelevant whether Chase’s interpretation of ‘cashlike transactions’ is more reasonable than Plaintiffs’. [...] Because Plaintiffs have identified a reasonable interpretation of ‘cash-like transactions' that would exclude purchases of cryptocurrency, the breach of contract claim survives the motion to dismiss.”"

Seiberg comments that Facebook has global intentions which do not appear to be shared by Walmart. However, Seiberg noted that Walmart’s proposal will not likely get automatic approval from Congress. He pointed out that, for instance, Walmart’s coin could be viewed as a threat to small banks and credit unions. Ultimately, though, Seiberg believes that lawmakers would eventually approve Walmart’s proposal.Regarding the details of Walmart’s proposed currency, Seiberg wrote to clients on Monday that the currency may come in the form of a stored value card that is pegged to the U.S. dollar, somewhat like a rechargeable gift card.Bloomberg reports that Walmart is not moving to roll out its cryptocurrency in the near future. According to the report, a Walmart spokesperson said on Friday that it is not planning to immediately take advantage of its newly-filed patent.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Walmart filed for a patent for a “System and Method for Digital Currency via Blockchain” that was published on Aug. 1.

recognition and entry of digital assets by mainstream society and capital.","Aug 6, 2019","Since the founding of the Bgogo exchange a year ago, their list of institutional investors (so-called Supernodes) has been extremely illustrious. This list includes the world's largest cryptocurrency fund Pantera Capital, the influential Singaporean institution Signum, traditional VC fund SKY9 Capital, and well-known VCs such as Node Capital and Genesis Capital from China. Bgogo pioneered the decentralized governance model of a centralized exchange, inviting Supernodes to participate in the exchange's community governance.","After a long crypto winter, the recent bull market cycle triggered by the rise of mainstream cryptocurrencies, most notably Bitcoin, marks the recognition and entry of digital assets by mainstream society and capital. As a result, new exchanges have been springing up. MXC and Biki have both made the 100X legend for their platform token.With us having survived the bear market, and with the ushering in of the bull market, we are optimistic about the current state of the market, especially with the recent announcement of Facebook's new currency Libra. With such a historic opportunity, as a former Facebook veteran, our only goal is that before the end of the year we become a tier one exchange.Three of the primary reasons that we believe we can achieve this goal are as follows: Firstly, we are well funded; having raised two rounds in equity, we have accumulated strength in the winter. Secondly, we have an all-star team coming from leading Internet companies and financial institutions such as Facebook. The third reason for our confidence is the resources that Bgogo has accumulated from globally renowned investment institutions such as Pantera, Signum, Node Capital, and our users.The holding positions of our platform token’s organizational investors from the Supernode list are all transparent, and can be viewed on the Bgogo homepage. Bgogo’s user base has grown to more than 200,000 users with actual fund deposits, in part due to our active engagement with the community and continually improving user experience, resulting in a very international brand.Until this point we’ve not only been building our hard power, but we’ve also been putting a strong emphasis on developing our soft power. Bgogo has always had the best interests of the users at heart, and has focused on creating a mutually beneficially ecosystem for both Bgogo and each individual user. It is our core value that we do not encroach on the interests of users and we aim to share, co-govern and achieve win-win with the community.We at Bgogo have been working on a combination of long and short-term plans, which began their execution yesterday:First of all, we believe that future exchanges will be similar to brokers in the current stock market, and the trading assets themselves will not be much different. The mainstream currencies will be the focus of market transactions as commodities of gold and silver for a long time to come. In view of this, Bgogo recently introduced a cross-exchange hedging algorithm that thoroughly improves the orderbook depth of mainstream currencies such as BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC, and BCH. This creates an ""on par with Binance"" trading depth. In this way, Bgogo can satisfy the mainstream trading demands of our usersThis was the first plan, that we put in action today.Secondly, we invited over 500 KOL and influencers to enter our trading platform to create a brand new Bloomberg-like content push channel.This is the Buzz-Bgogo initiative.Bgogo will intelligently push the information that users care about most according to the user's holding position and transaction history, a system similar to Tiktok. For example, if a user holds or trades a lot of LTCs, it will push LTC related content to the user. Bgogo aims to create a full one-stop trading experience, where users can learn and get information in the media platform, and then go to the trading section to make trades. This is unprecedented on any other platforms.The above two functions, orderbook depth and media feed, will greatly enhance user retention. However, these alone cannot completely solve user growth problems. Our last plan, and the most important to user growth, is our “ambassador program”, the first initiative of its kind which is set to revolutionize the blockchain industry.The ambassador program works as follows. Users who purchased a value of 500 USDT of BGG platform tokens can become an ambassador, and benefit from up to 14% return per year. As long as other users participate through the ambassador's referral code, he or she can earn up to 11% of the total participation amount from primary referees and 5% of the total participation amount from secondary referees, a total of two levels. By using the mature cross-industry approach from community-based e-commerce, we bring potential and inactive users to life in the crypto world. Before our referral program was sharing only a percentage of trading fees with upper layer, however the trading fee is only 0.1% of the trading volume. Now the reward is 16% of the principle - the total amount referred users purchased of BGG. Thus, we call for ANYONE who has community influence and own his own group. We call for ANYONE who has community skills or influence to join us. We will also reward people who can make an introduction to these community leaders or influencers.The core of the “ambassador program” is to organize our community and users closely, so that all community users can become emissaries for the platform's promotion. The traditional rebate is only to return the percentage of the referees' transaction fee to the ambassador. However, this program rebates the percentage of the BGG platform token purchased from the secondary market, which is tens or even hundreds of times the traditional rebate incentives. This generous initiative is our trump card for growing our user base. Bgogo's ambassador program has a total of 50 terms, projected to complete in two years. All ambassador purchases can only be completed in the secondary market, and no extra tokens are sold separately by the platform or the team. Our goal is to develop   100,000 BGG Ambassadors within one year!The major exchanges in the crypto circle are still in the era of uncertainty, where it is difficult for first-tier exchanges to stay safe with new ones emerging.The current BGG token market value is very low, almost $9 million. Compared to other exchanges, Bibox is $29 million, Biki is $38 million, Mxc is $57 million, Bitmax is $74 million, Kucoin is $120 million, Gate is $160 million, ZB is $230 million, OKB is $550 million, HT is $1.3 billion and BNB is $1.9 billion. BGG will be 100X because there is room for growth.Let us hold our breath as we wait and see.Again, we call ANYONE who have capabilities of community and influence come and join us.Contact persons:Awan – Lyon@bgogo.com Anita – Anita@bgogo.com Official social media (feel free to check, like and subscribe us):FacebookTelegramTwitterMediumReddit"

Professor Zhu Jiaming, President of China Institute of Digital Assets and a renowned economist, delivered a keynote speech entitled ""Spring of Distributed Commerce and the Comprehensive Approach of Digital Economy"". He said that the significance of encrypting digital currency was to break the absolute monopoly of modern countries and realize the return of monetary sovereignty. Return, Decentralization and Creating New Wealth Patterns. With the rise of block chain technology and the birth of distributed commerce in recent years, traditional industries have gained a new growth point. The digital economy marked by block chain and distributed commerce has entered an advanced stage of development, which will promote the digital economy to come in an all-round way.Based on the concept of distributed business ecology, Paul, Bit Cherry CEO; Sliver Xie , IPSE Star Search Engine founder; Edwin Zhang, Engine Miner CEO; Killian Hussmann, EGQ CEO; Zhou Huan ,IPFS. Fund founder and IPFS Founder community founder; Chen Caigen, Tiantianjie Founder and CEO jointly participated in the panel discussion to talk about distributed commerce.

Cherry Wallet, as a block chain security storage scheme for digital assets, realizes cold and hot end interaction through the first encrypted two-dimensional code + near-field communication transmission (NFC). It originates semi-password technology, synthesizes the private key by seed password + payment password, and uses two-dimensional code and NFC communication mode to keep the private key from touching the network, fundamentally. The risk of private key being stolen by hackers is eliminated. It also pioneered the situation-generation technology, which will generate random passwords in real time according to the different application scenarios of users and improve the security of passwords. Cherry Wallet Pro cold wallet currently supports mainstream digital assets such as BTC, ETH, BCHC, USDT, EOS. With the continuous iteration and upgrading of wallet functions, Cherry Wallet will provide more public-chain digital asset types support for exchanges, block chain enterprises and trading users in the future.In the keynote speech of ""Mining Logic of Distributed Commerce"", Kilian Hussmann, EGQ CEO, proposed that distributed commerce not only achieves the decentralization of the form of e-commerce organization, but also reconstructs the interest relationship, improves the production relationship of traditional industries, and realizes wealth among different owners on the basis of transparent information and unalterable. Fair distribution among entities enables value to return to the creator and realizes the mining logic of ""behavior is value.""Since 2018, stable currency has become the absolute hotspot for cryptocurrencies worldwide.

Kik further wrote that the SEC resorted to misrepresenting the facts because they have no strong evidence to support their claims:“If the Commission had strong evidence that Kik offered or promised TDE purchasers an opportunity to profit from Kik’s efforts, as part of a common enterprise, the Commission would have simply outlined all the relevant facts and let those facts speak for themselves. Instead, the Commission’s Complaint reflects a consistent effort to twist the facts by removing quotes from their context and misrepresenting the documents and testimony that the Commission gathered in its investigation.”Moreover, Kik wrote that these purported smoke and mirrors tactics will ultimately fail the SEC if the case goes to trial:“The result is a Complaint that badly mischaracterizes the totality of the facts and circumstances leading up to Kik’s sale of Kin in 2017. These tactics may have gotten the Commission a decent news cycle, but they will not withstand meaningful scrutiny at summary judgment or trial.”Kik even goes so far as to claim that the SEC is failing to uphold its governmental obligation to pursue justice by resorting to what Kik alleges to be calculated misrepresentations:“Indeed, apparently recognizing the weakness of its claim, the Commission has rejected its higher governmental duty to first and foremost seek justice, and has instead employed a strategy to twist the facts, creating a highly selective and misleading depiction of the record as set forth below.”As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Kik initially warned the SEC in January that they would fight back against enforcement if the Commission pursued action against them for alleged securities law violations in a nearly $100 million initial token offering. In May, Kik made good on their promise and launched a $5 million funding campaign to back a lawsuit with the Commission."

S-coin is set to be programmed by the government, enabling authorities to decide in exact detail when it can and can not be spent, as well as in what quantities and frequencies.One of the S-coin use cases enables parents to give it to their children as rewards, while programming the coin to be redeemable for specific treats at certain stores and to be spent exclusively by children.

By issuing a local digital currency, the city expects to revive the local economy, as well as to secure a leading position in blockchain development.In late July, South Korea’s President Moon Jae-In stated that regulatory innovation regarding blockchain technology is now a question of survival. Moon said:""While regulatory innovation in the era of industrialization was a matter of choice, it is now a question of survival as we are experiencing the fourth industrial revolution, characterized by fusions across industries and fields.”Moon added that creating real use cases for blockchain to protect personal data contributes to a greater international presence for South Korea, while blockchain applications in finance will greatly contribute to the revitalization of the country’s economy."

Despite all of this, the crypto derivatives market is booming — with billions of dollars of trading volume registered every single day.BitOrb plans to focus on futures contracts and says its platform will be integrated with a range of tools and mechanisms designed to clamp down on unscrupulous practices and to protect funds. To begin with, deposits, withdrawals and trades will be executed using Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). Over time, the startup says its priority will be to seek exchange licenses to ensure that deposits can be made in a customer’s local fiat currencies.Leveraged trading is a common occurrence in the futures markets — and BitOrb says its users will be able to use up to 100 times their capital in order to embark on larger positions.BitOrb notes that its platform has been “built from the ground up” to deliver “one of the fastest throughputs in the crypto exchange market” (more than 10,000 transactions per second), matching speeds commonly known in the traditional forex market, as well as being fully scalable for future market requirements. This ensures BitOrb can handle the constant demand and frenetic pace that’s all too often seen in an online derivatives exchange. According to its white paper, this will be achieved through a “high-performance, low latency technology stack.”BitOrb says that many exchanges fail to tailor their services around the requirements of their customers — and acknowledge that no two users have the same level of trading experiences. While beginners find complexity in trading in the current market, experts are often left frustrated due to the lack of advanced tools.To this end, BitOrb emphasizes its plans to offer three modes on its crypto derivatives exchange — novice, casual and professional — to break down barriers and give users exactly what they want. While novice mode offers a single product and a simple interface, casual mode delivers an expanded offering and the ability to use automated trading tools. Last but not least, professional mode boasts a fully customizable interface and the full suite of BitOrb products.BitOrb’s automated trading tool is known as the Orchestrator — technology that assists users to build automated trading strategies by setting rules based on a wide variety of trading indicators and trigger points. The team sets its goal to eliminate the difficulties that crypto enthusiasts currently have in automating trades — with conflicting time zones and the cost of developing algorithms resulting in substantial barriers to entry. The company’s offering is also complemented by the Orbyt token, which is native to the BitOrb exchange.Between now and September, BitOrb says that its focus is on marketing, events, acquiring new talents and the on-going Orbyt security token offering. It’s hoped that the construction of the exchange will be completed between October and November. This would be followed by the deployment of the exchange in December and further expansion into 2020 and beyond.Disclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

Failure to make a payment immediately, they go on to falsely claim, could result in an arrest or other criminal action. Other bogus letters make use of bona fide information relating to recipients’ actual tax debts — such as liens filed against them — further bolstering their false sheen of authenticity.Yet as Forbes notes, tax-related data such as liens are made publicly available — meaning there is no reason to trust these letters any more than others. One scam reportedly warns the recipient of taxes owed to the so-called “Bureau of Tax Enforcement” — an agency that is itself a fake, as the IRS itself has cautioned.Aside from letters, thieves are also demanding bogus payments on the phone — another practice that, as Forbes notes, is never used by the legitimate IRS. Neither will the agency threaten — in writing or by phone — to arrest or deport taxpayers.To help taxpayers navigate these risks, Forbes provides a list of characteristics that can help distinguish a bonafide IRS letter from a fake. These include the inclusion of a notice or letter number, use of a government envelope and IRS seal, a 1-800 contact number for the agency and a note of the recipient’s truncated tax ID number and tax years in question. As recently reported, the prevalence of such scams comes at a time when the — real — IRS is sending letters to crypto investors to clarify their crypto tax filing requirements and, in certain cases, compel them to pay back taxes. Some tax attorneys have however argued that this recent wave of letters is likely to be a blanket campaign by the agency and is unlikely to be tied to any evidence that recipients have under-reported."

She said: “We need to educate institutions more about how digital currencies can be accepted, and how the transparency from using cryptocurrency would benefit the wider society. Perhaps, this mindset will change over time.”In early 2019, Cointelegraph reported that the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia partnered to collaborate on the creation of a cryptocurrency.In 2018, The ADAB Solutions project, based in the United Arab Emirates, announced that it plans to launch the First Islamic Crypto Exchange, which it claims will be operating “according to the principles of Shariah law.”"

This is where the acquisition of Quidd comes in, which claims to have over 200,000 users.In order to achieve this, the companies will be relying on the capabilities of Harmony’s blockchain, which can reportedly support 10,000 TPS. This capacity is capable of supporting Quidd’s current user base and can even scale up as necessary to accommodate a growing number of users via sharding. Based in New York, Quidd raised $13 million in a funding round led by major venture capital firm Sequoia Capital in 2017. According to the press release, Quidd has issued and sold more than 2.1 billion individually-serialized digital collectibles and has 325 brand licenses to date, including popular names in entertainment such as Marvel, Game of Thrones and Rick and Morty, among others. The total amount of generated gross revenues from Quidd’s digital collectors is estimated to be over $10 million, the press release notes.As noted in the press release, Animoca auctioned off a crypto collectibles car, the “1-1-1,” for $106,428.

It advises that the ECB should, therefore, prolong and refine its qualitative and quantitative analysis of the new asset class. Yet while the public nature of distributed ledger technology-based crypto asset networks broadly provides transparency, the report notes, the decentralized and patchily-regulated nature of crypto asset-related activities complicate efforts to organize systematic data collection efforts. This is in part due to the absence of hard transaction data covering both on- and off-chain activity, resulting in only a partial view of the crypto asset market. On-chain transactions for selected crypto assets as of April 2019. Sources: Bitinfocharts, Cryptocompare and ECB calculations, via the ECBAs the report outlines, initiatives to refine crypto asset data collection and analysis have been undertaken by entities such as the Irving Fisher Committee on Central Banking Statistics and expert groups investigating the statistical classification of crypto assets in the System of National Accounts.While this latter initiative may have significant implications for measuring nations’ GDP and other indicators, the ECB notes, statistical classification for crypto assets remains a complex task, given that their very characteristic is not to represent a financial claim on, or a liability of, any identifiable entity.The ECB states that those seeking reliable on- and off-chain data must further overcome the difficulty of retrieving public data on market segments that remain off-radar for public authorities. They must also contend with “relatively illiquid crypto trading platforms that may be affected by wash trading” and take into account the “lack of consistency in the methodology and conventions used by institutionalised exchanges and commercial data providers.”In its conclusion, the ECB pledges to continue to analyze both on-chain and layered protocol transactions and to focus on harmonizing and enriching metadata for off-chain transactions, as well as developing best practices for crypto asset indicators.This May, an ECB report had conversely argued that cryptocurrencies do not have implications for monetary policy nor factor into the real economy."

The Arizona-based financial services startup intends to offer a stablecoin that is pegged 1:1 with the United States dollar. During its sandbox testing phase, Alta will trial its member onboarding and remittances platform. The end goal of the platform is to let users pay for goods and services using the stablecoin instead of fiat money.Cannabis, while legal in some states in the U.S., is still considered a controlled and illegal substance by the federal government. As such, banks are hesitant to deal with cannabis-related business as it would be grounds for the government to revoke their federal deposit insurance, which is a crucial financial safety net for banks.Sarah Wessel, the co-founder and COO of Alta, said that this blockchain-based service can provide a crucial financial service and make local communities more safe:“The cash economy for legal cannabis in Arizona exceeds $350 million annually [...] These are legitimate companies, innovators and entrepreneurs that are forced to operate in cash. We offer them peace of mind. Our digital payment technology lifts the burdens of having to operate solely through cash and makes our communities safer.” Other crypto business and state governments have tried to bridge the gap between the cannabis and financial services industries. In 2017, the Dash network began paying the firm Alt Thirty Six to integrate Dash as a payment option in the cannabis industry’s point-of-sale systems.From the legislative side, lawmakers in the state of California proposed a bill in February that would accept crypto for tax payments from cannabis-related businesses. The bill, which has not moved out of committee since March, aimed to relieve tax offices from the large piles of money brought in by cash-heavy cannabis businesses.Arizona became the first state to introduce a regulatory sandbox in March 2018. Republican Congressman Jeff Weninger reportedly sponsored the legislation behind the sandbox. Weninger commented on the potential broader use cases in today’s press release, saying:""It's exciting to have Alta as the newest participant in Arizona's FinTech Sandbox. There's huge potential for stablecoin technology in cash-intensive businesses around the world, and Arizona is fortunate to play a critical role in the development and growth of this emerging industry."""

And in their ongoing legal battle with the New York State Office of the Attorney General (OAG), they continue to fight against the attempt to sue them and their parent company, iFinex. Against all the odds, they're doing a good job of holding their ground.","This was underlined most clearly at the end of July, when Justice Joel M. Cohen of the New York Supreme Court (NYSC) ruled to extend the attorney general's preliminary injunction against iFinex and its subsidiaries. This was to provide the OAG with more time to investigate its case but also to provide the judge himself with more time to decide whether to accept or reject iFinex's appeal to have the case dismissed, based on the alleged grounds that it doesn't operate in the state of New York.But even if the same Justice Cohen has previously criticized the attorney general's injunction for being ""vague, open-ended and not sufficiently tailored"" to prove what has caused or will cause harm against New York residents, this latest delay doesn't necessarily mean that iFinex will have its appeal accepted. In fact, as certain legal experts suggest, the attempts to have the case dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, as well as its receipt of a stay of document demands, might indicate that it's trying to divert scrutiny away from the fundamental issue of whether it defrauded its customers.On April 25, New York Attorney General Letitia James published legal filings against Bitfinex, alleging that the crypto exchange had defrauded its customers, chiefly by losing $850 million and secretly taking funds from the affiliated Tether in order to cover up this loss. A month later, on May 21, Bitfinex and Tether filed to have the case dismissed, arguing that the attorney general doesn't have jurisdiction over them since they ""do not allow New Yorkers on their platforms.""Related: Tether’s Trouble With New York Attorney General — Will Crypto Cope?Unsurprisingly, the OAG has contested these counterclaims, providing documents that purport to show that Bitfinex opened a trading account with a New York-based cryptocurrency trading firm in January 2019. However, this filing alone doesn't seem to have convinced Justice Cohen, because on July 29, he extended the injunction — largely because he required more time to decide whether to reject Bitfinex's motion or accept it. ""The idea is to keep things where they are until the decision of this motion, so the decision is to extend the stay and [...] extend the injunction,"" he said.At this stage, it's hard to really know whether this extension is good or bad news for Bitfinex and crypto. On one hand, it is encouraging news, since it indicates that Justice Cohen isn't entirely convinced by the attorney general's case. Otherwise, he would have just rejected Bitfinex's appeal, but in line with his previous statements regarding the ""amorphous and endless"" character of the OAG's claims against the crypto-exchange, it suggests that he hasn't seen anything strong or clear enough to decide on behalf of New York.But by the same token, it's still not wholly positive news for Bitfinex and Tether because, if the case against them were entirely meritless or unjustifiable in Cohen's view, he would have no doubt accepted iFinex's request to dismiss. He hasn't, and as Richard Howlett of the London-based crypto lawfirm Selachii Legal explained to Cointelegraph, this is because Cohen is sensitive to the possibility that new key evidence may come to light. Howlet explained further:""Judges quite often take a view that is less risk-averse to grant an extension than to make a final decision. The worry is always that evidence will come to light at a later stage which makes the original decision wrong and an appeal will be filed. No Judge likes an appeal against a decision they have made so they err on the side of caution.""While Howlett himself doesn't say which side is likely to produce new evidence, the fact that the onus is on the attorney general to prove its case would indicate that Justice Cohen has granted an extension in the event that the OAG dredges up new, material evidence. Indeed, when asked whether the extension is good or bad news for Bitfinex, Howlett suggested that the likelier possibility is that it's good news, at least insofar as it indicates that the attorney general doesn't have especially decisive evidence right now. According to Howlett:""Such situations are very hard to read. On the one hand, it could be argued that an extension is required as new evidence has come to light that is being investigated. Another school of thought is that the AG is desperately trying to find something to stick and need more time because they have nothing at present. If I were to gamble on this, I would say the latter, the AG has nothing and is delaying the inevitable.""Chetan Phull also provided his thoughts. He is the principal lawyer at Toronto-based Smartblock Law P.C., and is licensed in Ontario, New York State, and Massachusetts with his law practice focused in Canada. Like Howlett, he agrees that the extension will give the OAG more time to investigate its case. Phull said:""An extension will permit further investigation of fact-based jurisdictional issues. More evidence on these factual issues could potentially enable the court to render a decision, without having to deal with certain legal questions that are better left in the hands of federal legislators currently working in this area."" Overall, there is generally a consensus that the extension has been granted in order to provide the attorney general with more time to uncover evidence. Aaron Kaplan, a former attorney who is now the CEO of New York-based trading platform Prometheum, told Cointelegraph:""An AG should have solid proof when seeking a preliminary injunction. Seeking the investigatory extension indicates a weakness in the AG’s position. One would expect that when the AG seeks a preliminary injunction that he or she already has solid proof.""But even if an extension is arguably more indicative of a lack of significant evidence than anything else, this still doesn't necessarily mean that iFinex is on the cusp of having its appeal to dismiss granted by Justice Cohen. Kaplan went on to add:""Don't forget, the judge and the AG essentially have the same client, they are both elected officials and are both responsible to the public interest and subject to ongoing public approval. Therefore, a judge will be hesitant to dismiss the AG’s case when the general public is allegedly being defrauded out of their hard-earned capital.""Even though the indecision of Justice Cohen might imply that Bitfinex could eventually escape litigation, a long, protracted injunction could already be damaging enough as it is because the more Bitfinex and Tether have their names dragged through the mud, the more traders and customers will potentially be scared away from them.Well, maybe not exactly. While few companies benefit from associations with legal disputes, it doesn't appear that Bitfinex's business has been impaired too much by its confrontation with the New York attorney general. In terms of its adjusted trading volumes (as reported by CoinMarketCap), things have remained comparatively stable over the period between April 25 and today, even if there have been a number of dips.Related: Tether Stablecoin: Can the Crypto Market Live Without It?On April 25, for instance, Bitfinex's adjusted 24-hour volume was $210,787,032. This dipped after the attorney general announced that it was suing the exchange, with the volume coming in at $107,934,242 on May 1. However, a month later (June 4), its 24-hour adjusted volume was $510,369,772, while it was $494,845,894 on July 2.Of course, as a vivid indication of just how confused and unclear this whole episode is, it's worth noting that Tether also issued a large amount of its stablecoin, USDT, over the period in question. On April 25 — the very day the attorney general announced its proceedings – Tether issued 300 million USDT. On June 11 and June 17, it printed a further 150 million and then 100 million USDT, while it has printed at least 450 million USDT since July 1. No doubt Bitfinex and Tether will claim that this busy period of issuance was part of an attempt to meet increased demand for liquidity in cryptocurrency markets. Nonetheless, given reports and allegations that Tether has been used to manipulate the Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto markets, it's not entirely out of the realm of possibility that newly minted USDT could have potentially been used to inflate Bitfinex's volume.The case against the attorney general may have been negatively affecting Bitfinex's business, but given the lack of transparency around Tether, it is hard to say for sure. Assuming Bitfinex is being hit hard by this case, there's little doubt it would have a ruinous effect if it were ultimately settled against the exchange and Tether. But this is a big assumption, and there isn't any hard evidence so far that it will be validated.That said, a couple points can be made about the case with a little more confidence, even at this stage. First of all, it's likely that the New York attorney general is struggling to obtain concrete, damning evidence against Bitfinex. Not only is this indicated by the extension itself, but it's also indicated by the letter the OAG submitted on Aug. 1, in which it argued against the stay of demands Justice Cohen granted Bitfinex in May. This stay means that Bitfinex has to produce and release documents relevant only to whether it operated in New York. As such, the OAG is probably being deprived of documents related to the more important issue of alleged fraud, potentially hampering the case against iFinex.Secondly, even though the OAG has yet to convince Justice Cohen that New York has jurisdiction over Bitfinex, there still seems reason to believe that the exchange has been serving customers based in the state. In addition to the evidence the OAG has already amassed related to Bitfinex opening accounts with New York-based platforms, reports emerged at the end of July that traders residing in the state have been able to register with Bitfinex simply by clicking a box that declared they aren't U.S. residents.There's also the fact that, rather than focusing on disproving the OAG's claims that it didn't defraud its customers regarding an $850 million loss, iFinex has instead concentrated on what one could describe as technicalities. It has claimed that the New York attorney general has no jurisdiction over it, while in May, it successfully appealed for a stay of document demands, meaning that it doesn't have to turn over evidence related to whether it did cover up the aforementioned loss. Kaplan explained:""If their position is legitimate, Bitfinex/Tether’s attorneys will provide as much information as possible to the AG, as it will continue to prove the absence of violations of law. Alternatively, if they are not confident in their position, the Bitfinex/Tether attorneys will attempt to obfuscate, confuse and dance around the issues in order to address technical defects in the AG’s case, rather than provide substantive facts.”These facts lead us to believe that the attorney general isn't holding smoking gun evidence against Bitfinex, yet there remain legitimate suspicions that there's still a case against the exchange and its sister company Tether. This is likely why Justice Cohen has granted the extension, but if the attorney general doesn't provide hard evidence in this case soon, it's possible that Bitfinex and Tether will slip through its net."

Per the announcement, the firm received a vulnerability report through the program on May 1, which described what the researchers believed to be a hardware vulnerability.The purported vulnerability would allow an attacker to read what was on the wallet’s screen by monitoring power fluctuations to the display in what is known as a side-channel attack. If attackers were monitoring the power levels while sensitive information was displayed on-screen, this would ostensibly give them the opportunity to steal funds from the device.ShapeShift notes that, to obtain access to sensitive information displayed on-screen, an attacker would need to have physical access to the device and accurately monitor the KeepKey’s energy consumption with an oscillometer (or a similar instrument) as the information is displayed.ShapeShift explains that, since this alleged vulnerability would require physical access, there would be a simpler way to acquire the information:“By comparison, it would be far easier to steal someone’s Recovery Phrase by simply looking over their shoulder while they set up their KeepKey or installing a hidden camera in the room in which it was being initialized.”ShapeShift states that a side-channel attack would require physical access, specialized equipment, hardware skills and statistical analysis of the data to derive the contents displayed based from only the display’s energy consumption. Furthermore, it claims that, even if all of those requirements were met, it would still be highly difficult to interpret the data:“Due to the larger display in KeepKey, multiple Recovery Phrase words are displayed at once. This makes it much more difficult to identify individual words (and the order of words) based off the power used by the screen.”As Cointelegraph reported in March, major hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger has unveiled vulnerabilities in its direct competitor Trezor’s devices.

Cohen, arguing that cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex and affiliated Stablecoin firm Tether should not be granted a continuing stay of demands.","The NYAG submitted its letter on Aug. 1 — the latest chapter in the New York Attorney General’s ongoing case against Bitfinex, parent company iFinex and Tether, in which the state alleges a multimillion loss coverup took place.The court initially issued a stay of document demands in May at the defendants’ request. This means that the court currently only requires the defendants to produce documents and information pertinent to the issue of whether or not New York is the appropriate jurisdiction for the NYAG’s complaint, as opposed to a wholesale disclosure of complaint-pertinent documentation.Bitfinex’s lawyers recently wrote that it had spent over $500,000 responding to NYAG’s document requests, adding that they would appeal for a continued stay of demands even if a dismissal motion does not go through.The defendants’ lawyers asserted that producing full documentation would be particularly difficult, costly and unfair given the resources they have already spent on the investigation. They wrote:“Finally, a stay will serve the public interest, including by conserving judicial resources. And it will serve the interests of justice, as basic fairness dictates that the Respondents, who have been hauled into this forum against their will and have already incurred extraordinary expense to comply with portions of this § 354 Order to date, should not be made to suffer irreparable harm from being required to comply with that Order while seeking relief therefrom.”Today, the NYAG said that the defendants have not sufficiently demonstrated irreparable harm absent an injunction, that the factual issues pertaining to jurisdiction are not new and that it should be neither costly nor difficult to produce information previously subpoenaed by the NYAG. The office also argued against the defendants’ claims on why it is unfair for the court to not grant a continuing stay. The current legal battle began when Attorney General Letitia James alleged that iFinex, Tether Limited, and their associated entities violated New York law in connection with activities that may have defrauded New York-based crypto investors. The NYAG said that Bitfinex borrowed $850 million from Tether to cover a loss that it never disclosed to investors."

The bottles from this case are reportedly available at the Waigaoqiao International Alcohol Exhibition & Trading Center, D.I.G.’s  Flagship Store and the Sen Lan Shang Du in Pudong New District.As per the press release, each bottle inside Bin 407 comes attached with an encrypted NFC chip. This chip reportedly contains the bottle’s product information on a blockchain, which can be accessed with a chip reader. These details reportedly include the bottle’s provenance information, which is verified by third-party auditors.A number of companies are beginning to issue blockchain verification systems for wine. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the big four audit firm Ernst & Young announced that it’s Ethereum-based blockchain solution will be used to verify the authenticity of imported European wines in Asia. This solution would reportedly be implemented on the e-commerce platform Tattoo, for use by Blockchain Wine Pte. Ltd.Near the end of July, the Chinese alcohol wholesaler and marketer also announced that it would be using a blockchain solution to verify its products. This solution purportedly makes use of proprietary anti-counterfeiting laser recognition for certification and blockchain technology for tracking. On a slightly different note, retail giant Overstock announced its move into blockchain-based wine futures back in Oct. 2018. Overstock reportedly also intended to fight wine fraud, but in this case by means of developing a digital trading platform for wine futures. This would reportedly result in a secure supply chain that verifies wine industry products, they said. Overstock founder and CEO Patrick M. Byrne commented on the company’s idea, saying:“Like any economy, the wine industry has difficulty scaling its middlemen-heavy systems in parallel with the growing demands of an increasing global market. VinX’s steps in tokenizing wine futures while allowing wine enthusiasts to know without a doubt that the bottles they purchase are filled with authentic wines will position the entire industry as a model of a new global economy that replaces old boys’ networks with frictionless trust through technology.”"

It is reportedly expected to exceed tens of millions of dollars in claims.Orbs has forcefully countered Arad’s claims, arguing they “are fundamentally unfounded […] The plaintiff has become unjustly enriched at the expense of others. This attempt will not succeed.”Beyond the ironies of such local intra-enterprise discord, cryptocurrencies have been discussed by the region’s political class in connection with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Last month, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh reiterated that his government is considering using cryptocurrency as an alternative to Israel’s shekel fiat currency.Meanwhile, the militant arm of Hamas — the de facto ruling authority of the Gaza Strip in Palestine — called upon its supporters this January to make donations to the organization in Bitcoin (BTC) as a strategy to combat financial isolation. The group has since then reportedly been using increasingly complex measures to frustrate authorities’ attempts to track the flow of its cryptocurrency financing."

Singapore Airlines CEO Goh Choon Phong was quoted in the Press Release regarding the unveiling of the program, saying: “This groundbreaking development in which we will be using blockchain technology to ‘digitalise’ KrisFlyer miles is a demonstration of the investment we are making to significantly enhance the digital side of our business for the benefit of our customers.”Singapore Airlines, with a revenue of over $12 billion, has a large share in the global aviation market and is one of the oldest airlines — dating back to 1947 — and is now pushing for digital innovation. Goh went on to explain, “It is in line with our recently unveiled Digital Innovation Blueprint, under which we aim to be the world’s leading digital airline.”Aviation IT provider Sita’s senior manager, Sherry Stein, who has worked with many organizations to realize the potential blockchain has on its specific business application, explained:“If you want to cash in your miles on car rental, for example, blockchain allows transactions to happen seamlessly and instantly, updating all the stakeholders without dependency on offline review and reconciliation processes. The key rationale for loyalty programmes is to help airlines provide differentiated value or experience that improves customer retention. When we look at technologies that can help, blockchain is a perfect fit and the reason why we’re looking closely at how to leverage its many benefits.”Cathay Pacific has also jumped on the bandwagon with a new campaign called “Unlock More Miles” with a blockchain foundation powering it, as its general manager of IT solutions, Lawrence Fong, said: “We are pleased to partner with Accenture and we will continue to leverage its technology to develop more applications that our customers value. As a start, we are very excited by the first offering resulting from our co-operation — the marketing campaign launched by Asia Miles which we expect to be well received.”Another direct impact that has already seen large improvements from blockchain application revolves around the complicated booking process created by many third-party websites connecting to multiple websites for airlines, hotels and cruises. In February 2018, Webjet announced its release for blockchain platform Rezchain to handle booking disputes and reconciliations. An estimated 3% to 5% of bookings are disputed in some form. Webjet’s managing director, John Guscic, explained the fundamental thinking behind Rezchain:“In a low margin, high transaction volume business, it is essential to find ways to be more efficient and eliminate administrative burdens that add no value. It was this fundamental principal has led to the development of Rezchain.”Webjet says for one in 25 bookings, travel service providers do not get paid for their services. Its blockchain solution has already seen adoption from travel companies in Europe and Southeast Asia.Winding Tree, a Swiss blockchain startup focusing on the travel industry, provides a solution, benefiting both customers and suppliers. Air New Zealand, a partner of Winding Tree, has reduced transactional costs for customers with its blockchain application. Air New Zealand’s chief digital officer, Avi Golan, said:""While we are still exploring its benefits, blockchain may offer a streamlined way to retail airfares and ancillary products alongside our current channels. In removing complexity from the sales chain, customers benefit from reduced transactional costs, and airlines benefit from swift and secure sharing of information.""LockTrip states that its solution provides bookings cheaper than Booking.com and Airbnb by up to 20%. Earlier this year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued its first “No-Action” letter clearing TurnKey Ket Inc. to sell tokens in the U.S. As explained in its letter to the SEC, the company aims to issue tokens that “are redeemable for air charter services, similar to the business jet card programs that are common in the aviation industry.” According to independent research by Aelf blockchain, in the first quarter of 2019, almost 900 companies from 29 different industries were found to have made some announcement relating to their interest or adoption of blockchain technology. Of these companies, the largest industry, ahead of the finance industry, was supply chain and logistics, with approximately 300 companies including Forward Air and RTWAir.One key outcome from the research identified that the transport and logistics industry is very intertwined with blockchain through strong connections between air, road and sea travel, which accounts for 31.5% of use cases of the technology.With the introduction of blockchain solutions, quality in manufacturing and distribution of aircraft components and materials can be managed in a smoother and more effective manner. This concept has also been taken and introduced into other aspects of logistics, including aircraft maintenance, air accident reduction and luggage tracking. Air France KLM has been researching blockchain to track its maintenance and repair systems while a Cyprus-based startup, Aeron, manages a mobile app that records and verifies a pilot’s qualifications, replacing a traditional pilot logbook. Through this approach, the team hopes to reduce the number of air accidents that result from poor record keeping.Air New Zealand has also announced its research in cargo and baggage tracking. Rega, a blockchain insurance platform, has taken a different approach to blockchain utilization in regard to lost baggage. It uses blockchain to create a “crowsurance” platform in which the risk of lost baggage is shared across the community. By using this approach, it has been able to reduce costs to only approximately $12 annually for insurance coverage of up to $5,000.The aviation industry supports $2.7 Trillion (3.6%) of the world’s gross domestic product and carries over 4 billion passengers and 60 million tonnes of freight annually, according to International Air Transport Association.The giants in this industry have embraced blockchain technology with open arms and have quietly applied it to multiple aspects of their networks faster than some industries that have simply accepted the technology is here to stay. Not only does this improve the experiences and reduce costs for customers around the world, but it brings validity and a reputable image of the technology to other industries and organizations.In such a cutthroat industry, many companies are not waiting for their competitors to prove the benefits of the technology, but are striving to gain a first-mover advantage. According to the current rate of adoption, in a few years, this technology will no longer be a first-mover advantage but a fundamental base for all aspects of this industry."
