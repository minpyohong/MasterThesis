BTC could close well above ...","Aug 6, 2019 at 08:40 UTC","Bitcoin (BTC) is trading above $12,000 for the first time in four weeks and is reporting gains for the eighth consecutive day.","The top cryptocurrency by market value rose above $12,000 at 06:45 UTC and soon hit a high of $12,298, the highest level since July 10, according to Bitstamp data.As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $12,185 on Bitstamp, representing 3.26 percent gains on the daily opening price of $11,800. The cryptocurrency has scored 2–7 percent gains in each of the preceding seven days.If BTC prints a UTC close above $11,800 today, then the resulting eight-day winning streak would be the longest since June. Back then, prices had rallied for eight straight days, starting from June 19 to June 26. Prior to that, BTC eked out gains for eight consecutive days in December 2017.The latest winning run looks sustainable as it is accompanied by a rise in bitcoin’s dominance rate – the cryptocurrency’s share of the total cryptocurrency market. The gauge, as calculated by data source CoinMarketCap, currently stands at 68.5 percent, the highest level since April 2017.Further, the cryptocurrency seems to have found acceptance above key resistance at $12,000, as seen in technical charts.So, with the path of least resistance to the higher side, BTC could extend the ongoing rise toward the next major hurdle at $13,200 in the short-term.BTC is currently trading above the upper edge of the falling channel, currently at $12,000. A UTC close above that level would confirm the breakout and signal a revival of the rally from lows near $4,000 seen on April 1.The breakout looks likely as the 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are rising, indicating a bullish setup. The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is also reporting bullish conditions with an above-50 print.Further, the moving average convergence divergence histogram continues to produce higher highs above the zero line, a sign of strengthening bullish momentum.And, last but not least, buying volumes (green bar) ticked higher yesterday, violating the downtrend line and validating the bullish move in prices.So, the July 10 high of $13,200 could come into play over the next few days.The RSI on the 4-hour chart is reporting overbought conditions with an above-70 print, while the MACD has produced lower highs as opposed to higher highs on price (bearish divergence).So, a brief pullback may precede a rally to $13,200. That said, the bullish case would weaken only if the cryptocurrency finds acceptance below the ascending 10-day MA, currently located at $10,545.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

bitcoin's ...","Aug 5, 2019 at 11:05 UTC",View,"Bitcoin (BTC) is eyeing a move to key resistance above $12,000, having broken out of a bearish pattern in the Asian trading hours today.The leading cryptocurrency jumped above $11,120 at 00:45 UTC, violating the bearish lower-highs pattern created on July 20 and extended gains to $11,868 at 07:30 UTC. That’s BTC’s highest level since July 12, according to Bitstamp data.With the price rise, BTC’s dominance rate – the cryptocurrency’s share of the total crypto market – has jumped to 67.9 percent, the highest level since April 12, 2017, according to CoinMarketCap.Many observers consider price gains sustainable if they are backed by an uptick in the dominance rate.For instance, Vinny Lingham, co-founder & CEO of identity protection and management startup Civic, put out a series of tweets on April 10, explaining how alternative cryptocurrencies decoupling from the BTC rally would be a sign of substance in the bull run.With the dominance rate validating BTC’s 9.5 percent price rise in the last 24 hours, further gains toward resistance at $12,030 look likely. Technical indicators are also signaling a continuation of the price rise.As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $11,710 on Bitstamp.BTC’s move above the bearish lower-high of $11,120 (above left) is backed by a bullish above-50 reading on the relative strength index (RSI). Further, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram continues to gain altitude, another sign of strengthening bullish momentum.What’s more, BTC has found acceptance above the 50-day moving average (MA). Also, the 5- and 10-day MAs are trending north, indicating a bullish setup.As a result, a rise to the upper edge of the 1.5-month-long falling channel, currently at $12,030 looks likely. Supporting the bullish case is a pickup in the buying volumes (green bars), as seen on the hourly chart (above right).A high-volume UTC close above $12,030 would confirm the channel breakout and open the doors to a retest of $13,880 (June 26 high).The bullish case would weaken if BTC prints a UTC close below $11,120 today, leaving a daily candle with a long upper wick in its wake – a sign of buyer exhaustion.That, however, looks unlikely, unless China’s yuan recovers lost ground.It is worth noting that China’s offshore Yuan exchange rate (CNH) fell from 6.97 yuan per U.S. dollar to a multi-year low of 7.1085 per USD in the 60 minutes to 02:00 UTC today.Meanwhile, BTC picked up a bid around $10,980 at 00:00 UTC – an hour before CNH began falling against the dollar, as seen in the chart below.The price action seems to have convinced the crypto market community that yuan’s drop below the major psychological level of 7 per USD fueled a rally in BTC’s price – that is, wealthy Chinese investors rotated money into BTC amid the yuan’s depreciation.Some observers, including prominent analyst Alex Kruger, wondered earlier today whether BTC had front-run the People’s Bank of China’s (central bank) decision to allow the yuan to slide beyond 7 per USD.If that narrative continues to strengthen, then BTC may become vulnerable to a bounce, in yuan, if any. However, as of now, the yuan is showing little sign of life, currently trading at 7.08 per USD.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

Another strong sign of bearish exhaustion emerged in the form of a long-legged doji candle on July 28, as discussed earlier this week.Hence, BTC’s $1,000 rise seen in the last 48 hours is hardly surprising. The bullish move could be extended further as short duration technical studies are beginning to align in favor of the bulls.The 14-day relative strength index seems to have found acceptance above 50.00, a sign of bull market conditions.The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram, an indicator used to identify trend change and trend strength, has crossed above zero, confirming bullish reversal. The MACD is indicating that the pullback from June’s high of $13,880 has ended and the path of least resistance is now to the higher side.So, BTC could test the bearish lower high of $11,120 (July 20 high) over the weekend. A high-volume UTC close above that level would further confirm bullish revival and open the doors to $13,000.The widely followed 50-day moving average (MA) is currently located at $10,570 may cap upside for the next few hours, though, as BTC is looking heavy on the intraday charts.Both the RSI and the MACD have produced lower highs, contradicting the higher highs on price.The bearish divergence of key indicators suggests scope for minor pullback to support lines located at $10,318 and $10,172.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

The cryptocurrency jumped to a high of $13,880 on June 26 only to fall back below $12,000 on the following day. Similar price action was seen in the following two weeks. Notably, prices rose to $13,200 on July 10, only to fall back below $10,000 the following day.Currently, the bull market looks to have stalled, with $12,000 resistance acting as a ceiling to further gains, as seen below.Bitcoin broke into a bull market with a convincing move to $5,000 in April and rose to a high of $13,880 on June 26.The cryptocurrency, however, did not find sustained acceptance above $12,000 in either the last week of June or the first two weeks of July.The repeated failure to close above $12,000 indicates a weakening of bull momentum and has established the psychological level as the resistance to beat for the bulls.So, a high-volume weekly close above $12,000 is needed to signal a continuation of the rally from April lows near $4,100 and open the doors to resistances at $15,000 and $17,235 (January 2018 high).The odds of BTC closing this week (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000 would drop if prices slip below key support at $11,200 in the next day or two.BTC fell 2.8 percent yesterday, snapping its seven-day winning streak.More importantly, the cryptocurrency failed to close above the upper edge of the falling channel on the daily chart and created a candle with a long upper shadow – another sign of buyer exhaustion above $12,000.That candle would gain credence and the outlook would turn bearish if prices close below $11,200 (Tuesday’s low).A close above $12,060 today would confirm a bull flag breakout on the 3-day chart. A bull flag breakout is a continuation pattern that usually accelerates the preceding rally.If confirmed, a breakout would potentially open the doors to fresh record highs above $20,000 (target as per the measured move method).That said, a weekly close above $12,000 would be a stronger confirmation of the revival of the bull market.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

That was the longest monthly winning streak since August 2017, as seen in the chart below.(function() {    'use strict';    window.addEventListener('message', function(event) {        if (typeof event.data['datawrapper-height'] !== 'undefined') {            for (var chartId in event.data['datawrapper-height']) {                var iframe = document.getElementById('datawrapper-chart-' + chartId) || document.querySelector(""iframe[src*='"" + chartId + ""']"");                if (!iframe) {                    continue;                }                iframe.style.height = event.data['datawrapper-height'][chartId] + 'px';            }        }    });})(); While BTC looks set to end the month in the red, it has rallied by $1,000 in just a few minutes in recent past. For instance, the cryptocurrency jumped from $9,300 to $10,400 in 30 minutes during the U.S. trading hours on July 18.Further, prices rose from $4,100 to $5,080 in two hours to 06:00 UTC on April 2 this year, confirming a long-term bullish breakout.So, with the UTC close still 14 hours away, a sudden $1,000 move to levels above the monthly opening price of $10,759 cannot be ruled out.As of now, however, the technical charts indicate a low probability of a UTC close above $10,759.BTC’s 4-hour chart shows a descending triangle breakout, a sign the pullback from highs above $13,000 has ended.The breakout is also backed by the relative strength index (RSI), which is reporting bullish conditions with an above-50 print.Even so, BTC may not be able to push beyond the bearish lower high of $10,235 on the 4-hour chart, as trading volumes haven’t picked up with the price breakout. A low-volume breakout is often short-lived.While a negative monthly close looks likely, the long-term outlook will remain bullish as long as prices are held above the 200-day moving average (MA), currently at $6,417.Also, despite the monthly loss, the bullish structure on the long-term chart remains intact, as seen in the chart below.Both the falling channel breakout confirmed in April and the ascending 5- and 10-month MAs indicate the path of least resistance is to the higher side.The RSI is holding well above 50, indicating an intact bull market.It is worth noting that a similar bearish channel breakout in the final quarter of 2015 paved way for a record rally to $20,000.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

A break ...","Aug 1, 2019 at 11:23 UTC",Bitcoin (BTC) has eked out moderate gains amid the U.S. Federal Reserve’s announcement of its first rate cut in over a decade.,"The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $9,950 on Bitstamp, representing a 2 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.The Federal Reserve (Fed) on Wednesday said it will lower interest rates by 0.25 percent to cushion the economy from a global slowdown and trade tensions. That was the first U.S. interest rate cut since the great financial crisis of 2008, and indeed since the creation of bitcoin in 2009.BTC rose by over $200 to $10,000 in the three hours leading up to the Fed’s announcement at 18:00 UTC. More importantly, the cryptocurrency remained bid in the following hours and hit a high of $10,172, according to Bitstamp data.The price action seems to have convinced investors that BTC picked up a bid due to Fed’s rate cut.Some observers believe rate cuts by the Fed bode well for BTC.This is because an interest rate cut reduces the yield on a currency. Further, the liquidity added to the economy via rate cuts often leads to inflation and loss of purchasing power of the currency.Put simply, falling interest rates mean fewer reasons to hold U.S. dollars, as pointed out by Alan Silbert, executive managing director at INX Trading Platform.Silbert believes the Fed will deliver more rate cuts in the near future. The central bank, however, refrained from signaled further easing yesterday.The Fed has cut rates less than 12 months away from bitcoin’s mining reward halving – a process aimed at curbing inflation by reducing reward for mining on the blockchain by 50 percent every four years.Essentially, BTC’s monetary policy is on a preset path – its supply is halved every four years.The monetary policy divergence would widen further if the Fed embarks on a full-blown easing cycle, as anticipated by Silbert. That would further strengthen bitcoin’s appeal as store of value and may bolster the bull market.As for the next 24 hours, bitcoin looks set to test key average located at $10,500.BTC rose above $10,000 yesterday, validating the seller exhaustion signaled by the long-tailed doji created on the 4-hour chart on July 28.That bullish doji reversal indicates that the sell-off from recent highs above $13,000 has ended and the path of least resistance is to the higher side. The descending triangle breakout confirmed yesterday also indicates a bull reversal.Notably, buying volumes picked up following the price breakout. The green volume bar created in the four hours to 16:00 UTC yesterday was the highest since July 19.Hence, the cryptocurrency may rise toward $10,500 (50-day moving average) over the next day or two. However, the outlook as per the daily chart would turn bullish only if and when BTC invalidates the bearish lower-highs pattern with a move above $11,120.The case for a rise to the 50-day MA in the next 24 hours would weaken if prices find acceptance below yesterday’s low of $9,574, although that looks unlikely.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin and dollars image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

Furthermore, Mr Azzopardi did not submit a written response to this claim. To the Tribunal this meant that the trader was not contesting the claim.Mr Azzopardi was ordered by the Tribunal to pay the consumer the amount of €2,000. The Tribunal also ruled that the ownership of the engine reverts to the trader after the payment is made.”The balance between running (mostly power) costs, crypto market prices and the amount of cryptocurrency earned by a mining machine is the fundamental factor that controls the mining of proof-of-work blockchains. As part of the process of securing the blockchain and recording transactions, bitcoin has so-called an automatically adjusting “difficulty” that controls how easy it is for miners to crack the mathematical problem that earns them their rewards.The inbuilt mechanism is designed to keep blocks being produced at roughly 10-minute intervals, regardless of how much computer power is applied to the network.But that difficulty requires these days powerful processors called application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that are notoriously power hungry. As such, people and firms entering the mining industry need to take into account whether their miners will actually earn a return on their investment. There are online calculators that will help this process.Recently, bitcoin has seen a record amount of computing power dedicated to securing its blockchain. According to data from BTC.com, the average bitcoin mining hash rate over the last two weeks has reached 71.43 quintillion hashes per second (EH/s), up from 64.49EH/s on July 23 – a 10.78-percent jump since mid July.Bitcoin mining image via Shutterstock"

3, 2019 at 09:00 UTC Updated Aug 5, 2019 at 02:39 UTC.","Aug 3, 2019 at 09:00 UTC",Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and a member of CoinDesk’s product team. The opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own.,"The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a free newsletter for institutional investors interested in crypto assets. Sign up here.Celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Bretton Woods conference is probably not high on the list of priorities for cryptocurrency enthusiasts this month. This is an understandable oversight – the price swings, confusing product launches and whereabouts of Justin Sun are perhaps more compelling.But the birth of international economic cooperation and interoperability should be recognized as the beginning of a process of economic reconstruction that has contributed to the global imbalances worrying the markets today. It could also have set the scene for the solution.The bulk of the U.S. stock market may be overvalued, and yields look set to go even lower – but a large part of the current strain lurks under the surface of the currency market. A combination of monetary easing, trade tensions and the threat of military action in the Middle East is a noxious cocktail for currency holders and hedgers as international conversions get risky and costly.Perhaps because of this, as well as the disquieting brandishing of financial muscle by the U.S. administration, the chorus of questions about the role of the U.S. dollar as a global reserve currency is getting louder.What’s more, it has held its leadership role for almost 100 years; the average global reserve currency lifespan over the past five centuries is 95 years. Shifting balances are hinting that the dollar’s reign may soon be up: its share of foreign exchange reserves is over 60%, while the weight of the U.S. economy in global output has fallen to less than 25 percent and is likely to continue trending lower.Encroaching currency competition could well gather momentum as politics starts to trump economics.Some have posited that there is a “non-zero chance” that bitcoin would make a great reserve currency. I disagree, I believe that there is exactly zero chance that could happen. I do think, however, that the global reserve system will radically change over the next couple of decades. Bitcoin could be a part of what emerges.First, some background on the significance of Bretton Woods and why we should be paying attention.In 1944, an agreement was drawn up between delegates from 44 nations that established the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency, which would be pegged to gold. The other member nations would peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar, and the resulting relative stability between denominations would smooth world trade and boost the post-war recovery.The agreement also created the institutions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank to coordinate global currency movements and channel loans to developing nations.The U.S. dollar stopped “officially” being the global reserve currency when President Richard Nixon took the country off the gold standard in 1971. It remained the de-facto global reserve currency, however, by dint of being the world’s largest economy and trading nation. Countries tended to hold more dollar reserves than all other foreign currencies combined, for the ease of transacting and for their relative stability.Being the global reserve currency is a mixed blessing. While it makes it easy to borrow in international markets, it takes away power to influence the domestic economy.If foreign debt holders start to believe that President Trump might encourage a devaluation of the U.S. dollar (as he has often hinted he wants to do), they would start to unload, as a devaluation would make their bonds worth less. Foreign holdings of U.S. debt currently amount to over $6 trillion, almost 30% of the outstanding total, so even a small unloading would be a shock to the market and would weaken the dollar’s credibility for some time to come.As well as not being able to devalue when convenient, the additional global demand for U.S. dollars stemming from its reserve currency status is keeping the dollar’s value high relative to other currencies, exacerbating the current account deficit, now the largest in the world. And, whatever your views on Modern Monetary Theory (which posits, among other things, that debt levels don’t matter), the vulnerability of the U.S. markets to foreign investment strategies is disquieting.So much for “America First.”Given the growing doubts over the need for and advisability of a fiat-based, single-issuer global reserve currency, you can see why the bitcoin narrative would pop up. Surely a sovereign-free, algorithm-based alternative would be more stable and trustworthy?Perhaps, but it won’t be bitcoin*.First, a global currency needs to have a flexible supply. The limits on the amount of gold banks could hold was one of the main reasons the gold standard didn’t work – economic growth outstripped the supply of gold-backed money, and the inevitable scramble to overcome this limitation led to destabilization.Second, bitcoin will not become a universal settlement token for trading contracts. It’s too volatile. While this should soften in line with greater liquidity, it’s unlikely that businesses and sovereign powers will give up their preference for fiat, which they have some control over.So, if not bitcoin, then what? What could an international trading currency that embodies both trustworthiness and flexibility look like?One such model is Facebook’s Libra: a basket of currencies and government debt that is periodically rebalanced and used to peg a digital token that can be used for settlement.But the whirlwind of debate around the coin’s purpose and backing has highlighted the strong distrust of corporate motives with global ambitions, and the simmering anti-trust scrutiny will make it difficult for any large enterprise to create a universal solution.Another such model, much more likely, is a revamped Special Drawing Right (SDR). This basket of currencies was created by the IMF in 1969 to act as a private transaction token and a “store of value” for members. Its value moves in line with that of the underlying currencies: the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, euro, British pound and Chinese renminbi.Several economists have proposed the expansion of the SDR’s scope for purposes of international trade, positioning it as a global reserve currency that does not depend on any one issuer and can be managed by a neutral, supra-national organization with economic stability as its main objective.The problem is, even a liquid SDR in its current configuration would be subject to national priorities and vulnerabilities. A sharp depreciation in the U.S. dollar as central banks switch to the SDR as a reserve holding could destabilize the basket. The euro is almost as significant as a global payment currency but carries an existential risk, however remote. The Chinese renminbi is still largely controlled by its government, and the British pound’s future is uncertain.If only the SDR in its new liquid form could be pegged to a non-sovereign token of exchange that is totally free from political manipulation. You see where I’m going with this?Other currencies would also form part of the basket, to reflect economic activity and allow flexibility in the supply. But a robust apolitical anchor could add a layer of trust, difficult to come by in an increasingly fractious trade environment.How this mechanism would work, I don’t know – it would no doubt be complex and fraught with controversy, and anyone who studies currencies is aware of the colossal complications of maintaining a peg. But the building conviction that the current system is flawed and the increasingly apparent politicization of currencies will eventually shift the conversation from “it’s too difficult to attempt” to “let’s start talking about this.”The biggest risk to the world economy right now is not trade tensions, overvalued assets or negative yields. It’s complacency in assuming that the status quo will hold. Profound change always costs a massive amount of political and economic capital, but it happens regardless.None of us can be sure what the next step of financial evolution will look like – but we’ll soon find out. As economist Tyler Cowen reminds us in a recent article: “Every era’s monetary institutions are virtually unimaginable until they are created.”Unfortunately, even getting the main participants to the table to discuss this will be a mammoth task. The Bretton Woods’ anniversary celebrations have given voice to papers and panels questioning the current reserve system, the role of the IMF and how to weather the economic storms ahead. Ideas and discussions are a start. But we shouldn’t forget that in 1944, just after the bloodiest war in history, what brought the participants to the table in a collaborative frame of mind was fear.We can all fervently hope that it doesn’t take that level of fear to get everyone to the table again. What is different this time around is that the need for a reform is becoming startlingly apparent. The discussions are involving a much broader set of participants. And bitcoin is adding a new tool to the box of potential solutions.On its own, it won’t solve the most pressing issues. But combined with other tools, and aided by diplomacy, academic rigor and patience, it could well form an integral part of a new type of reserve currency, which could help smooth or even avoid the shocks to come.(*Disclosure: I hold a modest amount of bitcoin with no short positions.) Bitcoin image via Shutterstock"

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Aug 2, 2019 at 14:30 UTC","Busan has been declared a “regulation-free” zone for blockchain development by South Korea’s national government, a move long expected but now formalized as part of a larger liberalization push.","Zug, Switzerland is said to be one of the models for the zone.The Ministry of SMEs and Startups announced on July 24 that the second largest city in the country by population will host a wide range of blockchain offerings related to finance, public safety and tourism, though it stopped short of fully opening the market and allowing for international-level crypto initiatives, according to the Korea Herald.A total of eleven regulations have been lifted for the project. It is expected that investors will move 29.9 billion won ($25 million) into the region by 2021 and development will be spread between the Munhyeon Innovation District, the Centum Innovation District and the Dongsam Innovation District.BNK Busan Bank, a Korea Exchange-listed local institution, will supervise blockchain management as it relates to finance and might be developing a stablecoin pegged to the won.Hyundai Pay is supporting payment solutions and advances in tourism. The company, which was established in 2016 by the CEO of Hyundai BS&C (also grandson of the founder of the Hyundai Group), signed a memorandum of understanding with the city in February in which it said it would move its headquarters to Busan and help it develop blockchain infrastructure utilizing the Hdac blockchain platform.Other elements of the program include a public safety offering by Gyeonggi Province-based Coinplug, which claims to be Korea’s largest holder of blockchain patents. The development will include an app which allows citizens to video natural disasters and crimes and send the files to the appropriate authorities, complete with location information. A rewards system will encourage the use of the app. The next stage will involve a database that will allow for the storing and sharing of information.BP&Solution, a Busan-based computer company, will work on blockchain as it relates to fisheries.The region won’t be completely “regulation-free,” however. ICOs will not be allowed, and the project is still decidedly conservative in terms of cryptocurrency. The stablecoin envisioned will be highly limited in terms of its use. It will mainly be a component of a rewards system incentivizing participation in the other local blockchain offerings and will only be redeemable at certain establishments, making it more a voucher than a coin. Busan has explicitly said that the reforms are not designed to be cryptocurrency-related.While the government move has been billed as an exemption from regulation, it is more a controlled experiment with certain defined goals and is evolutionary rather than revolutionary and fitting with Korea’s general and persistent suspicion of crypto.The plan was initially mentioned in April, when Busan was reported to have won out over Jeju, a province already known for its relatively liberal policies. Jeju developed an ambitious and rather aggressive vision in 2018 to become a crypto island.Busan has long been a center for trading and finance as well as a hub for innovation, and it is the home of the Korea Exchange. The city has been working for some time on blockchain-related developments, including the use of the technology at the port.The recent designation of Busan as Korea’s blockchain capital is connected to a broad policy drive by Korea’s current administration. President Moon Jae-in has been promoting so-called regulatory sandboxes, which allow for the temporary suspension of rules so that new technologies and services can be tested outside the complex legal and bureaucratic environment in the country.A goal of 100 such sandboxes was set for 2019, and as of mid July, 81 had been approved.In line with the sandbox push, the government has named seven areas (cities and provinces) that will receive blanket sandbox privileges in certain  technologies. South Jeolla Province, for example, will focus on e-mobility, Daegu on smart wellness and Sejong on autonomous driving."

The threshold was breached as bitcoin adjusted its mining difficulty at block height 586,672 on Monday 2:52 UTC – that is a 6.94EH/s, or 10.78 percent jump since mid July. Bitcoin mining difficulty is a measure of how hard it is to compete for mining rewards on bitcoin. Just how difficult the bitcoin software makes it to generate new blocks adjusts every 2,016 blocks – approximately every 14 days – to ensure the block production time remains about 10 minutes at the next cycle.Assume this additional 6.9EH/s (or 6.9 million tera hashes per second, TH/s) computing power has all come from powerful ASIC miners, such as Bitmain’s AntMiner S17 or MicroBT’s WhatsMiner M20S, both of which boast a mining rate of around 55TH/s and recently hit the market.That means more than 100,000 top-of-line ASIC miners could have been switched on within the past two weeks. Further, given these products have been sold for at least $2,000 each, this equates to some $200 million in revenue pocketed for major miner makers.The continued interest in bitcoin mining comes at a time when the cryptocurrency’s price appears to be en route to challenging all-time highs, however distantly, and amid the arrival of the rainy season in China, which leads to cheaper hydropower electricity costs in the country’s southwest provinces – a region that is reported to account for 50 percent of the global mining activity,Miners in China estimated earlier this year that bitcoin’s hash rate in the summer would break the level of 70EH/s. To be clear, at several single points of time, bitcoin’s hash rate had already crossed that level in June and even reached 80EH/s around Aug. 1. However, today marks the first time that the two-week average computing power has been able to remain above the 70EH/s threshold. As such, bitcoin’s mining difficulty has also set a new record of nearly 10 trillion.Amidst this uptick in mining interest, there have been notable changes in the mining market, where top manufacturers are racing to produce more powerful equipment.For instance, in Bitmain’s 2018 initial public offering prospectus, the Beijing-based mining giant claimed it had a 70 percent market dominance. Now, it may be facing serious competition from rival players that some believe are capable of shipping more top-of-line products with better profitability. Michael Zhong, a former mining analyst who now operates mining farms at a startup called The Force Mining, told CoinDesk that based on his experience, the production capacity ranking among major Chinese miner makers for their flagship products have changed over the years. Zhong explained that from 2017 to 2018, Bitmain had topped the list with its AntMiner S9 series miners, followed by Canaan’s Avalon 8 series machines. InnoSilicon, Ebang and former Bitmain design director’s MicroBT were all in the third position at the time.But from January to June this year, the delivery capacity ranking has reshuffled, with now MicroBT’s WhatsMiner M20 series at the top, followed by Bitmain’s S17 series miners and then InnoSilicon, Canaan, and Ebang, Zhong added.According to F2pool’s miner profit tracker, Bitmain’s flagship AntMiner S17 Pro ranks third in terms of mining profitability, following BitFury’s Tardis and MicroBT’s WhatsMiner M20S. The cost for WhatsMiner M20S is around $3,000, while that of AntMiner S17 Pro is around $4,000 each, based on the information advertised on the two firms’ websites. Although orders for these flagship machines have queued up until November and December this year, MicroBT’s founder Zuoxing Yang told CoinDesk previously that the bottleneck of production capacity is the availability of chips from suppliers. For example, MicroBT uses 10-nm chips for its M20 series, which are relatively more affordable with a higher level of availability compared to more advanced 7-nm chips used by Bitmain for its AntMiner S17 series equipment. While Bitmain has always been relying on chips supplied by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), MicroBT has switched from TSMC to Samsung earlier this year for its flagship products. Both TSMC and Samsung have estimated in their most recent Q2 earnings calls that the demand for cryptocurrency mining chips will come back in the third and the fourth quarter this year.Operating miners image courtesy to Hashage"
11,www.coindesk.com,"Aug 7, 2019",The 'Vault' Is Back: Coder Revives Plan to Shield Bitcoin Wallets From Theft,https://www.coindesk.com/the-vault-is-back-bitcoin-coder-to-revive-plan-to-shield-wallets-from-theft,"Basically, someone holding bitcoin primarily as a store of value could put 
it in cold storage, or hold it offline, with code that says it can be 
spent, ...","Aug 7, 2019 at 14:00 UTC",What if there were a mechanism that placed a time delay whenever someone spent bitcoin?,"The idea has been around for a few years now, and for good reason, it’s believed it could make it much harder for bad actors to steal funds from bitcoin users.Basically, someone holding bitcoin primarily as a store of value could put it in cold storage, or hold it offline, with code that says it can be spent, but not immediately. The owner could set some pre-determined time delay on any attempt to move the coins. The fact that it has a built-in delay would give a true owner time to reverse a transaction if their private information had been compromised and someone tried to steal their crypto.Malte Möser, Ittay Eyal, and Emin Gün Sirer proposed this feature, known as “vaults,” as a way to better secure bitcoin in 2016, but their proposal required a fork of the protocol codebase. That fork never happened.But on Wednesday, Bitcoin Core contributor and crypto consultant Bryan Bishop sent out a design to developers to accomplish the same thing using existing code.In an email titled, “Practical bitcoin vaults with theft-recovery/clawback mechanisms,” Bishop writes:“Vaults are particularly interesting as a bitcoin cold storage security mechanism because they enable a publicly observable delay period during which time a user could be alerted by a “watchtower” that a thief might be in the process of stealing their coins.”Under Bishop’s proposal, if an “unlock period” were initiated, an owner could choose to react or not react.If the proper owner had initiated the transaction, he or she would do nothing because they actually did want to move the bitcoin to a less-secure “hot” wallet for use. But if it was a malicious transaction, the rightful owner could use another pre-determined transaction to force the bitcoin back into the cold wallet, under the same time delay.In his email, Bishop writes:“The idea is to have a sequence of pre-generated pre-signed transactions that are generated in a certain way. The basic components are a vaulting transaction that locks coins into a vault, a delayed-spend transaction which is the only way to spend from a vault, and a re-vaulting transaction which can recover/clawback coins from the delayed-spend transaction.”Bishop’s proposal also has a number of options to address other scenarios, for more-sophisticated users.He told CoinDesk:“The way I’m looking at this is there are a lot of people and a lot of exchanges that clearly cannot secure their keys. We’ve seen theft after theft. Having the ability to revoke or undo a transaction, even in this constrained environment, could be quite valuable.”Indeed, this year has seen hacks at Bitpoint, Bitrue and Binance, among others.“I don’t know if I’m willing to say it solves theft,” Bishop added. “That’s a strong statement, but it’s a very important tool in the toolbox.”Bishop said that his proposal would not require any kind of fork as the prior proposal did. It relies on existing time lock functions that are already built into bitcoin code.That said, the software is not written yet. Before he makes this code available to the public, he needs to get feedback from fellow developers, write it and then test it thoroughly. So it will be a while before it’s available.During that give and take with fellow developers, questions about making security more complex are likely to be revisited. When the prior proposal came up in 2016, one developer noted that such a proposal gives a bitcoin user more pieces of data that they have to secure.On the other hand, since the approach requires no changes at the protocol level, it will be entirely up to the user to take advantage of it or not.And Bishop is aware that his strategy imposes new responsibilities on users. If it gets built, his concept will also need to be delivered, he said, with a certain amount of public education material, about protecting these new tools, security practices and so on.Once it is ready, though, the developer said he will make it freely available to any bitcoin holder who wants to use it.Bishop said he is likely to secure much of his own bitcoin this way, once the software is ready.Bryan Bishop photo by Flickr user @jeanbaptisteparis"

Bitcoin costs, however, are listed at $122.9 million in the unaudited quarterly report, yielding the aforementioned $2 million in profit.On an investor call Thursday afternoon announcing the numbers, Dorsey said:“We love you, bitcoin.”The first quarter of 2019 was Square’s best quarter for bitcoin at the time, with $65.5 million in revenue and $832,000 in profit. Clocking $125 million in sales in the second quarter, however, represents significant growth and a new record for the company. For comparison, the company reported $166 million in bitcoin sales in all of 2018.With a net loss for the quarter of $6.7 million on $1.17 billion in total revenue, bitcoin remains a long way away from the center of Square’s overall strategy. Transaction-based revenue in Q2 topped $775 million, according to the report.The company sells bitcoin to users through its Cash App, a service that expanded to all 50 U.S. states in August 2018.Earlier this week, the company clarified the role of Square Crypto, a project within the company created to make open-source contributions to the bitcoin protocol and ecosystem.A senior research director at market intelligence firm CB Insights told CoinDesk he believes adding bitcoin is helping Square drive more usage from its customers.“They don’t really make a lot of money on it, but it is driving engagement,” Chris Brendler said.Jack Dorsey image via CoinDesk archives"

To keep the conversation going in person, register for Invest: Asia 2019 coming up in Singapore on Sept. 11-12. There remains a great deal of confusion surrounding the legal status of cryptocurrency in China.Between headlines like “China Bans Bitcoin”, “China Bans Crypto Exchanges?”, and “China Bans Bitcoin Mining,” it’s no surprise that most people are unclear on where China stands on cryptocurrency and whether that has any real bearing on how its citizens behave.We hope to demystify this and offer some insight into the legal status of cryptocurrency and related matters.In China, bitcoin is legally recognized and protected as virtual property. This has been the law since 2013 and the classification was reconfirmed in the recent Hangzhou court ruling.However, this does not recognize bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as legal currency. Hence, any use of Bitcoin as a currency is illegal. Occasional peer-to-peer OTC transactions are acceptable, as long as the behavior remains on a small scale. All mainland financial institutions are barred from any involvement in virtual currencies and foreign entities are also prohibited from serving mainland customers.China has been progressively restricting more aspects of cryptocurrency within its borders dating back to September 2017, when it began by banning ICOs because of the financial risk and frequent fraud.Since then, China has not hesitated to prosecute seriously offending ICOs or crypto scams, which were clearly scamming their customers, such as Hero Chain, EOSPLUS, TronDotWallet, PlusToken, MGC, and DOGX. Some of them raised a ton of money from retail and exit scammed, some disguised as wallets or high-yield quant fund. The largest among them is PlusToken, which has scammed over a whopping $3 billion in total. Core team members of PlusToken were arrested earlier this year in Vanuatu with the help of local police and are now facing decades in jail.The ICO rules also restricted the activity of cryptocurrency exchanges domiciled in mainland China, as they are considered to be facilitating illegal fundraising and financial crimes. To preserve their businesses after the ban, these exchanges restructured and moved overseas to countries such as Japan, Singapore and registered in countries like the Seychelles and Malta.However, some exchanges, including Huobi and OKEx, continue to conspicuously serve Chinese customers in crypto to crypto trading, and facilitate yuan to BTC/USDT exchange disguised behind a peer-to-peer OTC front.The regulatory requirements on bitcoin mining are relatively fuzzy, the “ban” was not issued by a legal or regulatory department, but rather came from a “industry structure reform recommendation” from a state planning agency, which usually serves as a guideline instead of actual regulation. Hence, we haven’t seen any material impact on local mining facilities due to this “ban”. While many Chinese miners are currently looking for foreign sites, that is primarily due to fierce local competition rather than regulatory concerns.The actual handling of cryptocurrency in mainland China in practice doesn’t reflect the letter of the law, however.It’s no secret that Chinese citizens remain deeply involved in cryptocurrency mining, trading, and ICOs/IEOs. While official figures say that the percentage of cryptocurrency trading attributable to the yuan has dropped from 90% to 1% in the wake of the 2017 regulation, this does not account for over-the-counter trading which is where most fiat to crypto volume in China has shifted to since the regulation.OTC options are offered by exchanges like Huobi as well as by locally managed WeChat groups. These OTC desks take the form of a marketplace where buy and sell orders are offered manually and transactions are done in a peer-to-peer manner. The platform here merely acts as a place for buyers and sellers to discover each other, rather than facilitating trades itself as exchanges do.Payment can be handled between two parties once they have agreed on a trade through WeChat, Alipay, or banking wire, though China is attempting to crack down on that as well by blocking mobile payment platforms from processing crypto related payments. The biggest risk of peer-to-peer OTC trading is counterparty risk. If you want to buy Bitcoin from someone you have to 1) Agree on the price with that party, 2) Send RMB first, 3) Receive Bitcoin once the other party has received the payment.For this reason, most of the OTC WeChat groups have very strict rules for dealing with new members and only deal with those who have been in the group for long enough to have a good track record.To give you a sense of the volume that these desks handle, Huobi OTC has surpassed $100M USD in volume and WeChat OTC groups such as this one report processing a daily volume of $300k a day on average. There are thousands of similar WeChat OTC groups operating at a small scale, but together add up to a significant amount of crypto trading volume originating from China that is not accounted for by official figures.If one has the desire, buying cryptocurrency in China is by no means difficult. There are plenty of tutorials such as this one outlining various simple ways to purchase cryptocurrencies with RMB. Local liquidity for Bitcoin and USDT are excellent, despite what the regulators’ official statements might suggest.Once traders have gotten their hands on Bitcoin or USDT, they can then freely exchange that for other cryptocurrencies on exchanges, even ones that try to block Chinese customers, by using the credentials of people from other countries. KYC materials can be obtained for a mere $75 online and allow Chinese citizens access to exchanges as well as IEOs and ICOs. Crypto-to-crypto volume on exchanges like Huobi, OKEx, and Gate.io are still very dominated by Chinese retail, and OKEx derivatives trading is also dominated by Chinese whales and traders.As a result of the ban, different trading behaviors and selections of assets have emerged on these Chinese dominated exchanges compared to those on US exchanges like Bittrex, Bitstamp and Kraken.After the ban, China took to using Tether ($USDT) as a substitute to yuan in trading pairs. Tether has since developed into a USD replacement in even some non-crypto cross-border business cases. This is one possible explanation for why Tether has been so resilient to negative press such as the Tether-Bitfinex $850 million cover-up and over 60% of newly issued Tether is traded in Chinese background exchanges —it is supported by the crucial role it plays in the huge amount of crypto trading that depends on it in China.Because of the central role it plays, people in China don’t care whether it’s fully backed by reserve, as long as they remain able to exchange USDT for Yuan with local counterparties.China’s legal actions against cryptocurrency certainly had a huge impact on crypto activity within its borders. It changed the landscape of crypto trading in China and caused many crypto companies to move overseas. But the resilience and perseverance of Chinese crypto entrepreneurs are remarkable, which clearly manifests “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger”.Cryptocurrency is still alive and well in China.China flag image via Shutterstock"

Now with Fold entering the game, bitcoiners might benefit from competition between the shopping apps. But while Lolli offers an in-browser, custodial wallet, which can also be used to send bitcoin rewards to external wallets, Fold’s app automatically directs the rewards to an external wallet specified by the user.“It’s akin to accruing rewards points, just these are denominated in satoshis [fractions of bitcoin],” Fold product lead Will Reeves told CoinDesk. “They can be used for purchases within Fold or withdrawn to an actual bitcoin wallet.”Fold’s lightning compatibility also sets it apart from Lolli’s beginner-friendly service. This is possible because while Lolli works directly with merchants, Fold partners with pre-paid card networks and essentially buys a gift card with users’ bitcoin then facilitates the purchase on users’ behalf.Reeves said the lighting pizza feature has generated nearly $22,000 worth of transactions so far, with dozens of pizza purchases still rolling in every day.Executives at both Lolli and Fold now say their respective startups have thousands of active monthly users. Lolli CEO Alex Adelman told CoinDesk that, in addition to launching a mobile app, his team has plans to implement lightning options into the Lolli payout feature.“Lightning will be a powerful tool to help with the mainstream adoption of bitcoin,” Adelman told CoinDesk. “I’m excited to eventually share it with all our merchants.”Meanwhile, from Reeves’ perspective, competitors like Lolli have adapted incumbent affiliate models while Fold seeks to build a new payments system.“Soon, Fold users will be able to spend any currency they choose directly with these retailers and get free bitcoin for doing so,” Reeves said. “Beneath all the fun of shopping and rewards we intend to introduce a whole new paradigm to consumer spending.”Image via Fold app"

The research explored whether artificial intelligence could assist current anti-money laundering (AML) procedures.Only 2 percent of the 200,000 bitcoin transactions in the data set were deemed illicit as part of Eliptic’s initial work. While 21 percent were identified as lawful, the vast majority of the transactions, roughly 77 percent, remained unclassified. (To date, there have been an estimated 440 million bitcoin transactions since the network’s launch in 2009.)To be clear, the 2 percent comes from an Elliptic data set that was previously not public and the figure was merely affirmed by the MIT researchers’ analysis. The data point is in line with a study from competing analytics firm Chainalysis, which estimated just 1 percent of bitcoin transactions in 2019 were known to be associated with illicit activity.Since Elliptic is frequently hired by law enforcement agencies around the world to identify illegal activities using cryptocurrency, this research aimed to identify patterns that can help distinguish illicit usage from lawful bitcoin usage, especially among unbanked individuals or other unknown entities.“A big problem with compliance, in general, is false positives. A big part of this research is minimizing the number of false positives,” Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson told CoinDesk. “The key finding is that machine learning techniques are very effective at finding transactions that are illicit.”Sometimes, Robinson added, software was able to find patterns that would be difficult to describe yet still matched with known entities, based on pre-existing data from darknet markets, ransomware attacks and other criminal investigations.Following the academic study, Elliptic made the same dataset public to encourage open-source contributions.“On the AML side, we are sharing our early experiments with domain experts to solicit feedback,” IBM researcher Mark Weber told CoinDesk, adding:“We are also hoping the release of the Elliptic Data Set inspires others to join the effort to help make our financial systems safer by developing new techniques and models for AML.”CNBC reported in April that surging demand for U.S. $100 bills was likely driven by a rise in global criminal activity. A 2017 report by the American Institute for Economic Research, estimated that “more than a third of all US currency in circulation is used by criminals and tax cheats.”Update (22:00 UTC, Aug. 6): The title of this article has been modified and language has been added to clarify that the 2 percent figure was calculated in Elliptic’s initial work, and not in the subsequent analysis involving MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab.MIT image via Shutterstock"

As widely expected, the final guidance does not drastically alter the regulatory landscape, instead specifying when certain types of crypto assets fall under existing categories.True cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether, which the FCA classes “exchange tokens,” are not regulated, though anti-money-laundering rules apply.The FCA said some 92 responses to the consultation paper were received from an assortment of firms, including banks, trade associations and crypto exchanges. Most respondents supported the proposals, said the FCAImportantly, the guidance provides a definition of security tokens. When issued, these assets behave like shares or debt instruments, including ownership rights, thus falling under the category of a “specified investment” and, in turn, the FCA’s remit. Almost all respondents who answered the question agreed with the regulator’s assessment of security tokens in relation to the regulatory perimeter.Utility tokens, by contrast, do not grant the same sorts of rights as regulated financial instruments and will generally fall outside the FCA’s remit, except in circumstances when they meet the definition of electronic money and fall within a new category of e-money tokens.The agency said:“Any token that is not a security token, or an e-money token is unregulated. However, market participants should note certain activities that use tokens may nevertheless be regulated, for example, when used to facilitate regulated payments.”Certain stablecoins may also meet the e-money definition, though, and hence would also be subject to oversight by FCA (whose mandate is consumer and investor protection).The watchdog said, though, that “Market participants should use the Guidance as the first step in understanding how they should treat certain cryptoassets, however definitive judgements can only be made on a case-by-case basis.”Christopher Woolard, executive director of Strategy and Competition at the FCA, said in a statement:“This is a small, complex and evolving market covering a broad range of activities. Today’s guidance will help clarify which cryptoasset activities fall inside our regulatory perimeter.”A firm can issue security tokens without needing a regulatory license, in the same way that issuing shares does not require a license. But in any scenarios in which the tokens are traded, the advisers and brokers handling the tokens, and the financial promotions regime, will need authorization, said the FCA.If a security token is tradeable on the capital market, said the FCA, it will further be considered a transferable security under the European Union’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), and that regime will apply too.The initial coin offering explosion of 2017-18 has largely abated, removing some of the pressure on regulators, but there are still wrinkles when it comes to the business of defining certain types of crypto assets.Given the growing popularity of security token offerings, there could be a blurring of the lines between those and utility tokens, according to Jacqui Hatfield, a partner specializing in crypto at the London office of law firm Orrick.Hatfield pointed to possible cases when a utility token could wind up being dressed in a security token wrapper, telling CoinDesk:“The interesting thing is where you have got utility tokens that are dressed up as security tokens just to make sure that they don’t fall foul of any promotion type restrictions. So the question is, does that actually change the nature of the token itself when it comes to trading it?”In this regard, Nick Cook, director of innovation, FCA, reiterated the need to look at the nature of individual tokens and issuances on a case-case basis. “We don’t rely on the labeling, particularly with something like stablecoins, where we find the terminology is not especially helpful, because it could be a security token, it could be an e-money token, or it could be an unregulated token,” Cook told CoinDesk, adding:“So an individual or entity may attempt to make a token appear, in one way or another, to fit within or without the parameters, but we always look at the underlying characteristics.”As stated in the original consultation paper, utility tokens might meet the definition of e-money in certain circumstances (as could other tokens), in which case activities in relation to them may be within the FCA’s jurisdiction.The FCA agreed further clarity between types of tokens was required and said it will separate e-money tokens from the utility tokens and security tokens categories. “This will create a specific regulated e-money token category and an unregulated category that includes utility tokens,” said the regulator.Stablecoins, which are designed to maintain parity with fiat currency, may also fall within the definition of e-money, according to the paper. These may be considered electronic money where the crypto asset is issued on receipt of funds (i.e. fiat currency, not other crypto assets) and is accepted by a person other than the electronic money issuer.This would include crypto assets that are issued on receipt of British pounds and are pegged to that currency, as long as the asset is accepted by a third party, noted Hatfield.The FCA refers to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether which have no controlling authority or centralized issuer as exchange tokens and these are outside its parameters of regulation. However, exchange tokens will be caught (along with other crypto assets) by the EU’s 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD), which will be transposed into UK law by the end of 2019.Bradley Rice, senior regulatory associate at law firm Ashurst, said the more interesting paper will be from the Treasury because this could amend the regulatory perimeter – something the FCA was at pains to state in its response, adding:“The FCA’s hands are tied.  If the UK wants to bring more crypto assets into the regulatory net, the law has to be changed and that is in the Treasury’s gift.”Perhaps the most controversial move by the FCA – one separate from Wednesday’s guidance – is the proposed ban on crypto derivatives for retail investors, including options, futures, contracts for difference (CFDs) and exchange-traded notes with underlying (unregulated) cryptoassets like bitcoin, for example.Starting in August, the FCA is making restrictions for non-crypto CFDs and then at the start of September for non crypto CFD-like options. The consultation for how to deal with derivatives with underlying crypto assets ends October 3; the FCA’s proposal on this is a blanket ban.Hatfield said the notion of a ban on crypto derivatives was the only thing set out in the FCA’s crypto regulations she staunchly disagrees with.“The intention is that this will become a blanket ban for retail generally in the future,” she said, concluding:“My view is these should be treated like derivatives on the retail market generally, like any other derivative because these are no riskier.”Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Conduct Authority, Andrew Bailey, via SIFMA"

He threatened to sue the regulatory agency for “anti competitive behavior, breach of duty, [and] going against the [regulations],” noting the 180-day requirement described below.LedgerX admitted Thursday it has not launched bitcoin futures, as the firm had previously claimed, after the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said it had not approved the exchange to do so.The company previously told CoinDesk it was planning to launch the product on Wednesday. LedgerX would have been the first venue in the U.S. to offer physically-settled bitcoin futures, which are contracts that pay out in the underlying cryptocurrency rather than in cash.“Not only are they delivered physically in the sense that our customers can get bitcoin after the futures expires, but also they can deposit bitcoin to trade in the first place,” LedgerX CEO Paul Chou told CoinDesk on Monday.But on Thursday morning, the day after CoinDesk’s initial story ran, CFTC chief communications officer Michael Short said in an emailed statement: “LedgerX has not yet been approved by the Commission.”Indeed, a look at LedgerX’s data page shows only options and swaps trades that took place on Wednesday, but no futures.When contacted subsequently by CoinDesk, LedgerX chief operating and risk officer Juthica Chou acknowledged that the company was not trading futures contracts.She insisted that the prior conversation with her and Paul Chou about a Wednesday launch pertained only to LedgerX’s retail platform, Omni, which she said is actively serving swaps and options products to traders at present.“We’re still operating, we’re putting the product in front of retail,” she said.The CFTC last month approved LedgerX as a designated contract market (DCM), which was one of two approvals the company needed to proceed with the futures launch. The other is an amendment to its derivatives clearing organization (DCO) license.It is currently authorized to clear swaps, but not yet futures.In the CFTC’s own press release dated June 25 announcing the DCM approval, the regulator noted:“LedgerX has requested that the CFTC amend its order of registration as a DCO, which limits LedgerX to clearing swaps, to allow it to clear futures listed on its DCM.”According to CFTC regulations (Title 17 part 39.3), the agency has 180 days to approve or deny a DCO application.“[The CFTC] said to clear swaps and they said later that [we] should actually clear futures too and … we were waiting essentially for this amendment,” Paul Chou told CoinDesk Thursday.Juthica Chou appeared to suggest that because this period had passed without an objection from CFTC, the company was under the impression that it was clear to proceed.“We submitted the amendment on Nov. 8, 2018, it’s been more than 180 days, we don’t know why that’s the case [that it has not been approved],” Chou said, later adding:“We filed on Nov. 8 and we have email correspondences confirming there were no additional items that they needed for the amendment.”However, LedgerX needs explicit approval, according to a senior CFTC official.“Every new or amended DCO application needs to be affirmatively approved by the Commission,” said this official, who did not want to be identified. “The absence of a decision does not constitute approval, and entity self-certification is not an option.”The regulation does state that “the Commission may stay the running of the 180-day review period if an application is materially incomplete, in accordance with section 6(a) of the Act,” but there is no indication whether the CFTC took this action.That said, LedgerX’s DCO application “appears to be in the very final stages of the approval process,” the senior official said.Paul Chou told CoinDesk that there is little difference between swaps and futures products.“Basically, it’s just a total technicality that a swap and a future are different things and … it’s like, it’s actually a little different,” he said. “The difference between futures and swaps is ridiculous, it’s the same product.”Marc Hochstein contributed reporting.Juthica Chou image via CoinDesk archives"

process called Gitian to make so-called “reproducible” builds, which ...","Aug 1, 2019 at 08:00 UTC","Like it or not, there’s a bit of trust involved in the process of setting up, or “compiling,” the software at the heart of bitcoin – but a recent code change could help.","Featuring container software Guix, code was recently merged into the most popular bitcoin implementation, Bitcoin Core, meaning it’s now ready for real users to try out. The change could help to limit trust in code downloaded from operating system Ubuntu during the building process.“It’s been quite a journey, but #Guix support for deterministic, bootstrappable Bitcoin Core builds has landed in master,” the main developer behind the project, Carl Dong, tweeted last month.For this building process, there are already some protections built in. When downloading Bitcoin Core from Bitcoin.org, many developers use a process called Gitian to make so-called “reproducible” builds, which allows developers to double check that the binaries being distributed to them are the correct version that they want to be downloading – not a replica with a secret backdoor built into the software, say, to steal bitcoins.But Dong claims that’s not enough in terms of security of the building process, as he detailed in a presentation on the topic at the conference Breaking Bitcoin in Amsterdam.Through this Gitian process, the code is turned into something a computer would understand. Through that, users might not notice they are downloading code from the operating system Ubuntu, and effectively trusting them.Dong told CoinDesk:“Currently, Ubuntu (or whoever gains access to Ubuntu’s signing keys) influences both the availability and security of Bitcoin Core’s release binaries. In the long term, placing trust in un-auditable, opaque binary downloads from third parties like Ubuntu seems like a recipe for disaster.”Because of this, when going through the whole “reproducible builds” shebang a few years ago, Dong told CoinDesk he became “disillusioned” with bitcoin’s build process.He found that he wasn’t the only one, and once he joined Chaincode Labs, a hub for bitcoin protocol development in New York City, the project took flight, getting help from Bitcoin Core contributors Russ Yanofsky and Cory Fields, among other active contributors to the Bitcoin Core software.He decided ultimately that the solution was to minimize the trust in these binaries as much as possible. And to make it easier to track where exactly these binaries are coming from.“When we use Guix to build our toolchain we can audit how each tool in our toolchain was built and easily bootstrap them from a minimal set of trusted binaries,” Dong said in his Breaking Bitcoin talk.That’s not to say it eradicates trust completely, Dong said, “unfortunately it is a somewhat infeasible task to remove trusted third parties from the build process completely,” but, he argued, it sure helps.“What we do achieve is much better auditability of our third-party provided toolchain. This project’s use of Guix allows us to have unprecedented visibility into what our set of trusted binaries is, and how we derive Bitcoin Core’s build environment from it,” he went on.For now, this change is available to users of the Linux operating system. Dong and others are in the process of making the change work for Windows and Mac users as well.“This was a big first step, and should be a good alternative to Gitian building. Lots of Guix related improvements already in the pipeline. I’m optimistic it’ll play a role in the 0.19.0 release,” tweeted Bitcoin Core contributor Michael Ford who was recently named a maintainer of the software.Not to mention, Dong has plans to make these builds reproducible across time.“If this works, it means that future Bitcoin Core developers will be able to build previous Bitcoin Core versions and produce binaries that are bit-for-bit identical to when they were released. This reproducibility-across-time allows us to recreate the exact behavior of previous versions, which is valuable for testing and debugging purposes,” he said.And, although it’s a rather technical change that might sound arcane, developers are praising Dong for his work in making bitcoin more secure.“Innovation like this is often invisible to the consumer and investment communities, but is unquestionably the reason why bitcoin is so far ahead,” tweeted Sia co-founder and lead developer David Vorick.Bitcoin developer Cory Fields via CoinDesk archives"

small transactions affordable by reducing network fees.","Aug 1, 2019 at 12:00 UTC",Lightning-centric bitcoin wallets are gaining traction in 2019 and making small transactions affordable by reducing network fees.,"The bootstrapped Spanish startup Bluewallet garnered 35,000 downloads so far this year, according to co-founder Nuno Coelho, a significant jump from the 5,000 users it had in 2018.Coelho told CoinDesk the wallet’s built-in lightning marketplace, offering connections to external services like the crypto exchange ZigZag, the blog Yalls and games like Lightning Roulette, facilitates nearly 10,000 referrals a month. So far, BlueWallet users have completed more than 100,000 lightning transactions.“The things we are working on now are to prepare the wallet for the next bull run,” Coelho said. “To allow users to have more control over the fees when the market will be with higher fees.”After a year of operations, Bluewallet is currently raising its first round of venture capital. It is hardly alone. Competition across the marketplace is ramping up with a crop of new wallets seeking funding to support lightning development, sources told CoinDesk.In June, the Lightning Labs wallet launched and attracted 2,000 downloads within the first 24 hours. That same month, the bitcoin wallet provider Samourai Wallet announced a partnership with the French lightning node-maker Nodl to make the mobile wallet lightning-compatible.At the same time, Zap wallet creator Jack Mallers told CoinDesk that 500 Android users downloaded Zap since early June. This summer could be described as a lightning boom for product development.Plus, Mallers added, Zap now has more than 25,000 desktop downloads and 1,000 active TestFlight users on iOS.“Not only are they downloading it, but the applications are actually checking assets because they’re using it and the wallets are open,” Mallers said. “On average, we get thousands of asset downloads a day. That means we have thousands of active users.”According to Google’s analytics, Mallers said, only 33 percent of those users are located in the United States. While Bluewallet has far more American users, Coelho said his company’s wallet also appears to be gaining traction in Indonesia, the Philippines and Japan, based on App Store data and the times that users interact with the product.Across the board, all of these apps share a common trait: They lack a clear business model.However, for some, that process might be seen as a feature, not a bug.“It’s not our main priority to focus on a business model at the moment,” Coelho said. “It’s our priority to … put product out there and talk to users.”Like Coelho, Mallers said he is not in a rush to profit from this wallet because playing the long game means focusing on users for now. Lightning Labs developers told CoinDesk the startup will offer premium services for wallet users in the future, but collecting fees from users isn’t a priority for their team either.“It wasn’t very clear how a lightning wallet would make money. A lightning wallet’s point is to help with scaling,” Mallers said.Most mainstream wallets like Jaxx and Bread earn revenue by taking a percentage of transaction fees. They also rely on other revenue models like fundraising tokens (Bread) or integration partnerships (Jaxx). Meanwhile, open-source wallets like Bluewallet and Zap de-prioritize the business model as they seek to stabilize the product with the help of volunteer contributors.“You cannot accelerate the development of bitcoin,” Coelho said. “We see this as a long-term project, from 5–10 years.”So far, most of these wallet apps rely on an autopilot setting rather than making users manage channels and independent nodes. Coelho said those options for experts will come with time, considering that the LND beta version many such wallets are experimenting with is just one year old.As such, Coelho concluded:“Our goal was just to show this is what lightning could be in the future.”Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark via CoinDesk archives"

That plan, though, has been abandoned and the firm’s Hong Kong Stock Exchange application lapsed in November.In March, it was reported that the firm was considering an IPO attempt on the newly created Science and Technology (Sci-Tech) Innovation Board within the Shanghai Stock Exchange, in addition to its communication with the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.Confidential filings for companies of all sizes are allowed in the U.S., after the Securities and Exchange Commission in July 2017 changed the rules in a bid to encourage more IPOs. Prior to that, only smaller firms were allowed private applications.Firm’s IPO registration statements are submitted in an SEC filing, the S-1, around three to four months before their planned launch. The SEC reviews the documents before approving the public offering.Rival miner manufacturer Bitmain also failed in its bid to IPO in Hing Kong and was reported to be considering an attempt in the U.S. in June.Canaan image via CoinDesk archive"

The meeting seemed to revive an initiative that had lost some momentum since first being announced late last year.Three priorities were set for completion by the November deadline. The city’s blockchain points system will be introduced and residents of Seoul will receive S-coins for the use of public services. They will be able to redeem those points for rewards. Services that generate the coins include paying taxes and participating in public opinion polls.Seoul’s point system will integrated with ZeroPay, a city-government sponsored QR-code-enabled network established last December. It allows customers to pay for goods and services using their phones and does not charge merchants commissions.In addition to the S-coin, a blockchain service for submitting qualifications without paper documents is also on the list for completion by November, as is the enhancing of the Seoul Citizens Card with blockchain to enable digital authentication for the use of public services.By the end of the year Seoul would like to have its part-time workers rights program up and running. The blockchain-based system will allow part-time and temporary employees to sign simple contracts with employers, keep track of their work histories, and maintain time sheets. It will also help them properly register for the county’s four major social insurance programs. The aim is to improve trust and relations between small companies and part-time workers.Other programs mentioned but not with year-end completion deadlines include smart healthcare, donation management and online certificate verification.While the blockchain services will be controlled by the city, they will be operated by private enterprises.Seoul has been discussing the implementation of a blockchain strategy for some time. Mayor Park Won-soon has campaigned on a promise to implement relevant solutions for the city, and the Blockchain City Seoul Promotion Plan was announced last October.When it was introduced, 14 blockchain administrative projects and a 2022 completion date were mentioned. A total of 127.3 billion won ($105 million) was to be committed to the plan.Since then, very little has happened in terms of actual progress.

But he denied Coinbase’s motions to move the case to arbitration and to dismiss the buyers’ negligence claims, saying it is “plausible” that the company “breached its duty to maintain a functional market.”“For starters, the fact that Coinbase halted trading within three minutes of the launch is indicative of dysfunction,” Chhabria wrote in the ruling Tuesday.The case was brought last year by Jeffrey Berk, a former Coinbase user, who accused the exchange of allowing insider trading on its GDAX trading platform from Dec. 19–21, 2017, because BCH prices spiked right before Coinbase announced trading options on Dec. 20. Berk, an Arizona resident, brought the case on behalf of other traders. Two earlier versions of his complaint were dismissed.In dismissing the insider trading theory, Chhabria cited a lack of “causation” proved by the plaintiff’s price volatility arguments. (Last year, the exchange hired two law firms to investigate insider trading allegations; they reportedly found no wrongdoing.)Nevertheless, Coinbase will need to prove it applied a standard of reasonable care to prevent foreseeable harm to users.Coinbase contested that it had a “duty” to strategize against market swings, citing a lack of responsibility to prevent the economic loss of others. The judge’s order replied, “the interpretation that the California Supreme Court would be most likely to adopt – is that Coinbase indeed had a duty to maintain a functional marketplace.”Namely, because Coinbase “encouraged traders to enter the market,” by promoting the BCH launch, and held a “position of trust” when processing users’ transactions.Because the sellers’ motion was dismissed with prejudice, it cannot be amended. However, the discovery process will continue, and Chhabria left a door open for the sellers to re-file should new evidence to support their position turn up.Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong image via CoinDesk archives."

(The company believes ethereum, in particular, is the future of “non-fungible assets,” or digital assets that are provably unique from all the others).The blog post goes on:“We also believe that bitcoin is the future of money, and many of our players will prefer to hold most, if not all, of their funds in bitcoin. We want to make it possible to serve our biggest supporters and players on the bitcoin network while utilizing all of the infrastructure present on ethereum and other blockchain networks.”As such, they want users to be able to send lightning bitcoin payments to trigger ethereum events.“By integrating bitcoin lightning network payments, we are able to accept instant payments in bitcoin directly, and instantaneously kick off a series of events on any other chain, such as minting a brand new Neon District asset to a buyer’s ethereum or Loom Network wallet,” the blog continues.The code for this unique type of lightning transaction is not yet public, but “we will open it once we’re sure it’s ready and secure for people to pull down and use,” Heidorn told CoinDesk.Regarding the frequent tension between bitcoin and ethereum enthusiasts, Heidorn argued that the two cryptocurrencies are “two sides of the same coin,” adding:“When it comes down to individuals maintaining sovereignty, privacy and autonomy, especially as crypto grows in popularity and faces greater social and political attacks, the infighting will be a thing of the past.”Bitcoin and ethereum coins image via Shutterstock"

competitor, Wasabi Wallet, is the target of an ongoing network attack.","Aug 6, 2019 at 04:00 UTC","Bitcoin privacy wallet Samourai announced last Thursday that its primary competitor, Wasabi Wallet, is the target of an ongoing network attack.","The blog post is the latest in a string of allegations Samourai has leveled against Wasabi since mid-July.The attack, according to Samourai Wallet, resembles a Sybil attack, where a small number of users falsifies new identities and pretends to be much larger in number. This would mean that the anonymity set, or crowd, in which a user can hide their bitcoin transactions is not actually as large as Wasabi suggests.“As the Wasabi team has described it, the goal of the Wasabi mixing technique, is to hide your [unspent transaction outputs] in a ‘sufficiently’ large crowd (peers),” Samourai wrote in its blog post. “The current target Anonymity Set in Wasabi mixing is 100 peers.”That means that if, say, 20 of those peers are actually just one user and the identity of this user is uncovered, privacy levels for all other users in the same mixing pool are reduced.“With bad user privacy, the crowd gets smaller,” independent bitcoin researcher Max Hillebrand explained to CoinDesk. “If you are one of these other [transactions] that have not been de-anonymized [by an attacker] then your anonymity set is no longer 100.”Samourai says evidence of Sybil attacks on the Wasabi network dates back to January 2019.Wasabi has issued its own statements refuting Samourai’s claims, while also issuing allegations of their own against Samourai.As a result, privacy-minded bitcoin users are questioning the true efficacy of either wallet in hiding the identities of its users.Indeed, the core design of both Samourai and Wasabi actually has more in common than most realize.Speaking to CoinDesk, the co-founder of Samourai Wallet, who goes by the initials SW, said that at one point in time, Samourai and Wasabi were the same application.Lead developers TDevD (Samourai) and nopara73 (Wasabi) worked together on building an implementation of long-standing bitcoin privacy tech CoinJoin called ZeroLink.“We just had a difference in implementation desire,” said SW. “So we split. We forked the project and just implemented it the way we wanted to implement it.”Samourai’s implementation of ZeroLink (called Whirlpool) has a different pricing mechanism than Wasabi, though this is not the only difference between the two wallet applications. As a result, SW maintains that Whirlpool makes it more expensive for malicious actors in the system to break the anonymity of other users through a Sybil attack.Wasabi’s Adam Ficsor, who goes by the alias nopara73, counters that divvying up costs later on in the process is actually more “cost-effective” and points out that anonymity using Whirlpool can always be broken given that Samourai relies on a centralized, backend server to process users’ extended public keys.“Fuck you,” Ficsor wrote in a Medium post on July 21. “How can you take a stupid design decision you made and act like it’d be a significant advantage over another project that clearly has its basics right?”This issue of sending user addresses to a backend server, Fiscor said in a second blog post, was raised by the creator of CoinJoin, Gregory Maxwell. When Maxwell approached the Samourai team with his concerns, he said on Reddit he was harassed and accused of making false claims.“When you use the wallet, you send Samourai all of your public keys in the form of an extended public key (XPUB) that let’s Samourai have unique access to all of your current and future addresses,” said Aviv Milner, the community technical support lead for the startup behind Wasabi, zkSNACKs.This matter of Samourai’s reliance on a backend server is one that SW admits does require the trust of users “that Samourai isn’t trying to sell their public key data to third parties.”As such, experts say there is no clear winner between Wasabi and Samourai.“[The two] are based on different assumptions,” Hillebrand said, adding:“One assumes that the coordinator must not be trusted and that everyone knows what the coordinator knows. The other assumption is that there is an inherent trust in the developers and therefore it’s OK to trust central servers. Now, [what you choose] really depends on the threat model of every individual and each unique case.”According to Hillebrand, while the basics of the two ZeroLink implementations are the same, in both implementations users are required to take privacy matters into their own hands by ensuring they are abiding by the best practices of the protocol.Indeed, Kevin Loaec, the managing director of blockchain consultancy Chainsmiths, said any CoinJoin implementation will suffer from the same basic attack vectors.“Privacy on bitcoin is extremely hard, any mistake from you or other mixing participants will hunt you down in the future as the blockchain is here for all to see,” Loaec told CoinDesk. “The type of wallet you use, the spending habits (time of the day, amounts…) the consolidations you do… everything can be exploited to profile you and reduce the anonymity.”As such, Loaec, who uses both Wasabi and Samourai wallets, said that for users still deciding on which side of the bitcoin privacy wallet debate to land, there isn’t one right answer.Concluded Loaec:“Use CoinJoin, but learn about it and don’t assume you are private. Always mix.”Image via Shutterstock "

Many of North Korea’s hackers operate under the Reconnaissance General Bureau, an intelligence agency that handles clandestine operations.The U.N. report said targeting crypto exchanges allowed North Korea “to generate income in ways that are harder to trace and subject to less government oversight and regulation than the traditional banking sector.”U.S. president Donald Trump has met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un several times in a bid to persuade the country to drop its nuclear weapons program.Reuters said it asked a U.S. State Department spokeswoman about the U.N. report, and received the response:“We call upon all responsible states to take action to counter North Korea’s ability to conduct malicious cyber activity, which generates revenue that supports its unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs.”Previous reports have linked North Korea to major hacks at crypto exchanges.A South Korean agency pointed the finger at its neighbor back in  2018 saying that domestic exchanges had been attacked with the loss of billions of won. It was investigating at the time if the rogue nation was behind the massive hack of Japan’s Coincheck exchange, which led to the theft of more than $500 million in cryptocurrency.More recently, North Korean hackers were said to have been targeting users of the UPbit exchange with  phishing email campaign.Pyongyang image via Shutterstock"
26,www.coindesk.com,"Jul 31, 2019",Ethereum: What the Next 4 Years Look Like,https://www.coindesk.com/what-the-next-4-years-of-ethereum-look-like,"... a partner at Pantera Capital, the oldest U.S. bitcoin investment firm 
which has invested in over 20 different ethereum-based startups to date.","Jul 31, 2019 at 21:15 UTC","Yesterday, ethereum celebrated its fourth birthday.","Four years ago, on July 30, 2015, the world’s first general-purpose blockchain platform went live. Called ethereum, the platform was the first of its kind to feature a Turing-complete virtual machine and native programming language able to deploy code of any algorithmic complexity.“Before ethereum, developers had to design and write extremely complex software,” blockchain researcher Mihailo Bjelic told CoinDesk. “Ethereum introduced a generic programmable layer which abstracted this whole process and enabled developers to build decentralized applications by only writing their applications’ core logic.”There are roughly 800 monthly active developers building on the ethereum blockchain, according to new data from investment firm Electric Capital.“This means that the ethereum ecosystem is experimenting an order of magnitude more than almost every other ecosystem,” said Electric Capital founder Avichal Garg.That said, ethereum is no longer the only general-purpose blockchain in the world, nor even the most active by some metrics. The most recent quarterly report from Dapp.com shows that while ethereum is still the first choice for developers, other decentralized application (dapp) platforms such as Tron and EOS surpass ethereum in the number of active dapp users.That leaves many industry observers wondering where ethereum will be in another four years. Will it retain its lead as a general-purpose blockchain platform in the face of a fast-rising competition?Eric Conner, founder of information site ETHHub and product researcher at blockchain startup Gnosis, said:“I think in four years, Ethereum will be moving past the hardest parts of its ambitious goals around proof-of-stake and scaling. At that point, the network will be able to onboard more users and we’ll start to grow beyond the use cases we are seeing today.”Both proof-of-stake (a comparatively more eco-friendly version of the current consensus algorithm on ethereum) and scaling are bundled into an ambitious upgrade called ethereum 2.0 that many, not just Conner, envision to be completed in the next four years of ethereum’s existence.Said Anthony Sassano, marketing and growth lead at ethereum-based startup Set Protocol:“I believe that ethereum will achieve the original ‘world computer’ vision within the next four years because Ethereum 2.0 will have completed its roll-out. We will have mature scaling solutions (at all layers) and we will have proper privacy solutions.”At the same time, it’s not just core bottlenecks in the technology limiting transaction throughput and efficiency that experts say will need to be resolved about ethereum in coming years. Others both within and outside of the ethereum community say in the next four years, ethereum will also have to overcome challenges associated with its monetary identity.Yaz Khoury, director of developer relations for the Ethereum Classic Cooperative (which helps build the protocol for ethereum’s sister chain, ETC), said:“[Ethereum] is still struggling with a monetary identity. It’s not so much a cryptocurrency as much as a dapp market and network.”To this, Ryan Sean Adams, founder of another crypto investment firm called Mythos Capital, sees ethereum establishing itself as a digital currency in four years time.“Four years from now, it’ll be obvious that ETH isn’t a utility coin, it’s money. A programmable store-of-value money,” he said. “Lending, borrowing, trading, saving. Each of these will be public protocols in the ethereum economy.”As such, MakerDAO’s Conti thinks ethereum 2.0 and scalability challenges aren’t all that important to the immediate future of the protocol.The continued growth of decentralized finance applications, on the other hand, is.Mariano Conti, the MakerDAO Foundation’s head of smart contracts, said via email:“I honestly believe that even if Ethereum 2.0 is significantly delayed, what we have right now is good enough for proper Decentralized Finance in the next three or four years. I expect more companies paying their employees streaming salaries in DAI. … I also expect (dread) the first big DeFi hack to happen soon, and this’ll be something to watch out for.”On the flip side, major investors in ethereum say they aren’t worried about how the platform will transform in the next few years. On the contrary, progress in the last four years of ethereum’s existence has only proven to cement the technology’s lead.“Ethereum has progressed significantly in making it easier for developers to build,” said Scalar Capital founder Linda Xie. “There’s improved language, tooling and infrastructure. It’s still a work in progress but it’s much easier to build an application now than in the early days.”Mythos Capital’s Adams estimates that close to $15 billion worth of tokenized assets have been generated on ethereum thus far. These assets will continue to snowball in popularity and generate even greater value for the ethereum platform in future years, says Adams.“We’re also seeing a first generation of [decentralized finance] protocols [on ethereum], with $500 million locked in lending and exchange protocols over the last 18 months,” Adamas said via email. “These protocols will form the banking layer of this new open finance system.”2019 alone has been and will continue to be an inspiring year for ethereum, said Paul Veradittakit, a partner at Pantera Capital, the oldest U.S. bitcoin investment firm which has invested in over 20 different ethereum-based startups to date.“The Ethereum community has stayed focused during bull runs and kept faith during the crypto winter,” Veradittakit said, adding:“That focus on building is really paying off, and the ecosystem is healthier and richer because of it. So many great Ethereum projects are set to launch this year, and it’s been incredibly inspiring to watch.”Vitalik Buterin image via CoinDesk archives"

bitcoin last May. On Wednesday, a Telegram group created by an admin ...","Aug 7, 2019 at 12:51 UTC","Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, said it’s investigating the alleged leak of its customers’ verification information. The leak could affect up to 60,000 individual users who sent KYC information to the company in 2018 and 2019.","This leak is said to be directly related to a hack that nabbed 7,000 bitcoin last May.On Wednesday, a Telegram group created by an admin under the pseudonym “Guardian M” distributed hundreds of images of individuals holding their IDs and pieces of paper written with “Binance, 02/24/18,” alleging that the data presented was hacked from the exchange. The hacker supplied CoinDesk with hundreds of photographs and we have identified a number of users who recognize the photos of their faces and personal IDs that they sent into Binance for know-your-customer purposes.The hacker told CoinDesk that he or she has at least 60,000 more and that he will release them over time. We have access to nearly 1,000.Know-your-customer, or KYC, is a legal requirement by financial institutions to collect identifying information for all customers attempting to trade, withdraw and deposit.In a response on Wednesday, Binance said the information circulated in the Telegram channel does not match data in Binance’s own internal system, and as such said there’s no evidence so far to show it’s directly coming from the exchange itself.“These images do not contain the digital watermark imprinted by our system,” the company said. “Our security team is hard at work pursuing all possible leads in an attempt to identify the source of these images, as it remains unclear where they were obtained.”Binance added that the unidentified individual previously demanded 300 BTC from it for “withholding 10,000 photos that bear similarity to Binance KYC data.” After Binance refused to continue the conversation, the individual started distributing the photos online and to media outlets.In fact, since Monday this week, CoinDesk has already reached out to three people whose ID images, among hundreds of others, were first uploaded to a publicly available cloud drive and were later circulating in the Telegram group today.Two individuals confirmed to CoinDesk the authenticity of the images and that they submitted such images to Binance.com on Feb. 24 2018.One of the two individuals, who asked to remain anonymous, showed CoinDesk his Binance login history from January 2018 when he first registered the account, via email alerts he received every time he went onto the site.The email alert history indicates he did log into Binance.com, on Feb. 24, 2018, around 5:00 UTC.Further, this individual showed CoinDesk an ID image of his saved on his phone taken on Feb. 24 around 6:00 UTC, which appears identical to the one that’s circulating inside the Telegram group.The second individual told CoinDesk that he received an email from Binance’s customer support on Feb. 24 as he was trying to make the size of his submitted image correct. He added the email was sent from an email address with a binance.zendesk.com domain. The exchange makes regular announcements on a site with such domain name.A third user we contacted could have been a victim of identity theft. The photograph we analyzed contained a face similar to the victims but incorrect address information.An error-level analysis of the photo suggests that the some of the image had been modified, especially the brighter edges in the photo above. “Similar edges should have similar brightness in the ELA result,” wrote the photo forensics site FotoForensics. “All high-contrast edges should look similar to each other, and all low-contrast edges should look similar. With an original photo, low-contrast edges should be almost as bright as high-contrast edge.”In today’s response, Binance said that around February 2018, it had contracted a third-party vendor to handle know-your-customer verification “in order to handle the high volume of requests at that time.”The exchange did not elaborate on to what degree this third-party vendor was give access to the know-your-customer data or whether it was able to obtain the actual image files on premise.“Currently, we are investigating with the third-party vendor for more information. We are continuing to investigate and will keep you informed,” the company said.Image via hacked files"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Aug 5, 2019 at 10:20 UTC","Litecoin (LTC), currently the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has just reduced its block reward for miners by half.","The litecoin blockchain reached the trigger block height of 1,680,000 at 10:16 UTC on Monday, according to the litecoin explorer from mining pool operator BTC.com.The event marks a major threshold for miners, as the litecoin network is designed to reduce its mining rewards by half every 840,000 blocks (roughly every four years).For this “halving,” the mining reward for every block has been reduced from the previous 25 LTC to 12.5 LTC.Given the block production time on the litecoin network is around one block every 2.5 minutes, roughly 576 blocks are produced in every 24 hours with a new supply of 7,200 LTC entering into the market – half the previous daily level of around 14,400 LTC.As of press time, about 63 million out of the total issuance of 84 million LTC are effectively in circulation, leaving about 21 million LTC block mining rewards – worth $2 billion at today’s prices – available for miners to compete for in the future.Since early this year, LTC’s price has seen a significant uptick from around $30 in January to as much as $120 in June, but has since then decreased to around $100.In line with the price increase ahead of the anticipated halving event, hash rate computing on the litecoin network and the mining difficulty have both jumped by 200 percent since end of December 2019.The halving will likely have an affect on the interest in mining participation, as several widely used litecoin mining devices will now have a tough time generating enough LTC to offset electricity costs.According to a miner profit index from f2pool, one of the world’s largest mining pools by hash rate, the three most profitable LTC miners made by InnoSilicon and FusionSilicon X6 had a profit margin of between 55 and 60 percent before Aug. 5.Other older models such as Bitmain’s AntMiner L3, however, already had a profitability that was less than 50 percent based on an electricity cost of $0.04 per kWh and LTC’s price before the halving.Holding everything else constant, reducing the mining revenue by half could lead to a net loss for miners with such older models, as Shixing Mao, co-founder of f2pool, said in a Weibo post:“With an electricity cost of 0.26 yuan [$0.037] per kWh, miners like L3+ can pretty much just shut down tonight.”Litecoin mining image via Shutterstock"

bearish-to-bullish trend change with a big move above key resistance at ...","Jul 31, 2019 at 16:25 UTC",A rule embedded within litecoin’s (LTC) code is set to soon reduce rewards for the miners who today ensure transaction processing on the world’s fourth-largest blockchain by total value.,"In approximately five days, litecoin will undergo a scheduled reward halving – a process aimed at preserving cryptocurrency’s purchasing power. The mining reward is currently set at 25 litecoins ($2,500) per block and will drop to 12.5 litecoins ($1,200) per block on Aug. 5.With that transition, the protocol will be adding significantly fewer litecoins to the market after Aug. 5.The halving, therefore, sounds similar to interest rate hikes and other measures initiated by central banks across the globe when combating high inflation, so investors may feel tempted to snap up litecoins while heading into the event.However, while the cryptocurrency may pick up a bid in the next couple of days, big gains look unlikely with the price action of the last six months suggesting that an impending supply cut has already been priced in by savvy traders.Litecoin, which traded at $30 on Jan. 1, ended the first quarter at $61, representing a 100 percent gain. That was LTC’s best first-quarter performance on record, as reported by CoinDesk on March 31.More importantly, the cryptocurrency eked out stellar gains in the first three months of this year despite the flat action in bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency.Essentially, LTC broke into a bull market well before bitcoin confirmed a bearish-to-bullish trend change with a big move above key resistance at $4,236 on April 2. Prices went on to hit highs above $140 in June before falling back to $80 earlier this month.Litecoin’s non-price metrics have also risen sharply since mid-December, hitting new record highs several times over the last couple of months. For instance, hashrate or computing power dedicated to mining rose to 523.81 TH/s on July 14, up 258 percent from the low of 146.21 TH/s seen in December 2018, according to bitinfocharts.com.Litecoin leading the broader market higher with 100 percent gains in the first quarter followed by a rise to highs above $145 in June. Yet, the recent drop to $80 is reminiscent of the price action seen in months ahead of the previous reward halving, which took place on Aug. 25, 2015.Back then, prices bottomed out at $1.12 in January and peaked at $8.72 in July before falling back to $2.55 by Aug. 25.More importantly, following the reward halving, prices remained trapped largely in a narrow range of $2.5 to $5.5 before picking a strong bid in April 2017.If history is a guide, then LTC may trade in a sideways manner post next week’s reward halving, unless BTC makes a move toward the record high of $20,000.The mining profitability will likely drop by 50 percent along with block rewards, as mining difficulty – a measure of how hard it is to maintain and add to the blockchain – seldom adjusts immediately. So, some miners may shift to other blockchains, leading to a drop in the hashrate.The computing power, however, may tick higher over the coming months, as the drop in the inflation rate to 4 percent from the current 8.4 percent per year will likely bode well for LTC’s price. That would compensate for the slide in the mining profitability.It is worth noting that the hashrate had dropped by 15 percent around the previous halving before rebounding in the next two weeks, according to Binance Research.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Litecoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"

The resulting crackdown could force the closure of 201 listed startups, according to national media.","The law, passed in 2018 but only recently enforced, targets crowdfunding and electronic payments services. Over 57% of them are currently battling against time to obtain permission to do business from the National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV).One of the biggest barriers for entrepreneurs are the high costs required for compliance, which can reach well over $35,000. The law also demands businesses to have a minimum annual profit of $100,000, some thing few startups can achieve.The entrepreneurs are also subject to a cryptocurrency ban. A recent version of the regulation banned fintechs from exchanging, transmitting, and holding crypto.Mexico’s regulators’ initial attempts at managing cryptocurrencies have changed drastically since it began the regulation process, according to Josu San Martin, Ex-Director at the Secretary of Finance and Former Director of Fintech México.“The bar was set too high. At first they were aiming for an open, inclusive regulation. At the end, the law came out very restrictive, especially for cryptocurrencies to the point where an exchange can’t work under the Mexican law,” San Martin said.At the same time, the high costs of regulation pushed entrepreneurs to raise funds quickly, with many of them resorting to ICOs, according to Alberto Navarro, CCO of Lumit, a blockchain consultant.“Usually the first thing they ask us for is to create a cryptocurrency to raise funds with, which comes with a very high legal risk,” Contreras said.Nonetheless, bitcoin adoption isn’t slowing down. Bitso, Mexico’s biggest exchange, became the first to obtain a license to operate in the country and now works with nearly 700,000 bitcoin customers.According to Pablo Gonzalez, Bitso Chairman and Co-Founder, the popularity of cryptocurrencies stems from the general distrust of banks in Mexico, making his service a necessity.“Here we have more people using cryptocurrencies than equities. I think that’s why a Fintech Law was created in the first place,” Gonzalez said."

I think they will only go back a couple of years, two or three years,” said one industry insider.The source pointed out that it would be very difficult to provide ten years’ worth of information for any platform, adding:“If they [HMRC] do only go back two or three years, I think the interesting thing here is, that the individuals who went into crypto very early on in 2012-13 will not be affected. The ones who probably made the largest gains won’t be affected, it will be the people who came in around the time crypto peaked.”In response to a Freedom of Information (FOI) Request submitted by CoinDesk, HMRC said it was withholding details about its demands for information since disclosing them could jeopardize the assessment or collection of tax.But the agency confirmed such demands are within its remit, saying:“These exchanges can retain information on their clients and the transactions that they have completed. These transactions may result in potential tax charges and HMRC has the power to issue notices requiring exchanges to provide this information.”HMRC’s move is following a pattern set by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other governments.Last month, the IRS began sending warning letters to over 10,000 Americans who it says participated in virtual currency transactions but did not report them properly.In the past, Coinbase has fought against what is known as a “John Doe” summons; an attempt by government agencies to gather hitherto unknown customer information, including taxpayer ID, name, birth date, address, and historical transaction records.In December 2016, the Internal Revenue Service issued the summons demanding that Coinbase produce a wide range of records relating to approximately 500,000 exchange customers. In a partial victory for the company, a court order compelled it to produce records for only 13,000.U.K. pound image via Shutterstock"

inspired when he learned about bitcoin from the news in 2017.","Aug 4, 2019 at 09:00 UTC","Jemima Joseph, 18, is working a summer job as a social media manager for a crypto startup after graduating from high school in the Bronx. And she learned how to make her first cryptocurrency transaction, a purchase using zcash, with the Flexa mobile app. ","It was a summer day, so hot the air outside felt like soup, when Joseph joined 10 other teenagers inside the BXL Business Incubator in a ragged neighborhood in the South Bronx. Their former high school English teacher, Carlos Acevedo, arranged for representatives from the Electric Coin Company, Messari, Gemini, Flexa and Casa to teach a two-day workshop for local students interested in cryptocurrency. Sitting near Joseph during the lecture is Emmanuel Ntiamoab, 18, soon to be a computer science student at the University of Buffalo. “We, as students in the South Bronx, don’t often get the opportunity to be a part of something bigger,” said Ntiamoab. “So if this cryptocurrency is really like the internet, I want to learn how to be a part of it. I’m interested in development.” Many of these students hail from immigrant communities, Ghanian, Jamaican, Nigerian, and Dominican, plus, even among the American students there are several Puerto Ricans. Most of them work after school to help support their families. They’re familiar with cross-border payments within underbanked communities. What they don’t know are the different tools available today. “There’s a large population of unbanked and underbanked people right here,” Acevedo told CoinDesk. “They pay predatory fees. … There are fewer bank branches in the Bronx than any other borough.”It’s true. The streets outside are full of places to get cash loans and sell jewelry and send payments abroad, all with brightly colored signs, and their correspondingly loud fees. Electric Coin Company VP of Marketing Josh Swihart told CoinDesk each student got a small zcash allowance for completing the workshop. “I’d love to see this replicated in other cities,” Swihart told CoinDesk. “We’ve already been asked about Oakland.” Although Joseph already has a summer job in the industry, several other students were interested in finding internships or staying after for the entrepreneurship coaching by the BXL Business Incubator. They’ve now joined dozens of teenagers around the world who told CoinDesk about their plans to join the cryptocurrency industry, starting by using crypto assets to further their own education.That’s what Toronto-based developer Anish Agnihotri, 16, told CoinDesk keeps him engaged in open-source projects since he first learned about bitcoin in 2015. “I like that anyone, anywhere, can connect with a community of builders that is so welcoming,” Agnihotri said. “I’ve worked with people from Africa, Mexico, China, through things like Gitcoin.”Fellow Toronto-native Talha Atta, 17, told CoinDesk he was immediately inspired when he learned about bitcoin from the news in 2017. “Remittances, being able to move money abroad without any fees, would really help my family in Pakistan,” Atta said. “I just want to find the right technology to solve problems and reduce inequality.” He’s already started experimenting with such use cases. Earlier this year, Atta won a hackathon with some friends by making an IOTA-fueled micropayments system for people who don’t have WiFi to tap into other people’s connections. Whether they are starting their own companies, studying computer science, doing internships, contributing to open source projects on GitHub or helping educate their peers, here are 10 more teens to watch as they rise through the crypto ecosystem:  Few bitcoiners hustle as hard as the 17-year-old founder of BlockXAfrica. The Ghana-based Akyaw runs educational meetups through an email newsletter and Telegram group with nearly 300 subscribers, plus 16 teen volunteers who help organize meetups.“We are working on content in local languages and our English content is always based on local examples and things relevant to the average Ghanaian,” he said. Akyaw is ramping up BlockXAfrica’s programming this year, with plans for a hackathon, a developer training program, and an online course by 2020. He said the developer training will focus on apps for using cryptocurrency that leverage interfaces the local community is already familiar with. “People in Africa are more familiar with sending money through mobile phone numbers than email addresses,” he said. Eventually, his goal is to turn BlockXAfrica into a monetized business, with paid trainings and exclusive content. Until then, the group is focused on spreading high-quality information and combating the myth that all cryptocurrencies are “a scam,” he said. “Most of [the participants] are teenagers because I started by speaking to my friends,” Akyaw added. By the age of 16, this entrepreneur from Saharanpur in northern India already sold her Crypto Price Tracker mobile app, which monitors 1,000 cryptocurrencies across 20 exchanges in 10 languages, to Redwood City Ventures. The iOS app maps bitcoin’s price in 32 different fiat currencies. Its global, user-friendly focus earned her the “Woman of the Year” award at a CryptoChicks conference in Toronto in April. Despite an onslaught of death threats and cyberbullying, Arora continues to work with Redwood City Ventures to further develop the product, which has been downloaded by more than 25,000 people so far. Instead of letting the trolls get her down, Arora used her earnings to buy textbooks and apply for a O-1A visa to stay and work in the U.S. She has since relocated to San Francisco and hopes to stay to work in the cryptocurrency industry. Now her second app, Cryptos Stickers, offers over 50 iMessage stickers related to various crypto memes.Over in London, node wizard Anand Patel has helped at least 10 people set up their own personal nodes for various cryptocurrencies, in addition to roughly 100 people using his scripts to run nodes. “For bitcoin, I have a lightning node testing their Layer 2 solution,” Patel told CoinDesk. “I wanted to have more of an impact on the new technology so I’d help different communities by creating install scripts to simplify the process for new users trying to set up miners and full nodes.” Since he first discovered bitcoin four years ago, Patel graduated from the blockchain workshop led by Bitcoin Core contributor Jimmy Song and helped secure networks for proof-of-stake crypto projects such as PIVX, Chaincoin, OXY and Rise. “I had the basic skills so I thought I’d just experiment, see what’s being done, run different people’s software and learn the process,” he said, adding that he is inspired to help facilitate “a new generation of entrepreneurs that value liberty and co-creation through decentralization.”Meanwhile in the U.S. state of Washington, a 15-year-old figure skater is starting research to build a blockchain application for local fruit growers and sellers. Pichini’s interest in distributed databases started while working with her dad to build a community registry of ice skating competitions and opportunities. Plus, she started trading bitcoin with her parents as a learning exercise. After attending Song’s bitcoin seminar, Pichini noticed all the farmers and packing plants in her town shipping cherries and apples across the country. “Especially here in Washington, there are a lot of people who are mining [bitcoin],” she told CoinDesk. “I think that [bitcoin] could actually be used as payment, especially in the wholesale industry. … I think I’d want to start my own company and have blockchain be a part of it.”Minneapolis native Lim bought his first bitcoin in 2016, after hearing about it from friends at school, and quickly became a regular at local bitcoin meetups.When Lim’s mother experienced severe health problems after several strokes, he pondered how to apply knowledge of the bitcoin ethos to the healthcare industry.“In general, what I want to do is to be on the cutting-edge of blockchain technology in the healthcare space,” Lim told CoinDesk. “Putting myself out there was the best thing I could have done, instead of just reading books but also meeting people who have experience in this space.”Lim went on to win a Startup Weekend Minneapolis hackathon in 2017 with a Hyperledger-based blockchain solution called BlocVac, which allows patients to keep and share their own immunization records. Since then, Lim has presented his blockchain experiments at universities like MIT and community events with Techstars.“I see myself primarily as an entrepreneur,” Lim said, “making it commonplace for people to be using applications on top of [the blockchain].”This Londoner made a name for himself in March 2018 by discovering a flaw in the Ledger hardware wallet. His blog post about the vulnerability propelled him to Twitter fame, with some conspiracy theorists suggesting the teen hacker worked for the rival startup Trezor. In reality, Rashid has contributed code to Trezor’s firmware to enhance security, although he’s not officially involved with the company, and occasionally submits contributions to open source projects such as Bitcoin Core and zcash. “When you look back on history, or even current world affairs in less fortunate places in the world, you can see where something like bitcoin could be applied to really improve people’s lives,” Rashid told CoinDesk.His goal is to help improve “the security and usability of private key management” across the cryptocurrency ecosystem. For now, Rashid prefers to study and experiment on his own rather than join a startup or launch his own venture. “I would like to study proposals for privacy improvements, such as the zero-knowledge proofs used in zcash,” he said. Over in Israel, 18-year-old Sack created his own freelance job teaching developers about smart contracts and writing blockchain research reports for startups. So far, eight developers have taken his ethereum course, customized for each client. He developed the base curriculum while teaching himself how to deploy ethereum code in early 2017.“You get to meet a lot of interesting people,” Sack told CoinDesk, speaking of both the ethereum and bitcoin communities. “These issues actually matter. This is the internet disrupting something that is very inherent: money, programmable money. It makes me want to put my time in it, because there’s a lot to do here.”Several of the 25 students who attended Sack’s lectures at Tel Aviv University are now working on their own open source applications. One such student even went on to participate in the winning team of the Tel Aviv Bitcoin Embassy’s 2018 hackathon with a project related to the lightning network, a scaling solution for bitcoin.Since then, he has also contributed to Andreas Antonopoulos’s GitHub resources for ethereum developers and made a lightning wallet as an experiment.  “We had a great time. It really helped me with my research,” Sacks said of the wallet, which he developed with friends at a Tel Aviv hackathon. He hopes to continue freelancing in the industry, and contributing to the open source projects that fascinate him. DAOstack developer Kaufman, 18, started contributing to open source ethereum projects in January 2018, after two years of researching the space.“I also love the community and the openness of the platform,” Kaufman told CoinDesk. “I already suggested an EIP [ethereum improvement proposal].”Kaufman dropped out of his freshman year of high school to start working full-time as a freelance mobile app developer at Tel Avivian startups. But it became a hassle for the prodigy’s parents to get him banking services. “As a teenager, I have a lot of problems with banks,” Kaufman said. “The concept of bitcoin giving me control over my own financial assets inspires me a lot.” In addition to leading ethereum workshops for over 100 students at coding school Le Wagon in Tel Aviv, Kaufman is currently researching the lightning network. “I’m really interested in how the Lightning network can bring bitcoin to more mainstream adoption,” he said. “I’m currently trying to see how I can build something for that purpose.” When Ramos graduated from high school in 2018, he promptly launched his second startup Shasta, a blockchain energy marketplace. The idea came to this Spanish entrepreneur because his first startup, Sharge, which earned him a place on the Forbes 30 under 30 in the European tech sector list, couldn’t get off the ground when it faced regulatory issues related to electric cars and energy sharing. Ramos first heard about cryptocurrency in 2015 at Tim Draper’s coworking space in Silicon Valley. In 2018, a five-person team helped Ramos launch the ethereum-based project Shasta with a solar-powered pilot in a small Spanish village. Ramos said nearly 2,000 people have used the testnet so far. “It’s a platform that lets consumers and providers connect in a DAO [decentralized autonomous organization],” Ramos told CoinDesk. “You can manage all the payments and receipts, all the things going on in this marketplace. … If we think it makes sense to make a utility token in this program, if it really makes sense, then we will do it. If not, we will raise money from traditional investors.”Computer science student Gerald Nash, 19, has already interned at Coinbase and led several programs at the Howard University Blockchain Lab. “A lot of students around me have randomly had their Venmo or PayPal accounts shut down or frozen even if there’s nothing suspicious,” Nash told CoinDesk. “The big thing that inspired me the most is the idea of monetary sovereignty.”Nash first learned about bitcoin on Reddit in 2013, when he was still in high school in Atlanta, Georgia. Now he runs campus events to teach students how to manage noncustodial bitcoin wallets with private keys, the alphanumeric strings that act as passwords.“I mostly follow bitcoin and ethereum as two of my favorite projects,” he said. “I think over the next five years [crypto] will provide more technical users with greater financial inclusion. … People will have greater access to moving and growing their money.”Image of teen bitcoiners in Ghana (including Elisha Owusu Akyaw, second from left) via BlockXAfrica"

Srinivasan, former Andreessen Horowitz partner, founder of Earn.com and former chief technology officer of Coinbase.The current site says, “Nakamoto is bitcoin country. HODL or GTFO.”As of now, potential users can only enter their email address and await more information. Srinivasan never directly responded to multiple attempts to confirm he was running the site, but in a recent tweet he recommended a go-to-market strategy similar to the one the site appears to be using:Another approach (recommended if feasible) is to soft launch first.Put up the site/app, don’t make a big fuss about it, start gaining customers by individually emailing & signing them up.Your first “launch” is then the announcement of a concrete traction milestone.— Balaji S. Srinivasan (@balajis) August 1, 2019Srinivasan led one of the best-funded early bitcoin companies, 21e6, which rebranded as 21 Inc and then again as Earn.com.The original idea was to make home bitcoin miners for regular people. By March 2015, it had raised $116 million, but the idea met major headwinds as the realities of the bitcoin mining market became clearer. Later in 2015, 21 Inc was found looking for a way to pivot out of a straightforward mining hardware play.Eventually, the company would take a major leap. In May 2017, it would open its bitcoin-powered email service to the public, allowing users to set up an account where correspondents would pay to get a reply in bitcoin. Later that year, it would change its name to Earn.com to better reflect the new mission.Earn was then purchased by Coinbase in early 2018, a move many saw as an expensive acquisition of Srinivasan as much as it was an acquisition of the company itself. Nevertheless, Earn has evolved to take a prominent place in Coinbase’s offerings, allowing assets listed by the exchange to make a bigger splash by allowing interested users to earn some crypto in exchange for going through educational modules about various tokens.Srinivasan announced he was leaving Coinbase in May. An investigation by The Information found that Srinivasan’s departure followed a tense year of internal debate inside the company. In short, now-former president and COO Asiff Hirji represented traditional finance aspirations; Srinivasan, in the CTO role, represented crypto’s more rebellious ethos.Now Srinivasan’s next chapter may be Nakamoto.com.While little is known of its future plans, the site’s past is well documented. First registered in 1997, a quick scan of the Internet Archive shows the website belonged to a technologist who shares the last name of the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin. (CoinDesk’s requests for comment to the former owner were not returned.)Records show a transfer was made in July 2018, however. The information on the current owner is masked by a proxy, Whois Privacy Protection Service, Inc.The new site is sparse, yet very crypto. It’s not yet clear exactly what it’s been repurposed to do.CoinDesk will update this piece as more information becomes available.Balaji Srinivasan image via CoinDesk archives"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Aug 2, 2019 at 09:27 UTC",Retail giant Walmart has applied for a cryptocurrency patent that bears some similarities to the Libra token proposed by Facebook in mid-June.,"In its application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Walmart touts the concept of a digital currency “tied to a regular currency” – that is, what’s commonly known as a stablecoin. Libra will be a token pegged to a basket of fiat currencies and government bonds, according to Facebook.Over and above that, the filing suggests that the proposed coin could help provide finance for those with limited access to banking services – one of the major claims Facebook has made for Libra, most likely in an effort to appeal to the public (and regulators) over the token.“Using a digital currency, low-income households that find banking expensive, may have an alternative way to handle wealth at an institution that can supply the majority of their day-to-day financial and product needs,” Walmart states.Facebook’s offering is expected to create a system whereby its social media platforms could use Libra for payments, allowing advertisers to earn Libra and pay Facebook in the token for ads. Although it could also be used more widely in time in remittances and other use cases.Walmart’s filing, too, indicates its coin could have features that apply to a token being used within the ecosystem of a high-street retail company:“The digital currency may be pegged to the US dollar and available for use only at selected retailors or partners. In other embodiments, the digital currency is available for use anywhere. The digital currency can provide a fee-free, or fee-minimal place to store wealth that can be spent, for example, at retailers and, if needed, easily converted to cash.”A notable difference is that users of a “Walmart Coin” could “even earn interest,” the application suggests. With Libra, interest earned on the scheme’s potentially vast reserve funds would go to Libra partners that back the company to the tune of around $10 million.More closely applying to a commerce giant, though, Walmart says its token could store user’s purchasing histories on the blockchain, and then apply related savings to their subsequent purchases in a similar way to loyalty points.Other novel features suggested in the very broad filing include the ability to remove the need for credit cards, and acting as a “pre-approved biometric (e.g., fingerprint or eye pattern) credit.”“A person is the ‘credit card’ to their own digital value bank,” the firm says.The token could also be used to restrict what product categories can be bought and by whom, for example blocking minors from purchasing cigarettes, alcohol, or an R-rated DVD.Walmart is already using blockchain for tracking products like fresh greens and pharmaceuticals. It’s also has been investigating various use cases of the technology, with projects including connecting automated delivery drones. In June, Walmart China launched a live scheme aimed to improve the nation’s poor food safety record.It also has a host of other patents applied for, including some relating to tracking packages, power supply payments and delivery fleets.Walmart image via Shutterstock"

Ted Budd (R) on July 25. In what Budd calls a national security issue, the bill would effectively end the double taxation on cryptocurrency transactions by amending 1986’s Internal Revenue Code.Under the 1986 Code, gains and losses in transactions of real property of like-kind remain unrecognized. As Rep. Budd stated before an introduction of the bill in June, the code places a 40 percent tax rate on transactions. Budd says tax concerns and transaction record-keeping act as a deterrent to adoption.“The use of digital assets is already treated as a sale of the asset, even though the economic reality of the transaction is a purchase of a simple consumer good,” Budd said.If passed, the act would free cryptocurrency transactions from double taxation and record-keeping immediately.Budd’s newest bill adds to other cryptocurrency legislation before Congress. In early July, Rep. Tom Emmer (MN-R) reintroduced the “Safe Harbor for Tax Payers with Forked Assets Act of 2019.” Emmer says the bill will bring clarity on taxable events following cryptocurrency forks and airdrops.Rep. Budd’s legislation joins fellow North Carolina Representative Patrick Henry’s enthusiasm for cryptocurrency, particularly bitcoin. “I think there’s no capacity to kill Bitcoin,” Henry said speaking in preparation for Facebook’s Libra hearings prior to the U.S. House and Senate Committees,“My point is: you can’t kill Bitcoin,” he said.Image via budd.house.gov"

Mining centres must also not be sited within a 30-kilometer (approximately 19-mile) range of all towns except the capital Tehran and major city of Esfahan where tougher restrictions will be applied, the report says.Regarding devices used for mining, crypto miners must observe rules laid out by Iran’s standardization and communications authorities.Mining firms also face fees on the energy used as part of the mining process, and will be charged for electricity, or natural gas that can be used to generate electricity, at the same prices as energy exports from the country, the bill reportedly says.Miners will be taxed at the same level as industrial manufacturing firms, with exemptions for firms exporting mined cryptocurrencies and returning the revenue back to Iran’s economy.The bill also notably lifts the illegal status of cryptocurrencies in Iran, although it stresses that trades made with cryptocurrencies in the nation are not recognized as lawful.Further, cryptos will not be recognized as legal tender and the Iranian central bank will not guarantee their value.The move has been prompted by Iran’s increasing popularity with crypto miners due to its cheap power.

Commissions can be high and accurate information difficult to obtain. With a P2P service, individual owners of stock should be able to easily and cheaply lend their shares directly to others, earning a fee in the process. Individual short sellers will potentially be able to borrow stock from willing counterparties without having to pay exorbitant fees to large institutions.Shinhan Financial Investment, which is a brokerage related to the country’s second largest banking group by assets, is developing the capability in cooperation with Directional, a Korean company that has been permitted by the Financial Service Commission (FSC) to provide stock lending and borrowing as part of the government’s sandbox initiative. Sandboxes, which are being aggressively pushed by the current administration, allow for a temporary lifting of regulations for the testing of innovative technologies and services.Directional received its exception in May under a financial market sandbox program announced by the FSC in April. No timeframe has been reported for the roll out of the Shinhan offering.Shinhan Bank has been aggressive in its pursuit of blockchain solutions. Two years ago, it started using the technology for the verification of gold bars. Since then, it has utilized it for interest rate swaps and and cross border remittances. In May this year, it was reported that the bank would use the technology for loan verification, enabling customers to electronically submit documents that previously had to be presented on paper, and often in person, and authenticated manually.Like most commercial banks in Korea, Shinhan has been more enthusiastic about blockchain than pure crypto, tracking the official government stance but running counter to customer appetite for coins.The bank was for a while more positive on crypto and accepted deposits from cryptoexchanges and exchange customers rejected by other banks. But in light of increased scrutiny by the authorities from 2018, and in light of new FATF standards, the bank has upped its surveillance of crypto-connected accounts and is instituting systems and procedures to enforce real-name account requirements and adhere to Know-Your-Customer best practices.Like other banks, it is currently renegotiating its cryptoexchange deposit agreements. While an extension of its contract with Korbit, the local exchange it serves, is expected, nothing is guaranteed given concerns about possible fraud.Image via Shutterstock."

SpankPay charges a fee of 0.5 percent per transaction, which compares favorably with the charges for credit card use of up to 3 percent in the non-porn world. Soleimani said that card companies will charge adult sites up to 10 percent, however.In recent years, many adult services have had problems receiving payments via credit cards, banks and payment services, with accounts being denied or closed.SpankPay launches with two partners that have already integrated the solution: Skype-based webcam service SkyPrivate and fan-focused adult platform JustFor.Fans.Dominic Ford, creator of JustFor.Fans, said:“We are excited to offer cryptocurrency payment options to our subscribers. Using SpankChain, we don’t have to worry about being shut down due to the fact we are an adult company.

Dubbed “Access Mining,” Carbon Black researchers Greg Foss and Marian Liang say the 2018 botnet campaign has been collecting secret data for the past two years, making millions in the process.According to reports at the time, 500,000 machines were trojanized with a monero cryotojacking mining protocol, XMRig, collecting 8,900 monero.  Most infected machines resided in Russia, Eastern Europe, and Asian Pacific.Unbeknownst at the time, the 500,000 computers were not only hacked with the ghost protocol but also data collection software. A patchwork of programs taken from open-source code on GitHub like Eternal Blue and Mimikatz implemented on XMRig helped the hackers innovate, the report states.The hackers turned the security data into a secondary source of income. With one infected machine selling for an average of $6.75 on dark web markets, the 500,000 haul is worth $1.69 million. Infected machines can even be rented for 24 to 48 hours as a source of passive income for hackers. Depending on the machine’s location and owner, machine values can skyrocket.At $90 per monero coin, the group’s assets sit near $3.29 million Carbon Black says.Foss and Liang say Access Mining is more than likely the result of dropping monero prices following the 2018 bear market.

Since its founding, the startup has extended more than $700 million in crypto-collateralized loans to over 200,000 clients. Now, the loans can be used to make purchases at merchants that accept MasterCard, through a co-branding.After swiping, an oracle confirms the user has enough collateral to cover the purchase, instantaneously executes a loan, and settles the transaction in fiat. Trenchev claims the card’s issuer is licensed within the European Economic Area.Through additional partnerships with intermediaries, Nexo aims to expand to the U.S. and Asia by the end of the year.The cards are available independent of a client’s credit history, as the staked collateral reduces default risk. Likewise, interest rates are set between 8 and 24 percent APR based on the loan structure and local regulations.Users can repay their loans in either crypto or fiat, though using Nexo’s token will reduce interest rates to 8 percent. Additionally, minimum payments will be eliminated if the value of bitcoin increases. This is because the credit line is “dynamic,” meaning as the value a client’s collateralized assets increases relative to the market, their fiat debts decrease.In fact, crypto entrepreneur Brock Pierce mortgaged a house in Amsterdam through a $1.2 million line of credit through Nexo, and hasn’t made a single repayment due to the rising value of bitcoin since he took the loan, Trenchev said.Conversely, if cryptocurrencies crash, users will either have to “deposit more crypto, pay a part of their loan to reduce exposure, or sell a portion of their collateral to restore the loan-to-value ratio,” Trenchev said.The company complies with know-your-customer ustomer protocol, follows international sanctions, and has integrated with blockchain investigators Chainalysis to check if collateralized crypto has been ill-gotten, it says.Nexo has previously paid out dividends of 30 percent on $3 million of profit made during its first 7 months in operation to token holders.Nexo crypto card photo courtesy of Nexo"

State regulators believe Alta’s dollar-pegged-stablecoin and payment network provide such an alternative in addition to a healthy candidate for fintech development.In a statement, co-founder and CEO of Alta Jesse Forrest pointed out the specificity of the product due to legal considerations:“We help solve the banking challenges facing medical marijuana companies and their vendors. ALTA uses blockchain and geofencing technology to protect clients’ digital payments and transfers. Other digital payment companies require a bank account. We provide all the financial services medical marijuana companies need without requiring a bank account.”Alta’s stablecoin can be purchased via its platform. By purchasing ALTA coins, marijuana tainted transactions become legal sales providing an off-ramp for profits. The startup offers cash pickups in armoured vehicles with instant transfers into dollars available.State Representative Jeff Weninger and creator of the fintech program welcomed Alta to the program, noting the “huge potential for stablecoin technology in cash-intensive businesses.”The state backing of Alta adds to a mixed bag for the Grand Canyon state, as legislators failed to pass a cryptocurrency tax bill last May.

As our clients increasingly look to technology to address the challenges of today’s global trade environment, we are extremely optimistic and excited about the potential opportunities that Voltron brings to the industry with its demonstrated benefits in improved speed and reduced risks of settlement, as well as its flexibility in connecting banks, businesses and other third-party providers in its network.”Sending the documents electronically over the blockchain platform meant that all participants in the trade were able to view real-time data as the transaction progressed. This, Standard Chartered said, allowed a “significant reduction” in the time needed to complete the trade, which took less than 12 hours.Oil companies often utilize letters of credit for short-term trade finance, but the process is largely manual and paper-based, taking up to five days for the documents to be delivered.The use of blockchain also brings the oil industry participants of the Voltron platform greater transparency and cost efficiencies across the supply chain, the company added.Voltron is an open-industry blockchain platform set up to “digitally create, exchange, approve and issue Letters of Credits.”Jordane Rollin, Standard Chartered’s global head of digital transformation for trade product management added that as Voltron moves towards a commercial launch, “we are continuously getting feedback from our clients via pilots to enhance Voltron with new features.

Getting a new supplier on-boarded quickly, particularly when there are new capabilities coming up every day, is critical to how rapidly you introduce new products and services.”Renee Ure, chief supply chain officer for Lenovo’s data center group, echoed this in a statement, saying, “Through Trust Your Supplier, both buyers and suppliers will see the procurement benefits of blockchain through reductions in cost, complexity and speed.”Stepping back, enterprise blockchain projects have a reputation for moving forward at a glacial pace, plodding from proof-of-concept to pilot and finally (if you’re lucky) to live production.However, in this case, IBM has emerged with a fully formed live production blockchain.Big Blue started work on the project internally with its own procurement division and is using the blockchain to manage 4,000 of its own 18,500 suppliers. IBM said it expects to see a 70–80 percent reduction in the cycle time to onboard new suppliers, with a potential 50 percent reduction in administrative costs within its own business.TYS is currently limited to the existing participants, with plans for commercial availability in Q3 of this year. Wieck said that, for now, its footprint is confined to North America, but the intention is for a global network.A key innovation at the heart of TYS is a “digital passport” for supplier identity.One of IBM’s early blockchain partners, Chainyard, which also builds on Hyperledger Fabric, helped design this aspect of the project. Third-party validators such as Dun & Bradstreet, Ecovadis and RapidRatings provide outside verification or audit capabilities for suppliers via the passport.Wieck said the digital passport is specifically tailored to TYS, but like most things IBM does, it has been created with pluggable open interfaces in mind.As such, some facets of TYS could also be applicable to TradeLens, IBM’s shipping cargo blockchain ecosystem launched with Maersk back in 2018. Wieck said there are a number of document-sharing use cases that could be extended with the TYS supplier network.She said TradeLens, for example, is working on optimizing invoice settlement, factoring and invoice dispute resolution.Wieck explained:“We have been talking about the notion of interoperability between blockchain networks – the idea of a network of networks which can expand these economies.”Marie Wieck General Manager, IBM Blockchain IBM Corporation via CoinDesk archives"

told ...","Aug 1, 2019 at 02:05 UTC","A team of former Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) engineers is bringing trading and settlement of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, to a private blockchain network originally developed for enterprise.  ","Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, London-based LAB577, led by ex-RBS innovation lead Richard Crook, is rolling out its first platform offering, the Digital Asset Shared Ledger (DASL, pronounced “dazzle”). DASL is built on top of the Corda Network, the open-source blockchain system created by R3, a bank consortium that once personified the “blockchain, not bitcoin” ethos of 2015-2016.As such, it’s a sign of how much the industry has evolved that DASL will be used to facilitate the trading of bitcoin, ether, and the like. Crook told CoinDesk:“Crypto is clearly converging with blockchain. We spent quite a lot of time in 2015 separating the two, to make sure we could have a conversation about blockchain, and now here we are converging the two back.”LAB577 is working with prime brokerage BCB, which will park its clients’ assets, both fiat and crypto, with custodians; mirrored representations of these assets will trade on Corda, in a process known in blockchain parlance as layer 2 settlement. (A similar arrangement is in the works to bring ethereum tokens onto the architecture R3 is building for Swiss stock exchange SIX.)In this way, investors will be able to conduct both legs of a trade, whether fiat-to-crypto or crypto-to-crypto, on the same system, and have them settle instantly and simultaneously, instead of waiting days for a bank transfer, or minutes (sometimes hours) for a public blockchain confirmation. BCB says it has a pipeline of clients to bring to Corda via DASL including a couple of big banks. Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, BCB’s founder and CEO, said his firm is already live with a couple of beta clients, settling ethereum and British pounds bilaterally in a kind of closed environment. “It is live in the sense that it’s using the live Corda network and live Corda nodes, but not yet a released product out in the wild,” he told CoinDesk. (Crook said BCB will be migrating from its old tech stack over the coming months.)Apart from speed, Crook said plugging a crypto prime brokerage into the Corda Network (the free, open-source version of R3’s tech) makes sense because you have to be a known legal entity to operate on that network.In other words, banks and financial institutions can rest assured they are meeting things like anti-money-laundering and sanctions compliance.“DASL wants to assist those regulated financial institutions to be able to deal with digital assets,” said Crook. “It could be something they want to issue themselves like debt or equity. It could be cash. And some of them do want to handle crypto.”For prime brokerages, a core challenge of crypto is negotiating a host of network structures, wallets, proprietary blockchain protocols and so on. Similarly, on the fiat side, a unified settlement layer is lacking, said Landsberg-Sadie. The U.K. has a leg up with its Faster Payments system, he added, but firms still have to deal with a mishmash of payments systems in different jurisdictions. Landsberg-Sadie pointed to certain operational challenges around storing and moving crypto safely, and also accounting for it in a unified way, adding:“What we have always been on the lookout for is something which is a credible institutional bridge and a kind of settlements layer for cash and for crypto.”  To be fair, similar sorts of off-chain settlement arrangements have been created recently. These include tie-ups between custodians and trading firms (BitGo with Genesis Trading; Kingdom Trust and OTCXN) and networks built by crypto-friendly financial institutions for their clients to trade with each other (Silvergate Bank; Signature Bank; and Prime Trust).In the DASL solution, BCB parks crypto in cold, or offline, storage with Volt, a crypto custodian which works with insurance broker Aon. The equivalent in the fiat world is physical bank accounts, which in the case of British pounds will be BCB’s banking partner, ClearBank, said Landsberg-Sadie.Using Corda as a settlement layer also addresses the scaling problem which has dogged the cryptocurrency industry for years, added Landsberg-Sadie. Two counterparties exchanging a bunch of litecoin, for example, would be unaffected by the transaction time of the public blockchain to settle. “You don’t need to move the physical litecoin out of its cold storage, you can just represent these as ledger entries on Corda,” Landsberg-Sadie said.Stepping back, settling the fiat side of trades on a blockchain instantly with cash on the ledger is an alluring proposition well beyond the crypto markets. A lot of work is being done to bring digital fiat to distributed ledgers, with projects like Utility Settlement Coin drawing a lot of attention. Crook, whose team started the work of building bridges between public and private blockchains while at RBS with projects like Cordite, said the likes of BCB and also SDX coming on Corda creates a rising tide which will also lift pure enterprise plays being built on the network.   “In the case of trade finance, you want to have stores of value on-chain which the Marco Polos and the TradeIXs of the world can use,” he said, referring to a Corda-based trade finance consortium. “So you can get the goods and services to flow one way across the ledger and the payment for those goods and services to flow the other way on the same ledger.”Ether image via Shutterstock"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Aug 6, 2019 at 09:41 UTC",Data protection chiefs from across the globe have united to express concerns over the privacy risks posed by Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency project.,"In a joint statement published on Monday by the U.K. Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), data privacy commissioners from Australia, Albania, Burkina Faso, Canada, the EU, the U.K., the U.S., shared concerns that “while Facebook and [its crypto wallet-focused entity] Calibra have made broad public statements about privacy, they have failed to specifically address the information handling practices that will be in place to secure and protect personal information.”Given that Libra is on a speedy timeline for launch (planned for as soon as 2020), the watchdogs added that “we are surprised and concerned that this further detail is not yet available.”The privacy commissioners also set out a list of questions that Facebook is expected to address, including how the Libra Network will provide end users with clear information on how their data will be used by project participants and how it will ensure that default privacy setting will “not use nudge techniques or “dark patterns” to encourage people to share personal data with third parties or weaken their privacy protections.”In the extensive list of questions, the group further seeks reassurance that Facebook would use “only the minimum amount” of personal data as required for the service, and “ensure the lawfulness of the processing.”Users’ personal data must also “adequately protected” and “simple procedures” should be provided for Libra users to “exercise their privacy rights, including deleting their accounts, and honouring their requests in a timely way.”According to the joint statement, the signees were prompted to air the concerns in part because they have previously had to address events in which Facebook’s handling of users’ information “has not met the expectations of regulators, or their own users.”The statement comes as the latest call for information on the Libra project. Regulators from nations including Switzerland and Singapore have called for the social media giant to be more open about its plans for the project, while two U.S. Senate committees have hauled Facebook before hearings to discuss the various issues in more detail.Facebook, for its part, responded that it won’t have access to personal financial information gathered for its planned cryptocurrency. The company’s blockchain lead, David Marcus, however, acknowledged that third-parties would potentially be building products such as wallets for Libra.These third parties would be responsible for how their Libra wallets are built, Marcus said, saying “it will be the responsibility of these providers to determine the type of information they may require from their customers and to comply with regulations and standards in the countries in which they operate.”In the release of the joint privacy statement, U.K. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said:“I hope this statement will prompt an open and constructive conversation to ensure that data protection is a key part of the design process and that data protection regulators are a key consultative group as the Libra proposals develop.”Facebook image via Shutterstock"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Aug 7, 2019 at 01:06 UTC",The Takeaway:,"Kik said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) manipulated facts and took comments out of context in the regulator’s lawsuit against the startup over its 2017 token sale.In a 130-page filing Wednesday, Kik laid out a paragraph-by-paragraph rebuttal of the SEC’s arguments and flatly denied its core allegation that the company conducted an unregistered securities offering.CEO Ted Livingston told CoinDesk the SEC was “playing dirty” in its June complaint by trying to “simply make [Kik] look bad,” adding:“What really surprised us is just what lengths the SEC went to twist the facts. They cut quotes and [took them out of context] and that’s something we didn’t expect from the SEC.”The SEC’s complaint alleges that Toronto-based Kik offered unregistered securities in the form of kin tokens to U.S. investors in an attempt to keep the messaging platform going when revenue failed to materialize.Kik maintains that its public offering of kin was not a securities sale. In the response, Kik’s attorneys wrote that the SEC recognized its claim was weak and therefore created a “highly selective and misleading” picture of the circumstances of the sale.The plaintiffs and defendants have met with a judge in the U.S. Court for the Southern District of New York to work out a timeline for going to trial, Livingston said. Kik has asked for a May 2020 trial date, while the SEC has reportedly asked for a date later in the year.“We wanted this to be resolved as fast as possible,” he said. The judge did not pick a trial date, but, apparently chose Kik’s timetable on discovery, which will conclude by November 2019. Livingston added:“We’re very confident in our case.”The SEC’s complaint included a number of quotes from Kik board members and executives purporting to show that the company needed to conduct a token sale as a potential securities offering.The most seemingly damning comment was from an unidentified board member, who apparently referred to the token sale as a “hail Mary,” a term for acts of desperation. However, Kik says that while the board member did write this phrase in an email, its board and executive team did not see the project as “a … final attempt to save a dying company.”Another board member, “consistent with the Board and Executive Team’s view at the time,” went so far as to write:“The more I think about it, I think this is a great idea. People call it a hail Mary but to me that is a longshot and I really do not think it is a long shot.”Livingston told CoinDesk that the quote came from a private email provided to the SEC as part of the discovery process.In its complaint, the SEC also said a consultant warned Kik that “the Kin offering was, potentially, an offering of securities that needed to be registered,” but Kik’s response says that this, too, was taken out of context.The consultant’s full remarks added that “in the case of a community currency, there is a good basis to argue that this is not a security.”A third example from the complaint indicated that Kik told its potential customers the company could ensure Kin’s success on its own, which would suggest that there was an expectation of profit from “the efforts of others,” one of the prongs of the so-called Howey test for determining whether something is a security.Kik’s response says the next line emphasized that kin’s success would depend on “how many other people can we get excited to compete with us, to join us, to work with us and to build this together.”Kik also emphasizes that it did not conduct a single sale for the Kin token, but rather two sales: a private SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) and a public token sale. The SEC conflated the two, undermining its case, the company said.The SAFT was limited to accredited investors and conducted under an SEC Regulation D filing, meaning Kik believed it fell under certain exemptions to federal registration requirements. The second round was public and saw Kin tokens being sold for ether, according to the filing.The company says it raised about $50 million in U.S. dollars during the pre-sale. Another $50 million was raised in ether from the general public, with 10,000 purchasers, roughly one-third of whom lived in the U.S., participating.“The SEC seems to be grouping [the sales together],” Livingston said. “I think what’s important in the response is to be very clear about what facts you agree with and what facts you disagree with.”Elsewhere in the filing, Kik pushes back against the idea that the token sales were a last-ditch effort to generate revenue.Kik acknowledged that it had hired an investment bank to look into potentially selling the company, but said it had already started looking into “pursuing a cryptocurrency project” before seven potential buyers declined to acquire or merge with it. Livingston had, according to the filing, been looking into a potential cryptocurrency project as far back as 2012.Moreover, while the SEC complaint claims that the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) warned Kik that kin might be a securities offering, the response claims that, as far as Kik is aware, the Canadian regulator did not make a final determination.The OSC told Kik that the Howey framework, which has been one way of assessing whether an asset is a security, might not be applicable to kin, which Kik, in turn, relayed to the SEC, according to the filing.The SEC’s actions have taken some toll on Kik, Livingston said.Among the “detrimental impacts” the lawsuit has had include the monetary cost ($6 million to date, according to Livingston), as well as the time Kik has spent compiling documents for discovery and testifying in Washington, which could instead be spent continuing to build the kin ecosystem.Kik has provided the SEC with more than 50,000 emails and 200 hours of filmed testimony as part of discovery, he said.Kin’s price has also suffered, with the token tanking the day the lawsuit was filed, falling from $0.000036 to $0.000025.The cryptocurrency’s price has continued to decline in the months since, trading around $0.000017 as of press time.Kik has long said that the outcome of its fight with the SEC – regardless of whether kin is deemed to be a security or not – will result in increased clarity over token sales and how securities laws might apply.Livingston reiterated the hope to CoinDesk, concluding:“I think this industry is less concerned about what the guidance is and more just that we have it.”Kik Response to SEC by CoinDesk on ScribdKik CEO Ted Livingston, photo by Brady Dale for CoinDesk."

This technology enables low-latency systems, including traditional matching engines or private blockchain ledgers, to be anchored into immutable public blockchain ledgers,” the company’s announcement says.The technology will allow tZERO to record trades as hashes anchored on a public blockchain, verify previous trades and keep an immutable record of the transactions on its platform, according to the announcement.The method, tZERO CEO Saum Noursalehi said, “can be used in our suite of products, as well as licensed to companies across various industries that are seeking to maintain a tamper-proof and auditable record of time-series-based data.”It can also link the settlement of tokenized securities on a public blockchain with legacy trading systems and anchor data about the resulting on-chain settlements into public blockchains, the company said.“For example, off-chain trade data and on-chain settlement data occurring on an Ethereum mainnet can be combined and anchored into the Bitcoin blockchain for added resiliency, security and transparency,” tZERO explained.TZERO, launched for trading in January, is designed as an alternative trading system (ATS), a limited version of a securities exchange to trading tokenized private equity. It started with its native equity token, tZERO Preferred (TZEROP), with ambitions to be an issuance platform for other companies that want to tokenize their securities.So far, the second token that was made available on the platform is Overstock’s own digital stock, the Digital Voting Series A-1 Preferred Stock, previously known as Blockchain Voting Series A Preferred Stock, or OSTKP — an early blockchain experiment by Overstock issued back in 2016.The platform has so far seen meager trading volumes, as only the accredited investors could register and only one token has been available to trade. However, this month, the lock-up period for TZEROP tokens (issued under Regulation D) expires, at which point retail investors will be allowed access to the asset.Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne previously told CoinDesk he expected to see a boost in trading activity on tZERO after that point.On August 8, Overstock will conduct a Q2 earnings call where the Overstock and tZERO leadership will share the company’s current state and future plans.The company has previously won a similar patent outlining how it could merge legacy trading systems with cryptocurrencies and digital asset tech.Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne image via CoinDesk archives"

The move would boost the transparency of cryptocurrency transactions, Lee said.“If an amendment to the Act on Reporting and Use of Certain Financial Transaction Information, which reflects the FATF’s international standards for cryptocurrencies, passes the National Assembly, it will be possible to prevent money laundering through cryptocurrencies,” Lee explained at a public hearing on crypto transparency at the National Assembly.Approval of the amendment would make regulations more effective “by shifting from the current indirect regulation through commercial banks to direct regulation,” Lee added.According to a Wednesday blog post from crypto compliance solution provider Argos, the amendment may also bring in the controversial “travel rule,” meaning that exchanges would have to share information on parties when making transactions. This would pose a major problem for exchanges as crypto transactions do not include identifying data, the post says.Korean National Assembly image via Shutterstock"

But when she does, she’s giving away 15 percent of her share to charity.","Breitman, one of the co-founders of the Tezos blockchain, has signed a binding commitment with Founders Pledge to donate a portion of her initial coin offering (ICO) proceeds. Tezos raised $232 million in mid-2017 in what was the largest ICO at the time. Breitman says she’s in no rush to cash out. Her eventual gifts should amount to millions of dollars, though, that depends on how Tezos and crypto perform in the next few years.“I haven’t exercised the put option for Tezos yet, but I have signed the pledge,” Breitman told CoinDesk. “I think a lot more founders in the space should consider doing this.”How lucrative the pledge may end up being is still to be determined, however.Per the terms of the Tezos fundraising documents, the Tezos Foundation has committed to acquire the company that Breitman owns in part, Dynamic Ledger Solutions (DLS), though it will not pay the full price till a full four years have passed and the Tezos blockchain has met certain performance criteria.If the acquisition had simply happened on the day the sale closed, the Breitmans would have earned approximately $17.7 million from the proceeds alone, plus roughly 68 million XTZ, which would be worth approximately $97 million at today’s prices. The Breitmans own 90 percent of DLS, Kathleen told CoinDesk.It is not known whether the contract calls for them to be paid in a percentage of the bitcoin and ether from the sale or in the spot value of those assets in dollars. As of now, Kathleen is the only member of the Breitman family that has made a commitment to Founders Pledge.Regardless, Breitman has committed to giving 15 percent of her earnings from that sale.“I also liked the idea of credible commitments, because that’s part of why blockchains are powerful,” she said.Founders Pledge aims to get as many entrepreneurs as possible to commit a part of their potential exit winnings to charitable purposes.Late last year, forecasters projected that 2019 alone could see $200 billion in initial public offerings.“We’re thrilled about Kathleen making this meaningful commitment to do good and joining the Founders Pledge community,” Founders Pledge President Matt Hunter told CoinDesk. “We’re currently working on some big things for crypto investors and entrepreneurs which we can’t talk about just yet, but we’re very excited.”Breitman tells CoinDesk she has appreciated joining the community of founders who have also taken the pledge. She likes the way fellow founders think about engaging with social change.“Obviously you start a company because you want to solve a problem,” Breitman explained. “That attitude carrying over to a charitable environment makes for really compelling conversations.”She’s still thinking about where she might put her commitment. “I don’t have to decide until I actually do it,” Breitman said. She says she volunteered at youth services non-profit Covenant House in college and she still values their work.“I [also] think there’s a lot of interesting progress going on in different disease categories,” she added.CoinDesk has also confirmed that Joey Krug, one of the key creators of Augur, now at Pantera Capital, has also signed the Founders Pledge.Krug’s commitment is a little more open-ended. He plans to give 5 percent of his next exit on whatever the next company he founds ends up being. It’s not clear what that will be or when, however. “It’s kind of just a no-brainer,” Krug told CoinDesk.As a member of the team at Pantera, he’s also helped Founders Pledge get introduced to the new startup leaders he’s backed. Kathleen noted that there’s been talk of social good efforts in crypto, but it still tends to be a bit inwardly focused.“I think a lot of the cryptocurrency stuff is more centered around making cryptocurrencies an action of charity,” Breitman said. “I think for efficacy, my personal philosophy would be like: Hey, to whom much is given, it’s better to do something more helpful in the short term”Breitman said that she wants to “target things where money can be spent more immediately and less moonshot-y stuff, since that is how I would define my day job.”Krug is following a fairly similar approach. He expects he’ll give about half of his eventual exit to known non-profits with a good track record of preventing death, disease or disability (such as the Malaria Foundation). He’ll probably also give half to some kind of neglected basic research.For example, Krug noted that every time the energy density of batteries leaps forward, it has broad ramifications for social good, but not a lot of people invest in fundamental battery research.“That kind of stuff I think is interesting to me, things that people are overlooking,” Krug said.Krug is currently the co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital.Since finishing her efforts to help the Tezos Foundation launch the blockchain, Breitman has been at work on a gaming company that will use Tezos infrastructure.Coinbase co-founder Brian Armstrong has also signed the Giving Pledge, a similar commitment but for billionaires such as Warren Buffett, MacKenzie Bezos and Pierre Omidyar.Image courtesy of Kathleen Breitman"

With CertiK, it will be focused on the security of the code, technology verification, and project information security.The moves come as crypto exchanges are the subject of heightened scrutiny in South Korea and globally. With concerns about money laundering and with FATF guidelines beginning to have an impact, banking relationships are being tested and financial institutions in Seoul are refining their KYC programs and processes.Just today, it was reported that the Korean Financial Services Commission (FSC) is planning to directly supervise the exchanges.With concerns about hacking on the rise, Korea’s Fair Trade Commission (FTC) in June called for a change in the terms and conditions of use for crypto exchanges, requiring the exchanges themselves to accept liability for any losses from theft.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Aug 1, 2019 at 20:10 UTC","Quit whining, Bitfinex.","That’s the message of the latest court filing by the New York Attorney General’s office (NYAG) in its ongoing case against the cryptocurrency exchange and affiliated stablecoin issuer Tether.Earlier this week, Bitfinex and Tether’s lawyers complained to New York State Supreme Court Judge Joel M. Cohen that the companies had spent $500,000 and tasked 60 lawyers simply with finding documents that the NYAG’s office has asked for. Part of the expense comes from the fact that the respondents use 10 different communications systems, they wrote.But in a letter to the judge Thursday, the NYAG’s attorneys scoffed at the suggestion that its demands were somehow onerous.“Whatever difficulty Respondents may claim in collecting and reviewing the communications called for in the 354 Order, the Court should take note that the 354 Order also calls for information that any responsible trading platform or venue of exchange should have at its fingertips,” wrote the lawyers, John Castiglione, Johanna Skrzypczyk and Brian Whitehurst.The information the NYAG’s office is looking for includes tether issuance and redemptions, its current corporate, trading and client accounts, tax filings, and information about any customers who wanted to withdraw cash from Bitfinex.The letter added:“The 354 Order also directs production of documentation of the so-called ‘line of credit’ transaction, all of which was ostensibly generated while Respondents were under subpoena by the OAG, and therefore should be preserved and in reasonable order. There is nothing difficult, or costly, about producing that information.”Given the expected ease of producing the documents, Thursday’s filing asked Judge Cohen to dismiss a stay of proceedings requested by Bitfinex and Tether. The NYAG lawyers argued that the companies would have to turn over documents even if an order filed under section 354 of the Martin Act was permanently stayed by the court.The NYAG is investigating a concern that Bitfinex covered up the loss of $850 million held by a payments processor by borrowing funds from Tether’s stablecoin reserves. The latter company extended a $900 million line of credit to Bitfinex, which borrowed $700 million before an injunction froze further transfers.The New York investigators are looking for more information about the deal, and are awaiting a ruling by Judge Cohen after a hearing on Monday.A ruling in Bitfinex and Tether’s favor would not help the companies, as they would still be required to turn over documents, they wrote.“Because the stay they seek would not necessarily forestall the harm Respondents claim, their claim that they need an injunction to prevent that harm falls short,” the attorneys wrote.The attorneys also addressed the key question from Monday’s hearing: whether the NYAG’s office has jurisdiction to conduct its investigation.Cohen has the authority to decide personal jurisdiction, according to the letter.“Those questions are well within the competence of this Court, and the First Department,” they wrote. The attorneys also noted that New York residents might have “a public interest” in the matter, writing:“To the extent there is a public interest to be vindicated at this stage, it is that the people of the State of New York have an interest in the timely disclosure of materials sought in lawfully-issued subpoenas.”Bitfinex image via Shutterstock"

Judge Bruce Reinhart heard testimony at a U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach to determine an appropriate, possible remedy to this offense.These holdings may contain bitcoin collectively mined by Wright and Kleiman and may be held in the 1.1 million bitcoin Tulip Trust, at the heart of the case. Wright has claimed his access to the trust is limited through a complicated cryptographic scheme.Wright’s defense, led by Amanda McGovern of Rivero Mestre, deposed Steven Shadders, Chief Technology Officer of nChain, to lay groundwork why the self-declared inventor of bitcoin, Wright, has been unable to provide complete information regarding his earliest acquired bitcoin.Shadders, who has publicly affirmed Wright’s claim to be the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, testified that beginning sometime in June he began work on extracting possible holdings. Using six criteria, he winnowed down potential addresses to around 27,000 on Wright’s behalf.Shadders testified he had only examined addresses dated between Jan, 3 2009 and Aug, 21 2010, that were unspent, were used only once, contained a particular pay-to-public script pattern, and showed a nonce field value between 0 and 58. Despite the rigid criteria, Shadders also testified his algorithm contained a “quirk” that may have included addresses that do not belong to Wright. He allegedly made this discovery in the days leading up to the hearing.As part of the cross-examination the prosecution probed Shadders regarding his travel expenses to and from the June 28 hearing at which Wright testified, seemingly to indicate Shadders may have been paid for his efforts.Shadders declined a request for comment and Wright did not appear in court.As part of this civil and criminal hearing the prosecution called Matthew J. Edman, Director at Berkeley Research Group, as an expert witness in metadata and cryptography. According to his testimony, a number of emails and BitMessages purportedly sent between Dave Kleiman and Wright, as well as documents pertaining to the Tulip Trust show evidence of tampering.Though Edman spoke to inconsistencies found between multiple versions of documents, including in timestamps and email headers, he was unable to speak to the possible motivation behind the changes and therefore could not reasonably assume the documents show evidence of fraud.Edman frequently spoke to circumstantial evidence that suggests Wright manipulated documents to weave a narrative around the establishment and chain of custody of the Tulip Trust, though the defense was able to push back during a cross examination.Wright’s counsel argued that though metadata may place an email as having been edited in Eastern Australia’s timezone, where Wright was residing at the time, it does not conclusively speak to who or why an edit was made.Similarly, the defense argued an invoice relating to the Tulip Trust may have been a template after hearing Edman opine the document was inauthentic for showing signs of editing.As it stands, a hearing has been scheduled for August 26 where both defense and prosecution will give their closing arguments.

Of that, luxury brands were calculated to have taken a financial hit of $30.3 billion.Mastercard said it plans to use the Provenance solution with other (unnamed) partners “to provide a clear record of traceability, designed to contribute to consumer confidence and trust by creating awareness of the authenticity of the product.”Other blockchain and cryptocurrency initiatives may also be on the way too.

Any product returns are also tracked back to Seagate. In a real-world offering, this would help ensure that counterfeit drives are not sent back in place of the genuine article.Another potential use case for the platform, especially in Europe under the 2016 General Data Protection Regulation, would be to verify that any drives returned for defects or other reasons have undergone a possible “certified erase” process to remove any user data.“When a drive … comes back as part of its returns process, if we can prove that the drive was cryptographically erased, and therefore, the information is no longer on the device, then, from a risk perspective, this reverse supply chain can treat that device differently,” said Offenberg.Monty Forehand, Seagate product security officer, said in the report that, while the firm’s products already have a QR code-based brand protection tag, it doesn’t utilize blockchain.

4484331If you can understand the above, you could be in for a portion of a $100,000 prize – that is, if you can then beat the others attempting to calculate the answer with the greatest speed improvement.The highly technical conundrum has been posed to coders in a competition supported by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that aims to “change the face of blockchain,” as well as how hardware is designed and made.Launched by the VDF Alliance, the competition aims to solve how to calculate something called the verifiable delay function (VDF) in the shortest time.In its announcement, AWS paraphrases Justin Drake, a researcher with the Ethereum Foundation, explaining that “VDFs are a low-level building block in cryptography, barely more than a year old. It’s the “V” or ‘verifiable’ in VDF that makes the approach so unique.”“It’s trustless,” according to Drake. “For the first time, it adds this notion of time with which you can build all these cool things.”Included in the “cool things” promised by VDF tech is “unbiased proof of randomness.” Effectively, it could enable trustless, truly random number generators on blockchains. Currently, these are pseudo-random and can be exploited by bad actors by effectively being able to guess the number. With true randomness, that wouldn’t be possible.If the tech can be advanced sufficiently it could help to move blockchain such as ethereum from the energy-intensive and hence costly proof-of-work algorithm to one called proof-of-stake.“The Ethereum ecosystem alone currently uses on the order of 850 megawatts to extend blocks. That’s about $460 million in running costs per year,” said Tim Boeckmann, senior startup business development manager for AWS in the U.K. “With VDFs in Ethereum, there is an opportunity to bring down that cost to less than $0.13 million for the 0.25 megawatts of energy to power the hardware random beacons.”In fact, the competition is being held in partnership with the Ethereum Foundation, as well as other alliance members, the Interchain Foundation, Protocol Labs, Supranational, Synopsys, and Xilinx, which are sponsoring the event “with support from AWS.”As reported by CoinDesk previously, the Ethereum Foundation is already working on the VDF problem, revealing in February that it was considering spending $7.5 million in the search for true randomness.VDFs are envisioned for use in ethereum’s much-anticipated proof-of-stake system called Serenity, to which the ethereum network will migrate in the next few years.The first round of the competition will run till the end of September, and will award prize money to the fastest design that solves the problem at the top of this article.In the initial round of the competition, successful entrants will be awarded $3,000 for every nanosecond improvement. Full details can be found here.Drakes suggests that those entering will need a blend of skills.“You are going to need people who are really good at hardware design, but also people with algorithmic skills,” he said. “My guess is the winning team will have a combination of that expertise.”AWS image via Shutterstock"

Arad claims the brothers committed “conspiracy, deceit and serious fraud, as well as unlawful enrichment.” The official report accuses the brothers of breach of fiduciary duty, oppression of a minority shareholder, breach of contract and breach of commitments, theft of commercial secrets, and negligence.Initial reports suggest that the lawsuit could reach into the tens of millions of dollars as Arad is demanding a settlement from the Elad brothers’ 12 separate digital currency offerings including Leadcoin, Kin, Orbs, Sirin, and Stox.Arad claims the brothers allocated his Cointree Capital shares towards Hexa, a non-profit blockchain foundation. From the lawsuit:“The respondents (the Peled brothers) exploited Cointree Capital’s business opportunities to set up new companies based upon new opportunities in the new world of virtual currencies, as well as ideas and plans of Cointree Capital.”Orbs first launched in 2017 with an initial coin offering following in May 2018. It raised $118 million. A $15 million investment followed in December from Korean firm Kakao Investments. Interestingly, transactions between Orbs and two recent and large ICO’s Kik and Sirin Labs are listed. Arad claims he was the contact point between Kik and the Peled brothers before they cut him off. Currently, Kik is under fire from the SEC for an unregistered securities offering. Earlier this year, Sirin Labs CEO Moshe Hogeg was given two months by an Israeli judge to settle an investment misappropriation charge by a Chinese investor. The current connection between Kik, Sirin Labs, and Orbs is unspecified.Responding to the suit, Orbs says the claimant’s demands are unremarkable. “We have not yet managed to study the claim documents, which were sent to us at the same time as they were distributed to the press and media,” they wrote. “Unfortunately, the statement of claim did not surprise us, and follows previous attempts and threats on the part of the claimant.”As initially reported by CoinDesk in June, Orbs was invited by White House advisor Jared Kushner to discuss prospective blockchain solutions for aid distribution in the Palestinian territories.UPDATE (09, August 16:00 UTC): A prior version of this story incorrectly stated the White House had chosen Orbs to create a blockchain-based land registry. "

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Aug 1, 2019 at 13:02 UTC","Zooko Wilcox, CEO of Electric Coin Company (ECC) – the firm behind the privacy-focused cryptocurrency zcash – has made an appeal for the creation of a new “Dev Fund” to support the future operations of the privacy-focused cryptocurrency.","The move comes after much debate over the continuation of the project’s controversial “founders’ reward,” which took centerstage at Zcon1 and even drove a portion of the zcash community to fork off into a new network, Ycash.In a lengthy open letter on Medium Wednesday, Wilcox said:“I hope that the community will decide to renew the ‘Dev Fund’ structure, allocating coins from future block rewards for core support functions such as software development, user support, business development, regulatory and government outreach, security auditing and monitoring, educational and marketing initiatives, new protocol development, and so forth.”He further aired the hope that the zcash community would seek to “hire” the ECC to carry out those tasks.Having never taken the ICO path of fundraising (selling tokens to raise “a bunch of money from the public on the promise of delivering future results,” as Wilcox put it), zcash was originally bootstrapped by a group of investors to the tune of $3 million.The project was also set up so that over the first four years, 10 percent of the total 21 million token supply of zcash (ZEC) would go to the founders (the founders’ reward) and the remainder to the miners on the network. The investors were also assigned a “small slice” of ECC’s equity, Wilcox said.The original Dev Fund, according to the post, arose when Wilcox and ECC co-founder and CTO Nathan Wilcox got ECC to buy back some of the founders rewards to be used for funding ongoing operations. Wilcox and other founders also set aside some of their rewards to set up the Zcash Foundation.“We decided to do this because we thought that having an independent entity from the Electric Coin Company would be an important part of the Zcash community’s decentralization and stability in the long run,” Wilcox wrote.Now, with zcash set (programmed, in fact) to end the founders’ reward in October 2020, a new means of funding development is required, according to the ECC CEO.Wilcox said: “I opted for the initial Dev Fund to sunset itself, so that in the future, if Zcash were a success and a community were to grow up to support it, that community would have to collectively decide what to do next.”The options ahead, he said, include allocating all new ZEC issued to the network’s miners, creating a new Dev Fund with a percentage of new coins issued, or “other alternatives.”Wilcox is pushing hard for a Dev Fund to funded from a slice of the issuance, however:“This decision isn’t about the Electric Coin Company. If all of the employees of the Electric Coin Company were to board the same airplane tomorrow to go to an off-site meeting, and that plane were to crash with no survivors, the Zcash community would still be facing the exact same choice: shall we use some of the tens of millions of dollars that we’re spending on issuance every month to fund core support functions like protocol development, software support, security auditing, government outreach, educational initiatives, and business development, or shall we instead send 100% of that money to miners?”Finally, Wilcox called for community members to make their voices heard, either on public forums or by emailing zcash.The Zcash Foundation is expected to publish a procedure for making a community decision “soon,” according to Wilcox, while ECC will publish a blog post setting out how it will assess proposals in the next few days.Zooko Wilcox image via CoinDesk archives"

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Aug 7, 2019 at 11:40 UTC",The European Central Bank (ECB) has issued a new report indicating that it plans to use more on-chain data to better monitor the crypto markets.,"Titled “Understanding the crypto-asset phenomenon, its risks and measurement issues,” the report reveals that the ECB has already built a system that uses “high-quality” aggregated data available online in its efforts to analyse “the crypto-asset phenomenon” to identify and monitor how the financial technology might affect monetary policy and the risks it potentially poses to market infrastructures, payments and financial stability.However, using available data in this way has limits to its value. The report explains that this data leaves “gaps and challenges,” such as the exposure of financial institutions to crypto-assets and payment services that use layered protocols.It lists, among others, derivatives and investment vehicles’ exposure to digital assets, financial firms moving into custody and other services, and payments platforms using cryptos as potentially having implications for financial policy and stability.While currently “contained and/or manageable,” such links with regulated financial firms “may develop and increase over time.”Going into more detail on these issues of collecting accurate data, the EU banking authority says:“Specifically, it is hard to retrieve public data on segments of the crypto-asset market that remain off the radar of public authorities; some relatively illiquid trading platforms may be affected by wash trading; and there is no consistency in the methodology and conventions used by institutionalised exchanges and commercial data providers. Moreover, new and unexpected data needs may well arise with further advancements in crypto-assets and related innovation.”Going forward, the ECB plans to go into more granular detail for its analyses of crypto assets, and “will continue to work on indicators and data by dealing with the complexity and growing challenges encountered in analysing on-chain and layered protocol transactions.”It will further seek new data sources for information on links between crypto assets and regulated firms.Regarding off-chain transactions – transactions conducted off the blockchain and later aggregated back on-chain in fewer transactions – the ECB said it will work on increasing the “availability and transparency” of reported data and the methods used to provide it, “harmonising and enriching the metadata and developing best practices for indicators on crypto-assets.”Euro sign image via Shutterstock"

Previously, the blockchain team at Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud business, built a proprietary blockchain known as the Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB), and AWS’ Managed Blockchain service connects with ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric.Amazon is joining a number of companies that have tried to use blockchain to simplify the opaque and convoluted value chain in adtech. The general idea is that a distributed ledger can get everyone on the same page about where advertising dollars are going and avoid discrepancies.Just as a cryptocurrency blockchain shows which addresses sent or received money, how much, and when, an adtech ledger could track how much advertising is being placed and which middlemen are taking a cut, the thinking goes.It remains to be seen whether Amazon will roll out its blockchain-based advertising reconciliation platform for wider industry use. However, the company has a track record of developing solutions internally which are then offered more broadly.An example is AWS’ QLDB, a centrally administered immutable data ledger now available in limited preview.“We have a very long and healthy tradition of bringing forward internally developed projects at Amazon,” Rahul Pathak, general manager of AWS Managed Blockchain, said at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2019 in May.AWS’ Rahul Pathak at Consensus 2019 image via CoinDesk archives"

This year at TruffleCon, we are announcing two incredible enterprise integrations and one really amazing open-source public integration.”Both Hyperledger Fabric and the Corda network are marketed as enterprise-focused, permissioned blockchains. Developers for these platforms are backed by large enterprise organizations such as IBM and SBI.Tezos, on the other hand, is a public blockchain network that at one point amassed a total token supply value of over $1 billion. It too has been used and developed upon by major companies including Brazil’s fifth-largest bank, BTG Pactual.With the expansion of Truffle developer tools to these blockchain networks, Hyperledger Executive Director Brian Behlendorf see these formerly divided technical communities being able to better cooperate and work across chains.“This integration marks another step towards compatibility and interoperability in blockchain and smart contract development,” said Behlendorf in a press statement. “We believe the Truffle integration will bring even more energy and ideas from the Ethereum developer community into Hyperledger.”Interoperability is also a stated goal of Truffle’s as it looks to grow beyond the 3.4 million downloads it has clocked to date. The ConsenSys-backed company was recently spun out of the Brooklyn-based venture studio, though it continues to receive support from ConsenSys. An internal ConsenSys document from early 2019 pointed to Truffle as one of the firm’s standout successes.“We’re called Truffle and we have all this chocolate branding because we want the experience for developers to be as delightful as eating a chocolate truffle,” Coulter said, adding:“Truffle’s the start of the development experience. You start building with Truffle, then build your application and deploy it to whatever platform you want. … This multi-chain future I’m talking about has a lot of people working to have the many protocols themselves integrate with one another.”Truffle’s Wes McVay (left) and Tim Coulter (right) speak at TruffleCon 2018 (photo via ConsenSys)"

This is the first insolvency case in Canada involving cryptocurrency and has presented a number of unique issues, including requiring specialized resources for the monitor’s investigation.”EY and its legal counsel charged $1.3 million, ($1.7 million CAD), while the law firms acting as representative counsel charged $340,000 ($446,000 CAD), broken down as such:All told, the judge approved $1,631,161.99 ($2,143,442.44 CAD) in costs to each of the companies.The payments will come from the recovered funds in the creditor accounts, which total roughly $25 million ($33 million CAD), according to a previous report by EY.This leaves roughly $23.4 million (or $31 million CAD) to be distributed among the creditors. EY is trying to secure another $9 million ($12 million CAD) by selling off certain assets from the estate of Gerald Cotten, Quadriga’s deceased founder and CEO.Miller Thomson recently also kicked off the claims process for Quadriga creditors, with information posted to its website. The exchange’s former users have to fill out a form, with a final due date of August 31.Users will need to provide their Quadriga account number, full name, telephone number and address, as well as the amount of each cryptocurrency and fiat they held in the exchange prior to its closure. EY has set up a website for individuals unsure of the amounts they held, or who need to verify.Any users who disagree with the amounts shown on EY’s website will have to provide documentation supporting what they believe is their actual claim amount. A full set of directions on how they can do so has been posted to Miller Thomson’s website.QuadrigaCX first made headlines worldwide in January when court documents revealed Cotten had died, taking the passwords to the exchange’s crypto wallets with him. At the time, his widow, Jennifer Robertson, filed an affidavit claiming that Quadriga owed roughly 115,000 users a combined $190 million, and that she could not access any of its funds as Cotten was the only operator with knowledge of the private keys for its crypto accounts.Subsequent investigations by EY found that Cotten may have actually appropriated his customers’ holdings for personal use, including to support the margin trading of cryptocurrencies such as zcash, dogecoin, dash and omisego.EY reported in March that it could not locate or account for more than $100 million in various cryptocurrencies that the exchange was supposed to have held.While the exchange entered the CCAA process in January, EY moved to have it placed in bankruptcy, indicating that Quadriga will not recover from the losses. Nova Scotia Supreme Court Judge Michael Wood approved the motion, with bankruptcy operations running parallel to the CCAA proceeding.With Wednesday’s ruling, the CCAA process will wrap up, and the exchange will officially only be in bankruptcy.Nova Scotia Supreme Court image by Nikhilesh De for CoinDesk"
