No one really knows why but in my model we should be in for ""good"" news on the China trade war or some such China-related information that is strong for the Chinese currency.","This is only a theory but if it is correct, bitcoin will either rally vertically if no news breaks or the news will appear very soon. This is being written at 12 p.m. GMT September 25 and the news ought to be out there by no later than the end of the week. If I’m wrong and there is no such news and the price stays down or falls more still with no positive trade war news then my bitcoin theory, which has served so well, will be severely challenged.In any event, bitcoin has crashed. The dreaded flag has broken to the downside and the bottom is anyone’s guess.The decision what to do next comes back to the schism between believing BTC will be worth $100,000-plus a coin or $0 a coin. You have to pick your side.Way back before this year’s rally, I stated there is another way of looking at this price action. In commodities a big bubble is followed by a series of smaller and smaller echoes of the initial price shock which erupt over time as the years pass. Each new price eruption is smaller than the last until the original bubble is all forgotten about. If this is your model, this BTC bubble echo is now dead and BTC will fall back to the $2,000-$3,000 range or even lower. Then after a year or two there will be another small vertical and on this pattern will go, until bitcoin is all  but forgotten. The alternate model is the tech boom, where the original bubble was replaced by another bigger rally, one we have still not seen the end of.Is bitcoin a commodity or a value added instrument? Bitcoin isn’t like gold or copper, where a price rise creates a glut. Or is it? For me this is a very tempting model because I experienced it as a youngster and saw it play out all the while everyone continued to wish for the return of the moment when copper or gold went to the moon. However, bitcoin is not going to flood the market as miners pour resources into a race to over produce. Bitcoin protects itself from exactly the economic reason why high prices are the solution to high prices.The choice is clear for players in this game of speculation, steer clear or buy the dip.I’ll be buying the dip but not in a hurry.This is the chart of what has happened:Bitcoin has crashedThe flag got broken to the downside and it’s clear as day that a lot of people took this as a cue to get out, causing a panic. I’ve put some levels equivalent to some zones where the price might settle. I will be buying a little in the coming days and more if we hit $6,000 and a lot if we see $4,000.Meanwhile, there was been a strange crash in hash rate before this price fall, so everyone is free to link that up with this fall. There may have been a BTC miner who needed to sell a big chunk of BTC and in this fragile market with everyone staring at the same delicate chart pattern, it doesn’t take much to create an avalanche. I must admit to staring at this chart before it crashed thinking I should sell. This would have been a good move but experience has taught me that you can win on the exit but lose on the reentry. It’s great missing a fall but you can also miss the rally which can end up even more painful. This is the basic lesson of the randomness of markets. Back the direction you believe is the long-term outcome and buy the dips or don’t play at all.Bitcoin is like backing Apple when it was on the edge of going bust: do you believe in the future or not? If you do, you hold forever and buy the dips. The only thing you mustn’t do with the position is let that put your finances at risk or hurt your sanity.As a believer I will buy this dip, in the same way as I bought the last, little and often. For those who don’t believe in the long term you should stay well clear.Be among the first to get important crypto and blockchain news and information with Forbes Crypto Confidential.

Following today's sharp price decline, Bitcoin is now down 15.52% in the month of September.There was no obvious news associated with today's decline in the price of Bitcoin, although the highly-anticipated launch of Bakkt's physically settled Bitcoin futures platform got off to a slow start on Monday.Altcoins Looking Even WorseThings have been bad enough for Bitcoin on Tuesday, but the altcoins have fared enough worse. Of course, it should be noted that cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin tend to fall further when the Bitcoin price goes down and spike higher during bull markets.At the time of this writing, Ethereum was down 6.76% against Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash was down 14% against Bitcoin, and EOS was down 18.85% against Bitcoin, according to CoinMarketCap's tracking of the 24-hour changes in cryptocurrency prices.Having said that, Ethereum recently had one of its best days ever in terms of its Bitcoin-denominated price gains. However, the altcoin is still down 85% against Bitcoin since the peak of the hype around the cryptocurrency network focused on expressive smart contracts peaked in June 2017.Over the summer, multiple cryptocurrency pundits made bullish Bitcoin price predictions ranging from $42,000 by the end of 2019 to $100,000 over the next couple of years."

Blockchain Technology",https://www.forbes.com/sites/ktorpey/2019/09/23/bitcoins-competitors-are-missing-the-point-of-cryptocurrency-and-blockchain-technology/,"I've worked all over the Bitcoin media space -- from being editor-in-chief 
at Inside Bitcoins to contributing to… Read More.","Sep 23, 2019,10:10pm EDT",Getty,"In a Medium post published earlier this month, Castle Island Ventures Partner Nic Carter explained the utility of Bitcoin (BTC) as a revolutionary alternative to the traditional, government-approved banking system. Additionally, Carter wrote about how the thousands of Bitcoin competitors that have popped up over the years have missed the point of this new technology.On a recent episode of Laura Shin's Unchained podcast, Carter discussed this secondary point on altcoins in greater depth. While Carter noted that the relative success of Ethereum (ETH) cannot be ignored, he also indicated that there are very few chains other than Bitcoin and Ethereum that have any real usage whatsoever.The Problem with AltcoinsWhen Shin asked Carter if there were any coins besides BTC that he viewed as legitimate or promising, he responded with an explanation of the key issue that the altcoin market has faced ever since the first alternative cryptocurrencies were created back in 2011.""The problem I identify in the article is that there has been insufficient attention given to the legitimacy-conferring factors for the long tail of altcoins,"" said Carter. ""And so, the emphasis has always been on technical innovation — some of which were really marginal technical innovations — and really insufficient attention to the things that I believe matter, which is like: How do you ensure that the developers can't abuse their privilege within the system? Are there checks and balances? Is the monetary policy credible, for instance? And oftentimes, what we actually see in these systems is those credibility-endowing facts are traded off to achieve glamour metrics or technical thresholds.""Carter used the EOS altcoin as an example of this issue. While supporters of EOS tend to point to the high number of transactions the network can process per second as a key selling point, the fact that trade offs are made in terms of the relative centralization of the validator set is oftentimes overlooked. Some of the issues associated with this centralization of the validator set were covered in a recent CoinDesk article.""[A high degree of centralization] poses a greater threat to the long-term legitimacy of the network, which is not outweighed by the marginal technical enhancement there,"" added Carter.The level of centralization around publicly-identifiable validation nodes seen in some altcoin networks, such as EOS and Ripple (XRP), puts into question whether these altcoins should even be referred to as true cryptocurrencies.Is Ethereum the Exception to the Rule?The one possible exception to Carter's view on altcoins that came up during his discussion with Shin was Ethereum. Just last week, Ethereum's native ETH token enjoyed one of its best ever 24-hour price moves against BTC. However, it should also be noted that ETH was down 85% against BTC since March 2016, which was the peak of the ""flippening"" hype, as of late July.""At this point, you can't deny that Ethereum has a really vibrant community and kind of organic groundswell of usage and development,"" said Carter. ""Beyond that, I would say it's very sparse.""That said, Carter also holds the view that the only cryptocurrencies worth creating are those that aim to be money. Due to the fact that ETH has long been described as a sort of digital gas for computing costs rather than money, Shin gave Carter a chance to explain this apparent inconsistency in his views.""Ethereum probably should contend and aim to be money, and I think we noticed a little recalibration where initially it was computational gas, like the lubricant in the system, and then more recently certain high profile [Ethereum users] have been saying, 'Well, actually, Ethereum itself is money,'"" said Carter.To Carter's point, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin recently stated that ETH can be money if that's what the community wants at Ethereal Tel Aviv 2019. Joseph Lubin, who co-founded Ethereum and founded the blockchain technology company ConsenSys, also made the case for ETH as money during the same discussion at the Ethereal event.ETH's pivot away from gas and towards money has mainly been promoted on the backs of the various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications that have launched on Ethereum in more recent times.According to Carter, value accrues in a cryptocurrency network when users decide to hold the underlying token of the network for long periods of time rather than when someone utilizes the token for any sort of short term value transfer (read more on this in an older post).Shin pointed out that there is also a need for ETH to have value in order for Ethereum's upcoming move to proof-of-stake to work from a security perspective. Of course, this applies to proof-of-work systems as well. After all, the miners need to be incentivized to secure the legitimacy of the transactions on the network.While the market views BTC as the more valuable and trustworthy form of crypto money today, it still has its own issues. A Bitcoin mining veteran recently described the level of centralization in the industry as ""quite alarming."" Blockchain technology company Blockstream recently revealed their own massive Bitcoin mining facilities to the public, which is their attempt to help with the problematic situation around mining centralization.These potential issues around mining centralization have not stopped various individuals from increasing their Bitcoin price targets to anywhere from $42,000 by the end of this year to $100,000 by the end of 2021.While Bitcoin has had a great year thus far, a bigger winner has been Chainlink (LINK), which was up more than 800% against the US dollar year-to-date at one point."

(Photo by Ulrich Baumgarten via Getty Images),"As bitcoin, crypto’s largest asset, continues to consolidate in price, numerous other non-bitcoin crypto assets, known as “altcoins,” are showing a little bit of life in the price department after months of losing value. Nicholas Merten, host and creator of one of YouTube’s top-subscribed cryptocurrency channels, DataDash, listed three altcoins he expects the most growth from over the next year. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]“At the current moment, taking a look at [bitcoin] market dominance, it does look like we’re starting to enter into a trend shift where altcoins can start to gain as we retest back toward bitcoin’s highs at $20,000,” Merten said to me in a September 19 interview. “The last two [altcoin cycles] that we had were at the end of the overall bitcoin cycle where bitcoin reached $20,000,” he explained. “The first one happened at the beginning of 2017 when bitcoin retested its highs at $1,100.” Bitcoin (BTC) has had a fantastic year in the price category, rising from under $4,000, to more than $13,000 per BTC according to Messari’s price data, in what could be labeled as a storybook comeback. In contrast, the altcoin market, composed of more than 2,800 crypto assets, as listed on CoinMarketCap.com, has had a rocky year. The tides could be turning for altcoins however, as shown in Merten’s reference to bitcoin dominance, a metric that shows the amount of money invested in bitcoin compared to altcoins. Merten commonly references this metric on his YouTube channel, which touts more than 320,000 subscribers and over 21 million views, according to his channel’s analytics page on Social Blade.As the dominance and growth of crypto’s top asset increases, Merten said he sees money eventually funneling into other areas. “As bitcoin does increase over time, as we tend to see a general growth in bitcoin’s price, we tend to see more risk taking in different types of digital assets. As more liquidity has entered into bitcoin, you have the ability now, through exchanges, for that liquidity to exit into other alternative investments. Sometimes that can be rampant speculation, and, in other cases, it can be driven through fundamentals. I believe this time around, in this cycle, were going to see more going toward fundamental developed projects that actually have real demand.” In terms of altcoins ranked in the top 100 by market cap on CoinMarketCap.com, Merten singled out Chainlink (LINK), Basic Attention Token (BAT) and Ravencoin (RVN) as the three crypto assets he sees performing the best between now and the end of 2020.Chainlink (LINK)The Chainlink project, with its token operating under the ticker symbol LINK, looks to provide a solution in the area of connectivity. “Chainlink is helping to solve something that’s known as the oracle problem,” Merten said. “The problem with blockchains [such as] ethereum, who aim to have enterprise use case in utilizing blockchain, is that they struggle to connect with the outside world,” he explained. “Nodes on the network or the blockchain can only communicate and do basic transactions or token exchanges,” he said. Lacking in the mentioned structure, however, is the ability to execute “if-then scenarios,” Merten explained. “If so-and-so does this through a traditional data system that a business might use, then this transaction can go through,” Merten explained as one such scenario. Such an instance would “need something like Chainlink that can help have a decision-maker outside of the ethereum network as a middleware solution, in order to make the transactions on the ethereum network much more functionable.” Chainlink has made several big steps forward in 2019, including a partnership with software giant Oracle. Basic Attention Token (BAT)BAT is the digital asset associated with Brave Software, the company behind the Brave internet browser, a browser option that “blocks ads and trackers,” according to its website. Brave’s BAT is Merten’s second pick in terms of expected performance over the course of the next year. Explaining his rationale, the YouTube host pointed toward BAT’s affiliation with the Brave browser, and the “incentive structure” around the asset. “The token incentive structure [...] benefits all parties involved,” he said. Brave and its asset work in a way that compensates advertisers, content creators and viewers, Merten added. “Those are the things that really excite me,” Merten said. “Having that kind of trifecta of providing incentive for all users and a way to actually earn for your attention, because, quite frankly right now, there’s not a good respect for data privacy for Google and a lot of the major tech companies,” he said. “Not to mention, even if you want to receive advertisements and things of the like, you’re not getting any form of monetization for it, which Brave, in that case, offers through BAT as a token.” Ravencoin (RVN)Merten’s third pick is Ravencoin, a “platform for digital assets ” that allows users to develop their own tokens, backed by various different things. “You can actually make digital tokens that represent physical real-world assets or digital assets themselves,” he explained. Merten compared the project to the work many entities are doing with tokenized securities platforms, except with “the mindset of bitcoin,” Merten explained. “It’s created cypherpunks, it is censorship resistant, you can create digital tokens that represent any asset across the world and you can transmit it digitally across the world as well.”Forbes Special Offer: Be among the first to get important crypto and blockchain news and information with Forbes Crypto Confidential.

In 
stark contrast to the traditional financial system, Bitcoin is not a 
debt-based ...","Editors' Pick|Sep 25, 2019,02:55pm EDT"," Last week the financial system ran out of cash. It was a modern version of a bank run, and it’s not over yet. Stepping back, it reveals two big things about financial markets: first, US Treasuries are not truly “risk-free” assets, as most consider them to be, and second, big banks are significantly undercapitalized. The event doesn’t mean another financial meltdown is necessarily imminent—just that the risk of one is heightened—since the brush fire can be doused either by the Fed, or by the banks raising more equity capital. However, it provides a “teachable moment” regarding systemic fragility and anti-fragility.","What’s Happening, In Plain English?Somebody—probably a big bank—needs cash so badly that it has been willing to pay a shockingly high cost to obtain it. That’s the layman’s explanation of what’s happening. Interest rates have betrayed common sense—interest rates in the repo market should be lower than rates in unsecured markets, for example, because repos are secured by assets and thus supposedly lower-risk. But repo rates spiked way above unsecured lending rates last week, even for “risk-free” collateral such as US Treasuries.But US Treasuries are not risk-free. Far from it. (By this, I’m not referring to the US potentially defaulting on its debt obligations. Rather, I’m referring to the practice in the repo market that allows more people to believe they own US Treasuries than actually do. It’s called “rehypothecation.”)Why was someone willing to borrow cash at a 10% interest rate last Tuesday, in exchange for pledging US Treasury collateral that yields only 2% or less? That trade lost someone a whopping 8% (annualized) overnight, but presumably the trade allowed the bank to stay in business for another day. As risk premiums go, 8% is shockingly high—for a supposedly risk-free asset!On the flip side, the better question is why banks weren’t willing to lend against “risk-free” collateral for an 8% “risk-free” gain? Banks are supposedly healthy and flush with cash, right? So why aren’t banks falling over themselves to rake in such easy, “risk-free” profits?Shockingly, the Fed admitted to asking itself this same question, as revealed in an extraordinary interview on Friday with New York Fed President John Williams in the\Financial Times. The Fed has a theory about why. Many analysts do too. But almost no one is talking about the elephant in the room.The Elephant In The RoomFor every US Treasury security outstanding, roughly three parties believe they own it. That’s right. Multiple parties report that they own the very same asset, when only one of them truly does. To wit, the IMF has estimated that the same collateral was reused 2.2 times in 2018, which means both the original owner plus 2.2 subsequent re-users believe they own the same collateral (often a US Treasury security).This is why US Treasuries aren’t risk-free—they’re the most rehypothecated asset in financial markets, and the big banks know this. Auditors can’t catch this because GAAP accounting standards obfuscate it, as I’ll explain later. What it all means is that, while each bank’s financial statements show the bank is solvent, the financial system as a whole isn’t. And no one really knows how much double-, triple-, quadruple-, etc. counting of US Treasuries takes place. US Treasuries are the core asset used by every financial institution to satisfy its capital and liquidity requirements—which means that no one really knows how big the hole is at a system-wide level.This is the real reason why the repo market periodically seizes up. It’s akin to musical chairs—no one knows how many players will be without a chair until the music stops. Every player knows there aren’t enough chairs. Everyone knows someone will eventually lose.Financial regulators can’t publicly admit to this, but big banks know it’s true—and that’s why they hunker down (and stop lending) when they sense one of their kin is in trouble. They recognize that what appears to be an 8% risk-free arbitrage is anything but risk-free.Most financial regulators baffle us with jargon when they discuss this issue, making it barely intelligible to regular folks (cloaking it in such terms as “clogged transmission mechanisms,” “length of collateral chains”). The closest I’ve heard a financial regulator speak publicly of this is former CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo, to his credit, when he answered a question after a 2016 speech:“At the heart of the financial crisis, perhaps the most critical element was the lack of visibility into the counterparty credit exposure of one major financial institution to another. Probably the most glaring omission that needed to be addressed was that lack of visibility, and here we are in 2016 and we still don’t have it.”This is why the FT’s interview with Williams was so extraordinary. It’s as close as a regulator will come to admitting the reality that the system doesn’t work the way most of us think it does and that the Fed may not even understand critical things about it. Specifically, the Fed’s focus on the fed funds market is misplaced because the real action is in the much bigger, much more global repo market; the Fed shouldn’t have allowed America’s big banks to pay dividends or buy back stock when they’re so capital-constrained that they can’t even pick up an 8% “risk-free” arbitrage; the Fed’s proclamation that “the financial system remains resilient,” when it released the results of the most recent bank stress tests in June 2019, strains credulity; a staggering amount of US dollar liabilities have been issued offshore in recent decades and the Fed not only doesn’t control them but can’t measure them with any degree of accuracy; and banks’ financial statements don’t accurately reflect their financial health. No one really knows how solvent (insolvent?) the financial system is.Auditors can’t help here, and the accounting profession bears some of the blame for this problem. In June 2014, FASB updated the US GAAP accounting rules for repos. Here’s what the books of three parties show when a transferee (Party A) sells pledged collateral to a third party (Party C):If you add up the positions of all parties, economically there’s no problem because the net of the two longs and one short position add up to $100. The problem arises when you aggregate the three US GAAP financial statements. Both Party A and Party C report that they own the same asset (!) The balance sheets balance because Party B records a liability, so auditors don’t catch the problem. When that same bond is reused again and again and again in similar transactions, the magnitude of double counting within the financial system builds in a manner that no one can accurately measure.For years, IMF economist Dr. Manmohan Singh has done terrific work estimating it (see examples here, here, here, here, here, here and here).Singh has been recommending for years that regulators’ financial stability assessments of big banks be adjusted to back out “pledged collateral, or the associated reuse of such assets.” Financial regulators should have followed his advice years ago!What does this mean for markets in the short-term? No one knows, but I doubt this is “the big one.” Sure, the repo market is flashing red sirens. But the run on repo can be stalled in one of two ways: (1) banks raise new equity capital, or (2) the Fed injects more dollars into the system. Yes, it’s true that a run in the repo market is serious, since the big banks are still overly reliant on it and one dropped ball by the Fed could quickly turn the brush fire into an inferno. But, as usual, the Fed will almost certainly do what it always does—stem the run by injecting cash into the system in various ways, thereby socializing losses among all US dollar holders.A Teachable MomentIf this topic makes you uncomfortable, it should. It made me uncomfortable when I first realized all of this, which for me happened during the financial crisis while I was working on Wall Street and took a deep dive into why the crisis was happening. The financial system is fragile. It’s unstable. It always has been. What started in the repo market last week isn’t new—it’s actually the fourth such episode since 2008. At a systemic level, the traditional financial system is as fragile as Bitcoin is anti-fragile.An anti-fragile system is one that becomes stronger and more resilient as a result of shocks, not weaker. This describes Bitcoin, whose network security grows as the system’s processing power grows.Here I distinguish between price volatility and systemic volatility. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, but as a system it is more stable. In stark contrast to the traditional financial system, Bitcoin is not a debt-based system that periodically experiences bank run-like instability.In this regard, Bitcoin is an insurance policy against financial market instability. Bitcoin is no one’s IOU. It has no lender of last resort because it doesn’t need one.For me, Bitcoin is empowering because it provides a choice to opt out of the traditional financial system. In light of the traditional financial system’s instability, despite all of Bitcoin’s drawbacks, I find that a powerful concept."

Source: TradingViewAs we can see on bitcoin’s daily chart, the last couple of hours marked the time when bitcoin finally broke down of the descending triangle, which had started forming from June 26th onwards. Although BTC formed higher lows, the lower highs as indicated by the red trendline were far more suppressive and forced the price down continuously. The orange trendline was tested three times over the last months until bitcoin made a breakout to the downside when retesting it for the fourth time. This flash sale was supported by a lot of volume as we can see on the volume indicator.Bitcoin Hourly Chart. Source: TradingViewAfter two massive red candles on the hourly chart, bitcoin now starts building a small pattern that looks like an ascending triangle with resistance at around $8,750, which is exactly the 200 EMA trendline on the daily chart. So, if prices are to recover, bitcoin needs to surpass this critical level first. At the time being, it is hard to say where the markets are headed. A short-term recovery is likely in the hours to come, and whether bitcoin can start an uptrend from there depends on the decisiveness of the market and momentum that needs to build first.Ethereum Daily Chart. Source TradingViewEthereum Hourly Chart. Source: TradingViewEthereum’s hourly chart is very similar to bitcoin’s hourly chart. Ether is putting in higher lows and forming a tiny ascending triangle with resistance at $175. A critical key level is $165, which marked the bottom wig of the daily candle on Ethereum’s daily chart on the 29th of August and 6th of September. With bitcoin dominance at 69%, currently all major altcoins mimic bitcoin’s movements and how the price of ETH will develop in the foreseeable future, is currently dependent on bitcoin.As the crypto market tanked in the last couple of hours, it affected not only the top 100 but all cryptocurrencies across the board, which is the reason why there are no top gainers as of today.Today’s top losers, as of the time this article is being written, are Algorand [ALGO] with -24.62%, Bytom [BTM] with -24.40%, and Aeternity [AE] with -23.72%. In the course of the day, the top losers are likely to change a lot, as the percentage losses are dependent on how quickly the altcoins are able to recover.Forbes Digital AssetsResearch Teamresearch@forbesda.com646-450-8808Forbes Digital Assets does and seeks to do business with companies covered in ForbesDA Research.

U.S. stocks dropped, following the worst loss in six weeks for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, as global shares slid on concern over growth in China and potential political turmoil in Greece. Photographer: Ron Antonelli/Bloomberg","Wells Fargo is the latest bank to jump into the cryptocurrency space with the launch of its stablecoin product, dubbed Wells Fargo Digital Cash. The tokenized dollar will allow users to move money internally across the firm’s global network in “near real-time.” Banks have taken a general “no new friends” stance on decentralized cryptocurrencies and warned against the alleged dangers of operating outside the control of a fiat-based financial system. Are banks starting to understand that they can use the technology for instant payments, while eliminating the need for middlemen?The Breakdown You Need to Know: Back in the day cryptocurrency networks were a major concern for banks that didn’t want to be seen as enabling tax evasion or money laundering, but they’ve realized blockchain technology isn’t as shady as previously thought. This move into cryptocurrency is an about face for Wells Fargo because back in July, the company confirmed it was refusing to allow domestic banking customers to complete crypto-related transactions. Now, the financial firm is following JPMorgan into this space, which launched its JPM coin to mixed reviews in earlier this year. “As a result of the increasing digitization of banking services globally, we see a growing demand to further reduce friction regarding traditional borders,” Wells Fargo said in a statement.Cautious Crypto Coins: As institutional investors engage in these crypto coins, they’ll be looking to ease their cautiousness by having a reliable benchmark for their performance. It will be interesting to see just how much volatility institutional investors are willing to stomach as more players enter the cryptocurrency market.Last year, Goldman Sachs became the first regulated financial institution to allow its clients to trade Bitcoin futures via one of its New York desks. The legitimacy bar for digital currencies was raised at this point. The Wall Street titan proceeded cautiously and didn’t trade actual Bitcoin initially, instead the bank used its own money to trade Bitcoin futures contracts for clients. Also, they traded non-delivery useable forward futures where trades settled in the regulated currency they’re quoted in.While Goldman Sachs dips its toes in the cryptocurrency markets, CultureBanx found BitMEX is way ahead of the game. CEO Arthur Hayes helms this leading cryptocurrency derivative exchange. The company offers derivative products to retail investors and has a daily trading volume approaching $3 billion. BitMEX made revenue of $83 million in 2017 and posted $21 million in revenue during January of 2018.What’s Next: Wells Fargo’s stablecoin is pegged to the U.S. dollar and the pilot program is planned for 2020. The concept will undergo a test for internal transfers, with a goal to expand to multi-currency transfers in the future."

Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase, called Bitcoin a fraud.I turned to attorney Marta Belcher—a pioneer in the area of blockchain law—to demystify cryptocurrency and to share her insights on the implications of of blockchain on leadership and organizational structure.Belcher is an attorney focusing on blockchain and emerging technologies at Ropes & Gray. She has spoken about blockchain law around the world, including presenting twice in Davos during the World Economic Forum, testifying before the New York Senate, and speaking in European Parliament, the OECD, and U.S. Congress.Belcher serves as outside general counsel for one of the largest cryptocurrency projects, defended one of the first patent litigations against a blockchain company, and was recognized by the Financial Times Innovative Lawyer awards for her pioneering work on the first blockchain-transferable software license. She also represents major blockchain industry groups and civil liberties organizations in matters relating to blockchain and public policy. Q: Could you explain Bitcoin simply? Marta Belcher: Think of Bitcoin as doing for value what the Internet did for information. You can send a digital file to the other side of the world instantly, so why can’t you send money that way, too? Before Bitcoin, if I wanted to send money to you digitally, the process would be something like this: I go to my bank. My bank updates its ledger to subtract money from my account. My bank communicates with your bank using 1970s ACH technology. And, finally, your bank updates its ledger to add money to your account. That takes a lot of time and expense and requires that we trust our banks.The idea behind Bitcoin was this: what if instead we have a single, shared, public ledger that permanently records every transaction, and that ledger is not maintained by a single entity but rather by many computers working together. That ledger is called a “blockchain.”Q: Is Bitcoin here to stay? Belcher: Yes. The thing is that even if, say, a government wanted to shut down Bitcoin, there is no “Bitcoin Corporation” to shut down. Bitcoin is decentralized—it is computer code running on thousands of computers around the world. That makes it extremely interesting from a legal perspective. Whether the price of Bitcoin will go up or down is less interesting, at least to lawyers. Q: What is the most exciting thing about this technology?  Belcher: Being able to program money. You can write computer programs that automatically transfer cryptocurrency when something happens—“if x happens, transfer y amount of money.” For example, you could write computer code that automatically transfers a millionth of a cent to a singer for every second of the musician’s song that you listen to. These computer programs are called “smart contracts,” but I prefer to think of it like “programmable money.”Q: What is a common myth about blockchain and cryptocurrency? Belcher: People sometimes called for a ban on cryptocurrency because it can be used to commit crimes. It is true that some cryptocurrencies allow for greater anonymity (since transactions are recorded using a “public key”—like a username—instead of real names). But the fact that a technology could be used to break the law doesn’t mean it should be banned. We don’t call for a ban on cash because criminals use it to commit crimes, and we don’t blame Ford when one of its cars is used as a getaway vehicle in a bank robbery. Q: You’ve been serving as outside general counsel for a blockchain company and advise many other blockchain-focused organizations. What have you noticed about leaders in those companies?Belcher: Leaders of blockchain companies really understand and believe in the power of decentralization. And they really do implement those ideas. Some of these companies don’t have offices, have employees all over the world, and heavily rely on tools like GitHub and Slack for asynchronous communication. They also deeply believe in the ideals of open source software. They aren’t looking to make money through ownership of their inventions; they care about adding value to the ecosystem and to the world.Q: So how could blockchain change leadership?Belcher: There are these so-called decentralized autonomous organizations that are absolutely fascinating. We were just talking about being able to program your money; now, imagine writing a computer program where a bunch of people contribute money and the program automatically distributes those funds based on how the contributors vote—like an automated venture capital fund. That was the model of the first of these decentralized autonomous organizations in 2016. Suddenly you can have leaderless organizations governed entirely by computer code—a pretty radical change from traditional organizational structures. And that may be scary, but it also raises some fascinating legal questions that I can’t wait to try to answer."

Bitcoin, blockchain, and the emerging technology as it is a bit more ...","Sep 24, 2019,09:50am EDT", (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images),"Quantum computing has been on the tech radar for some time now, but it has also been lurking in the background of the blockchain ecosystem for very different reasons. The new advancement of computing allows for complex equations and problems to be solved exponentially quicker than is currently available. However, it has always been predominantly a futuristic, almost science fiction-like pursuit; for blockchain that has been just fine as well because we have been warned that quantum computation could render existing encryption standards obsolete, threatening the security of every significant blockchain.This week, news has emerged that Google has made a recent quantum computing breakthrough, achieving quantum supremacy. It is being reported that Google, using a quantum computer, managed to perform a calculation in just over three minutes that would take the world's most powerful supercomputer 10,000 years.This could mean panic stations for blockchain as all that has been achieved thus far could be wiped out, and without the right provisions, all the promise and potential could be eliminated overnight. However, the term quantum supremacy refers to the moment when a quantum computer outperforms the world's best classical computer in a specific test. This is just the first step, but it is a rather large step that means the spotlight is once again on blockchain to try and resist this kind of technology which can unravel its cryptographic algorithms in minutes. Google's first stepsGoogle has described the recent achievement as a ""milestone towards full-scale quantum computing."" They have also said this milestone puts a marker in the ground on which they can start rapidly progressing towards full quantum computing - another concerning statement form blockchains. Details are a little scarce on what Google has achieved, and how they have done it, but previous proposals essentially involve the quantum computer racing a classical computer simulating a random quantum circuit. According to Gizmodo, it has been long known that Google has been testing a 72-qubit device called Bristlecone with which it hoped to achieve quantum supremacy and the initial report from the Financial Times says that the supremacy experiment was instead performed with a 53-qubit processor codenamed Sycamore.However, it would be a little early to start abandoning all hope with Bitcoin, blockchain, and the emerging technology as it is a bit more complicated than that. More so, there is already technology and projects in place that has been trying to prepare for an age of quantum computing where blockchain is resistant. Are blockchains ready to resist?So, if quantum computing is making significant breakthroughs, is there any evidence of blockchain's being prepared for this new age, and a new threat? There has been news of blockchain builders putting out quantum-resistant chains, such as E-cash inventor David Chaum and his latest cryptocurrency, Praxxis.David Chaum, Elixxir on Moneyconf Stage during day two of Web Summit 2018 (Photo by Eoin Noonan /Web ... [+] Summit via Getty Images)QAN is another project that says it is ready for the quantum computing age, has reacted quickly to the news of Google's breakthrough with Johann Polecsak, CTO of QAN, telling Bitcoin.com: ""The notion of Google achieving a quantum breakthrough sounds very dramatic, but in reality, it's hard to gauge the significance at this time. How can we be sure that Google's quantum computer is more powerful than D-wave's, for example, which surpassed 1,000 qubits four years ago?""I also reached out to Polecsak to find out more about the threat of quantum computing when, and if, it reaches its pinnacle. ""We should definitely be worried,"" he told me, ""Many IT professionals and CTOs, including the earlier m, are neglecting and denying quantum computing threats with the simple reasoning that once it's seriously coming, we'll have to redesign almost everything from scratch, and that must surely be a long time ahead.""""The truth is that one can already rent quantum computers for experimenting with possible attack algorithms and testing theoretical approaches. The maths behind breaking currently used public key cryptography - EC and RSA - were proven, we just need more qubits.""""In cryptography, it's best to prepare for the worst, and one can observe in recent literature that past skeptics now instantiate their crypto protocols in a post-quantum setting - just it case. Users shouldn't worry now, but experts should prepare before it's too late.""QAN CTO Johann Polecsak speaking about the threat of quantum computing at a conference in Seoul, ... [+] South Korea. What it means to be quantum-resistantOf course, the technological aspect of the race between quantum computing and blockchain quantum resistance is immense, and it is also quite nuanced. It is not as if quantum computing will, like a light switch, be available and all blockchains will suddenly be vulnerable - but it is still important to be prepared. As it stands, there probably is not enough preparation and planning in place, according to Polecsak.""Blockchains won't be ready for such a breakthrough. Since transaction history is the backbone of blockchains, such an improvement in quantum computing could be catastrophic for the whole transaction history,"" added the CTO. ""There is an extra layer of protection with Bitcoin's double hashing but assuming a quantum computer is capable of Shor on secp256k1 it's safe to assume it's also capable of Grover256. Also, we don't know bounds for SHA regarding quantum circuits.""""As for QAN blockchain platform, it is not a linear comparison or a race where we need to keep up side-by-side with increasing qubits. Being Quantum-safe does not mean that we are just increasing bits in currently used algorithms, but that we take a totally different approach which resists the known Quantum attacks by design.""Prepare to resist As science-fictiony as it sounds, quantum computing is a threat that needs to be taken seriously in the world of blockchains. It may not be the kill switch that everyone imagines because of media hype, but it certainly something that should be on the radar for anyone involved in the ecosystem. It is not only because of what has been accomplished in blockchain thus far but also because of what is being built and promised in the space. Blockchain is a major technology revolution on the horizon, and as it permeates deeper into enterprises and governments it would be catastrophic for all that has been done to be undone, and all that has been promised to be eliminated. "

money in the world and it flowed in an efficient enough way, there ...","Sep 23, 2019,12:32pm EDT",photo credit: Getty,"Last week we had a mini-crisis in global cash flow. There was a U.S. liquidity freeze that saw banks scrambling for overnight money to balance their books. This scramble catapulted interest rates in this ultra-short-term market from close to zero to 10%.In a nutshell, the wheels came off the financial system. Now this is not 2007 or any other time when there were no awareness or systems to cope with this kind of situation. In the bad old days this could have easily created a domino effect where solvent banks go bust because the process where totally healthy banks became insolvent infects the whole system. A chain reaction where a short term lack of cash flow cascades into a full blown financial crisis is how crashes and economic collapses are born.You can imagine this dynamic as the equivalent of a financial pileup, where a little over-breaking somewhere on the road feeds back to a point where a huge line of vehicles have no escape from rear-ending each other. This is just the sort of thing that any complex system will suffer from time to time because… well because statistics say outlandishly unlikely events will always occur at some point and half of them will have very nasty outcomes. This is why countries have central banks. Central banks are there to avoid these situations by regulating the financial traffic where possible and picking up the pieces when the worst, as it must at some point, happen.So the Fed bailed out the system and now the system is back to normal. The worse that can be said of this situation is the Federal Reserve took its eye off the ball a bit and should have been ahead of the situation rather than having to chase it down. However, armchair quarterbacking is a lot easier than covering all the complex eventualities in a $19 trillion dollar economy, so the Fed can say it had it covered and it did.Underlying this however, is quantitative tightening, something I’ve been going on and on about. This situation has its root in the period of QT that kicked off last year. Thankfully QT ended at the end of August. It ended early because the Federal Reserve clearly saw that it had done at least enough and possibly a bit too much.QT took money out of the global economy and shrunk the Federal Reserve’s massive balance sheet. QE was what exploded the Fed’s balance sheet and QT was reverse-QE. You might think U.S. QE was solely a U.S. thing, but of course it couldn’t ever be that because money flows to the places with the highest rate of return and those are generally not going to be at home. That is not to say QE wasn’t great for the U.S. QE rocketed the U.S. stock market, saved millions of people from losing their homes and repaired the housing market. QE was the driver of the recovery from the ""global financial crisis"" or ""credit crunch,"" as I still like to call it, of 2007-2008.QE back then was ""unorthodox monetary policy"" but it’s now the new orthodoxy. Yet the Fed having trillions on its balance sheet was considered a new terrible thing so QT was implemented to get back to the past, a time where the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet was on an almost comprehendible scale. The trouble is, there is no way back.Back in 2006 and before, banks could have a 3% capital base and be free to lend, lend, lend. The crash changed all that; now if banks have a capital base of anything much under 10% it raises eyebrows. This means in effect banks can lend way less money and that in turn means they can create way less liquidity by the age old system of ""fractional reserve banking,"" where $1 of saving can be blown up to $10, $20, $30 of money in the system. Most money is just a record on a disk drive with the Fed supplying the cash on demand to keep wallets full and if banks are allowed they will create huge piles of virtual money and they do.Yet this change to the amount of capital needed by a bank to be ""safe,"" means the old engine of money generation has been cut off at the knees. The old system had worked for ages and the good thing about money supply coming from the private sector was it tended to match economic demand. The bad thing was, the system could degenerate into a race to the bottom by the banks where loans got riskier while the margin of safety got slimmer. The result of that was by 2007 mountains of money had been lent to rubbish borrowers on terrible assets. Regulators are meant to stop that happening but they didn’t and in the aftermath new regulations crippled the banking systems’ ability to be the engine of liquidity it once was. The replacement was QE, because if you stop banks from generating liquidity and do not replace that liquidity somehow, you would create an economic ice age. QE was that process.You can’t, however, keep QEing forever or so it is still thought by many and perhaps in the good times you have to pull money back, just as in the old days you would have jacked up interest rates. That’s fine, until you do too much of it. Just as rising interest rates causes ""hard landing"" crashes, QT will do the same. If the system runs out of enough money to keep the wheels rolling you end up it the same place as you do if the Fed jacks up interest rates too high, something some remember happening before the Credit Crunch crash. QE/QT might be a new system but it hasn’t escaped the potential for boom and bust.So as soon as QT kicked off, money started to return to base and the periphery of QE’s effects began hurting. This of course was the ""emerging economies"" where yields were highest and risk greatest, and one by one those economies got into trouble as the dollars drained away. At some point this process hits home and you can see it landing in the U.S. from the semi stock market crash of last winter. Now the tide of hard times is arriving on main street.It is therefore no surprise that QT was stopped early and now interest rates have been dropped. The Fed has anticipated this, but whether it has anticipated it enough is yet to be seen.QE will restart soon, or some such innovation to produce similar results.This means we could well be on the cusp of a fat equities rally. That is good news for investors, yet it leaves the system is an interesting situation.Replacing the old money generation process of fraction reserve banking moderated by interest rates, is one operated by a bunch of ""wisefolk"" letting out or pulling in purse strings. There is more control but less flexibility. This might be good, this might be bad, but what it certainly does, is put our economic fate solely in the hands of a small number of old people working with experimental and poorly understood tools. This carries its own bundle of risks and fragilities.Which brings me, at last, to bitcoin and other cryptos. If there was enough money in the world and it flowed in an efficient enough way, there would be no place for cryptos. There is no place for silver and gold as money because paper is better money than precious metals. Precious metals’ place in the modern world of money is as a tiny niche, essentially ""war capital."" Take away the threat of armageddon and gold loses much of its value. This would not be the case for crypto. Crypto’s value comes from the ability to transact with it outside of the claustrophobic and costly banking system. It’s faster, cheaper and lighter and a whole list of other benefits if you want to dig into it. What is more, it’s a money that can be created by market demand, by the private sector, just like the crippled fractional reserve banking system does.So we have an intersection of opportunities for crypto where there is not enough money for economic purposes and other important factors are in play.Technology has produced an environment that is no longer supply bound. Inflation is caused by too much demand for available supply and in the modern world this situation has reversed. Low inflation is telling us all, there is not enough money to fuel demand. Economists say there is plenty of money, but surely you should believe the inflation numbers not the opinion. Inflation is low because more demand is quickly sated by supply; where it isn’t, prices surely rise. Where there is flexible supply, inflation doesn’t strike. As such you could have more money in the system and let the inflexible supply of labor drive up wages. This would enable more demand, improving living standards, while creating only moderate levels of inflation.This won’t happen though, because while central banks have grasped ""unorthodox monetary policy"" because it works, it is still not agreed by all, why it works or that it will continue to do so.Happily, at least for holders, crypto will take up the slack.Crypto will deflate--i.e. go up in value--because the crypto brands will dominate in this adoption process and they tend to be very finite. Then Gresham’s Law will ensure ‘bad money, drives out good.’ Now this will work unintuitively because good and bad and drive out mean the opposite of what you might think.Stable dollars are bad money versus appreciating crypto, while ""drive out good,"" means make people hoard ""good"" money and spend ""bad"" money. People will hoard cryptos like bitcoin and spend their dollars.Lack of enough liquidity to optimize economic output will actually translate in people saving crypto as it appreciates and spend dollars as they don’t and what do you know, we have already seen that in the army of crypto-hodlers.In the past when new sources of gold or silver were found, the increase of monetary base would create a boom. In the old gold standard days the inflexibility of money supply was one of the root causes of boom and bust and especially bust.To me it is manifest that there is not enough  liquidity in the global economy and last week’s brush with monetary disaster clearly demonstrates ""issues"" in money supply. However sage our regulators, and they are pretty sharp in my opinion, it seems unlikely the possibility of systemically too little money in the system will be considered let alone accepted and addressed. The lack of inflation will continue to be a mystery as will a lack of growth. “What could possibly be the cause,” they will continue to cry.Happily a lack of sufficient money to feed the new economic reality with extremely flexible supply but inflexible demand will drive crypto adoption and bitcoin and its sisters will continue to fill that vacuum like a bonanza of new gold.Be among the first to get important crypto and blockchain news and information with Forbes Crypto Confidential.

There have been rumors circling the company for some time now that they are building a cryptocurrency trading desk, but on the more evidential side of things, they also funded $16 million in Series A for Fireblocks - a startup that helps institutions safely transfer coins between different wallets and exchanges. Rakuten has also been garnering much interest in the blockchain sphere, as well as more recently the cryptocurrency space. The Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten, which has a market capitalization of over $12.5 billion, revealed a deal to acquire domestic crypto exchange Everybody's Bitcoin in late August.Everledger is no stranger to being courted by major enterprises, however. Back in 2016, the firm took part in an accelerator program run by Mastercard as it looked to grow its scope to other areas where provenance and transparency are of crucial importance such as minerals, luxury goods wine and art.Fitting inThere is an ever-growing understanding that enterprises and startups in the blockchain space have a lot that they can benefit from each other. The likes of Telefonica and others are driving accelerator programs with the hopes of unearthing the next big thing, but for the startups, it is equally essential to be aligned with significant companies. Leanne Kemp, founder, and CEO of Everledger, said the following while also announcing a use-case example the two will be collaborating on: ""Everledger and Tencent are a natural fit. We share strategic synergies, including several solutions that are part of their ecosystem. As an example, we will launch the world's first WeChat Mini Program for blockchain-enabled diamonds, uniting key stakeholders in the diamond value chain, which aims to empower WeChat users to buy jewelry with more transparency and security. In particular, we are excited to see how this new partnership with Tencent will help to strengthen and extend our developments in China and contribute to other potential partnerships."""

estimated that bitcoin accounts for more than 71 terawatt hours of ...","Sep 25, 2019,08:00am EDT","As the renewable energy revolution comes to the large entities that are responsible for providing us with electrical power, investor-owned utilities could be caught off-guard.","The IOU business model centers on rate-based investments in large-scale power generation. However, the growth of renewables indicates they will have fewer opportunities to invest in large projects, as state regulations begin to favor distributed generation, microgrids and smaller independently operated grids. By 2050, I predict that the IOUs that expand their view of what they invest in now to include renewable technology will be the ones to continue to expand their businesses.As the CEO of a company that provides an operational platform for utilities and energy companies, I have firsthand knowledge of the evolution of utility technology and the work involved in keeping up with trends.It’s often said, “During a gold rush, sell shovels.” We often see companies find success not necessarily by innovating new technology, but through predicting demand for something new and offering services that support it. As the energy landscape evolves, it’s important for utilities to continuously re-envision what their “shovels” would be.For instance, Google Fiber is providing fiber-based home internet services to broaden high-speed internet access throughout the U.S., either with its own service or by forcing competitors to join them in a fiber race. Faster internet for everyone leads to more viewership of advertisements and videos and better-connected smart home devices — all of which give the tech giant more user data to monetize.The Amazon purchase of Whole Foods in 2017 is another example. Some say the acquisition was considered valuable for Amazon to secure more urban and suburban locations vital to its delivery business.In previous pieces, I discussed the importance of utilities researching new market trends. I also applauded the efforts of utilities that breed new technology through research labs, incubators and funding rounds. Most utilities were painfully late to the uptick of solar energy generation and are attempting to get ahead of electric vehicle charging before that market also moves forward without them.Since, typically, utilities have a 25-year planning horizon and are accustomed to making significant investments that will pay off for decades to come, I believe it behooves the industry to explore new strategies for investments into new markets that are likely to generate more electricity sales, preferably clean energy. For example:• Driverless vehicles: As autonomous vehicle technology improves, some companies are working toward developing self-driving vehicles. I believe these autonomous vehicles will most certainly be fueled by electricity (it’s hard to fathom an autonomous vehicle powered on a combustion engine).Taking the worst-case scenario as an example, research by the University of Michigan and Ford Motor Company indicates that even autonomous electric vehicles operating in regions with the highest use of fossil fuels for grid power AEVs would produce fewer emissions than their gasoline counterparts.• Cryptocurrency: At the time of writing this article, cryptocurrency markets are again more vigorous. As of September 11, Digiconomist's Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index estimated that bitcoin accounts for more than 71 terawatt hours of electricity per year. According to Digiconomist, that's a carbon footprint comparable to the country of Denmark's.Mining bitcoin requires so much energy that regulators in China have considered a ban on cryptocurrency mining. But, what if that energy could be generated from renewable sources and stored for mining use? To the entrepreneurial mindset, such a problem could also hold a solution.• Indoor horticulture and vertical farming: Whether you’re growing tomatoes or participating in the booming cannabis industry, indoor horticulture is on the rise and uses a massive amount of energy. However, overpopulation and overfarming make finding adequate farmland difficult. That’s why some in the agriculture industry are turning to vertical farming as a solution to maximize crop yields and minimize land use.According to The Independent, ""The energy demand associated with vertical farming, however, is much higher than other methods of food production."" No matter what these farms are producing (i.e., vegetables, landscape plants, hemp or cannabis), utilities have the opportunity to develop custom solutions and services tailored for these markets to cultivate their growth.With these three brief examples in mind, it's not too difficult to see there are opportunities for utilities to keep an eye out for upcoming trends in the space. However, the secret here is to take things a step further. I would begin implementing focus groups, doing experiments and even including potential new technology in future road maps. This way, you are not only keeping your finger on the pulse, but you also have a road map toward implementation.That said, you must consider that there will certainly be some challenges in trying to predict future areas of growth. For example, you might even come into pushback by those who are too fixated on the current industry structure or aren't ready to take risks.However, I firmly believe that the energy companies that are thinking ahead into where energy will be most needed will be able to continuously evolve and offer quality services that benefit not only customers, but also the environment and our communities."

Tether, a so-called stablecoin is supposed to be backed on a one-to-one basis by the U.S. dollar, however New York attorney general Letitia James in April accused the company behind Tether of essentially minting the cryptocurrency for Bitfinex to the tune of as much as $900 million.If the stay had been rejected, Bitfinex parent company iFinex would have been required to continue turning over documents pertaining to Bitfinex and the Tether cryptocurrency. A court document dated today is being presented as a “victory,” by a person familiar with the case speaking on background, but it’s only a partial win.The parent company of the Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange was sued by New York attorney general James in April, following allegations that the company was given what amounts to a line of credit from Tether Holdings Limited, the maker of the Tether cryptocurrency, a stablecoin widely used in the cryptocurrency space to enter and exit investments. Tether’s market cap is currently $4.11 billion, with a daily volume of $24 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.com.Importantly, no official complaint has even been filed against Bitfinex or Tether as pertains to this motion. Rather, today’s motion means that the companies will not have to provide documents about their relationship to investigators until a decision on an appeal to dismiss the entire case has been reached. In August, Justice Joel M. Cohen declined a similar request sent on behalf of Tether. The New York attorney general’s office confirmed that while the the partial stay means the companies won’t have to turn over the paperwork in question they could still be required to do so at a future date. “The injunction that prohibits the movement of money between Tether and Bitfinex is still in place,” says a spokesperson of the attorney general’s office. “We look forward to making our case in court as we seek to have Judge Cohen’s decision upheld and continue our investigation.”A representative of iFinex and Tether Holdings Limited, speaking in similar terms, said: “We are gratified by the panel’s decision and we look forward to addressing the significant substantive issues before the appellate court.”While the decision is certainly a set back for the attorney general’s office investigating Tether, Bitfinex and other related companies, it is not an end to the proceedings. The motion signed by a clerk today is granted on the condition that additional documents pertaining to the broader appeal for dismissal be filed by November 4, 2019. If the case is allowed to proceed actual arguments won’t likely begin until 2020.Editor’s Note: This article has been updated with information from the New York attorney general’s office.

cryptocurrency donations from donors directly, other sites facilitate the 
donation ...","Sep 25, 2019,09:30am EDT","As a digital, peer-to-peer, decentralized, distributed ledger, blockchain has the potential to transform systems and enable solutions we never thought possible. As with any developing technology, there are challenges to address — but initiatives within the social impact space are already demonstrating some of blockchain’s advantages over traditional solutions.","Reducing Risk And FraudThe OECD reports that an estimated 20-25% of funds are lost to corruption globally at the government level. Even when it's unintentional, waste, inefficiency and misallocation of funds cost millions of dollars that could otherwise be used for good.One advantage blockchain has is that it’s tamper-proof. Through a process known as “consensus,” each transaction is verified by multiple parties independently. Entries are immutable, meaning they can’t be modified, and can only be updated by adding an addendum. With all entries publicly viewable, this offers unparalleled transparency into how donations are used. Not only does this build trust between an organization and donors, but it helps mitigate the waste and fraud that has historically been a part of charitable giving.Transparency And AccountabilityBlockchain-based philanthropy is also addressing social causes that haven’t been well served by traditional systems. Research shows that trust and confidence in charities has dropped. Donors want to see more accountability and assurance that their contributions are making a difference. Tracing funds from the point of donation is a major benefit blockchain can offer.Alibaba, China’s e-commerce conglomerate, developed a blockchain-based donation system called Charities on the Chain. It records donations from Alibaba’s users and lets charities, auditors, donors, media and other parties track information on how donations are being used.Reducing Administrative CostsAdministrative costs have been a point of contention with charities; in some cases, overhead is higher than what is passed along to recipients. One administrative expense is the need for legal and financial intermediaries, which cost time and money. I work in smart contracting, which is a blockchain application intended to digitally facilitate or verify the negotiation or execution of a contract. In my experience, smart contracting can help charities reduce the need for these intermediaries.Transcending Borders Faster And More EfficientlyWith traditional banking channels, sending money internationally can be a complex, multistep process. Transactions on blockchain result in a 40 to 80% reduction in transaction costs and take seconds to process instead of two to three days. Instant cross-border transactions allow charitable organizations to make an impact quickly instead of being held up by red tape.Beyond digital currency, accessing international, immutable forms of identification via blockchain can assist in the screening and verification of volunteers. Accessing verified work history records or other documentation instantly could reduce delays and vastly improve the efficiency of international emergency aid programs. For social good initiatives looking to transcend borders with blockchain, the first step is often determining the unique gaps and inefficiencies that exist. From there, organizations can assess the situation and better determine if blockchain is right for them.Increasing AccessibilityMany of us take for granted our ability to open a bank account, obtain a credit card or get a mortgage. Meanwhile, approximately 2 billion unbanked or underbanked people. Blockchain technology offers an incredible opportunity for people without access to banks. Decentralized digital currencies not only allow fast, easy and low-cost transfers, but they also create a more open financial system.In the Philippines, one of the top five countries to receive overseas remittances, coins.ph allows locals to convert cryptocurrency sent to them by relatives into their local currency. This reduces the costs and settlement times of remittance transfers. While just one example, the benefits of accessibility are truly global, given that inclusive financial systems reduce inequality and bolster economic growth.New Ways To GiveWhile some charities and foundations accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency donations from donors directly, other sites facilitate the donation of cryptocurrencies to good causes through their platform.Donations can include clauses stipulating that money is only transferred if certain conditions are met, and can be tied to fundraising goals or even performance. Alice, a social funding and impact management platform, makes each project’s performance publicly available, allowing donors to find and contribute to social projects that are actually effective.What’s Next?While charities and nonprofits are beginning to see the untapped potential of blockchain technology-based solutions, there are still challenges to overcome.One hurdle facing the blockchain space is regulatory pressure. Policymakers are still attempting to understand the long-term implications of this technology and it is still uncertain how they will choose to regulate it. Ease of use is also a challenge — blockchain technology works differently than traditional systems, resulting in an inevitable learning curve for organizations wanting to explore its potential. More user-friendly projects and accessible information will help simplify the use of blockchain.Security is another key concern. While blockchain is secure, smart contracts are not — so finding ways to address the security challenges around this technology is crucial.Although most use cases are still in their pilot or idea stage, existing use cases demonstrate blockchain’s potential to benefit social initiatives across the globe. It is clear that blockchain technology is here to stay, and the social impact space will need to experiment, adapt and evolve in order to leverage this technology.It will be fascinating to watch this technology unfold and address old challenges with new solutions that were never thought possible."

Photo credit: Getty","Genetics aren’t destiny, the Senate Aging Committee was told today.“We should let the American population know despite their family history and personal genetics, in the vast majority of cases, lifestyle and behavioral changes have the potential to preserve and promote brain health and prevent age-related diseases – not only Alzheimer’s, but also heart disease, diabetes, heart disease and cancers,” Alzheimer’s Genome Project Director Rudolph Tanzi urged the panel.The Harvard Medical School Neurology Professor hypothesized healthy lifestyles could delay Alzheimer’s by years or decades in over 95 percent of those at genetic risk for the disease, but it would take clinical trials to find out for sure.The best-selling author of “Super Genes” and “The Healing Self” gave the following prescription to ward off dementia which he called SHIELD:S stands for 7-8 hours’ sleep, which serves to clear away Alzheimer’s pathology.H is for handling stress, for example, with a meditation practice.I is for interaction with friends. Loneliness increases risk for Alzheimer’s by two-fold.E is for exercise, which induces new nerve cell growth to strengthen brain regions affected in Alzheimer’s disease.L is for learning new things, which increases the number of synapses in your brain, the connections between nerve cells storing your memories. Synapses loss correlates most with the degree of dementia. The more you make, the more you can lose, before you lose it.D is for diet. The best diet for the brain is the Mediterranean diet, which minimizes red meat and is rich in fiber from fruit and vegetables that strengthens bacteria in your gut, or your gut microbiome. And, by the way, a healthy gut microbiome has been shown to reduce brain neuroinflammation, the biggest killer of nerve cells in the brain.Both Tanzi and the Senate Aging Committee Chair, Maine’s Susan Collins, said healthy living including staying engaged physically, socially, and cognitively can reap substantial personal financial rewards by allowing seniors to work longer and cut medical bills.They added some loved ones could be aided financially as well since they wouldn’t have to take time off from work to care for a senior whose chronic illness could have been prevented.The scholar and the Senator warned Alzheimer’s poses a major threat to the economy.“The cost of this disease to our country is approaching 300 billion dollars per year. With the American lifespan up to nearly 80 years, this disease is a burgeoning epidemic that could someday single-handedly collapse our healthcare system,” Tanzi cautioned.The Senate Aging Chair predicted on its current path Alzheimer’s would bankrupt the country."

Trump's China Nightmare Is Coming True For The U.S. Dollar ...","Sep 23, 2019,10:27am EDT","The promise of blockchain technology couldn’t be greater than in the healthcare sector. A prime example is the groundbreaking deployment of blockchain technology by Intermountain Healthcare, a Utah-based, not-for-profit system of 22 hospitals. This medical group has more than 1,600 physicians and advanced practice clinicians at 180 clinics.","Intermountain is using blockchain-based technology coupled with artificial intelligence to identify waste in its massive healthcare system, creating better outcomes for patients, and significant savings all around.According to Frank Ricotta, CEO of BurstIQ, the future of healthcare will be driven by data, and blockchain technology is the enabling foundational technology. He explains, “Blockchain is a trust overlay over the Internet that allows parties to transfer representations of value, like health data, safely and securely.” BurstIQ’s HIPAA compliant blockchain-based platform provides an efficient way for health care organizations to manage, store and analyze big data.Ricotta explains that BurstIQ solved two fundamental challenges that had vexed the healthcare community: supporting large volumes of data and securing the underlying data. BurstIQ’s blockchain-based solution simultaneously enables both granular data ownership, data sovereignty, and privacy, as well as accessibility of data across a highly complex set of stakeholders: patients, health systems, insurers, government agencies, biopharma, digital health solution providers and medical researcher communities. And they do all of this securely and at scale.But BurstIQ doesn’t work in a vacuum. Its partner Empiric Health utilizes machine learning, artificial intelligence and Natural Language Processing to produce data that easily identifies differences in care provided to patients. The technology analyzes the many facets of surgery and connects them to their corresponding outcomes. Armed with accurate data about the effectiveness of the medical care provided, doctors make better decisions about which future treatments to prescribe, with the result being improved outcomes for patients. When Intermountain combined Empiric’s analytic solution with BurstIQ’s blockchain-based platform in the surgical area, they drove down the cost out of surgery, saving the hospital system tens of millions of dollars over a two-year period. And this is just for starters. Empiric’s analytics-enabled technology is now being introduced to new areas in the Intermountain system and across the country.“We are encouraged by the progress our clients are making to reduce costs and improve patients’ outcomes. Every hospital can benefit from this technology. We look forward to working with innovators throughout the U.S. to make this a reality,” said Justin Schaper, Empiric Chief Technology Officer.According to Ricotta, the BurstIQ platform makes access to healthcare data easier, and provides the engine for the many systems that run atop of the platform possible. BurstIQ enforces the security domains. They interface with the healthcare providers’ legacy systems and offer an HL7 interface -- the international standard for the transfer of clinical and administrative data between software applications and healthcare providers -- for the healthcare providers’ electronic medical records systems (EMR), and patient accounting systems. BurstIQ is not the only blockchain provider in the healthcare space, but it appears to be the only blockchain-based solution that has been public about commercially deploying its blockchain-enabled solution in the healthcare sector in the U.S. There are a few other blockchain-based healthcare solution providers, including Guardtime and Oasis Labs. Hyperledger has a health track. IBM is also in the sector building a blockchain-based healthcare ecosystem. Patientory is an app for the storage and secure transfer of healthcare information between patients and healthcare providers. Guardtime’s approach is different from that of BurstIQ. Rather than putting healthcare records on a blockchain, the Guardtime technology takes a hash (think about it as a thumb print) of medical records, and records the hash to the Guardtime blockchain. This is what they are doing in the country of Estonia where all of the medical records are digital. In fact, Guardtime hashes every medical record from every health care provider and facility in Estonia every second. Recording the hashes to a blockchain enables easy detection if medical data has been tampered with. Like BurstIQ, Guardtime is creating applications that aggregate and analyze data from disparate sources and enable parties to share medical data securely and only between those parties that have permissioned access. Ain Aaviksoo, the Chief Medical Officer and General Manager for Guardtime in Estonia, explains that because the medical data is hashed, Estonians trust that medical data is not being misused. According to Aaviksoo, the innovation in the healthcare space starts from the same premise which is that there is a single version of truth about medical data, namely, how and when it was created and by whom. The hash function ensures that the single version of truth is captured at the time it is created. Aaviksoo further explains that you can prevent unauthorized use of medical information by creating rules that safeguard medical information. Aaviksoo suggests that the workflows can be managed by smart contracts, but they can also be solved with less complex technologies. According to Aaviksoo, what is most important is that you create trusted workflows.We are still at the very early stages of blockchain deployment in the healthcare field. But it is heartening to see that large healthcare institutions are collaborating with blockchain innovators to deliver the triad of benefits: better outcomes, better engagement between doctors and patients and cost savings. We can only hope that these results are shared far and wide and that the medical systems in the U.S. take notice. They should start to explore how to leverage the groundbreaking work being done in Utah and Estonia for the benefit of doctors and patients. Both Frank Ricotta and Ain Aaviksoo will be on hand to discuss their blockchain-enabled solutions at an upcoming blockchain-based conference for the healthcare sector. There are many reasons why blockchain-based solutions can get sidelined. But these two individuals have succeeded in making real progress. This is worth a spotlight! When asked about how to get medical professionals interested in blockchain-based solutions, Ricotta stated, “we try to hide all of the blockchain stuff. We make it less scary and focus on solving their problems.” Introducing Forbes Blockchain 50: Learn about the companies investing in the tech that will speed up business processes, increase transparency and potentially save billions of dollars."

Yet, banks continue to thrive by providing consumers and enterprises with critical products and services that underpin the global economy.Put simply, the core business of a bank is using technology to create and distribute information in new ways.A financial instrument is at its core a form of information, and financial institutions are responsible for creating, selling, and servicing these digital products. Put simply, the core business of a bank is using technology to create and distribute information in new ways. Ironically, technology companies share a very similar approach—managing large quantities of digital information; using AI (artificial intelligence) and machine learning (ML) to process data more efficiently; and using that data to attract customers in new ways. So why do tech and banking share such an uneasy relationship? As CEO of one of the largest cloud providers in the world, I think there are new ways we can work together.Historically, it’s true that technology providers have framed their discussions with banks—and the cloud debate, in particular—in reductive ways. We’ve focused on providing lower cost infrastructure, championing how they can implement raw compute, storage, and networking more cheaply and efficiently. We’ve reduced the argument to a cap-ex vs. op-ex exercise. And, in doing so, we’ve discounted how innovative banks, working hand-in-hand with their technology providers, can use new technologies and the cloud as a powerful and transformative platform for their businesses.Today’s digitally savvy banks are using the cloud to process vast quantities of information to rapidly construct and sell financial products that differentiate themselves in a highly competitive market. They’re using real-time market information streamed into extremely large-scale, real-time databases and AI/ML models to quantify and price risk. Every second that is saved in processing this information allows them to offer products at lower cost. Whether built using analysis of vast amounts of market data or by applying algorithms on top of historical user info, innovative banks are leveraging new cloud technologies to understand risk, segment customers, track market movements, create new instruments, and price them differentially. Importantly, banks can also leverage the cloud to become more capable at combating fraud and money laundering. By using more dynamic AI and ML models, rather than static rules-based systems—combined with transactional and behavioral data—banks can now more accurately detect evolving fraud patterns while avoiding costly false positives. Similarly, cloud-based tools are being applied toward banks’ own risk-management systems to calculate liquidity and exposure significantly faster, to perform mark-to-market adjustments, and to help them better balance their books.Of course, it’s easy to forget that customers may stand to benefit the most from cloud-enabled banking. Innovative banks can create experiences that more closely resemble the best digital ones in other industries, such as pre-ordering groceries online or getting recommendations on the best TV shows to stream. For example, imagine a bank automatically suggesting a better interest rate based on your tax situation. Or applying AI to your spending patterns and proactively suggesting a conversation with a financial advisor after your annual bonus hits your checking account. Imagine being able to submit a mortgage application from your mobile phone and getting an approval in minutes. Gone soon will be the days sitting in windowless offices, signing pages-after-pages of paperwork.Today, the cloud is reshaping the technology landscape, and it has the potential to transform banking well beyond core infrastructure. It’s time for tech companies to put aside the counterproductive talk of disruption, and instead work with banks to help them do what they do best—building and delivering great financial products and services to customers. "

I know you come from more of a “big pharma” background. What drew you to UPGRAID? Why now?Helene Rutledge: For most of my career, I challenged the status quo to evolve the health and wellness space. I was fortunate to work at some of the largest companies – GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Nature’s Bounty, New Avon – but I was frustrated by their inability to change, think big, and act fast. And most importantly to me, there was no sense of urgency to give consumers healthier solutions and reduce our society’s chemical addiction. So when I met my cofounder, Justin Kamine, and learned the idea behind UPGRAID, we were immediately aligned. I knew that it would give me the chance to do what so many of us hope – to use our experiences and knowledge to make a difference. I really believe my life has been leading me to this opportunity. I’m proud to represent a movement away from chemicals and to combining real science with real ingredients.  Doherty: Tell me about what kinds of investors you pulled in? What motivated them?Rutledge: Our goal was universally understood and supported by our investors: to reduce our daily chemical consumption and change how consumers think about the pharmaceutical industry. We focused our first product on inflammation because nearly everyone struggles with some sort of aches and discomfort, what we call the daily grind. We were very selective in which investors we engaged. Our first round was quickly oversubscribed, and we wanted investors who are builders and could scale globally. We have an amazing founding team of some of the most influential family offices and entrepreneurs, including, Blue.IO, KDC, and many others who have helped build businesses that have grown and been valued in the $100MM’s+. We believe human capital is our most important attribute. Doherty: Explain the process in assembling such a diverse team of entrepreneurs, how did it add unique value? And where has it posed its challenges?Rutledge: It was fun assembling such a diverse team. Justin’s major value is his network and he set out with me to build what we call “the social avengers,” a group of amazing people with highly specialized skills who all want to better society. Justin literally cold-called me the first time – and within our first meeting, I saw the vision and the passion and jumped in headfirst.He and I are a great yin and yang. I have a science background with deep consumer healthcare and pharma experience, and Justin has entrepreneurial grit and the desire to be a wrecking ball in an “established” industry. Once we had this dynamic, we brought on nutrition experts and strategic revenue and marketing pros. Many have led global companies and scaled social platforms to 40 million users. In a direct-to-consumer business, page views and getting the word out is crucial. So we also brought in social media influencers with nutrition or fitness expertise. Ensuring that they spoke the same message and would be trusted by their audience was important to us. We want honesty and transparency to be everyone’s focus. Justin Kamine, Cofounder of UPGRAID, speaking at the Forbes Impact Summit.Doherty: UPGRAID is an early startup facing well-funded incumbents across multiple sectors, from conventional pharmaceuticals to organic food and health supplements. How do you get it to stand out from the noise?Rutledge: We want to stand out as a company because we’re not just a product – we’re a movement to reduce the use of synthetic chemicals. It’s a much deeper calling for us. We talk about “turning warning labels into positives” and encouraging people to look at things they do every day and make them better. It’s how we treat our own growth as a company, improve daily. We looked at the competitive landscape and saw that consumers don’t really have products that were fully organic and better for your body but with real science behind them. So we created one. At its simplest – we think that building a transparent relationship with our customers about our ingredients is how we earn their trust and stand out from the noise.Doherty: A key part of your go-to-market strategy leverages previous clinical studies of known ingredients - adding scientific credibility while bringing speed and shrinking R&D costs. Doesn’t that make it easier to copy? How do you keep it defensible?Rutledge: First, developing the formula, scaling the product, and getting to market costs a lot. We also think our “unfair advantage” is the 20 people in our company who all have immense experience in building, scaling, and growing companies. Other smaller competitors that could feasibly move quickly lack the financial capital, network, and deeper experience. And the big companies that do have the assets are too invested in the status quo and can’t move fast enough to listen to consumers and navigate a changing environment. But even if competitors start promoting fully organic products, we all win by reducing chemical-based products in the market.Doherty: Some of these dietary supplement brands seem to make miraculous claims without much proof. Does the FDA regulate them? How does honesty fit into your model as you build consumer trust?Rutledge: Dietary supplements are regulated by the FDA but the challenge is they lack the resources to fully enforce at the national level, so there’s a lot of state-level discretion. The FDA does set safety guidelines – but the bar for effectiveness is lower. The rationale is that supplements are generally for healthy people to help them optimize their health whereas drugs are for treating sick people.Responsible supplement companies want to separate themselves from bad actors. Because the government doesn’t always do this, it falls to individual companies to earn consumer trust through transparency, honesty, compliance, and leadership. One way to build trust is to also join industry groups like Natural Products Association and Council for Responsible Nutrition. We belong to both and we also engage in conversations about promoting these issues across the industry.Doherty: Who’s an early role model and how did they influence your career?Rutledge: My dad was my early role model. He was a no-nonsense New York City police sergeant who was very tough but fair. He was the definition of a good cop – he was reviewed without a single finding against him during the days of the Knapp Commission into police corruption. He told me that I could be anything I wanted as long as I worked hard and always did the right thing. He was fiercely intelligent and always challenged me if he thought I was taking the easy way out. I learned the relentless desire to improve and do good things for others from him. It’s followed me through my entire career.Doherty: Overall health and wellness starts with our own selves. How do you practice self-care in the context of a demanding startup? How do you model that for your team?Rutledge: Becoming a mother was the beginning of my journey to better health. I started to scrutinize everything that could impact my unborn baby – nutrition, exercise, and sleep were essential. UPGRAID was so exciting because it fit this overall health mindset. And working out is a great stress release for me as well. Also, at the company, our culture and work-life balance is based on what we have to achieve, not arbitrary office hours or useless meetings. And we have the liberty to change our approach so people can continually work at their best. Admittedly we’re always “on” since start-ups are 24/7 but we’re flexible and there for each other.Doherty: Who’s your Icon of Impact? Rutledge: Ruth Bader Ginsburg has always inspired me. As a female chemical engineer, I was in the minority of my college graduating class. I was often the only woman in the room, whether it was a lab, manufacturing plant, or leadership meeting. RBG rose to the top of a male-dominated field despite her initial resistance and has been an outspoken advocate for gender equality. She is a brilliant woman, and I admire her dedication, tenacity, and refusal to give up."
