",The technical director of a joint local government-private enterprise group in Spain’s Balearic Islands believes that a future whereby tourists in the area pay “for everything” in cryptocurrencies is on its way.,"In an interview with news outlet El Mundo, Fundación Impulsa Technical Director Antoni Riera responded positively to the question: “Do you foresee tourists paying for everything using cryptocurrencies in 20 years’ time?”Riera said that the pace of cryptocurrency adoption in the tourism sector would “depend on how quickly economic paradigms change in [overseas] countries.”However, he added, “I am aware that [crypto pay] is a future scenario that will end up taking place.”The Fundación Impulsa comprises many of the area’s biggest hotel and restaurant chains, as well as a number of major Spanish banks and shopping outlets.The islands – the biggest of which are Mallorca, Menorca, Formentera and Ibiza – welcome some 17.5 million tourists a year.  Many parts of the Balearic Islands are actively looking to embrace crypto pay. An 18th-century palace on Ibiza was placed on the market for BTC 1,850 back in 2017, and an increasing number of Balearic stores, hotels and restaurants have begun accepting bitcoin and altcoins in recent years – while cryptocurrency brokerages and exchanges have also started setting up shop on the islands.As previously reported on Cryptonews.com, Mallorca’s Playa de Palma resort earlier this year unveiled a pilot project whereby crypto ATMs were installed at key tourist hotspots, while eateries and hotels in the resort were equipped with technology that allowed them to process crypto payments.The companies behind the initiative, Criptoarea and Palma Beach, claimed that Playa de Palma would become Europe’s “first tourist resort to operate on cryptocurrencies.”And in another group of Spanish islands popular among tourists both international and domestic, growing blockchain and cryptocurrencies interest has seen the Canary Islands host the region’s first meaningful crypto-conference.Per media outlet Que, locals, Canary Islands-based cryptocurrency and blockchain startup executive and cryptocurrency experts from elsewhere were on hand for interactive sessions at the Nucleo Blockchain summit.Organizers say the event, held on Gran Canaria, was the first in a series of conferences – with more to follow in the near future."

","A banking company claims it will allow Mexican customers to make payments in cryptocurrencies using debit cards. The firm, named Tauros, says its new digital account lets customers keep money in fiat as well as tokens including bitcoin.","Although the company says its new card currently only allows peso transactions, it claims that “in the coming months, customers will be able to make payments in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.”Cryptocurrencies are not legal tender in Mexico, but Tauros says it has a way to get around the problem. According to El Universal, the company states that Mexican law recognizes cryptocurrencies as a “means of storage or value transfer, with which payments can be made.”Many observers have pointed out that demand for crypto pay is likely to increase in Mexico – with new fintech laws coming into effect yesterday.The new regulations effectively outlaw many forms of e-wallet for payment platforms such as PayPal. With the Mexican peso dropping to a new eight-month low against the U.S. dollar last month, and the central bank set to cut interest rates, crypto fever might strengthen in the country.According to Global Digital data, almost 6% of the surveyed Mexican internet users already owned cryptocurrency a year ago – the 16th-highest figure in the world.Mexican interest in cryptocurrencies is outstripped in the region only by Brazil and Colombia, although crypto-fever seems to be spreading fastest in the latter.The companies looking to install 20 new crypto ATMs in Colombia appear to be chomping at the bit, hopeful that customers will prove eager to flee from fiat to crypto.Quoted in La Opinion, Paxful – one of the aforementioned companies – said,“Colombia is our main market in the [Latin American] region. Last month, we processed 30,000 cryptocurrency transactions with sellers located in Colombia. This year, we have seen a growth of 65%, and over USD 1 million has been processed on our platform.”Crypto ownership among the surveyed internet users stood at 7.7% a year ago, also per Global Digital figures.Meanwhile, in Peru, ibitt, another company looking to operate a vast network of cryptocurrency ATMs across the entire Latin American region, has partnered with HTC in a deal that will see the latter’s Exodus 1 smartphone go on sale in the country. Per La Cuarta, the Exodus 1 – which features a hardware wallet from cryptocurrencies – will go on sale from October.ibitt earlier this year began its crypto ATM expansion in Chile and Peru, with multiple machines installed in major cities in both countries."

","On September 23, Bitcoin and digital assets in general took three important steps towards traditional and institutional investors. On the same day when Bakkt, the U.S.-based much-anticipated physically-settled Bitcoin futures trading platform, was finally launched, two giant European stock exchange operators made their crypto moves. (Updated at 13:40 UTC: updates throughout the entire text.)","As for BSDEX, at this stage only selected users in Germany can connect directly to the trading venue, where they can trade the bitcoin-euro pair initially. ""We are opening BSDEX gradually to a larger group of investors. At first, it will be German residents who can connect to BSDEX. In the next step, BSDEX will be opened for investors in other countries of the European Union,"" Dirk Sturz, CEO of Boerse Stuttgart Digital Exchange, which is the technical operator of BSDEX, told Cryptonews.com without elaborating on the timeline in more detail. Boerse Stuttgart Digital Exchange, is a joint venture of Boerse Stuttgart, Axel Springer, a major European publishing house, and finanzen.net, the finance news website owned by Axel Springer.BSDEX plans to add other trading pairs later this year. According to the CEO, BSDEX is now focused on ethereum (ETH), litecoin (LTC), and XRP as trading pairs with euro: ""We will add further trading pairs depending on market feedback.""Moreover, the company is planning to offer trading in other digital, tokenized assets in 2020.The launch of the BSDEX is another step by Boerse Stuttgart in creating an end-to-end ecosystem for digital assets.""The next step is the creation of a primary market platform that will allow companies the issuance of digital tokens, for corporate financing or to represent rights and assets, for instance. The platform will make it possible to issue tokens with standardised and transparent processes,"" Sturz said. The goal of the company is ""to build up the leading European trading venue for those assets"" as ""the market in cryptocurrencies is worth billions, and more digital assets will emerge on the basis of blockchain.""As reported, in May, Boerse Stuttgart added exchange-traded notes (ETN) based on the LTC and XRP, tracking the price in relation to both the euro and the Swedish krona.While the CEO did not comment on trading volume forecast on the new platform in more detail, he stressed that EUWAX, a subsidiary of Boerse Stuttgart, is providing liquidity and tight spreads to the market from day one at BSDEX.The trading volume in all traditional securities at Boerse Stuttgart was EUR 71.2 billion (USD 78 billion) in 2018 and reached EUR 45.7 billion (USD 50 billion) in the first eight months of this year. Meanwhile, SDX said the objective of the prototype is to showcase ""the future of financial markets to the community and obtain feedback as well as demonstrate that a distributed CSD – based on [distributed ledger technology] – can be integrated with a central order-book stock exchange model to ensure fair market conditions for all.""Ahead of full launch in Q4 2020, future releases of the prototype will offer more functionality, with a particular emphasis on asset servicing, in Q1 2020. Early stage functionality will cover digital security token issuance as well as live trading and instant settlement. A second phase of the prototype will be released in the coming months, the company said.“The launch of this prototype is a major milestone in creating a credible digital infrastructure for moving our industry forward. We are now one step closer to demonstrating the viability of our vision for the financial markets of the future and, ultimately, for the way people and businesses access capital,"" Thomas Zeeb, Chairman SDX and Member of the Executive Board at SIX, was quoted as saying in the announcement. In 2018, Zeeb said that crypto is at the same place where financial derivatives were in the early 90s. But it won’t take 30 years to go mainstream - “it will go in maybe five years,” he estimated back then.Separately, highly-anticipated and oft-delayed crypto trading platform Bakkt has finally launched today. We’re live!In the first ten hours since the launch, trading volume on the platform reached BTC 29 (USD 287,700). Jeff Sprecher, CEO and founder of Intercontinental Exchange, the backer of Bakkt, estimates that it will take weeks or months before Bakkt's Wall Street audience judges its production a hit or a flop.#Will the #Bitcoin market see positive effect from the @Bakkt futures this year?"

","Free money from Stellar’s airdrops is either left unclaimed or it’s exchanged to other currencies, says crypto market analysis firm Coin Metrics, calling into question the efficiency of airdrops. ","Companies use airdrops in order to gain popularity, recognition, free advertisement, to incentive investors and holders, as well as to improve an asset’s decentralization and/or to share a certain amount of its asset fairly to individuals for free use, but how effective are they if most of the coins is sold right away, asks Coin Metrics.Their latest analysis of Stellar’s Blockchain.com and Keybase.io airdrops revealed an interesting trend:  At the genesis of Stellar, the analysis finds, 100 billion Lumens (the native token, XLM) were created and given to the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), which then shared them over the years, but some 20 billion of the 100 billion are outside of SDF control currently.Just recently, Keybase and Stellar partnered for what is likely the largest giveaway of Stellar’s native token, Lumens (XLM) – a total of XLM 2 billion – though up to that point, the price of XLM dropped 76% since Stellar’s first airdrop was announced. Before that, cryptocurrency wallet and data provider Blockchain.com announced a massive airdrop of USD 125 million in XLM, among Blockchain’s 30M wallets. Since airdrop senders cover the fees, they just need a list of addresses, and not necessarily the recipients’ permissions. “However, this also means that the airdropped currency may never be claimed since some receiving addresses may be inactive or uninterested,” says the analysis.In the case of Blockchain.com airdrop, two addresses were used to airdrop XLM, between November 6th 2018 and July 15th 2019, when the airdrop finished. These two accounts created 1.2 million accounts and credited them with around XLM 400 million, and “when valuing the XLM at the time it was credited, we find that overall, Blockchain.com airdrop claimants received USD 45.7 million.” As of September 23rd:In the case of Keybase airdrop, it was found that all the XLM 100 million were pre-distributed to 274,864 accounts between September 9th and 14th, in two batches. The conclusions are that:Currently ranked 10th by the total market capitalisation, Stellar trades (13:29 UTC) at USD 0.06. It dropped 6.5% in the past 24 hours, but appreciated almost 3% in the past week. It's still down by 12% in the past month and by 76% in the past 12 months."

","Improving user experience is one of the main focus areas at Kraken this year and the popular, U.S.-headquartered cryptocurrency exchange plans “major change” in the next 2-6 months, Dan Held, Director of Business Development of the company, told Cryptonews.com. ","“User experience is where we struggled in the past, and I think that's something that we've recognized. We were really, really actively working to solve that. So, we're excited for what we have coming out - I can't tell you exactly what we're working on, but it's gonna be a major change,” Held said during an interview at the Baltic Honeybadger conference in Riga, Latvia, in September. The Director did not specify what new products the company might launch only adding that “it's around user experience, <...> around different types of financial instruments, or different trading pairs that people will be looking for.""Also, besides expanding their reach by entering new countries, adding new digital assets, Kraken is focusing on bringing liquidity into a specific trading pair: “That's our bread and butter as an exchange - but being the most liquid for certain pair is how we're strategically thinking through it.”As for competition, their main competitors are “different depending on the geography.” In either case, according to Held, “we see ourselves as pretty well-positioned in the U.S. and in Europe.”Talking of the Binance.US's debut in the U.S., the Director said that Kraken has “a pretty competitive offering” and “it'll be interesting to see what happens."" Dan Held joined Kraken this past summer after the exchange acquired Interchange, a company co-founded by Held. Interchange, which offers professional-grade accounting and portfolio reconciliation tools for digital asset markets, now operates as a separate product at Kraken.

are clear: the vast majority of bitcoin volume here is entirely fake.“.","
September 24, 2019
","After Blockchain Transparency Institute (BTI), the group of anonymous blockchain data researchers and enthusiasts, reported that a large majority of cryptocurrency exchange OKEx's volume is fake, the exchange’s CEO Jay Hao wants to challenge this claim with a bet worth BTC 100 (USD 970,000). The reactions to both the accusations and the bet are numerous and various, but earlier reports on wash trading don't provide a clear answer to this debate either.","A challenge was issued via Twitter, by which Hao wants BTI to either accept the bet or apologies for the allegations of wash trading. If they do accept the bet, Hao claims that the exchange will pay 100 BTC if it’s not able to prove that 10+% of their volume is real. If they can, the group has to pay the same amount to OKEx. The main goal here, Hao emphasizes, is to prove BTI wrong.The CEO’s bet comes as a reaction to BTI’s recent September 2019 Washtrade Report, which currently (13:00 UTC) can’t be accessed (the entire website seems to be down at the moment). However, as we have previously reported, BTI claims the ""cleanest"" exchanges to still be Kraken, Poloniex, Coinbase and Upbit, while OKEx and Bibox lead the exchanges with the highest percentage of wash trading in their ranking, which means that fake volumes of these exchanges exceed 75%. Head of Operations of OKEx, Andy Cheung, also denied the accusations, calling the group's report “false,” saying that they ""are NOT involved in and do NOT tolerate any wash trading activities at OKEx,"" that the methodology used is “highly questionable,” and that the BTI is not transparent on their website. (As previously reported, the website of the project does not disclose who the members of this for profit group are.)  “Considering our unique market structure, one cannot expect to use a methodology that lacks comprehensiveness to yield an accurate result. You don't measure everything with the same ruler,” said Cheung.For their part, answering a repeated question posed by Tai Zen, CEO of Cryptocurrency Market, whether they have a direct access to the analyzed exchanges’ books and order matching engines, BTI explained in their Twitter post that they have over a year of data, that their “algorithms are tailored depending on many variables between exchanges,” and that they “do consult with exchanges on their routing, matching and execution engines.” Finally, Zen asked again if they “have DIRECT ACCESS to their routing, matching and execution engines because if u do not have direct access to it I refuse to believe you can reliably determine what trades are washed and what trades are legit,” to which BTI replied that “yes you cannot definitely say of course 100% without those account details, which is why we have margins of error (after many months of analysis) and we BTI Verify exchanges under 10%.”I'm asking u guys these questions cuz u guys claim ""transparency"" on ur site but I can not find anything about  ur team or how ur able to derive the wash trading data claims you are making.If I can verify that ur methodologies are ""feasible"" I want to share it with our viewers.Don't think the methodologies and algos you posted at https://t.co/zpm4V0KPVV explains anything in specific.""CMC still lists numerous scam exchanges in its Top-10 “Adjusted Volume” rankings"" @CoinMarketCap thoughts?As these are heavy allegations, it remains to be seen if and how BTI will respond and if they will provide the detailed methodology behind this analysis, used to arrive to the figures reported. It’s also still unclear if they will accept the bet.We have asked both OKEx and BTI for a comment and will update should there be a reply.Quite a few people seem to have been confused by the 10% part of the bet, asking the CEO why he doesn’t prove that the higher percentage of volume is real, if not all, but Hao claims this is just the beginning, as they’re “now only proving BTI wrong. We'll show how liquid our markets are next.” People have also found fault in the CEO’s math, saying that if BTI claims the exchange has only 10% real volume and the CEO aims to prove that 10% of the volume is real, it validates BTI’s claim, or at the very least does not invalidate it.HONESTLY if you want your credentials back, then prove 90% is real.Simple as that10% allowed for errorBut saying you will prove 10% is actually laughable AFThis is hilarious, all you have to do is look at the recent IEO volumes to see that it's all wash trading. And don't come with your 'its the way instos purchase' bsSupporters, however, find it laughable that somebody would accuse a major exchange like OKEx of being illegitimate, that any research would prove OKEx credible and that BTI will eventually apologize, and they believe the bet is fair.OKEx has the most various products. The trading system of OKEx which has been updated for twice is more stable and faster than other exchanges. Creating wash trades is common in small exchanges, but not OKEx.This is the only way BTI could come to fame, by talking shit about big player in the industry! BTI, if there is any merit in your report then accept the 100 BTC challenge by @JayHao8Wash trading has been a constant issue since the inception of the Cryptoverse, and many have tried battling it by reporting on the suspicious behavior. In August, we’ve reported that CryptoCompare, a provider of the crypto market data, found that top-ranked exchanges, graded AA, are Coinbase, Poloniex, Bitstamp, bitFlyer, Liquid and itBit, while those ranked A include OKEx, Binance, Kraken, etc. Before that, in June, CrypoCompare, came out with the top 10 ""most trusted and reliable exchanges."" OKEx wasn't on their top 10 list, but it is currently on the 13th spot and is still rated with an A.In May, crypto investment company Bitwise Asset Management, analyzed 83 cryptocurrency exchanges, out of which only 10 passed their wash trading test, with OKEx not being one of them. Their report stated that “the Trade Size Histogram for OKEx is notably suspicious,“ but that “the clincher, however, is the Volume Spike Analysis. OKEx’s volume graph shows a wall of nearly constant hourly volume that betrays none of the natural rhythms of the reference exchanges; even the “spike” on May 3 is extremely muted compared to our reference exchanges. While there may be a smattering of real bitcoin volume on OKEx, the charts are clear: the vast majority of bitcoin volume here is entirely fake.“""Same bet with them if they're willing to take it,"" OKEx CEO said."

",Kin prices have been sent tumbling after the coin's operator announced it will shut down its Kik messaging app.,"In a blog post, Kik Interactive's CEO Ted Livingston stated that regulatory pressure from the American Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had sparked the decision.However, the CEO did not specify when the app will be closed, only adding that Kin has over 2,000,000 monthly active earners, and 600,000 monthly active spenders. Kin prices took a sharp turn downwards after the news broke, with its 24-hour price rate depreciating by almost 25% after what had been a mostly steady and stable week for the token, ranked 381st by market capitalization.Livingston wrote, as a justification of Kik Interactive’s decision,“After 18 months of working with the SEC, the only choice they gave us was to either label Kin a security or fight them in court. Becoming a security would kill the usability of any cryptocurrency and set a dangerous precedent for the industry.”The CEO stated that the SEC is “working to characterize almost all cryptocurrencies as securities” – thus forcing token operators to abide by American securities laws that date back almost a century.In a scathing attack on the regulator, Livingston wrote that the SEC had taken his company’s quotes “out of context to manipulate the public to view us as bad actors,” and “pressured exchanges not to list Kin.” He also alleged that the SEC had used underhand tactics, “drawing out a long and expensive process to drain [the company’s] resources.” The company stated that in addition to shutting down the Kik app, it would also be reducing its staff to just 19 – with 70 employees working on the Kin blockchain project in Tel Aviv, Israel, handed layoff notices yesterday, per media outlet Calcalist Tech.As reported in January 2018, Kik Interactive, intends to fight the SEC in court over the categorization of their token as a security, arguing that “the tokens represent a new kind of asset that shouldn’t be subject to the same rules as stock or bond offerings.” A legal battle like this could help determine the scope of the SEC’s authority over the ICO (initial coin offering) market and set legal precedent for future cases.In May, the Kin Foundation, developer of the Kin Ecosystem, set aside USD 5 million for the legal battle.The cryptocurrency that Kik created, Kin, enjoyed one of the most high profile ICOs of 2017, when it raised almost USD 100 million in September 2017."

","Another victim of the abrupt drop that painted the market red is Ripple's XRP, which reverted to the levels seen all the way back at the end of 2017. ","While ether, the second largest token by market capitalization, certainly suffered this week, the third largest coin, XRP, is not doing any better. It has seen almost a 12% drop in the last 24 hours (11:09 UTC) and more than 22% in the last week. That brought it to the current price of below USD 0.24. The last time we’ve seen it this low was in December 2017. XRP price chart:Moving to a closer period of time though, XRP’s price exactly a year ago was USD 0.52, and though it had been rising and falling since, it hasn’t reached that number again so far and is down by 47%. Looking at the levels in the last quarter alone, what we notice is actually a gradual drop all the way till the short-lived September rally. In the last week, like many altcoins, XRP appreciated on September 17th, rising by 24% to USD 0.31 on September 18th, before starting to drop to its current levels. But observing the week leading up to the rally, the price was quite stable, with the usual fluctuations, moving between USD 0.25 and USD 0.26. It is also interesting to note that XRP was among seven of the top 10 coins that saw its trading volume increase in September during the rally, compared to the August values.Like we’ve seen with the reactions to the ETH drop, the opinions on XRP’s next move are also quite divided, but in general – nobody seems to be particularly worried. The ardent supporters insist that the levels are guaranteed to be higher again. Many of them believe that, a drop or not, Ripple will continue to expand and improve its product, boosting the native token’s price. Some blame the institutional involvement and are calling for people to hodl, and others believe this lowest price of the year is the perfect shopping time. Others, though, are not that optimistic, expecting a further drop.Meanwhile, the past month was somewhat mixed for XRP in terms of news:_____A few more reactions to the recent price drop coming out of the Cryptoverse:$XRP update:A heartfelt sorry from me to the XRP community. pic.twitter.com/6LT9HrGvoP__First got #XRP in 2017 at .26 and it fell to .20 then climbed to all time high...you haven’t lost anything unless you’re panic selling.__But then the ecosystem would also stop growing."
