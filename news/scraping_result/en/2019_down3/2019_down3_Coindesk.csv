In addition, $30 billion has been drawn out of the market over a 24-hour period as investors sought to close their positions amid a frenzied sell-off.Eyes are now firmly fixed on the 200-day moving average (MA) that would officially mark the start of a new bear market should a strong close below $8,311 occur.The price drop may have been exacerbated by margin calls and contract liquidations on Bitmex, according to a previous report by CoinDesk.In any case, BTC’s 2019 bull market hangs on a thread.As can be seen above, BTC has begun to break down from a bearish descending triangle that had been noted by a large portion of the crypto Twitter community since as early as Sept 2.Further, the $1,000 price drop flies in the face of Bakkt’s recent futures launch, which was supposed to be a bullish catalyst but has so far fallen short of expectations.Technicals point to the possibility of a short-term bounce, courtesy of an extreme oversold RSI on the daily chart and weaker histogram bars below 0. However, a measured move (the drawdown from peak to trough within the triangle) adds scope for a continuation to prior June 2018 supports near $6,100.Pressure is on buyers to hold the defensive and retain the official bullish status above the 200-day moving average at $8,311.All prices below that point would add credence to a new bear market for the remainder of 2019.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; chart via Trading View"

low-volatility consolidation represented by the narrowing of Bollinger ...","Sep 24, 2019 at 11:00 UTC","Bitcoin’s recent low-volatility price squeeze has ended with a downside break that may see the cryptocurrency drop to the August low of $9,320 in the short-term.","The top cryptocurrency had been largely trading in a very narrow range ($9,600–$10,500) in the 11 days to Sept. 21.As a result, BTC’s price volatility, as represented by the spread between the Bollinger bands, dropped to the lowest level in over four months last week. Bollinger bands are volatility indicators placed two standard deviations above and below the price’s 20-day moving average.A low-volatility period often paves the way for a big move on either side. In BTC’s case, the big move has happened to the downside. Bitcoin fell by 3.38 percent on Monday – the biggest single-day loss since Aug. 29 as per Bitstamp data – and closed (UTC) well below the lower Bollinger band, confirming a downside break of the low-volatility consolidation.Prices hit a low of $9,600 earlier today and continue to trade below the lower Bollinger band, currently at $9,767.So, the sellers have come out victorious in a close tug of war with the bulls and a deeper drop could be in the offing. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $9,730 on Bitstamp.The spread between the Bollinger bands narrowed to $656 on Sept. 21, the lowest since May – a squeeze that’s now ended with a price breakdown.The path of least resistance is therefore to the downside and BTC could challenge support at $9,320 (Aug. 29 low) in the next couple of days. On the way lower, the cryptocurrency may find support at $9,388 – the lower edge of a three-month contracting triangle.Supporting the bearish case is the sub-50 reading on the 14-day relative strength index. Further, the MACD histogram is charting deeper bars below the zero line – a sign of strengthening bearish momentum.A UTC close below $9,388 would confirm a contracting triangle breakdown and may yield a deeper sell-off below $9,000.The bearish outlook would be invalidated if prices rise above $10,380 – the high of a bullish hammer that formed on Sept. 19.That said, a break above the upper edge of the contracting triangle, currently at $10,692, is needed to revive the bullish outlook. A triangle breakout, if confirmed, would imply a resumption of the rally from April’s low near $4,000 and open the doors for a sustained break above key resistance at $12,000.BTC defended support of the Sept. 19 low of $9,600 earlier today.If the support level continues to hold ground in the U.S. trading hours, the cryptocurrency may rise back toward $9,900, as the RSI is hovering very close to the oversold territory (below 30).Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View"
2,www.coindesk.com,"Sep 23, 2019",Bitcoin Price Indicator is Most Bearish Since December,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-indicator-is-most-bearish-since-december,"Bitcoin's weekly moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is 
reporting strongest bearish bias since December, suggesting ...","Sep 23, 2019 at 11:30 UTC","Bitcoin’s three-months of sideways trading may soon end with a notable price drop, as key indicator is reporting strongest bearish bias in nine months.","The leading cryptocurrency’s stellar rally from April’s low of $4,000 ran out of steam at highs above $13,880 at the end of June. Since then, BTC has produced a series of lower highs well above $11,000 and higher lows in $9,000 to $10,000 range.With a reward halving (supply cut) due next year, many investors are expecting the ongoing consolidation to end with a bullish breakout. The cryptocurrency is also expected to receive a boost from Bakkt’s launch of physically-settled bitcoin futures.However, the weekly MACD histogram – an indicator used to identify trend changes and the momentum of the bearish or bullish movement – is calling a range breakdown.The histogram crossed below zero in August, confirming a bullish-to-bearish trend change and is now seen at -206, the lowest level since the last week of December 2018, as seen in the chart below.The bearish bias is currently the strongest in nine-months, according to the MACD.Technical analysts would argue that the MACD is based on moving averages and tends to lag price. While that is true, the indicator has produced reliable trend reversal signals in the past.For instance, the indicator crossed above zero in February, indicating a bullish reversal and the cryptocurrency broke into a bull market with a high-volume move to $5,000 in the first week of April.In another example, the MACD crossed below zero and fell to -8.18 in the second week of November 2018, following which prices fell sharply below $5,000.Also, other indicators are aligning in favor of the bears. Notably, the chaikin money flow index, which incorporates both prices and volumes, is currently seen at 0.08, the lowest level since April 8, meaning the buying pressure at is at the weakest in 5.5 months.BTC created a bullish hammer last Thursday, but so far, that has failed to draw bids. In fact, the follow-through has been bearish – prices are currently down more than $400 from the hammer candle’s high of $10,480.Here too, the MACD has crossed below zero and the 14-day relative strength index is reporting bearish conditions with a below-50 print.BTC, therefore, risks falling to the contracting triangle support, currently at $9,482. A UTC close below that level could yield a sell-off to levels below $9,000.Meanwhile, a high-volume close above the upper edge, currently at $10,758 would imply a resumption of the bull market and open the doors for $12,000.As of writing, BTC is changing hands around $9,920 on Bitstamp.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via CoinDesk Archives; charts by Trading View"

Reeves said that capital will go towards cementing partnerships, both in the cryptocurrency and retail space.“We’ll be rolling out subscription options for merchants and consumers soon that will provide premium services and highest rewards,” Reeves said, adding:“When people spend fiat at retailers they will receive BTC rewards. They can spend those rewards or withdraw them to an on-chain address. In the future, we are releasing an update that allows people to withdraw rewards directly to lightning, which will lower fees and make it more usable.”In short, the app can be connected to a debit card for bitcoin-back on regular purchases through the app, or users can send bitcoin to the Fold App from their independent wallets. A mobile Fold App with the full features currently available via desktop, Reeves added, is slated for launch in October. Until then, the mobile app is also available to users that sign up through Fold’s website for early access.CoinShares co-founder Meltem Demirors told CoinDesk Fold App is unique, compared to other retail-focused bitcoin apps, because it encourages users to use non-custodial wallets.“I’m excited to work not only with Fold, but also with our community of portfolio companies, corporate partners, and other service providers to build an integrated user experience around bitcoin payments,” she said.While there are several other retail-focused crypto apps gaining traction, like Lolli and Flexa, Fold is the most focused on lightning payments. Fold App is already integrated with two lightning-friendly wallets, BlueWallet and Breez. This is what attracted Fulgur Ventures partner Oleg Mikhalsky to the investment.“We believe the lightning network has the ability to become an interesting payments rail for various applications due to features like instant final settlement, cost-efficient micro-transactions, the ability to ‘stream’ payments and the support of other assets over Lightning in the future,” Mikhalsky told CoinDesk, adding:“We, as investors, are in a learning mode as well. We’re placing our bets on different types of applications and models and learning from them. Supporting startups that experiment with how to drive adoption is one of our priorities.”Lolli told CoinDesk in July that it, too, was planning to eventually add lightning options. So it remains to be seen how the retail app race will play out.In the meantime, Fold is offering a type of crypto training wheels to retailers like Macy’s, Target and Amazon. On the merchant side, they only see a payment processed by Fold, not the users’ credit card or bitcoin wallet address. This offers more privacy than directly shopping via the merchant’s website. Fold then cashes out the payment for merchants, which typically choose to receive the value in fiat.“We can settle in fiat or bitcoin, yet all major merchants choose to settle in fiat now so they don’t take volatility risk or accounting overhead,” Reeves said, adding:“Fold can seamlessly transition them when they are ready because we are already directly integrated into their point-of-sale systems.”Macy’s image via Shutterstock"

Russian law firm ZP Legal, which claimed it could recover up to ...","Sep 24, 2019 at 09:00 UTC",The Takeaway:,"A Russian law firm’s audacious proposal for recovering up to $2 billion stolen from Mt. Gox in return for a steep fee has divided the failed bitcoin exchange’s creditors.A minority of creditors have decided it’s better to take a chance on Moscow-based ZP Legal than sit and wait for Nobuaki Kobayashi, Mt. Gox’s court-appointed trustee in Japan, to finish the corporate restructuring process.According to Alexander Zheleznikov, ZP Legal’s managing partner, creditors holding claims for a combined 15,000 BTC (worth $150 million at current prices) have signed up for his firm’s services. That’s less than 8 percent of the bitcoin he claims he might recover. (Any recovered funds would most likely be repaid in fiat.) Applications to ZP Legal were due Sept. 22.  However, many viewed the offer with skepticism, especially given the hefty fees ZP Legal has been asking for: 50 to 75 percent of the recovered funds, depending on how much each creditor gets, plus $320 per hour, charged only in the case of success.“While a small number of creditors have already signed up with ZP Legal, it seems the more prevalent view among creditors is strong criticism,” Kim Nilsson, a creditor, told CoinDesk. “The fee they’re asking feels unconscionably high given that these are people’s lost savings we’re talking about.”As CoinDesk previously reported, ZP Legal approached Mt. Gox Legal (MGL), an association representing the creditors, in February, via then-head of MGL Andy Pag.The proposition, in short, was to leverage the previously established connection between the 2014 Mt. Gox hack and defunct Russian crypto exchange BTC-e, where some of the 750,000 stolen bitcoins ended up.ZP Legal offered to file police reports in Russia on the creditors’ behalf. Then, creditors would have to wait for alleged BTC-e operator Alexander Vinnik to get extradited to Russia and for the police to find the other culprits — with ZP Legal’s help. The thieves would either plead guilty and return the stolen funds to receive lighter sentences, or get convicted and then be sued by creditors for damages.But in addition to the fees, a number of other things about the proposal have spooked creditors.For example, the vague language of ZP Legal’s proposal felt manipulative, Nilsson said. “The sales pitch has rather been that there are no options, ‘just trust us, this is an exclusive deal with only limited availability, better hurry and sign up,’ and so forth.”Lawyer and Mt. Gox creditor Daniel Kelman also questioned the way ZP Legal communicated about its tactics to the creditors.“These lawyers have treated their engagement like it’s a mystery box, asking us to first gamble with a majority of our right to recovery before we can take their legal strategy out of its package,” Kelman wrote in his blog.This approach made many creditors feel “not so much being served as clients but rather being served up for dinner,” Nilsson wrote, adding:“The money being pursued here were life-altering losses to many people, and just because we didn’t expect more of it to be recovered doesn’t mean we might as well not need it back and are happy for our ‘saviors’ to help themselves to the lion’s share of it. In short, don’t reach for blood money quite so casually.”Another issue with the offer, Nilsson went on, is that while the civil rehabilitation process is designed to compensate all the creditors with approved claims, the plan ZP has been proposing will benefit only those who choose to sign up for it.At the same time, according to a Telegram chat for Mt. Gox creditors, people are worried about what happens if some creditors choose to use both ZP Legal’s service and the Japanese court’s civil rehabilitation process, potentially ending up in a better situation than others.“Most creditors want any and all recoveries to be done on behalf of all creditors and shared equally on a pro-rata basis. I think we can expect severe conflicts between different ‘classes’ of creditors if a subset of creditors pursue this Russian recovery separately and keep the money,” Nilsson explained.According to Zheleznikov himself, his firm has been in talks with the trustee’s team about the possible collaboration. However, it’s not clear if any common plan of action has been or is expected to be worked out. The next meeting of the creditors with the trustee is scheduled for Oct. 1 and expected to clarify the situation.It’s also not clear how legal procedures in Japan and Russia would work together in such a case, and if any legal action ZP Legal might take conflict with the process in Japan, which deals with the obligations of Mt. Gox as an entity and doesn’t stipulate any form of individual compensation directly from third parties.Still other creditors decided to pursue the “Russian recovery” path, but with a firm that would work cheaper. Mt. Gox creditor Frank Lee told CoinDesk he found a Moscow-based lawyer named Ivan Bunik, of the law firm Timofeev, Farenvald and Partners, who agreed to look into the case.According to the creditors’ Telegram chat, Bunik would represent the creditors in Russia for “either $200 per hour for work performed with a maximum cap of $7,000 per month (including outside services) or 25 percent of eventual recovery, whichever is greater.”When reached by CoinDesk, Bunik refused to comment on the situation, except to say no agreement had been signed yet.The main question, in the meantime, remains whether the strategy ZP Legal presented to the creditors is feasible.Cryptocurrency currently has no legal status in Russia, and actual criminal cases related to bitcoin are rare. According to Gleb Plesovskikh, head of Plesovskih and Partners law firm, the regulatory uncertainty makes recovering stolen crypto in Russia problematic.“There have been some criminal cases related to cryptocurrencies in Russia, but they were based on the current criminal law, so the criminal activities have been classified as illegal banking services or money laundering, for example,” Plesovskikh, a former law enforcement officer, told CoinDesk.He added that in such cases, Russian law enforcement would rather investigate the mentioned conventional crimes than “the theft of crypto-assets from a foreign company.”As for ZP Legal’s strategy, the creditors should “read between the lines,” Plesovskikh said:“It’s something that is obvious for the lawyers working with our law enforcement system: once the ‘culprits’ are found and a certain pressure is applied to them with the help of the law enforcement, to ease their fate, they will volutеer to return the stolen funds.”For example, Plesovskikh said he once represented the investors of a failed initial coin offering (ICO) in Russia, and after being called up by the police, the ICO launchers offered to return the money, to prevent a criminal case from opening.Zheleznikov mentioned a similar tactic describing ZP Legal’s work with users of the failed crypto exchange WEX, the successor to BTC-e. According to him, the sides also reached a settlement without a criminal investigation.“There are for sure some chances of success with this case, but let’s face the reality: most likely, there won’t be any actual criminal case on the crypto-assets theft as such,” Plesovskikh said of ZP Legal’s Mt. Gox proposal.Zheleznikov himself has acknowledged ZP Legal can’t guarantee a successful recovery for the Mt. Gox creditors, that the firm will be operating in a legal grey zone and that the strategy might take years to bear fruit.In the meantime, some of the creditors suspect that the whole operation ZP Legal is planning has a totally different objective: boosting the chances that Vinnik will be extradited to Russia instead of the U.S., by presenting more victims on the Russian side. He is currently detained in Greece.According to this theory, the Russian government wants to prevent Vinnik from falling into the hands of the FBI due to the role BTC-e played in at least one story involving the Russian political elite.Fancy Bear, the hacker group linked to Russian intelligence that attacked the Democratic National Committee email server during the 2016 presidential campaign, purchased bitcoin on BTC-e to fund its operations, according to an investigation by the BBC and Elliptic.(President Vladimir Putin’s press secretary Dmitri Peskov denied any affiliation between the Russian authorities and Fancy Bear. “We are unaware what kind of hackers they refer to, we do not know what this interference entails,” Peskov told the Russian news agency Interfax last August.)Whatever the motivation, Russia’s interest in getting Vinnik back has been expressed at the highest level. In January, Putin personally raised the issue during talks with the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, according to Russian news outlet RIA Novosti.“The conclusion of Vinnik’s extradition may be influenced by [Greece’s] decision to take into consideration of how many victims and financial damages each country has,” Mt. Gox creditor Lee wrote in a blog post.Zheleznikov’s clients include high-profile individuals such as the oligarch Konstantin Malofeev, an alleged sponsor of the pro-Russian separatist forces in Ukraine, and the police investigator Pavel Karpov, sanctioned by the U.S. following the Magnitsky Act.However, he denied that getting Vinnik extradited to Russia is his primary goal.Zheleznikov told CoinDesk his aim has been to “form the legal practice, help the creditors and, in case of success, make money,” concluding:“If Vinnik’s extradition helps the case, we’re glad to see any legal event helping our plans, but the extradition itself is not our goal and we don’t represent Vinnik’s interests.”Alexander Vinnik image via Shutterstock"

The SEC listed a number of questions for the general public, including what individuals think of the suggestion that the CME bitcoin reference rate is not susceptible to manipulation.The SEC began taking comments on the proposal in June, and records show that only six individuals have submitted responses, both in support of and against allowing a bitcoin ETF.(One comment appears exasperated with the process, with an anonymous submitter writing only, “FOR GOD SAKE just approve this bitcoin etf — THIS IS BEEN GOING ON FOREVER…”)According to another public filing, Wilshire Phoenix executives, NYSE Arca employees and members of the Seward & Kissel law firm met with SEC staffers earlier in September.The SEC faces a final deadline to approve or disapprove a bitcoin ETF proposed by Bitwise Asset Management in the middle of October.The company has filed a number of reports with the SEC in an effort to convince the regulator that the bitcoin market is mature enough to support such a product. It remains unclear whether the regulators are convinced of this fact, however. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton recently said that, while the bitcoin market has made steps to mature, there is still “work to be done” before a bitcoin ETF can be approved.VanEck and SolidX, which also faced a mid-October deadline, pulled their joint bitcoin ETF proposal earlier this month. VanEck Director of Digital Asset Strategies Gabor Gurbacs later said that bringing such a product “remains a top priority,” though he did not indicate if the companies would file the ETF proposal for a third time (the proposal was previously withdrawn during the prolonged government shutdown at the beginning of 2018).Regarding the Wilshire Phoenix proposal, the SEC has a legally mandated 180 days from the date the filing was first published in the Federal Register to make a decision. The 180-day countdown began July 1, which gives the Commission until Dec 28, 2019, to make a decision.Correction (Sept. 25, 17:10 UTC): The SEC has 180 days from the date the filing was originally published in the Federal Register to decide on the Wilshire Phoenix bitcoin ETF proposal, not 35 days from now, as was previously reported. Once the 180 days have passed, the SEC can extend the deadline for up to an additional 60 days, according to a Wilshire Phoenix representative.SEC image via Shutterstock"

It expects to have delivered 200,000 by the end of this month.The WhatsMiner M20 series are priced at between $1,500 to $2,000, which means the delivery of a total of 200,000 units would be worth around $350 million (assuming equal sales between both models). Currently, investors placing pre-orders for new mining equipment will have to wait until January 2020 to receive the products.While Yang did not indicate an approximate gross margin for WhatsMiner’s sales, industry rivals including Avalon miner maker Canaan and AntMiner maker Bitmain both have had a gross profit margin of about 50 percent for 2017, based on the firms’ financial disclosures made in initial public offering filings in 2018.The WhatsMiner series has the computing capability of about 55 tera hashes per second (TH/s) on average, so 200,000 miners could contribute about 11 exahashes per second (EH/s) to the total bitcoin hash rate.Since mid June, the bitcoin network’s mining power has jumped by over 30 EH/s, or about 60 percent, in part thanks to the cheap hydropower electricity in China’s southwestern region, as well as bitcoin’s price bull run this year.Yang went on to estimate that, including delivery of mining equipment from major miner manufacturers up until the end of the year, the total network has rate could increase by another 30 percent, saying:“In a short term, based on information I have seen and based on our current production capacity, the bitcoin network’s total hash rate is estimated to reach 120 EH/s by the end of this year.”Yang’s comments were, in part, a response to concerns that some of the products that should have been delivered between July and September had been delayed.Bowing to the audience as an apology, Yang explained the holdup was due to a delay from its chip supplier, Samsung.“The existing issues with the delay will likely be mitigated by late October. The entirely supply chain should have a primary, secondary and third supplier. This year we only have one supplier so our hands are also tied. Currently, the rapid development of 5G network has resulted in a major delay [of chips prioritized for MicroBT],” he told the audience.Indeed, the supply capacity from chip manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), as well as Samsung, remains a major bottleneck for the production capacity of all cryptocurrency miner makers.“Honestly, crypto miner manufacturers are still behind other electronic device makers like smartphones, PCs and computers. The supply [for us] is very tight,” Yang said.Yang Zuoxing image courtesy of Poolin event"

Ransomware attacks increased 118 percent in 2019, equaling 504 new threats per minute, in the first quarter, according to a McAfee report.WannaCryFake is a variant of the infamous WannaCry ransomware that targeted Microsoft computers in 2017. It locks victims’ files using AES-256, or the advanced encryption standard.An infected victim will receive a message that says:“You have to pay for decryption in bitcoins.

Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.,"The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.—————Last week, the Federal Reserve injected $278 billion into the securities repurchase, or “repo,” market over four days, all so that banks could meet their liquidity needs. It was the first time the Fed had intervened in this vital interbank market, where banks’ pawn financial assets to fund overnight cash needs, since the financial crisis of 2008.Fed officials and bankers dismissed the rare liquidity breakdown as a hiccup stemming from a series of coincidental factors in bond markets and corporate tax payments. It wasn’t a very comforting explanation, not when other economic warning signs are flashing, too: $17 trillion in bonds worldwide showing negative yields; a worsening U.S.-China trade war; and manufacturing indicators signaling an impending global recession.Predictably, certain crypto types have viewed this alarming scenario with glee. More than a few HODLing tweeters responded to the repo story with two words of advice: “buy bitcoin.”But it’s actually hard to predict what all this means for crypto markets, at least in the short- to medium-term.If and when a 2008-like financial panic takes hold, will bitcoin rally as a new kind of uncorrelated “safe haven” or will it decline in a broad-based “risk-off” dumping of all things speculative? (Notwithstanding a sharp dip and rebound midway through last week, bitcoin has proven quite stable of late, at least by its own volatile standards.)Other questions: do these vulnerabilities in traditional credit markets highlight the promise of new blockchain-based ideas? For example, would wider use of security tokens allow speedier settlement and, by extension, reduced counterparty risks and greater market confidence? Or, far more radically, would MakerDAO’s on-chain #DeFi lending markets enable a more reliable clearing mechanism, with collateral calls locked in by a decentralized protocol? Or might these underdeveloped ideas simply be recipes for systemic risk, a single hack or software glitch away from setting off a vicious spiral of collateral calls and bankruptcies?The jury is out on all this untested stuff.Still, if nothing else, the many signs of stress in the traditional financial system offer a valuable framework for thinking about how the world could be different and the role blockchain technology might play in enabling that new world.Let’s look at some of them:The rare phenomenon, where creditors are essentially paying issuers for the privilege of lending them money – head scratcher, right? – reflects excessive demand for “safe” assets, especially for government-issued bonds. It has historically been a strong indicator of impending recession, since it reflects an overwhelming reluctance among investors to take on risk.Now, another way of thinking about that reluctance is to express it as a perceived shortage of good investment opportunities. That perception can be fueled by a worsening economic outlook, but it’s also dictated by the barriers to entry that make it difficult for otherwise investable businesses of offer new opportunities.Here, certain blockchain-based credit ideas offer hope. There’s the prospect for distributed-ledger asset registries that better track collateral and enable new emerging-market lending in developing-country land, commodities and energy markets. Or there are ideas such as having exporters tokenize their receivables to tackle a major structural limit on global trade finance, where a majority of small-and-medium enterprise are denied letters of credit because bankers don’t trust their documentation.Effective use of blockchain technology could boost trust in assets and lien registries and help bring to life the $20 trillion in “dead capital” that economist Hernando de Soto says the world’s poor are sitting on.Just as importantly, it would open a world of new alternative assets to draw in investors’ capital, giving them less of a reason to park it in low-yielding bonds.An alarming, synchronized downturn in manufacturing indicators, most notably in purchasing manager indexes, which measure current and future business spending on inventory and equipment, flows directly from the U.S.-China trade war. In cutting off Chinese goods exporters from U.S. consumer markets and driving up costs for their U.S. importers – and vice versa for U.S. farmers selling to food distributors in China – the conflict has added a massive new burden on global economic activity.But let’s look at the starting point for this trade battle. It lies in American companies’ mostly legitimate complaints about China’s mercantilist, centrally planned approach to supporting Chinese companies at their expense, all enabled by a system of surveillance and control over people and businesses. This where there’s a crypto angle.Cryptocurrency and other decentralizing technologies could work against the Chinese government’s capacity to control its economy in this interventionist manner. If Chinese businesses and hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens used bitcoin to circumvent capital controls, for example, the ever-present risk of monetary flight would act as a pressure valve, compelling Beijing to pursue a more open economic model to maintain competitiveness. That would give anti-free-traders like President Trump less of an excuse to ratchet up protectionist attacks against it.Some innovators have sought to apply blockchain technology to the back-office structural problems that periodically roil money markets, such as those now manifest in repo. They see a distributed ledger as a superior mechanism for tracking the IOUs of money and pawned securities upon which inter-institutional credit markets are based.One was former J.P. Morgan credit market maven Blythe Masters, who founded Digital Asset Holdings in 2014 on the idea that on-chain settlement and a universally auditable ledger could improve transparency in global finance’s opaque, complex matrix of interconnected credit relationships. This way, she argued, it could mitigate the mistrust and counterparty risks that fueled the financial crisis.The DAH model and those of others working on back-office blockchain solutions for capital markets have not come to fruition. This is at least partly due to the reluctance of incumbent financial institutions and their regulators to kill off existing functions that a blockchain would make redundant; they instead designed cumbersome hybrid distributed-ledger models that sustained vested interests but were expensive and difficult to collectively implement.Either way, a blockchain back-office fix for traditional finance isn’t coming any time soon – whether because of internal politics or the limitation of the technology.A more important question is why we even tolerate a system that’s so vulnerable to those back-end markets’ problems at all. The only reason central banks ever intervene to support interbank credit markets is because society’s means of payment depends on avoiding cash shortfalls and maintaining confidence in fractional-reserve banking.If banks don’t have enough cash to meet short-term creditor calls, they would suffer runs on their deposits, companies wouldn’t make payroll, tenants would have to skip rent, ATMs would run out of banknotes, etc. The economy would seize up. The worst of it is that, because of this ever-present threat, banks hold our political system to ransom, knowing that they can always rely bailouts: the too-big-to-fail problem.But what if banks just stuck to longer-term lending? What if there were no checking accounts or debit/credit cards, and we simply exchanged value with each other via cash or digital currencies that we hold ourselves?If people used bitcoin, or fiat-backed stablecoins or central bank digital currencies to exchange value instead of the IOUs of an inherently fragile fractional reserve banking system, institutional cash shortages simply wouldn’t matter as much. Banks’ biggest creditors might take a hit against their risk-adjusted positions and their stock prices would fall, but the rest of us, including the Fed, could ignore the problem.As the journalist and commentator Heidi Moore astutely observed in a tweetstorm last week, the reason the repo market tumult is so worrying is because it speaks directly to the core problem of trust in the banking system.If nothing else, this is where blockchain technology provides a valuable lens with which to assess the current stress in the financial system. It helps us think about how the trust problem creates vulnerabilities, power imbalances and systemic risks and how we might design a system that’s better able to resolve it.Federal Reserve image via Shutterstock"

BAM is registered as a money services business with the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) with an address listed in San Francisco, California.While the U.S. entity would clear regulatory and compliance barriers, the new platform is still not supported by 13 states, as of Sept. 23, according to a statement from the company.Users in those 13 states, including New York, Florida and Texas, cannot register for an account at Binance.US. Coley previously explained that the U.S. rollout is to be “gradual” with the 13 states not supported at launch.The exchange said it would also strengthen its compliance and security practices through partnerships, most notably with software provider Chainalysis and KYC/AML tool provider IdentityMind.The move is part of a larger expansion by Binance, which launched a fiat-to-crypto exchange on the island of Jersey, a British self-governing dependency in January.Through that exchange, which caters to traders in Europe and the U.K, its users can trade bitcoin and ethereum against the British pound and the euro.The Jersey arm listed the cryptocurrency exchange’s own British pound-backed stablecoin, Binance GBP (BGBP), offered on the fiat-to-crypto platform due to trader demand for more stablecoin options, the company said.With its latest launch in the U.S., Binance has also been trying to push its US dollar-backed stablecoin posing as a potential rival against Libra.

The massive dam and generator feeds the region’s growing mining farms. Cheap electricity is actively attracting miners from all parts of the world, turning the region into an international mining hub.In addition to the cheap electricity, the local climate is favorable to miners: the average annual temperature in Bratsk is 28 degrees Celsius or 82.4 ℉. The warm season (meaning when it’s not freezing) lasts four or five months a year and the rest of the time it’s a deep freeze.Another advantage is the plethora of empty buildings left by the Soviet factories that didn’t survive Russia’s turn to a market economy.Now some of those buildings, with the electricity already plugged in, have made the leap from the industrial to post-industrial age, becoming homes for mining hardware. In these remote areas, the miners can gobble up hydropower without disturbing the neighbors.Three companies, Bitriver, Cryptoreactor, and Minery, are the biggest players here offering “mining hotels,” or venues to place ASICs equipped the cooling systems, tech support teams and security guards.Bitriver boasts 100 megawatt of power available for clients while Cryptoreactor said it had secured 40 megawatts and Minery claims 30 megawatt. The venues are currently hosting machines from the clients in the U.S., Russia, Japan, Korea, Brazil, Lithuania, India, Poland, Spain, China, and other countries.At one of Minery’s two farms, for example, 26 massive shipping containers host ASICs owned by the miners from the U.S., Russia, Korea, India, Japan and Spain, the firm’s CEO Ilya Bruman said.Dmitry Ozersky, CEO of Eletro.Farm, a mining company building a large venue in Kazakhstan, believes bitcoin mining farms across Russia now wield a joint capacity of 600 megawatts, accounting for almost 10 percent of the total 7 gigawatts of power supporting the bitcoin network worldwide.We went on location to see the mines in action and came home with some amazing footage.Image via CoinDesk Video. "

We are very disappointed that Paycase has chosen to go this route. TMX disputes the claims made and we plan to defend ourselves vigorously.”
The damages sought are likely among the largest in any crypto-related lawsuit to date; previous cases have demanded as much as $100 million.Paycase and TMX, both based in Toronto, entered into 10-year contracts for collaboration and revenue sharing on an over-the-counter (OTC) cryptocurrency brokerage desk and creation and administration of data feeds and crypto indexes and the sharing of crypto-index revenue. According to the complaint, Paycase entered into these contracts on March 21, 2018, with TMX’s subsidiary Shorcan DCN, with the intention to launch a TMX OTC desk and data feed in the second quarter of that year. TMX would receive a cryptocurrency data aggregation platform and a global network of industry participants and leaders, and Paycase benefited from TMX’s stature and clientele, according to the suit.At the time, Paycase chief executive Joseph Weinberg said Shorcan would be “the first-ever public crypto brokerage desk by an exchange.”On Aug. 31, 2018, TMX added an amendment to the contract to extend by two weeks a deadline to put together a Statement of Work outlining services, consent, service levels, specifications and delivery timelines for the products. Paycase alleges that it never received this statement. Peter Conroy, president and CEO of Shorcan DCN, encouraged Paycase to buy Shorcan DCN from TMX to bypass “board approval” issues affecting the progress of the products, the suit alleges. In the middle of November, Paycase delivered an offer to purchase Shorcan DCN to Luc Fortin, the director of Shorcan DCN and Global Head of Trading with TMX Group. Paycase claims that TMX announced in or around Sept. 25 that Conroy would be moving to another TMX company but still listed him publicly as president of Shorcan DCN. Paycase claims that Fortin controlled the business and operations of Shorcan DCN and began to dismantle those operations, including dismissing the two employees hired by Shorcan DCN dedicated to the design, implementation and ongoing operation of the TMX OTC Desk in early December. On Dec. 6 – the same day as the dismissals – TMX sent Paycase a “Mutual Termination Agreement,” but Paycase claims no event occurred to justify the termination and that there was no termination for convenience in the contract. Paycase rejected the termination offer and requested a meeting with TMX executives which happened in February 2019. During that time, Shorcan DCN has stopped performing its part of the contract, which Paycase says includes an obligation of continuing performance. There was no warning of termination, but TMX promised that the products would be operational imminently, the suit claims. Meanwhile, Paycase discussed the company’s digital strategy with TMX executives and trained TMX employees.In March 2018, TMX also announced that Bank of Montreal would provide banking services as part of the payment and settlement infrastructure of the TMX OTC Desk, similar to the models adopted by Fidelity, E*Trade and TD Ameritrade. Paycase Global Corp vs. TMX Group by CoinDesk on ScribdPaycase co-founder and CEO Joseph Weinberg at Consensus 2018, image via CoinDesk archives"

Through its consultation, the regulator makes little attempt to genuinely evidence its claims and instead ‘cherry picks’ data sets in order to illustrate its perception of crypto assets, ETNs and the perceived harm the FCA believes these products cause.”Similar to a bond, ETNs provide investors with returns based on a market benchmark such as the S&P 500. CoinShares offers exchange-traded products for bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, and XRP.Released this past July, the FCA consultation paper claimed that “retail consumers cannot reliably assess the value and risks of derivatives and exchange-traded products that reference certain crypto assets.”In today’s letter, CoinShares said the FCA’s analysis on crypto assets “demonstrates a lack of understanding of their functionality, value and the motivations for why an investor might seek out such products.”In a pre-formatted email CoinShares is asking investors to send to the regulator, the firm called the ban proposal “unwarranted” and “not been properly thought out or considered.”CoinShares is asking customers — or any proponent of cryptoassets — to write to the FCA over the proposed ban before the Oct. 3 comment deadline.After publication, CoinShares CSO Meltem Demirors told CoinDesk the FCA’s proposed ban could set back the entire industry – inside and outside the UK – and not just CoinShares.Said Demirors:“If the FCA is successful in pushing this proposed ban through, it will mean that UK retail investors who currently enjoy access to the crypto-ecosystem via our ETNs will see their access cut off; with presumably little recourse. Additionally, the FCA has been clear in their consultation to note that they intend to work with other regulators to ensure the ban is not circumvented – so the potential contagion effect is very real even beyond the UK based on the FCA’s own words.”FCA image via Shutterstock"

It has also concluded that cryptocurrency is not equity and does not give the holder contractual rights of exchange. Importantly, it said crypto is not cash because it is not, for practical purposes, a medium of exchange.The Committee added that in some cases, cryptocurrency could be accounted for as inventory if an entity “hold cryptocurrencies for sale in the ordinary course of business.”Stepping back, the treatment of cryptocurrency was not added to the committee’s standard-setting agenda, which means that the recent disclosure only reflects the thinking of the body and not an actual rule.But once the committee sets a standard, it tends to be followed, as IFRS is used in about 144 jurisdictions and is required for public companies in Singapore, South Korea and almost all of Europe, though the U.S. has so far been only using the framework of the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).Accounting treatment for cryptocurrency has been in discussion since about 2016, with numerous talks held and papers submitted. The IFRIC recently received 23 comment letters on the subject from a wide range of interested parties, including the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), The Indonesian Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Korea Accounting Standards Board (KASB) and the Accounting Standards Board of Japan (ASBJ).Accounting image via Shutterstock "

He is also the head of the Group of Seven (G7) Committee on stablecoins.The central banker raises a number of concerns about stablecoins. He said that they can be used for laundering money and financing terrorism, and he notes the possibility of consumer protection, data security, network stability, competition and taxation issues.He adds that stablecoins have serious implications for monetary policy and financial stability, as the coins can have an impact on money supply outside the normal channels, while the failure of the promised peg or the loss of confidence could have systemic implications.“There may be the risk of the monetary sovereignty of countries being infringed,” he was quoted as saying in written summary of his comments, which was published by the Bank of International Settlements.While he believes that much can be done to regulate the new products within existing policy frameworks, he said that new approaches are needed. He also said rules need be applied in an “internationally consistent” manner, suggesting a degree of coordination between institutions globally.In the comments, he said that the G7 group on stablecoins would be offering its recommendations in time for the IMF-World Bank meeting, which runs Oct. 14-20.His comments come as Libra faces hostility from some quarters, especially in Europe and China, but are in line with previous statements by the central banker, indicating that a consensus is developing around a balanced approach of welcoming but tightly supervising the stablecoin.ECB image via Shutterstock"

In a blog post shared with CoinDesk in advance, Tomaino wrote:“Today, the current total market value of crypto assets is ~$272B and investment/speculation is the only mainstream use case. We think in the next five years, that total market value will surpass $1T as the investment/speculation use case continues to grow and other mainstream use cases emerge.”1confirmation has invested in a wide array of new companies in the industry, including BloXroute, Tendermint, OpenSea and Commonwealth. The firm invests in both startup equity and cryptocurrency tokens.While Tomaino declined to detail participants in the new fund, he noted that it is “largely backed by our existing Fund I LPs.” When 1confirmation was first announced, limited partners included: Peter Thiel,  Marc Andreessen, Balaji Srinivasan, Brendan Eich, Runa Capital and Real Ventures, among others.This larger fund will allow for the company to write larger checks while continuing to capitalize on being close to pioneers in the space, Tomaino told CoinDesk.He wrote in an email:“For Fund I, our focus was providing early stage capital for founders building infrastructure and middleware for the decentralized web. For Fund II, we’re continuing that focus with larger checks as a result of the larger fund (Fund II checks are generally between $1M and $2M, where Fund I checks were between $250K and $1M).”In his blog post, Tomaino emphasizes the importance of not chasing the trend so much as investing in “focused, disciplined, mission-driven founders.” Further, he predicts that bitcoin will continue to be the market leader and that ethereum will follow close behind, particularly as the platform for decentralized finance.Tomaino writes:“While the story for ETH as a store of value is not as strong as the story for BTC as a store of value and a lot of Ethereum infrastructure challenges remain unsolved, we think that Ethereum as a platform for innovation is here to stay and ETH’s future as Internet money for open, inclusive financial products (aka DeFi) is bright.”Image: Nick Tomaino speaks at Token Summit 2018, via Brady Dale for CoinDesk"

To give potential clients additional peace of mind, the insurance arranged by Marsh covers them in case of external theft and internal collusion, up to the full value of their holdings.By contrast, often insurance policies covering crypto assets are shared across multiple clients of a custodian, explained Alex Daskalov, co-founder and CEO of KNØX. For example, a custodian holding $1 billion in assets, and advertising a $100 million insurance policy may only be 10 percent insured, in which case the customer is given a false sense of security, Daskalov argued. If the customer were to experience a total loss of $100 million they would only be reimbursed $10 million.The KNØX  program was developed with Marsh to remove ambiguity of this sort, Daskalov told CoinDesk:“Often we see people purchase an insurance policy and then hold in the aggregate funds well above the limit of that insurance policy. So for us, it was an important guarantee that when a customer is on-boarded to our platform, the full value of their assets is insured.”That’s not to say the cover is limitless. “There is, of course, an upper ceiling,” Daskalov acknowledged, without saying precisely what it is.Asked if KNØX  was ready to hold and insure north of $100 million for any of its customers, Daskalov said this would “not be a problem.” (To put that figure in context, until recently, the largest amount of insurance cover heard of in the crypto space was when Coinbase was reported to have up to $255 million).Jennifer Hustwitt, senior vice president at Marsh, told CoinDesk the insurance cover being offered with the KNØX  solution was led by insurance company Arch and supported by various syndicates at Lloyd’s of London.KNØX recently raised $6.2 million in funding led by Initialized and iNovia, with participation from Fidelity Investments Canada, FJ Labs, and Ferst Capital.Daskalov said that for custodying and insuring 100 percent of a customer’s assets, KN0X would charge a fee starting at 1 percent of assets and work down depending on how much business was being conducted. To get a customer’s assets out of cold storage in order to trade would normally take an hour, although the service level agreements (SLAs) are more conservative, he said.While scarce, crypto insurance cover is popping into the headlines with increasing regularity, thanks to the likes of blockchain security firm BitGo touting $100 million cover from Lloyd’s and Coinbase exploring new avenues with the number two insurance broker Aon, which is also working with custody providers Anchorage and Volt.Hustwitt said there has been a net expansion of insurance capacity available for digital asset risks in the past six months.Some carriers are starting to participate in programs who previously had not and this is edging up the capacity and size of insurance deals, she said. “At any given time the amount of overall capacity will depend on a risk-by-risk basis. Having said that, there is upwards of $750 million to $1 billion in potential insurance capacity available across specie and financial institutions insurance markets.”A caveat would be that the carriers participating and the capacity changes on a month to month basis, said Hiustwitt, concluding:“Our working metric right now is up to a billion. We break new ground with every deal we do.”Vault via Shutterstock"

Blockstack CEO Muneeb Ali told CoinDesk the App Mining incentives program has paid $900,000 worth of bitcoin to more than a dozen projects since it started in November 2018.The distributions are modest. Envelop, for example, has only received $3,784 from the program since June, according to Dos Santos. For comparison, Dmail, an encrypted email service built on Blockstack, earned $63,000 by August 2019.For many Blockstack projects, those small figures are not problematic. Envelop, for example, is a side project of web development firm Bloco, itself a mom-and-pop consulting firm run by Sérgio David and wife Claudia dos Santos.Like Dmail and many other Blockstack projects, these are established companies that aren’t looking to monetize their side projects, or raise venture capital for them, in the near future.“The good thing about the app mining program is it gives you a way to bootstrap, to test the waters,” Sérgio David dos Santos said, adding:“The community is still figuring out what are the best business models to build on top of decentralized applications. It’s tough to switch your mindset from normal business models to models that are more ethical.”If creators don’t want to collect user data or sell storage options, however, the question remains: How to capture value from the software they’ve built and maintained?“If we make our project open-source, if we let you take care of the storage itself, what else do we have to offer?” he asked. “We’re working through a few options.”It also remains to be seen how valuable the App Mining program’s support will be when the program switches in November from paying in bitcoin to Blockstack’s native token, STX. Blockstack CEO Ali said if an exchange listing of STX were to occur, it would take place on an international exchange that would only serve non-U.S. individuals. He said the listing would likely happen in October 2019, though possibly later.“Our plans for completely switching out bitcoin [for STX] might change as we’re actively tweaking and improving the App Mining program during the pilot phase,” Ali added.In the meantime, the Envelop team is focused on gaining users, beyond crypto circles, and learning about their needs.“In the long run, we’re looking to develop an iOS app and also a Mac [desktop] application,” David dos Santos said. “We’re still feeling things out.”Claudia and Sérgio David dos Santos image via Bloco"

The ICO raised $100 million, which the SEC claims was an unregistered securities offering. Since the SEC allegations in June, Kin’s token has dropped from $0.000036 to $0.0000105 as of today, according to data provider Messari.While the Kik app is shutting down, Livingston said the core developer team is pivoting toward developing the KIN token.He wrote:“Kin is a currency used by millions of people in dozens of independent apps. So while the SEC might be able to push us around, taking on the broader Kin Ecosystem will be a much bigger fight. And the Ecosystem is close to adding a lot more firepower.”Israeli news site Calcalist first reported the Kin layoffs. Calcalist also claimed Kin was being shut down as parts of the technology would be moved to different platforms, such as the Kik app.Aspects of the report were confirmed on the Kin Foundation’s official Reddit page. “I can confirm a restructure is happening,” a spokesman from the foundation wrote at the time.Kik image via ShutterstockEditor’s note: A previous version of this article stated that the Kin Foundation is also shutting down.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Sep 24, 2019 at 12:00 UTC","Data analytics startup Flipside Crypto, already backed by Coinbase Ventures and Digital Currency Group, has raised another funding round to solidify its service offerings.","Galaxy Digital, headed by hedge fund veteran (and runway model) Mike Novogratz, led a fresh $7.1 million round in Flipside Crypto this summer. Previous investors, such as Castle Island Ventures, also participated.In total, Flipside has raised more than $11.6 million since it was founded in 2017. CEO Dave Balter told CoinDesk the startup is now valued at $32.1 million. He plans to grow from roughly 14 employees to 21 by the beginning of 2020.“We have sophisticated tools to determine behavioral segmentation on top of [blockchain data], to understand specific stakeholder activity,” Balter said. “The ultimate framing of the service is trying to identify activities and, justifiably, what they do to the price of the asset.”Although Balter said 75 organizations have signed up to receive the free Flipside Analytics suite, only a few dozen users like Algorand are paying customers so far. For those customers, understanding specific metrics – such as who is staking tokens on a network and how their voter behavior compares to other networks – can help guide business decisions.Algorand COO Sean Ford told CoinDesk real-time insights help his startup “stay ahead.”“We work with several other data service providers, but none like Flipside,” Ford said. “The biggest difference with Flipside for us has been the ability to customize your approach to data and analysis of results.”Whether it’s looking at voting patterns, developer activity or users’ trading habits, Flipside’s Balter said many projects are specifically looking for activities that correlate with increased token prices. This isn’t unique to Flipside Crypto clients. One unaffiliated market maker told CoinDesk many prospective customers also prioritize price gains as the leading metric of success.Castle Island co-founder Nic Carter, who also co-founded the separate analytics firm Coin Metrics, told CoinDesk:“The interesting thing about crypto is that these networks/crypto assets trade in real time, so naturally you have price feedback for any new fundamental developments. That’s both a bug and a feature. Startups aren’t repriced whenever they sign a new client, so that growth isn’t as evident. But in crypto assets, it’s manifested in real time, so the price conversation tends to dominate.”According to Flipside Crypto’s analysis of 520 cryptocurrencies, it appears the perception of a network or asset’s future potential has a stronger impact on the market than its actual usage.Balter highlighted one “abnormal” pattern compared to non-crypto startups and assets: a growing customer base doesn’t directly impact price.“You can’t associate those two things [real users and price] just yet,” Balter said, adding that he expects this to shift as the market matures. “Related to insights, in one case Flipside identified an issue with a token provider’s auction program.  In this case, the client realized, they’d be better off driving nobody [to the product] than just a handful of people.”However, Avon Ventures partner and Flipside Crypto investor Sachin Patodia said in a press release that analytics are crucial to guiding long-term growth as projects “mature” into “mainstream businesses.” As such, some investors see equity in analytics firms as bets that complement other crypto investments.The leading blockchain analytics firms (not including those specializing in law enforcement and compliance) often share overlapping investors. For example, Balter is personally an investor in Coin Metrics, the same way Carter’s firm invested in Balter’s startup.Both men said they don’t view these analytics startups as direct competitors because Flipside is doubling down on serving blockchain projects themselves, while Coin Metrics is focused on investors evaluating those networks and assets.“If you can get detailed insight into how some protocol tweak alters the economics of a network, that is very valuable for the people designing these things,” Carter said, adding:“We think there will be a multiplicity of blockchain analytics firms that succeed, because the blockchain industry is so data-rich, as these things are natively transparent.”Team image via Flipside Crypto"

Cohen ruled in August that Tether and its affiliated entities must produce documents about a $900 million loan to Bitfinex, the exchange that Tether shares leadership and shareholders with.According to the order, which listed appellate court justices David Friedman, Peter Tom, Troy Webber, Ellen Gesmer and Jeffrey Oing, the respondents moved to stay an order to turn over documents about the loan.The judges wrote:“It is ordered that the motion is granted on condition the appeal is perfected on or before November 4, 2019 for the January 2020 Term.”The appeal will likely be fully briefed by sometime in December, with arguments not occurring before next year.Bitfinex, its parent company iFinex, its sister firm Tether and other affiliated entities are fighting the New York Attorney General’s office, which alleged in April that the exchange covered up the loss of $850 million held by a payment processor by borrowing from Tether’s stablecoin reserves.The New York regulator asked Bitfinex to turn over a number of documents pertaining to this alleged cover-up, which included a number of loans that Tether provided to Bitfinex to help the exchange process customer withdrawals and other transactions.Judge Cohen ruled last month that Bitfinex must turn over the documents, saying the NYAG’s office had jurisdiction over the exchange and the document production should proceed.Attorneys for Bitfinex immediately appealed the decision.In a statement Tuesday, Stuart Hoegner, general counsel to Bitfinex and Tether, said “We are gratified by the panel’s decision and we look forward to addressing the substantive issues before the appellate court.”After this article was published, an NYAG spokesperson told CoinDesk that, “The injunction that prohibits the movement of money between Tether and Bitfinex is still in place, that has not changed.

Immutable reports that it’s sold more than 4 million cards, breaking $4.5 million in revenue through a “Genesis Sale” that closes Oct. 10.Despite their success, they’ve also learned a lot about the complexity engendered by using a blockchain to run a game ecosystem.That’s why the company is turning over the underlying software that powers Gods Unchained to other developers with its Immutable Platform.Beyond enabling more NFT games, Ferguson said, “We’re also building a suite of interconnected products aimed to solve the highest areas of friction users face when trying to interact with this technology.”Ferguson did not describe how the platform fits into the company’s business model. Other video game companies have created game engines that they then license to other developers, such as Epic Games and its Unreal Engine.Immutable recently made a bit of a departure from the pure decentralization ethos by creating a typical sign-on for users to participate in Gods Unchained.At first, an ethereum wallet was all that was needed to interact with the site, but now users need to create an account on the website itself.Ferguson said this is “an effort to reduce confusion amongst new users and improve the general user experience.”With tournaments every weekend, Immutable says it is growing its user base.“We’re running a raffle where players can earn ERC-20 tokens that unlock prizes by playing the game and giving away beta access to their friends,” Ferguson said.Ferguson told CoinDesk:“The game itself has been designed by heavyweights to be easy to learn, but complex to master.”Disclosure: Reporter Brady Dale has previously purchased a few packs of Gods Unchained cards. Gods Unchained image via Immutable Games"

I have run both, and I know how to unlock the value in each. I’m confident we can rapidly return our retail business to profitable growth. Our transformative blockchain businesses continue to lead their respective industries by getting real products into production.”In retail guidance provided along with the news, Overstock set out a number of market factors that it expects to affect profitability, but added: “In spite of these recent headwinds, we’re confident in our retail strategy.”The company has had a turbulent two months for internal reasons too. Before leaving the company, Byrne had apparently attempted to stymie short sellers he believed were targeting the firm by controversially opting to issue Overstock’s next investor dividend through a digital asset on the firm’s subsidiary exchange tZERO. It was to have blocked investors from trading the asset for six months and restricted the activity to a single platform.However, Overstock last week sought to soften its stance by restructuring the dividend to make it freely tradeable at issuance.A day later, typically outspoken Byrne dumped his 13 percent stake in the company, which he founded 20 years ago, to buy cryptocurrency and precious metals, saying it was an effort to fight his “Deep State” enemies at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.In today’s announcement, Overstock added that it’s also appointed former principal financial officer Robert Hughes as acting chief financial officer after the resignation of Greg Iverson from the role last week.Jonathan Johnson image via Nasdaq"

We are now one step closer to demonstrating the viability of our vision for the financial markets of the future and, ultimately, for the way people and businesses access capital.”Early functionality of the platform for “test cases” will cover issuance of digital security tokens, live trading and instant settlement.“This will include the cash-leg of the transaction embracing the concept of a payment token as well as access to a distributed portal where it would be possible to monitor transactions across specific DLT member nodes.” according to the announcement.SDX’s trading facility will be similar to the SIX infrastructure, while token issuance will utilize SIX’s Connexor reporting service and functionality.Ultimately, SDX aims to enable instant settlement with no counterparty risk or requirement for default fund collateral at a central counterparty. “This implies that if the buy and sell-side have the necessary cash and assets to fulfil a trade, settlement will occur instantly,” said SDX.Phase two of the prototype is expected to be ready in “coming months,” and will take in feedback from this initial phase. It will also add the first post-trade and digital custody functionality, according to SDX. Exchange users will be able to hold their assets on the SDX in a “distributed way,” with access through the use of a private key.SIX image via Shutterstock"

Monday ...","Sep 25, 2019 at 08:01 UTC","Cryptocurrency data analytics startup Skew has raised $2 million in seed funding from several venture capital firms, including Silicon Valley icon Kleiner Perkins.","Announced Wednesday, the seed round was led by London-based FirstMinute Capital, with participation from Seedcamp, Kima Ventures and QCP Capital. The company declined to disclose its valuation.The company’s skewAnalytics service, launched concurrently with the raise announcement, provides a real-time overview of crypto derivatives markets with more than 100 charts on crypto futures and options. A company of 10 employees, many from traditional finance, London-based Skew is building out features for institutional clients to visualize historical data as well as create dashboards and is hiring in engineering and eventually in distribution. “Where we want to focus is on corporates and institutions that need this data to run their business,” Skew CEO and co-founder Emmanuel Goh told CoinDesk. “We have had heard concerns from interested traders and firms, and they would be able to generate backtest strategies from this data.”Goh and his co-founder Tim Noat worked as traders of flow derivatives and exotic options at JPMorgan Chase and Citi, respectively, before starting the company. The firm’s analytics tools resemble the institutional-grade tools one would find for established products such as foreign exchange and equity, Monica Desai, an investing partner at Kleiner Perkins, told CoinDesk by email.“As a former trader I’ve found many of their tools (some forthcoming) to feel the most trading floor-native or Bloomberg-esque and am excited to see how they evolve the product as the crypto derivatives space grows exponentially in the next year,” said Desai, who used to manage bond portfolios at JPMorgan.Crypto derivatives took off in 2018 after the brutal market correction of 2017 and are showing a resurgence driven by institutional adoption, Goh said. Swaps are being traded in the billions every day on offshore venues, and regulated entities are ramping up offerings. For example, CME plans to launch bitcoin options in Q1 2019 and Intercontinental Exchange’s bitcoin futures platform Bakkt debuted Monday (though it didn’t do much volume).“Bakkt is the first time large institutions can build physical coins,” Goh said, referring to the fact that the futures contracts are settled in real bitcoin rather than cash. “It’s going to be a moment of proof for the industry.”While crypto derivatives markets are fragmented, Skew has contracted a number of licensing agreements with crypto exchanges. According to Skew’s data, aggregated bitcoin options have grown more than sixfold from last year’s fourth quarter to $34.8 million this quarter.  Image of Monica Desai via CoinDesk archives "

Lucas also said the token would be listed on major exchanges and the company had verified that its investors were accredited; neither of the claims are true.The company made a further false statement when it affirmed all of its transactions are secured because users could only purchase the token with bitcoin or litecoin on ERC-20 blockchain, which was not the case.In fact, according to the SEC’s charges, no token was every issued and his ethereum application never existed.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Sep 24, 2019 at 13:00 UTC",Agro-focused blockchain platform GrainChain has brokered deals across the Honduran coffee supply chain to track the production and trade of beans over its smart contract system.,"The launch, announced today, is starting with a 2 percent sliver of Honduras’ 7-million-bag-a-year export industry – equivalent to “10-15 percent of the organic fair trade market,” says GrainChain CEO Luis Macias, who hopes to expand its reach.GrainChain’s rollout in Honduras comes as players in both coffee and tech embrace blockchain to tame the global market. In May, Starbucks announced that it would track its global coffee supply chain on Microsoft’s Azure blockchain for the benefit of consumers who want to follow the bean from plantation to coffee pot.While tasting notes and sourcing information headline Starbucks’ mobile app – GrainChain’s smart-contract-based ecosystem targets the on-the-ground financing of coffee production.GrainChain’s platform connects the Honduran farmers growing the beans with the exporters shipping them to roasters around the world.“This is the first solution that we see that allows banks, insurers, vendors, cooperatives, exporters and farmers to be all on one platform,” Francisco Fortin, a representative for participating loan guarantor Confianza Hondura, told CoinDesk.“We feel that this will encourage trust among the supply chain.”CEO Macias first pitched his “top-down approach” to Honduras’ financial institutions: banks, whose capital the farmers need to fund their seasonal industry.“They wanted to find a solution on how to loan their farmers money, but even if the banks guaranteed the loans, they were still having trouble figuring out how to do it,” Macias said.Macias had already tested GrainChain’s bean-to-buyer tracking system on farms in Texas, where the company is based, and Mexico, and both examples were presented as models to the banks. They latched on almost immediately.Farmers were on board with the project. GrainChain’s launch participants include fair trade and organic specialty coffee producers, Macias said — “people who are trying to make a difference in the social aspect of creating coffee.”The farmers were excited to build for stronger trust with the banks. It represented a new wave of capital from banks more willing to loan.“Having technological support and money changes many things,” German Delcid, a farmer with the participating Santa Rosa de Copan farm, said. “I feel that with access to financing and security of payment will have great effect on our farms.”GrainChain’s biggest struggle came from the exporters and buyers, who Macias said did not immediately understand the benefits a smart contracts system might have to their supply chain.But after seeing the tech’s potential cost savings – cutting out middlemen, securing and paying off loans, reducing administrative overhead – they, too, signed on.Exporters additionally saw the opportunity to use the tech for additional profit, Macias explained. Each step on the blockchain was, in itself, a marketing tagline.“When they’re able to show buyers in Italy and Miami exactly where the coffee came from – the path that it took, the ingredients that were used, the fertilizers, everything – they saw it as a great marketing opportunity.”Under GrainChain’s platform, farmers at Santa Rosa de Copan and other participating growers document their coffee production via a real-time mobile app, according to Macias. Each stakeholder tracks those beans as they make their way through the system.The system’s smart contracts pay each stakeholder exactly what they say they will, without regard for potential biases that humans often introduce.This transparency contrasts with the often informal “handshake-like” deals that Macias says permeated the market beforehand. Farmers might agree to sell their crop for $5, for example, but end up earning far less because of a middleman’s opinion. That would, in turn, impact the farmers’ ability to pay back bank loans.“It’s very different than what you can get away with when a person’s involved,” Macias said.GrainChain’s real-time record-keeping system makes the banks more eager to loan to farmers whose output they can check, and whose use of loan funds they can control.“Given a lot of our traceability and logistics applications that we have within our system, it opens up the door to people to see what’s really going on,” Macias said.Off-the-grid Honduran farmers and concept-heavy blockchains make unnatural bedfellows; Delcid, the Santa Rosa de Copan coffee farmer, is the first to admit it.But he’s nonetheless optimistic that GrainChain’s platform will build a new level of trust across the entire coffee ecosystem.“The technology has been explained to us.” Delcid told CoinDesk. “It sounds complicated but we are looking for results.”Coffee farmer image via Flickr"

Ethereum 2.0, Plasma, Raiden, zk-SNARKs – the list goes on.","On Monday, blockchain research and development startup Matter Labs announced a $2 million seed round led by Placeholder VC to develop a new scaling initiative atop the ethereum blockchain.Speaking to the goals of the initiative, Matter Labs co-founder Alex Gluchowski said:“Our product will be much more scalable [than ethereum today] without sacrificing decentralization or security. … You will be able to deposit any funds on it and it will be as safe as depositing on ethereum itself.”Matter Labs’ technology is based on a novel form of cryptography known as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). Leveraging this “mathematical magic,” in the words of Gluchowski, transactions on ethereum could be significantly sped up and cheaper to deploy.“With what we’re building … payments [on ethereum] will be very cheap and have very high throughput,” said Gluchowski. “Not only very cheap but predictively cheap because the bulk of the cost will be coming from [ZKP] computation.”At the same time, Gluchowski told CoinDesk the research into leveraging ZKPs as a scaling solution on ethereum is still “very early.” At present, Matter Labs has built a prototype of its scalable payments platform and is working towards creating a new minimum viable product over the coming months.A number of other venture capital firms joined Placeholder in the funding round, including 1kx, Dekrypt, Hashed and Dragonfly Capital Partners.Hashed CEO and managing partner Simon Seojoon Kim told CoinDesk:“We believe the on-chain data availability and … scaling solution the Matter Labs team is building will be the integral piece in accelerating the growth of [ethereum’s decentralized finance] space.”Dekrypt co-founder Howard Wu also added that using ZKPs to wrap “hundreds of thousands of transactions” on ethereum into succinct, verifiable proofs is a “really cool way to try and bring scalability to ethereum.”Launched officially in December 2018, Matter Labs has also received funding from the Ethereum Foundation, the oldest non-profit dedicated to ethereum protocol development.Gluchowski said Matter Labs has “received over $100,000 in several different grants” from the Ethereum Foundation over the course of 2019.Matter Labs R&D Head Alexandr Vlasov image via Medium"

German bank Landesbank Baden-Württemberg (LBBW) was also involved in the trade.The pilot involved an order and delivery agreement for a balancing system from Dürr subsidiary Schenck arranged over Marco Polo. Payment was prearranged through a conditional commitment from Daimler’s bank.Once the ordered equipment was delivered, the fulfillment data was entered onto Marco Polo and automatically reconciled with the agreed transaction data, thus triggering an irrevocable payment obligation.Founded by startups R3 and TradeIX, Marco Polo is built on R3’s Corda blockchain platform. The network aims to deliver real-time connectivity, boost transparency in trading relationships and lower barriers to accessing capital.Currently, arranging traditional paper-based payments for international trade transactions is inefficient and and slow, requiring multiple systems and a number of intermediaries such as logistics providers, insurers, customs authorities, according to LBBW’s announcement.The pilot – conducted in “minutes instead of days” – had persuaded Dürr and Daimler that blockchain can make the process “faster and simpler,” said the bank.Susanne Schlegel, CFO of Schenck and Dürr Division Measuring and Process Systems, said:“We focus on efficiency increases not only with regard to our machines and systems, but also to our business processes. The successful pilot project between Daimler and LBBW demonstrates the intrinsic efficiency potential of digital trade finance processes. Innovative platforms and technologies such as Marco Polo and Corda allow us to reduce complexities in order fulfillment – to the benefit of all participants”The ability to automatically trigger payments was a milestone for the network, announced in August. Marco Polo’s first such transaction involved LBBW and Commerzbank and saw logistics provider Logwin AG adding data to the blockchain to initiate the payment obligation.Marco Polo has also announced notable new members in recent weeks, with both Bank of America and Mastercard signing up to the project seeking new efficiencies in their trade finance businesses.Mercedes car image via Shutterstock"

The Treasury department bureau’s interpretive guides and letters on matters from AML compliance to ICO rules inform industry players. If signed into law, FinCEN may have to jump in.Gerard Daché, executive director at the Government Blockchain Association, which promotes blockchain technology solutions to government, called the advance long overdue.The government often plays catch-up to “bad guys” and their blockchain tools, Daché said, wasting time, energy and money on antiquated techniques while the enemy races ahead.“It’s almost like an ostrich sticking its head in the sand” said Daché.
