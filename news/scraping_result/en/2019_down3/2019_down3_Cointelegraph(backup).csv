Traders who heavily utilize RSI expect that the oscillator will move from overbought to oversold and vice versa on every time frame.Traders should note that the RSI was dramatically overbought at the June high, with a bearish divergence on RSI. Therefore, the expectation was to see Bitcoin price continue down to coincide with the oversold RSI, which has now occurred.¬†Divergence traders will look for an eventual bullish divergence in oversold territory to signal the likely bottom, as it did at the $3,128 low. This would require price making a lower low in a few days, with RSI continuing to push up, making a higher low.¬†BTC/USD Daily Chart.

certainly not immune to the same market forces and human emotion.",24-Sep-19,"Almost all traders are aware of the widely publicized statistic that ??5% of traders lose money.??When you drill deeper, research implies that this number is likely higher. The profession chews up and spits out aspiring traders at an astounding rate.¬†","So why are so many intelligent people drawn to a profession with incredibly high odds of failure?There are the obvious reasons ??the appeal of working for yourself, sitting in your underwear on your couch all day making millions. There?ôs the (false) promise of ?úeasy money??and the draw of independent wealth.¬†The truth is, day trading is extremely difficult, emotionally taxing and far more likely to destroy your life than enrich it.¬†Let?ôs start with a few key statistics, from online educational resource Tradeciety:The last point suggests that day traders even continue to trade when they receive a negative signal regarding their ability.¬†Astounding. Almost everyone loses, they lose fast, they underperform simple, mindless investments, and they continue trading even after being proven unprofitable. Why?The truth is, most would-be traders are woefully underprepared for the challenge ahead and learn many hard lessons with their real money. They underestimate the psychological challenges of trading and fail to eliminate emotion from their trades.¬†They fail to trade with a defined system. When they have a defined system, they often take trades outside of their own, established rules. These are all obvious reasons.¬†Perhaps a less notable reason that traders fail is the principle of ?úrandom reinforcement.??This concept also explains why they often continue trading, even after failing repeatedly. As defined by Investopedia, ?úRandom Reinforcement??is:Using arbitrary events to qualify (or disqualify) a hypothesis or idea; attributing skill or lack of skill to an outcome that is unsystematic in nature; finding support for positive or negative behaviors from outcomes that are inconsistent in nature?îlike the financial markets.The market has a tendency to reward bad habits, while concurrently punishing positive behaviors, especially with a small sample set. Let?ôs take a theoretical example to display this principal.Bob wants to leave his job and become a crypto trader. He sets aside some starting capital, follows the markets and the ?úbig names??on twitter. He sees them talking about an altcoin, opens the chart and sees that price is rising fast. He buys, goes to take a shower, returns and sells for a quick profit. He does this again before lunch and strings together a few successful trades. Bob starts to feel confident that he is a talented trader.¬†So what is the problem? Bob is trading without a system or a plan and is being fooled into believing that a successful outcome on a few random trades is indicative of likely success moving forward. The market has rewarded his bad behavior. We know how this story ends ??Bob continues to make impulsive trades and eventually loses his capital.¬†There is a flip side to this coin. Let?ôs say that Bob learns his lesson and spends months developing a trading plan, complete with risk management, proper portfolio allocations and trading rules.¬†He identifies a trading opportunity that fits, takes the perfect entry and??stops out of his trade. He tries again. And again. He loses 7 times in a row. The market is punishing Bob for his good behavior. Bob starts to doubt his system and takes a high-risk trade that violates his system ??and is successful. To his surprise, he tries this a second time and also makes money. Bob is now back to square one, trading without a system because the market has rewarded his bad behavior.Through random reinforcement, the market has re-conditioned the way Bob approaches trading by distracting him away from his trading plan. He has allowed himself to be manipulated into an impulsive, high risk, revenge based trading approach.¬†The concept of random reinforcement was never more evident than in the crypto bubble of 2017. During this parabolic bull market, it was easy to mistake luck for skill.¬†Amateur traders were making money hand over foot by simply throwing cash into random altcoins and selling after massive, immediate gains. Everyone was a ?úgenius??in the 2017 crypto market. Then 2018 happened ??the bubble popped, and these amateur traders were ill-prepared to deal with the drawdown. They failed to sell their assets and held blindly until they had lost everything.Understanding that markets are dynamic and in constant flux is key to being profitable. A trader must learn to be able to determine when a certain string of losses or profits can be attributed to their skill and when it is random. This is done by trading with a defined plan over a long period of time.¬†Every trader should have a well developed and tested (through paper trading) plan, with written rules for entries, exits and stop losses, position sizing and risk. They should NEVER trade outside their plan.¬†No more than 1% of a trader?ôs portfolio should be at risk on any single trade ??this is the key to sustaining multiple, consecutive losses. They should test and tweak their plan over a long period of time ??hundreds of trades. A good system gives a trader an edge over a long time frame because randomness becomes less of a factor with a larger sample.A good trade should be defined as one where a trader planned their trade, traded their plan and managed their risk ??those are all elements they can control. It is NOT defined by the outcome.¬†A bad trade, on the other hand, is where a trader fails to follow their rules and executes trades against their better judgment. This is always going to be a bad trade even if it happens to be profitable.¬†By developing a well-tested plan, traders can overcome the pitfalls of random reinforcement, eliminate emotion and impulse, and learn to be profitable. That?ôs how you become a part of the 5% that make it as traders.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author (@scottmelker) and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

altogether, they reveal. 4038 Total views. 120 ...",23-Sep-19,Cryptocurrency payment processor BitPay may soon find it harder to do business as developers plan to remove support for the way it creates payment addresses.,"In a GitHub discussion about the future 0.19.0 release of the Bitcoin Core client, developers continued plans to disable BIP70 by default, and possibly remove it altogether in a later version.The proposal first appeared in March this year, with activity to make it a reality ongoing.BitPay has stuck to using the payment address format defined in BIP70. Other wallets and payment businesses have joined the majority of Bitcoin users in preferring BIP21, leaving BitPay wallets with little support.¬†Despite this, the company continues to use the same address format. This led to frustration, as those wanting to pay in Bitcoin often find their wallet does not allow payment of BitPay invoices.Previously, BitPay allowed the extraction of the destination Bitcoin address from its invoices for those who could not or did not wish to use BIP70. That feature subsequently disappeared.BIP70 lost favor to BIP21 as its security setup involved reliance on centralized technology markets and paved the way for Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer options to enter Bitcoin merchant transactions.¬†Previously discussing the possibility of freezing out BitPay, Bitcoin Core developer Luke-jr did not mince his words.¬†?úDo any merchants require BIP70 at this point? (A particular payment processor claims it does, but AFAIK their implementation is broken and already doesn't work with Core.),??he wrote on GitHub in March.The company has released dedicated posts on BIP70, including one in January 2018 in which it defends its decision to force users to switch wallets solely to pay its invoices.As Cointelegraph reported, BitPay already faces controversy over its business practices and technical setup, with opponents frequently calling for a boycott.A dedicated competitor for merchant transactions, BTCPay, has been gaining momentum since 2018, while last week saw the announcement of a Lightning Network-based alternative from Zap wallet.",,,,,,,

similar but less popular proposals. 4080 Total views. 111 Total ...",23-Sep-19,"On Sept. 17, the Chicago Board Options Exchange?ôs BZX Equity Exchange withdrew its VanEck/SolidX Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposal a month ahead of the review deadline. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ??the regulator on the matter ??had until Oct. 18 to greenlight or reject the financial product.","As a result, the race for the first Bitcoin (BTC) ETF seems to be postponed once again. While the SEC is still reviewing two other proposals of this kind, the VanEck/SolidX Bitcoin ETF was generally perceived as the strongest contestant to get regulatory permission and debut this investment vehicle in the U.S. Chances are the industry will not see a crypto-based ETF until 2020 at the earliest.An ETF is a type of investment fund that is tied to the price of an underlying asset ??a commodity, an index, bonds or a basket of assets ??like an index fund. It is listed and traded on exchanges, normally available to both retail and institutional investors. As of September 2019, ETFs represent a $3.9 trillion market, according to research firm XTF, cited by the Wall Street Journal.Related: SEC Continues to Stall on BTC ETFs, All in Wait for BreakthroughA Bitcoin ETF, in turn, would track Bitcoin as the underlying asset. It is an indirect way to purchase cryptocurrency, in which the investor gets the corresponding security without having to hold the actual BTC coins. If listed on a regulated U.S. exchange, a crypto-powered ETF could set the stage for institutional investors, potentially pushing Bitcoin toward the financial mainstream.¬†However, no player has secured the permission to list a Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. yet, as the SEC has been denying and postponing all attempts to register a Bitcoin-focused financial product in the country. Some of the financial watchdog?ôs main arguments against approving Bitcoin ETFs include the supposedly ?úinsignificant??size of Bitcoin futures market, as well as the possibility of fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.Both VanEck, an investment firm, and blockchain-focused financial service company SolidX had tried registering their ETFs separately beforehand ??in August 2017 and in July 2016 respectively ??but the SEC shut down both attempts. In June 2018, they teamed up and filed a request to list a collaborative Bitcoin-based ETF on the CBOE BZX Equities Exchange, the second-largest U.S. equities market operator.The fund is tied to VanEck's subsidiary index MVIS, which will ostensibly calculate the real-time price of BTC based on executable bids and asks derived from U.S.-based crypto over-the-counter (OTC) markets instead of more conventional crypto exchanges, with SolidX is sponsoring the project. Each share of the VanEck?ìSolidX Bitcoin Trust is set to $200,000. SolidX CEO Daniel H. Gallancy previously explained that the high price reflects the fund?ôs intention to attract institutional rather than retail investors.In August 2018, the SEC postponed its decision on the listing of the VanEck?ìSolidX ETF for the first time, citing the unregulated nature of Bitcoin market. In November, representatives from VanEck, SolidX and CBOE met with the SEC to discuss their ETF proposal. According to the memorandum that was released after the meeting, the applicants argued that Bitcoin was in fact more resistant to market manipulation than its traditional counterparts ??e.g., crude oil, silver and gold ??all of which already have ETFs on the market.Nevertheless, in December, the SEC delayed its decision again. The agency set a new deadline for Feb. 27, 2019 in order to further review the rule change proposals. However, the next month, CBOE withdrew the ETF application just a few weeks before it would have faced a verdict from the regulator.¬†As an CBOE spokesperson told Cointelegraph at the time, the decision to pull out was the result of the U.S. government shutdown as the end of the review period on Feb. 27 approached. As Cointelegraph previously reported, the shutdown largely undermine the work of the SEC, among other government agencies.¬†On Jan. 30, CBOE, VanEck and SolidX resubmitted their proposal, making it approximately 40 pages longer compared to the previous version. Still, in March, May and later in August the SEC delayed its decision. The reasoning stayed the same, as the commission requested more answers to questions related to protecting investors and public interest from fraud and similar exploitations. According to the SEC, the latest postponement pushed the decision for listing the VanEck?ìSolidX ETF to Oct. 18.In September, VanEck and SolidX started to offer a limited version of their Bitcoin ETF to institutional investors under the SEC?ôs Rule 144A, which allows the sale of privately placed securities to ?úqualified institutional buyers,??namely institutions like banks and hedge funds who have at least $100 million in assets. The broker-traded fund is called VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust 144A Shares, and according to its official description, it ?úlooks and feels like a traditional ETF.?ùSoon after the launch, industry lawyer Jake Chervinsky took to Twitter to argue that the product did not represent a legal ETF. ?úThis is misleading. The VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust is *not* an ETF. It looks exactly like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which was launched almost six years ago,??he wrote.In any case, VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust 144A Shares are off to a rough start. As of Sept. 19, the product?ôs total net assets are only $40,500, which is less than four BTC, according to the current standings of the market. In the latest move of their continual ETF saga, CBOE, VanEck and SolidX pulled their application out for the second time.¬†?úAfter careful consideration in cooperation with our esteemed client, we have decided to withdraw our filing with the SEC to list and trade shares of the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust,??a CBOE spokesperson told Cointelegraph, adding:¬†?úWe continue to believe there are opportunities for Cboe and our clients in the broader cryptocurrency market, and remain open to pursuing ETP and derivative listings and trading.?ùEd Lopez, head of ETF product with VanEck, confirmed to Cointelegraph that ?úthis action doesn?ôt mean VanEck has given up on its pursuit of a public bitcoin offering.??He elaborated on that statement, saying:?úWe still believe investors would be better served having access to bitcoin through a regulated public vehicle. Given the current nature of the regulatory environment, withdrawal of the filing allows us more time to enhance the filing to help better address the concerns of regulators.?ùThe investment firm did not clarify whether its decision to withdraw was attributed to the performance of VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust 144A Shares. Richard Keary, founder of Global ETF Advisors LLC, an independent management consulting firm that specializes in the exchange-traded products industry, doubts that, however. He noted that it ?úhas nothing to do with performance of the 144A shares,??during an email conversation with Cointelegraph, adding:?úThis is just a procedural process. Withdrawing before it gets rejected, allows them to submit a new filing and start the clock ticking all over again. So, this filing/approval process will continue.?ùNevertheless, it is unclear when VanEck et al. are planning to submit their ETF proposal, as the regulatory environment remains largely cautious about the idea. Earlier this month, the SEC Chairman Jay Clayton told CNBC that although significant steps have been taken to address regulatory concerns surrounding Bitcoin ETFs, there is ?úwork left to be done.??Clayton went on to say that the SEC?ôs concerns were not immaterial:?úPeople needed to answer those hard questions for us to be comfortable that this was the appropriate type of product.?ùMost recently, on Sept. 19, Clayton argued that Bitcoin would require stronger regulation before being listed on major traditional exchanges like Nasdaq or the NYSE. Thus, the SEC?ôs approval will be largely dependent on the maturity of Bitcoin trading markets, Keary told Cointelegraph:?úCurrently not enough volume in the Bitcoin Futures, so another market that needs time to mature and become more robust. Futures are needed as a hedge to the ETF, if there's not enough liquidity for market makers to hedge there will be no liquidity in the ETF.?ùCurrently, the SEC is reviewing two other Bitcoin ETF proposals. One of them was submitted by investment management firm Wilshire Phoenix, which aims to include both BTC and U.S. treasury bonds in its trust to make it fund less volatile and hence more favorable in the SEC?ôs eyes. The company is relatively new to the ETF race, as it first submitted the application in January 2019.¬†The other filing is backed by cryptocurrency index fund Bitwise Asset Management with NYSE Arca, a top U.S. exchange. Bitwise first applied for a SEC-regulated ETF in July 2018. Per the document, the calculated value of its index will gather the price of Bitcoin based on data collected from around 10 preapproved exchanges. Wilshire Phoenix will hear back from the SEC by the end of September, while the deadline for the latter proposal is set for Oct. 13.However, the odds seem to be against the remaining proposals. Chervinsky, who has been closely covering the crypto ETF space on Twitter, puts the chance of approval at 0.01%. Stressing that the SEC?ôs primary complaint is a lack of surveillance-sharing agreements with regulated markets of significant size, he wrote:¬†?úMy guess, unfortunately, is that VanEck withdrew its application after becoming convinced that the SEC wouldn't accept its alternative approach to this problem. If that's true, it's *very* hard (though not entirely impossible) to imagine Bitwise's approach faring any better.?ùSimilarly, Keary, who thought an ETF would be approved this year, now says that he has ?úno sense on actual timing.??In his opinion, a Bitcoin ETF will happen when the Bitcoin market and Bitcoin futures markets are more mature, more liquid and less volatile. ?úBut, it will happen,??he told Cointelegraph.",,,,,,,

In 2008, he had left his role as CEO of UBS as the bank?ôs financial crisis losses spiraled, relinquishing over $10 million of his pay one month after the institution was bailed out by the Swiss government.More than a decade later, the former banker and recently-appointed board member of licensed Swiss cryptocurrency bank Sygnum observed of the crypto sector:?úI don?ôt see a bubble right now. I see more serious business planning and solutions addressing client needs, having learned from the last initial coin offering and Bitcoin bubble.?ùAs reported, Sygnum was recently issued a conditional Swiss banking and securities dealer license and now aims to become a fully regulated bank so as to provide a full suite of financial services, including crypto custody and fiat-crypto conversions.During the interview, Muffli claimed that the company was the only licensed bank specialized in digital assets worldwide that had fulfilled the conditions required for a banking license ?úin just five days.??Most critical, he noted, were Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer measures.When it comes to the traditional financial sector?ôs response to the emergent crypto asset space and industry developments, he said of large banks such as UBS and Credit Suisse:?ú‚Ä®From what we hear, interest has clearly picked up since the licenses were granted. Bank executives are asking their middle management to figure out whether this is just another fintech fad that comes and goes, or whether it is really transformational.?ùHe added: ?úThey are wondering strategically whether they need to commit to this, and what it would mean in terms of changes to systems but also mindset.?ùAs reported, the license granted to Syngum was also given in parallel to Seba Crypto AG, which plans to create a digital asset platform for professional traders and institutional clients, as well as to offer custodial and asset management services.Just last week, Arab Bank Switzerland partnered with blockchain technology firm Taurus to offer Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) custody and brokerage services to its clients.In August, Switzerland?ôs Financial Market Supervisory Authority released new guidance on regulatory requirements for blockchain-based payments, targeted at cryptocurrency exchanges, wallet providers and trading platforms.That same month, Swiss private bank Maerki Baumann revealed that it had experienced a deluge of 400 new clients wanting to tap its future blockchain offerings since revealing its interest in the sector.",,,,,,,,,,,,

broken the support and market capitalization has dipped to just under ...",25-Sep-19,"The total cryptocurrency market capitalization had repeatedly taken support close to the $250 billion mark since mid-July of this year. However, the recent collapse in crypto markets led by Bitcoin (BTC) has broken the support and market capitalization has dipped to just under $220 billion.¬†","It is difficult to pinpoint the exact reason that started the fall. A few speculators might have built up positions expecting the prices to surge following the launch of Bakkt. However, when that did not play out, they started closing their trades in a hurry. As a result, important support levels cracked and the rest of the traders were forced to close their long positions.¬†Another possibility is that the flight to safety following the news of an impeachment inquiry into United States President Donald Trump might have resulted in the quick drop. While the fundamental reasons can be debated, the technical picture gives a reasonable idea on what to expect next and how traders should approach this correction. With the current fall, there will be many overly bearish voices that can scare the traders. However, we do not believe that there are enough reasons to panic yet. Let?ôs see why.¬†We have been mentioning in the past few analysis that the tight range in Bitcoin will be followed by a trending move. That happened on Sept. 24 as the prices broke below the symmetrical triangle and the horizontal support of $9,080. The next support on the downside is $7,451.63.¬†Even if the BTC/USD pair declines to $7,337.78, it will only be a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the entire rally from the low of $3,236.09 to a high of $13,973.50. Though it is a deep correction, traders should not panic because if the bulls can arrest the decline between $7,451.63 and $7,337.78, the pair can still stage a recovery.However, if the bears sink the price and sustain below $7,337.78, the sentiment will weaken further and a quick recovery will be in danger. With the recent fall, the RSI has dipped deep into the oversold territory, which indicates that a relief rally is possible. Any pullback will face resistance at $9,080 and above it at the symmetrical triangle. The price action of the next few days will give us a better idea of whether this fall is a good buying opportunity.Ether (ETH) plunged below the support of $163.755 on Sept. 24 and triggered our suggested stop loss at $160. The bulls are currently attempting to defend the support at $150 because if it breaks down, a fall to $122 is possible.The 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI has dropped into negative territory, which suggests that bears have the upper hand in the short term. However, if the bulls defend the $150??163.755 zone, we might see a relief rally, which will face resistance at the 20-day EMA. We like the developing positive divergence on the RSI but will wait for the ETH/USD pair to form a new buy setup before recommending a trade in it.XRP slipped below the moving averages on Sept.23 and followed it up with a sharp move to a new yearly low on Sept. 24. This fall triggered our proposed stop loss on the long position at $0.24. Currently, the bulls are attempting to push the price above the previous support-turned-resistance of $0.24508.The RSI has formed a positive divergence, which is a bullish sign. If the XRP/USD pair sustains above $0.24508, it will be a positive sign and will indicate that the current fall was a bear trap.However, if the price fails to rise above $0.24508, the bears will again try to resume the downtrend. Below $0.22, the next support on the downside is way lower at $0.19. The 20-day EMA has started to turn down once again and the RSI is in the negative zone, which suggests that bears have the upper hand. We will wait for a new buy setup to form before recommending a trade in it.¬†Bitcoin Cash (BCH) plummeted below the neckline of the head-and-shoulders pattern on Sept. 24, which completed the bearish setup. The first target to watch on the downside is $166.98 and below it $105.¬†However, as the RSI has dipped deep into oversold territory, a minor pullback to the breakdown level is possible. This pullback is likely to be sold into. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls push the BCH/USD pair back above the neckline, but we give it a low probability of occurring. We do not find any buy setups at current levels.Litecoin (LTC) turned down sharply on Sept. 23 and broke below our suggested stop loss of $62. It was followed by another down-move the next day, which broke below the critical support at $58. There is a minor support at $49.3305, which is the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the rally.¬†If this support also cracks, the LTC/USD pair can drop to $30. Any pullback is likely to face resistance in the $58??62.0764 zone. Both moving averages are sloping down and the RSI in the oversold zone, which shows that bears are in firm command.¬† We will wait for the decline to end and a new reversal pattern to form before suggesting a trade in it once again.EOS plunged on Sept. 24 to a low of $2.4001. This sharp fall triggered our stop loss at $3. With the breakdown, the cryptocurrency has resumed its down-move that can extend to $2.20. If this level also breaks down, a retest of the yearly low at $1.55 will be in the cards.¬†The EOS/USD pair might attempt a pullback, which is likely to face stiff resistance at $3.1534 and above it at the downtrend line. The traders will use every relief rally to lighten up their positions. Hence, we suggest traders wait for a new reversal buy setup to form before attempting a long position in it.¬†Binance Coin (BNB) broke below the critical support of $18.30 and $16.2501 on Sept. 24. This has resumed the down-move that can extend to the support line of the descending channel. As the RSI has dipped into deep oversold territory, a minor pullback to $18.30 cannot be ruled out.However, as the sentiment has turned decidedly bearish, every rally in the BNB/USD pair will be sold into. We are not in favor of cherry-picking at these levels because when panic sets in, it is difficult to project where the downtrend will end. Hence, we suggest traders remain on the sidelines.The fall on Sept. 24 broke below the critical support of $107 and the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of $92.933. After this, a complete 100% retracement is possible. Therefore, Bitcoin SV (BSV) now has a target objective of $48.640.With the fall, the RSI has dropped deep into oversold territory, which indicates that a minor pullback might be in the cards. However, any relief rally is likely to hit a wall close to $107. We will wait for a turnaround in the BSV/USD pair before proposing a trade in it.Stellar (XLM) broke below the moving averages on Sept. 23 and dove to a new 52-week low on the next day. Whenever a new low is formed, buyers do not step in because they are unsure of the bottom. There is a psychological support at $0.050, below which the selling can exacerbate.¬†The only minor positive on the chart is that the RSI is forming a positive divergence. However, unless the price actions suggests a bottom, the positive divergence, in itself, can not be used as a buy setup. As the XLM/USD pair has plummeted to new lows, we withdraw the buy suggestion given in the previous analysis. We will wait for a new setup to form before recommending a trade in it.¬†UNUS SED LEO (LEO) has entered our analysis as it has risen into the top 10 list by market capitalization. It has has been gradually grinding lower since topping out on June 26. The bulls have not been able to sustain above the 20-day EMA for more three days since June 27, which shows a lack of demand.¬†The LEO/USD pair can now drop to the low at $1.0075. A breakdown of this support will be a huge negative as it will start a new downtrend that can drag the prices lower to $0.80. However, if the support holds, the bulls will try to push the price above the moving averages once again. We will wait for the pair to form a new buy setup before recommending a trade in it.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

power consumption is critical, ASICs will always be the choice of ...",23-Sep-19,"Electronics giant Samsung filed for a patent in May 2019 titled, ?úProgrammable Blockchain Solid State Drive and Switch.??Even though few details are known about the newly designed system, a surge in patent applications filed by large corporations on blockchain is clearly visible.","Related: Bank of America?ôs Blockchain Foray: Patent Trolling or Hedging Risks?Patent wars ??i.e., battles between corporations or individuals to secure patents for litigation ??are certainly not new. They have been widely practiced in the tech ecosystem since the times of Alexander Graham Bell at the turn of the 20th century, who was involved in over 600 lawsuits.¬†Any great invention from the past century has a history of some kind of patent war, but the digital age has accelerated this phenomenon. From the PC wars between Apple and Microsoft to the smartphone wars of the past decade, patents have been used for both offensive and defensive measures.It has been clear since the beginning that blockchain would see an increasing interest from corporations, which would turn to securing their patents as soon as possible. In just over a year, IBM has tripled the number of blockchain patents secured in the United States to over 100, while Alibaba leads the way with over 260 patents related to blockchain.¬†The number of global blockchain patent filings now considerably outpaces the patent filings for other technologies. However, Samsung has stayed relatively restrained with blockchain. That is, until it registered for a programmable blockchain SSD.¬†This programmable data storage device consists of a nonvolatile memory and a storage controller that is configured to control the system. It has a network interface and a field programmable gate array that is configured to implement a blockchain algorithm. While doing so, it stores at least a block of a blockchain corresponding to the blockchain algorithm in its nonvolatile memory through the storage controller.¬†Moreover, the gate array will be configured to a processor that has a memory with instructions stored. When executed, the processor sends and receives one or more blocks of the blockchain via the network interface. Additionally, the processor controls the programmable gate array to execute the blockchain algorithm on one or more blocks of the blockchain.To understand the significance of this new patent, the drawbacks of general purpose computer devices and ASICs should first be examined.¬†General purpose computer devices (usually GPUs) must be combined with the right software, drivers and configurations to execute a moderately efficient mining algorithm. Even though one GPU can mine multiple coins through this technique, its efficiency is very low. What?ôs more, to change the coin being mined is a hassle and very few miners are able to do so, while the cost of GPUs can vary significantly, as their price is influenced by the gaming and virtual reality industries.On the other hand, ASIC miners are professional mining equipment designed for computing a specific algorithm. This narrowed scope gives the hardware the ability to mine efficiently compared to general-purpose computing devices. However, the rigidity in mining algorithms makes the miner obsolete once a newer, more efficient device becomes available, and many coins are specifically designed to be incompatible with ASICs.Sam Town, an independent crypto analyst told Cointelegraph that Samsung?ôs patent doesn?ôt necessarily mean that the company is going to develop the product:?úPatents are not necessarily a tool to just protect your idea. It can be a defensive weapon to stop other companies from making similar products. Moreover, it can be used to send a signal to the market about the company?ôs intentions. This is most likely the case with Samsung?ùHowever, Nicolas Kokkalis, the head of technology at Pi, the first digital currency compatible with mobile mining, doesn?ôt agree with Town. Kokkalis stated:?úFlexibility comes at the cost of speed and power consumption. FPGAs can be re-programmed with software, but they are slower than ASICs and they consume more electrical power. So for consensus algorithms, like Bitcoin?ôs proof of work, where speed and power consumption is critical, ASICs will always be the choice of miners when possible. There are, however, attempts of consensus algorithms that aim to be ASIC-resistant, e.g., by producing memory-limited algorithms, GPU-hungry functions or by periodically changing the algorithm leaving no-time for ASIC designers to create ASICs in time before the next algorithm rotation.""Cointelegraph reached out to the inventors of the patent ??Rajinikanth Pandurangan and Vijay Balakrishnan ??for their comment on the matter, as well as Samsung, but each refrained from commenting on the matter.The aforementioned patent is not the first time Samsung has tried to disrupt the crypto mining space. The company has been designing and manufacturing three nanometer and five nanometer chips for Bitcoin mining since the first quarter of 2018.¬†The manufacturing process is based on extreme ultraviolet lithography technology, which makes the new 7LPP chips more dense and energy efficient. Samsung states that 7LPP will enable the development of other emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, networking, 5G, automotive as well as technology for enterprise and hyperscale data centers.Samsung has also entered into a strategic partnership with MicroBT ??the third-largest designer of Bitcoin ASICs. MicroBT?ôs latest device, the M20S WhatsMiner, has 68 terahashes per second (Th/s) and a power efficiency of 48 watts per terahash. To compare this with industry standards, Bitmain Antminer S9 achieves 13.5 Th/s with a power efficiency of 98 watts per terahash ??making Samsung?ôs chips allegedly five times more powerful than those used by Bitmain.Samsung?ôs potential pivot toward crypto mining should not come as a surprise, as it is the world?ôs second-largest producer of semiconductor, just behind Intel, which has actually been making its own mining chips.In November 2018, Intel filed a patent for ?úenergy-efficient high-performance Bitcoin mining.??The patent for a system-on-a-chip includes hardware that accelerates Bitcoin mining, reduces power consumption and is optimized to reduce the space and energy utilized during the mining process.The sheer size of Samsung?ôs semiconductor plant could give the firm an automatic advantage, and the same goes for Intel ??and this is only taking its existing infrastructure into account. Samsung is one of the biggest spenders on R&D, spending over $8 billion during the first half of this year alone. With the ever-changing mining algorithms and the need to be continually efficient, new tech from these giants could easily supersede existing hardware.Town believes there is no way around this problem. In his opinion, unregulated capitalism is bound to create monopolies:?úIt is the very nature of competition. There will be a winner (or a few) and most will either be acquired or they will die out. The idea that companies will compete in perpetuity and benefit consumers as a result is flawed. The advantages that Samsung has over miners like Bitmain and Canaan can never be overcome.?ùHowever, Samsung?ôs foray into mining could also have positive impacts on the ecosystem. Being one of the largest companies in the world, the tech giant can make an impression on regulations worldwide. Theoretically, Samsung possesses the influence and resources to lobby governments and even change the public perception around crypto.¬†Hardware manufacturing is not the only front in which Samsung has shown interest in blockchain technology. In 2019, Samsung invested around $8.1 million in the blockchain-based company Blocco and $4 million in KZen Networks. The tech company even confirmed that it is in the process of developing its own blockchain mainnet based on the Ethereum platform. Moreover, the company announced it was working on its own crypto token: the Samsung Coin.President and CEO of Samsung SDS Hong Yuan Zhen disclosed in May 2019 that blockchain can improve productivity in the manufacturing industry. He even praised the productivity gains that real-time data analysis and predictions could bring in conjunction with blockchain technology.In July 2019, the company announced that Samsung Galaxy S10 users could add the Pundi XWallet app to their Samsung Blockchain Wallet. Customers can move cryptos in the Samsung Blockchain Wallet into the XWallet. XWAllet now supports 33 different cryptocurrencies and has seen integration of decentralized applications (DApps). Over 10 DApps are already on the wallet.",,,,,,,

(BTC) mining, companies receive an estimated $700 million from ...",23-Sep-19,"Cross-border transactions on crypto assets are already relevant and have already had a considerable impact on the domestic economy of some countries. For example, last month, the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN) reviewed the Brazilian Trade Balance for crypto assets with new classifications under IMF standards.","In Georgia, for example, which accounts for about 15% of global Bitcoin (BTC) mining, companies receive an estimated $700 million from Bitcoin mining annually. This represents about 5% of the country?ôs GDP, or 10% of exported goods and services.The fact is that the sudden rise of crypto assets could pose challenges to central banks, compete with official fiduciary currencies, and have an effect on monetary policy on many levels. At this stage, monetary authorities around the world are concerned about following the advance of crypto assets. However, this monitoring has been hampered for two reasons.The first is because there were no crypto assets when the most recent revision of macroeconomic statistics manuals took place ??published, for example, by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the United Nations Statistics Division, the Economic Research and Statistics Division of the World Trade Organization, etc. There are no international guidelines available except for a reference in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Compilation Manual and Guide issued by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).The second reason is because the classification of crypto assets and their regulation varies greatly from country to country, and either it hasn?ôt been defined yet or it?ôs been changing in various countries.Related: CBDCs of the World: The Benefits and Drawbacks of National Cryptos, According to Different JurisdictionsThus, while aware of the difficulty of qualifying the essence of cryptocurrency and monitoring something still under development, the IMF decided to provide guidance on crypto asset categories and recommend specific statistical treatment according to current standards. Therefore, the IMF published the Treatment of Crypto Assets In Macroeconomic Statistics, with the caveat that such guidelines may need to be revised if conditions change substantially in the future.This paper provides recommendations on the statistical recording of cross-border transactions associated with Bitcoin-like crypto assets (BLCAs), differentiates digital tokens and BLCAs, explains the mining process, and provides guidance on how to measure mining activity output, among others.The recent move by the Central Bank of Brazil shows a change of position that, until then, did not see risks in digital currency transactions for the national financial system, considering that transaction volume is still very low.After mentioning the IMF's recommendation to classify the buying and selling of crypto assets (especially those for which there is no issuer) as nonfinancial assets produced, the Brazilian central bank now says it will consider the buying and selling crypto assets in the country?ôs trade balance.Note that BACEN did not define crypto assets, but simply said it will follow the IMF?ôs recommendation for the preparation of macroeconomic statistics, considering transactions with crypto assets as nonfinancial assets produced for the calculation of the Brazilian trade balance.Importantly, the IMF guidelines adopt the term ?úcrypto assets??(following the recommendation of the G-20), and categorizes crypto assets as two basic types:While BACEN has shown on other occasions that it understands the difference between tokens, cryptocurrencies and digital currencies, it is silent on the IMF's distinction between the categories of crypto assets for purposes of macroeconomic statistics.However, by not clarifying how digital tokens will appear in macroeconomic statistics, BACEN may have difficulty monitoring the real impact of crypto assets in Brazil. This is because the classification of digital tokens in macroeconomic statistics depends on the category of tokens (payment tokens, utility tokens, asset tokens and hybrid tokens).On the other hand, BACEN has announced that mining activity is now treated as a production process, as stated in the IMF guidelines. As a consequence, transaction fees can be viewed as a payment for transaction verification services. If the transaction fee payer is a nonresident, the miner is exporting transaction verification services to a nonresident.Note that mining output, according to the IMF, can be measured as the sum of the transaction fee and the newly extracted BLCAs.Thus, the second part of mining (i.e., newly extracted BLCAs) can be considered a produced asset resulting from mining.Also, the monetary authority of Brazil said that, because they are digital, crypto assets have no customs registration, but purchases and sales by residents in Brazil imply the conclusion of foreign exchange contracts.The obligation to observe exchange rules in transactions with crypto assets and other related instruments, however, had already been expressly emphasized by BACEN in 2017.In addition, the Central Bank of Brazil?ôs press release concludes that export and import statistics for goods now include purchases and sales of crypto assets. This is justified because Brazil is a net importer of crypto assets, which contributes to the reduction of the trade surplus in the account balance of payment goods.Has BACEN decided to include crypto assets in the country's macroeconomic statistics, due to the increase in the buying and selling volume of crypto assets in retail and the growing interest shown by the traditional financial market?Regardless of the answer, an honest assessment of the impact of crypto assets is needed, realizing the new opportunities, competitiveness, growth and social integration offered by this innovation.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author?ôs alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Tatiana Revoredo is the chief strategy officer at Global Strategy, a specialist in blockchain strategies by the University of Oxford, a specialist in blockchain business application by MIT, and a blockchain professor at Insper and Nextlaw Academy.

industry in the past, maintaining that Bitcoin (BTC) is not a real ...",23-Sep-19,,"Everywhere you look these days, there?ôs turbulence in the economy. A bitter trade war is seeing the United States and China slap ever-increasing tariffs on goods on a tit-for-tat basis. Over in the United Kingdom, never-ending uncertainty shrouds Brexit, with politicians in Westminster and Brussels at an impasse over the country?ôs imminent departure from the European Union.¬†A shock election result in Argentina caused the peso to crash, while hyperinflation in Zimbabwe and Venezuela means everyday essentials are dramatically rising in price on a daily basis. On top of all that, protests continue in Hong Kong amid concerns about interference from the Chinese mainland.And this is just a snapshot of what?ôs happening in the global economy at the moment. It?ôs little wonder that fears of a recession are growing. The services sector represents 80% of gross domestic product in the U.K., and at the start of September, a closely watched survey suggested growth had slowed to a crawl in July. Given that Britain?ôs economy contracted in the second quarter, another three months of decline would officially signal that a downturn has begun. Stateside, investors were spooked by an¬†inverted yield curve, where short-term Treasury bonds yield more than long-term bonds. This indicator has successfully predicted every U.S. recession for almost 60 years.Here?ôs the question: With the global economy in such disarray, is there an opportunity for cryptocurrencies and blockchain to save the day? In this article, we?ôre going to look at the chances and challenges facing the industry right now ??as well as how this technology is already making an impact.First, let?ôs take a look at the positives for crypto and blockchain ??for, after years in the wilderness, some central banks are beginning to explore how the sector can enhance their economies. Back in August, the U.S. Federal Reserve¬†unveiled plans to release a real-time payments and settlements service that would enable funds to be transferred quickly and around the clock, including weekends. Ripple Labs was also elected to the central bank?ôs Faster Payments Task Force Steering Committee ??a milestone that shows financial institutions are in listening mode.There have also been positive murmurings from organizations that have, until now, been skeptical about crypto?ôs potential. The European Central Bank (ECB) has barely hidden its cynicism about the industry in the past, maintaining that Bitcoin (BTC) is not a real currency and crypto doesn?ôt factor into the real economy. But in a sign that a changing of the guard could result in softening attitudes, the nominee to be the next ECB president ??Christine Lagarde, the current head of the International Monetary Fund ??has said central banks should be open to cryptocurrencies and the wider social benefits they could bring.Elsewhere, there is increasing evidence that BTC has been relied on as a safe haven during times of economic turmoil. Financial analysts have maintained that retail investors are relying on the dominant cryptocurrency as a hedge against the turbulence caused by the U.S.-China trade war ??prompting some to describe Bitcoin as ?údigital gold.??Telling evidence of this came in the middle of August, as BTC prices tumbled by more than 7% when tensions between the two economic superpowers appeared to ease.This sentiment has also been spreading from retailers to everyday consumers. The political uncertainty in Hong Kong has seen some protesters turn to cryptocurrency so they don?ôt leave a trail of payments for the government to investigate. A spike in demand there led to locals paying a¬†premium of about $300 per Bitcoin when compared with exchanges elsewhere.¬†Premiums of $420 were seen when Mauricio Macri suffered a shocking defeat in Argentina?ôs presidential elections. And in Venezuela, records for Bitcoin trading volumes are¬†continuously being broken because of its weakening national currency.As with most things in life, there are always two sides to the story. Focusing on the positives for crypto and blockchain would be neglecting some very real and pressing challenges facing the industry ??challenges that extend beyond¬†scalability and security. It has been well-documented that many blockchain networks struggle to compete with the capacity of traditional financial giants, and it is undeniable that¬†repeated hacks have dented consumer confidence and stymied mainstream adoption. Although it is incumbent on the industry to find solutions to these very real problems, there are other issues that lie firmly out of their control.Critics argue that fragmentation ??the current existence of thousands of competing cryptocurrencies and countless blockchains ??means the industry struggles to work in unison and speak with a single voice. This has been coupled with a disjointed approach to regulation, with¬†nations around the world taking contradictory stances on crypto?ôs legality, meaning startups are free to operate in some jurisdictions but banned in others. Whereas a new coin might be¬†welcomed with open arms in Japan, the simple act of owning crypto in India could potentially result in jail time.Mainstream companies are also wading into the world of crypto. While this can be regarded as an opportunity to build public awareness, this brings its own threats. Since Facebook unveiled its white paper for Libra back in June, the reaction from many U.S. politicians has been one of alarm. While some fear a stablecoin spearheaded by a tech giant could undermine the dollar and wreck the global economy, others have gone further ??claiming it could be more of a danger to America than the 9/11 attacks. Back in the crypto world, there are also fears that Libra could undermine BTC and altcoins, ultimately undermining the censorship-free, decentralized world that Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned ??a world where the value of an asset wasn?ôt tied to the fate of the U.S. dollar.These are just some of the chances and challenges that need to be explored and debated if cryptocurrency and blockchain are going to continue gaining traction in the global economy.The CFC St. Moritz says its conference is designed to offer exactly this: a place where the brightest minds can come together to discuss and forge a way forward. Strictly by invitation only, the event aims to pave the way for the valuable transfer of knowledge between participants ??enabling private and institutional investors, as well as family offices and funds, to meet leading experts in the crypto and blockchain universe and discuss the topics mentioned above. Ultimately, the vision is to transfer knowledge by personal interactions between experts and investors, and allow every participant to build a ?úreal??network ??creating unforgettable memories, priceless contacts and the space to pursue new opportunities.Just 200 to 250 people are going to be invited to the next conference, which is set to take place from Jan. 15??7, 2020 at Suvretta House St. Moritz in Switzerland.Disclaimer.

The hearing was informational and touched on a number of issues that have been plaguing the conversation in the U.S. about regulating cryptocurrencies ??a conversation that the release of Facebook?ôs white paper for Libra in June amplified significantly.","The range of attitudes on display yesterday among members of the Financial Services Committee was broad. Brad Sherman ??who coined the term ?úZuck Buck??back in July ??retained his hawkish stance, saying:?úThe U.S. dollar is extremely good currency [...] It fails, however, to meet the needs of tax evaders, sanctions evaders, drug dealers and terrorists.?ùOn the other end of the spectrum, Warren Davidson took his five minutes to question the representatives of the SEC as an opportunity to plug his Token Taxonomy Act and say: ?úI do hope that blockchain can play a role in the data security concerns that this country has,??to the delight of the crypto community.Indeed, the only consistent position among House members seemed to be a shared sense that they really should figure this out quickly. Such disparity in vantage points is not the only reason that no clear course of action has emerged over a summer of congressional hearings to determine how to incorporate cryptocurrencies into the U.S. financial system.The bulk of the Financial Services Committee has no interest in any extreme preventative measures like trying to ban Libra, and certainly would struggle to do so with other cryptocurrencies that are not tied to a company like Facebook that is easy for the U.S. government to reprimand, as the Federal Trade Commission did to the tune of $5 billion for violating consumer privacy.¬†In July, Ranking Member Patrick McHenry explained the plight facing regulators, saying:¬†?úThe world that Satoshi Nakamoto, author of the Bitcoin whitepaper envisioned, and others are building, is an unstoppable force.?ùBroadly speaking, most members of the House Financial Services Committee and their counterparts in the Senate Banking Committee have seemed guarded but curious about cryptocurrencies ??though hostility toward Facebook, particularly, is a common theme.Digital assets have proven new enough territory for regulators and legislators alike that nobody is eager to make the first move.

Bill Huizenga put it while speaking to Cointelegraph, he and his colleagues are ?útrying to figure out regulatorily ?òis it fish or fowl,??and it turns out it?ôs kind of a platypus.??When asked whether Libra and cryptocurrencies at large should be interacting with the SEC more closely, Huizenga answered:¬†?úI would put myself in the same category as where a lot of the other regulators are, which is trying to figure out when and how they interact, because you don?ôt want to be stifling innovation, you don?ôt want to be stifling the creativity that is there, and at the same time you?ôve got to protect investors.?ùThis double-bind also plagued the other side of the hearing, with the witnesses from the SEC reluctant to refer to specific cryptocurrencies or make unambiguous statements about what should happen next. When asked whether legislation or regulation was the next step, Commissioner Robert Jackson Jr., who testified before the committee, told Cointelegraph:?úIs this going to be more of a legislative move or an SEC move? [...] At the moment I don?ôt know.?ùPerhaps Jay Clayton, Chairman of the SEC, put it best in response to a line of questioning from Rep. Al Green as to how to define a security:?úI think statements like ?òif it doesn?ôt produce a return, it?ôs not a security????I think that?ôs a bit of an oversimplification. [...] A lot of lawyers will spend a lot of time figuring out just where that line is.?ù¬†The Chairman of the SEC is under obligation to be much more of a subject matter expert when it comes to securities law than can be expected from a given congressperson, yet Clayton deferred to future prosecution rather than legislation or declarations from his office. It is doubtful that this is because he lacks opinions on the matter, but he and his colleagues are playing them close to the chest.The reality is that securities law is slow to change. The SEC?ôs authority still rests on two acts passed during the heady days of the Great Depression: the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As Rep. Jim Himes pointed out at yesterday?ôs hearing, the SEC prosecutes even an offense as familiar as insider trading without specific legislation behind it, instead relying on anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authorities.While the Token Taxonomy Act would indeed be useful in establishing baseline definitions for how legislators treat different cryptocurrencies, the bill ??like its predecessor ??has seen limited action since introduction in April.¬†Legislation will have to come eventually, but it?ôs unlikely that Congress is going to be the first party to blink. There will be more hearings. Per an Aug. 23 announcement from Chairwoman Maxine Waters, among the Financial Services Committee?ôs priorities for the fall were:¬†?úConducting an ongoing review of Facebook?ôs proposed cryptocurrency and digital wallet [...] exploring data privacy; examining the use of artificial intelligence in financial services; and reviewing the evolution of payments and cash.?ùHowever, hearings have been slow to turn into law, especially when the members of the Financial Services Committee still lack much of the technical knowledge necessary to speak with conviction as to next moves, and especially when later on Sept. 24, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced that the House would be initiating an impeachment inquiry into President Trump, which is absolutely going to take center stage in the House for the foreseeable future.Similarly, it?ôs probably foolish to wait for grand initiatives from the commissioners of the SEC, but the commission is already taking decisive action in the courts and in their approvals ??using existing law and limiting grandiose statements.Blockstack?ôs $23 million token offering earlier this month was a landmark both thanks to its scale and the fact that the company had received SEC approval in advance ??a first. The race to get the SEC stamp for the first Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) will also be one to watch. The same day as the hearing, the commission started publishing that it was looking into Wilshire Phoenix?ôs request to change a rule to allow NYSE Arca to list their BTC ETF.On the other hand, the SEC has concluded a huge number of cases against initial coin offerings from 2017 and early 2018 this past summer, many ending in settlements of well over $10 million. Even without a change to formal rules, these cases demonstrate a clear willingness to pursue bad actors and will continue to establish the industry?ôs guard rails of precedent, which will, for the time being, have to precede new law.Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters was unavailable for comment, as was the SEC?ôs Senior Advisor for Digital Assets Valerie Szczepanik.",,,,,,,

The practice is illegal on regulated exchange platforms.OKEx ??alongside Bibox ??was notably singled out by BTI as being one of the platforms with the purportedly highest levels of wash trading on its platform. The exchange has rebuffed this claim, arguing that ?úBTI?ôs research methodology is not transparent and they do not provide data to back up their claims.?ù¬†OKEx continued to contend that given its nature as a crypto-derivatives platform, the characteristic patterns of trades ??from ?úhedge funds, proprietary traders and high-frequency trading firms????follow a different pattern to spot-only venues:?úDue to the complexity of derivatives instruments trading, thousands of trades could be placed per day by a single user via collocated machines. Attempting to use retail-oriented parameters such as website/mobile traffic in any research is de-facto an apple-to-orange comparison.?ùAside from accusing BTI of lacking comprehensiveness in its analysis and using inappropriate methodologies to examine exchanges??reported volumes, OKEx also used the statement to underscore its apparent commitment to mitigating the risks of market manipulation on its site:?úWe have a trading surveillance team working 24/7 to monitor the trades on OKEx. Any suspicious market manipulation such as self-trading will alert our system, the users involved will have their accounts suspended or terminated immediately. We also partner with AML companies and consistently upgrade our KYC system to ensure that our market is healthy.?ùOKEx added that it has recently joined the Data Accountability & Transparency Alliance led by CoinMarketCap, which was established in a bid to improve the quality of reported volumes after a series of bombshell reports revealed the apparent prevalence of manipulative trading practices in the industry.",,,,,,,,

freedom, like bitcoin does, but rather to give the Chinese government a ...",25-Sep-19,"In what is being considered a major step forward for Binance, CEO Changpeng Zhao (aka CZ) recently announced that his firm was all set to make its first strategic investment in China since leaving the Asian powerhouse back in 2017.¬†","At the time, the government had enforced a local crypto trading ban that resulted in a number of firms either shutting down completely or relocating to other, more hospitable destinations.In regard to this latest development, Binance ??one of the world?ôs leading cryptocurrency exchanges ??recently participated in a funding round estimated to be worth $200 million hosted by Beijing-based Mars Finance, a crypto/blockchain data and news provider. Some of the other big-name players that took part in the event or have previously invested in the venture include:Mars Finance is the brainchild of Wang Feng, a Chinese entrepreneur who has been active in the crypto space for quite some time now. It is estimated that his digital data aggregation venture, HuoXing, attracts a total of 124,000 monthly visits and ranks at around 70,947 in terms of overall web traffic.To gain a better understanding of why Binance is heading back to China despite the country?ôs vehement opposition to all things crypto, Cointelegraph reached out to Sky Guo, CEO of enterprise-focused blockchain platform Cypherium, who highlighted that, ?úBinance understandably left in 2017, as the Chinese regulations for global interactions proved too murky for many companies.??However, he believes that the exchange?ôs turnaround echoes a growth of interest toward crypto from the government:?úThrough its government resources, technological talent, and special economic zones, China has announced to the world that it intends to play a role in the upcoming tidal wave of decentralization. The sheer size of their market makes China impossible to ignore for companies like Binance who wish to become global household names.?ùAdditionally, he also pointed out that the Chinese government makes a clear distinction when it comes to its economic policy framework and the utilization of decentralized technologies. Guo believes that China is clearly looking to harness the energy and trajectory of the upcoming decentralization wave in order to benefit its national interests. He said:?úIt seems as though China is wisely looking to stake its claim in this new generation of software production. Binance and its competitors need to position themselves as trusted facilitators in this new landscape. In doing so, their businesses will expand, but more importantly, cryptocurrencies will gain their validity in the eyes of governments around the world.?ùDespite the Chinese government making it abundantly clear, time and again, that it is not interested in exploring crypto-related financial avenues, Binance?ôs decision to make its way back into the country definitely comes as a surprise ??especially given the real possibility of government intervention and potential to make life difficult for the exchange and other crypto firms, both from a logistical and economic standpoint. In a conversation with Cointelegraph, co-founder and chief marketing officer of Binance Yi He said:?úAny investment has its risks. And our investment in Mars Finance is not really a ?úcrypto investment.?ùOn the subject, Aries Wang, co-founder of Bibox, a digital asset exchange deploying the latest in big data analytics and AI-enhanced algorithms that optimize trades and transactions, speculated on why Binance made the move:?úBinance is looking to recover the engagement and interest of its Chinese community. Nowadays, most mainland China crypto traders would favor other large exchanges such as Huobi so in making this move back to China, I think Binance is looking to address the fact that they?ôve seen a reduction in Binance?ôs power and influence in the Chinese market.?ùA somewhat similar sentiment is shared by Jeffery Liu Xun, CEO at XanPool. He pointed out that by gaining control of a publication that has over 100,000 visitors, Binance will be able to, ?úmuch more easily control the narrative in China for these various coins that they are listing, IEOs,??especially those initial exchange offerings that it plans on listing on its platform in the near future.Also, China seems to be in a position right now wherein it needs liquidity from outside its borders. In this regard, Xun believes that Binance is serving as a means to an end for the local government and that this entire development will turn out to be a win-win situation for all involved parties.¬†Related: Binance Venus Aims to Outshine Libra and Chinese National Crypto?From a numbers standpoint, the Chinese trading community constitutes a large proportion of the world?ôs crypto transaction volume, so it?ôs unsurprising that a major exchange may be looking to re-enter the market.Alternatively, Kyle Asman, founding partner at BX3 Capital ??a business advisory firm ??gave quite a unique point of view in regard to this episode. He told Cointelegraph that he believes, ?úBinance is working closer with the Chinese government than anyone might imagine.??Furthermore, Binance could not have re-entered the market without approval from the Chinese government:?úChina needs to develop a digital payments alternative, as the powers that be there see that trend as something the rest of the world is doing: they don?ôt want to be left behind and want to have a horse in the race. CZ wants to have the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world under his thumb. He sees the opportunity to be number-one.?ùEven though China?ôs hostility toward all things crypto has been quite evident for some time, the People?ôs Bank of China is now reportedly looking to release its very own central bank digital currency (CBDC). To facilitate this development, the government may need the expertise of established blockchain-related firms.Related: Chinese National Cryptocurrency Turns Out Not Being an Actual CryptoAccording to various unconfirmed reports that went viral last month, China?ôs bank is working on the aforementioned project in conjunction with a couple of market leaders like online retail giant Alibaba, internet giant Tencent as well as five other banking organizations.¬†Artem Popov, co-founder of blockchain-backed investment platform Roobee, believes that by launching a CBDC, China is trying to gain a huge amount of global financial leverage ??especially amid news of Facebook planning to launch its much-hyped stablecoin offering Libra in the near future. Popov further told Cointelegraph:?úChinese authorities want to keep a strong eye on the world money supply. One more reason is tightening control over national operations. The proposed currency is not supposed to provide society with financial freedom, like bitcoin does, but rather to give the Chinese government a perfect tool to monitor transactions.?ùEarlier this month, Circle CEO Jeremy Alliare stated in an interview that no one in the world was closer to launching a CBDC than China. Similarly, Michael Yuan ??founder of a new decentralized marketplace, OpenBay ??shared his opinion with Cointelegraph that the People?ôs Bank of China, like all central banking institutions, dislikes currencies that it cannot control but has no issues with cryptocurrencies or blockchain technology that can remain under its purview at all times. He also discussed the dangers Binance is facing and trying to overcome:?úBinance operates in an unregulated financial market where they can be the exchange, the market maker, the investment bank, and the early-stage investor ??all at the same time. That is the source of their enormous profits. But they cannot play this game forever. They will be regulated.?ùThe Asian market is of massive significance to the crypto industry for a variety of different reasons. For starters, China houses some of the largest crypto mining farms in the world. Not only that, but a number of cryptocurrency firms and exchanges (such as OKEx, Bitfinex, KuCoin, Galaxy Digital, etc.) have also set up their bases in Singapore and Hong Kong ??primarily because of the logistical and economic benefits that these regions offer. Lastly, in regard to this entire situation, Yuan told Cointelegraph:?úThe company is playing the long game. Most of their users are Chinese nationals, so I think it is only natural for them to invest in Chinese projects.?ùYi He of Binance also believes that the market in Asia is growing at a fast pace, adding:?úBinance team has Asian genes, but not enough engaged in China. We hope to be more engaged in the blockchain ecosystem, and the investment helps us to better understand the Chinese market and dynamics in the industry.?ùDespite China?ôs ongoing crypto ban, a lot of firms operating within this space still see immense financial potential in the country. Not only that, even the Chinese government can probably greatly benefit by partnering with some established firms to create its very own CBDC offering in the easiest manner possible."

It is not all doom and gloom.?ùCommissioner Robert J. Jackson Jr emphatically supported greater transparency for corporate political spending and the need to provide greater transparency for consumers and investors.¬†Commissioner Hester M. Peirce expressed concern about ?úoverriding investor preferences,??saying that the job of the SEC is not to make decisions for investors. She also emphasized the importance of ?úregulatory humility,??the need to ?úalways be asking if what we?ôre doing is right,??entailing work with investors, corporations and other regulators like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).¬†Commissioner Elad L. Roisman said that ?úmarket integrity is a priority for us.?ù¬†The increase in capital raised in private rather than public markets were front and center in Commissioner Allison Herren Lee?ôs concerns, as were the role of digital assets and cryptocurrencies, as well as financial intermediaries.Chairman of the SEC Jay Clayton began his remarks by applauding the commission's recent progress in IT and cybersecurity, but cautioned: ?úlet there be no doubt: substantial risk remains.?ùClayton also put forward the enduring goal of aligning the interests of ?úmain-street investors??with those of professionals.Rep. Waters asked Commissioner Jackson about a 10b5 exception to insider trading law before shifting the conversation to Facebook?ôs Libra, referring to recent comments from President Trump, as well as the governments of France and Germany.¬†Waters??June call for a moratorium on Facebook?ôs development of Libra set off a summer full of news on potential regulation of the prospective token.Clayton responded to Rep. Waters: ?úwhat we have developed is an ecosystem of financial assets over the years,??saying that he indeed has a problem with the potential of digital assets to evade those existing regulations. He did, however, praise the efficiency of cryptocurrencies at large. Waters, however, pressed on Libra.Continuing with the theme of cryptocurrencies and Libra, Rep. McHenry noted that Facebook?ôs planned token ?úis just an idea at this point; a white paper.??But he asked if an appropriate ecosystem existed for cryptocurrencies, which Commissioner Peirce responded to with skepticism.Rep. Brad Sherman, whose incendiary commentary at the Libra hearings with David Marcus back in July was so memorable, said that:¬†?úThe U.S. dollar is extremely good currency [...] It fails, however, to meet the needs of tax evaders, sanctions evaders, drug dealers and terrorists.?ù¬†Rep. David Scott asked the commissioners about the broad state of regulatory affairs regarding fintech. Peirce responded that a great deal of development is happening overseas, and she would consequently ?úlike to bring more regulatory clarity to the United States so that fintech development can happen here.?ù¬†When Rep. Al Green grilled Clayton on the prospect of subjecting Libra and the Libra Investment Token, Clayton answered:?úI think statements like ?òif it doesn??produce a return, it?ôs not a security????I think that?ôs a bit of an oversimplification. [...] A lot of lawyers will spend a lot of time figuring out just where that line is.?ù¬†Citing a letter from Facebook that declared that the company would not launch Libra without addressing all regulatory concerns, Rep. Emanuel Cleaver asked Clayton whether any concerns had been sent to Facebook. Clayton said that there is a group within the SEC that is working on the question and has its doors open.Data security was first among Rep. Barry Loudermilk?ôs concerns. ?úIn this environment, it is more than a full-time job to stay ahead of the bad actors,??he said, suggesting that the stockpile of data that the SEC holds makes it a ripe target for nation-states and cybercriminals. Clayton agreed with the importance of asking whether the SEC needed certain information. Loudermilk rebutted, ?úis it data you need to store or is it data that you can retrieve??ù¬†¬†Rep. Warren Davidson took the opportunity to promote regulatory clarity and to plug the Token Taxonomy Act that he authored with Representative Darren Soto as a means of coping with unclear regulation for crypto. He also submitted blockchain as a solution to Rep. Loudermilk?ôs concerns, saying ?úI do hope that blockchain can play a role in the data security concerns that this country has.?ù¬†Rep. Anthony Gonzalez commented further on concerns that innovation in crypto was leaving the U.S. due to lack of regulation.

At the time, the head of the IRS, Commissioner Chuck Rettig,¬†said:""Taxpayers should take these letters very seriously by reviewing their tax filings and when appropriate, amend past returns and pay back taxes, interest and penalties.

Equipped with a multicurrency wallet, Telechat implements cryptocurrency transactions in a modern messaging and VOIP application. Users can buy, sell, and transfer digital assets such as The yet to be named Gold backed Coin, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Binance Coin. Intending to replace traditional financial institutions and capture the remittance sector, Telechat seeks to provide a cost-effective option for sending money worldwide.?úWe believe fintech is the future, and the future of money is global?? said Danny Oyekan, Chairman at Dan Holdings and Executive Chairman of Telechat. ?úCross border remittance services like Moneygram and Western Union are still popular in developing parts of the world such as India and Africa, however, these services charge fees between 10% and 15%. For some people, these fees take a significant part of their salary. Telechat aims to remove that financial burden by bringing global adoption of DeFi technology.Telechat provides messaging features such as private chats, secret chats, broadcast lists, and both private and public channels for group discussions. The chat features video and voice calls, text and voice messages, stickers, user location sharing, and other forms of media. Aside from connecting people socially, the application additionally connects people financially. Users have an integrated cryptocurrency wallet that supports a variety of significant digital assets.The stored cryptocurrencies can be sent to anyone anywhere, and even be exchanged into local currencies. Users have real control over their assets as they hold control over their private keys, ensuring that no one else can access or control their wallet. With a friendly and simple interface, users can view their balance and complete transaction history, filled with details such as addresses, recipients, and transaction value.Data became one of the most valuable assets in the 21st century. Technological corporations misuse the trust people have in them by selling their private data. Most messaging platforms are owned by companies who have previously sold user data to other entities. Disturbed by this notion, Dan Holdings focused heavily on privacy when creating Telechat.Aside from protecting privacy, financial freedom should be established as well. In a period of global geopolitical uncertainty and a potential recession, people not only require stability but demand it. For this reason, Telechat?ôs Wallet ?úCoins App??will provide stability using the yet to be named Gold backed Coin for Payments and Remittances and ensuring stability of the price when sending payments. Telechat also provides its users with control over their private keys. Without using intermediaries, everyone can decide how their assets are stored and whom they are sent to, in the absence of any 3rd-party supervisor.Additionally, Telechat focused on portability, ensuring that users can manage and access their cryptocurrency wallet no matter where they are, by implementing their messaging solution into a mobile application.
