Gox exchange scandal for bitcoin and cryptocurrency veterans, the world's largest crypto loss for an exchange.In February 2014 Mt. Gox revealed that almost 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins, as well as 100,000 of its own Bitcoins, had been stolen — what at the time was an eye-watering 7% of all bitcoins and worth around $473 million.Bitcoin trader Kolin Burges from London is surrounded by reporters as he protests against...

The clearest example of this has been shown in big bitcoin moves when certain countries’ markets open. South Korea was a strong example and London often moves bitcoin at open.Another example has been when equity indexes move and ten minutes or so later or roughly the time in takes for the blockchain to do its thing the price of bitcoin sets off in a new direction.It would be a funny world if bitcoin did not correlate with other markets because anything linked to ‘fiat’ is a conduit for hedging and arbitrage where lots of potentially easy money is to be had. This is especially true for immature assets like bitcoin where the armies of traders have not refined their armament into the super-efficient penny-stealing ‘algos’ that grace older markets.Right now equities are swooning, the Dow hitting its important 200-day moving average on Friday before bouncing back. The week starting October 8, 2018 was a bad week for stocks and it is not surprising that it was a bad week for bitcoin. It makes sense, there are all sorts of reasons a seller of equity would be a seller of their crypto.Here is the Dow:Plotting the past of the DowAnd here is Bitcoin:A very strong floor on the Bitcoin priceWhat we see on the chart is a very strong floor on the bitcoin price. For a bull this is a huge deal. This level is for them the bottom of bitcoin, probably forever. To me it looks like a big support level that if broken will deliver the move to ‘the real bottom’ where I want to buy. This is wishful of me and I am accumulating bitcoin at the current level, but I am not loading up like I would at $2,500.So now we are on the brink of an equity crash and if it happens, and the odds are likely 50/50, bitcoin will break the $6,000 level and it will slump.Some might say as ‘digital gold’ bitcoin will rally, and it is worth watching out for that because opinion is not fate.The key to bitcoin is the next move will be major with the trend in a forever tightening range creating a setup where a point will soon be reached when bitcoin will fly off to a new pricing level.For equity people what happens to bitcoin could be extremely significant. If bitcoin breaks down it will be a solid signal that shares are going to do more than correct, as there is no one supporting bitcoin, unlike stocks. It will give a clean signal that people are dashing to ‘fiat’ and away from secondary assets. As such, bitcoin may be the leading indicator share investors need.So look to bitcoin to gauge what is next for stocks.----Clem Chambers is the CEO of private investors Web site ADVFN.com and author of Be Rich, The Game in Wall Street and Trading Cryptocurrencies: A Beginner’s Guide. "

[+] Russia, Moscow"," Bitcoin alone could push global temperatures over the 2ºC catastrophic threshold by 2034 if the cryptocurrency gets adopted at the same pace as other broadly used technologies, says a new report in the journal Nature Climate Change.You’re forgiven if you aren’t familiar with a digital currency that could single-handedly devastate the planet. “Six months ago I wasn’t either,” says Camilo Mora, lead author of the study. When coauthor, Katie Taladay, first proposed analyzing Bitcoin’s emissions, Mora thought she was kidding. “I thought it was a video game.” What came from the analysis floored the research team. From the paper: “Reducing emissions to keep warming below 2ºC is already regarded as a very difficult challenge given the increasing human population and consumption as well as a lack of political will. Then came Bitcoin.” *Critics of this report point to how difficult it is to calculate power usage because of how dispersed the Bitcoin network is. They also point to the IT sector's efforts in reducing its footprint. It is certainly very possible that tomorrow we create a new technology that will produce electricity without emissions,"" says Mora. ""But it is just as possible that we do not. Are we willing to take a gamble when at stake is the viability of our planet? According to The International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook (WEO) between 55-65% of the electricity by 2040 may still be produced by coal, gas, and oil. So decarbonatiozation of electricity is something that we should push harder, but the full conversion is still far.""  While crypto proponents argue it's unlikely that Bitcoin's energy consumption will remain fixed over the next hundred years, the report's urgency is driven by the impact Bitcoin could have over the next 16-23 years, suggesting Bitcoin (and probably every area impacting climate change) may have to act a lot faster to reduce carbon emissions.The estimated emissions produced by Bitcoin last year alone is 69 million metric tons of CO2. Mora calls the numbers mind-blowing. “That is the source of concern for us.  If this [technology] is so insignificant and the footprint is so big, can you imagine if this thing were to take off? ” As Bitcoin gains popularity, it’s energy demands increase dramatically. “We don’t have a single thing–not agriculture, not transportation–that we can think of that in two decades would be enough to warm the planet by two degrees. But Bitcoin can.”What’s causing the emissions explosion?Bitcoin miners are the reason for the ugly energy report card. Bitcoin has no central bank. It’s a peer-to-peer decentralized network for digital currency. Bitcoin purchases generate blocks of data. It’s like a folder with a complicated math problem inside as the key. A miner is simply anyone who wants to join the Bitcoin network and owns powerful Bitcoin processing hardware necessary to support the software capable of solving the key and verifying the Bitcoin. This makes Bitcoin super hard to counterfeit. As compensation for providing this level of computationally intensive security, miners get a percentage of the Bitcoins they verify. But verification takes an enormous amount of energy and as Bitcoin gets more broadly adopted, the energy demands increase perilously. The current analysis suggests  mining data for profit could be more destructive to the planet than mining the planet itself for profit. Research methodsThe researchers incorporated previous peer-reviewed methods from Digiconomist in their analysis and tracked the power efficiency of hardware used for Bitcoin mining with the geographic location of miners and the CO2 emissions of producing electricity in those regions.Another of the paper’s authors, Randi Rollins, says their dire estimates are quite conservative. The hardware requirements for mining Bitcoin generate a lot of heat. The energy needed to cool the Bitcoin mining rigs weren’t even factored into the emissions estimates.Is there any chance both Bitcoin and the planet can survive?Bitcoin is public and transparent. There’s no vetting process for miners. Anyone can become one. Which is why there are no emission standards applicable to miners. It may seem like Bitcoin is an ecological fail in a global libertarian experiment. Ironically, many Bitcoin advocates who champion libertarian values say it’s up to governments, not Bitcoin, to impose standards that require implementation of renewable energy technologies to reduce emissions. An argument can be made that Bitcoin’s emissions trajectory is no more Bitcoin’s fault as it is humanity’s fault for not hastening the transition to renewable energy. The authors of today’s paper argue that given its impact, Bitcoin needs to take an active role in solving the problem. One possible way for Bitcoin to reduce its footprint might be to make the keys easier to resolve. But this could potentially leave the currency more vulnerable to counterfeit. And if it’s easier to solve, more miners get into the market, thereby maintaining or increasing the emissions footprint as adoption increases. We cannot predict the future of Bitcoin, but if implemented at a rate even close to the slowest pace at which other technologies have been incorporated, it will spell very bad news for climate change and the people and species impacted by it,"" says Mora via press release. “With the ever-growing devastation created by hazardous climate conditions, humanity is coming to terms with the fact that climate change is as real and personal as it can be. Clearly, any further development of cryptocurrencies should critically aim to reduce electricity demand, if the potentially devastating consequences of 2°C of global warming are to be avoided.”*Updated Oct 29th 2017 @ 4:00pm PST"

On some exchanges, including the Hong Kong-based Bitfinex exchange where bitcoin often trades at a premium, the bitcoin price climbed to over $7,000. The sudden rise in the bitcoin price this morning was signaled by a sell-off of the dollar-linked tether digital coin — the only cryptocurrency which is down today, according to CoinMarketCap data.Traders often sell tether to buy other cryptocurrencies and a sudden influx of tether sellers would push down the tether price — and boost the bitcoin price if that's what traders are moving their money to. Tether was down by some 3% in the run up to bitcoin's sudden price rise.A smartphone displays the bitcoin market value on the stock exchange via the Yahoo Finance app.... [+] (Photo by Guillaume Payen/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)Tether is the second-most traded of all digital currencies after bitcoin, according to CoinMarketCap.Tether’s tokens are designed for stability and the tether price doesn't usually stray far from the U.S. dollar price because Tether Limited, the company that issues the tokens, says each one is backed by a dollar in its bank accounts — though this has not been independently verified.This morning Bitfinex put out a statement saying it temporarily suspended fiat deposits on to the exchange ""for certain user groups"" last week in order to deal with ""processing complications.""It read:""We are working to implement a new and increasingly robust fiat deposit system to be available in the next 24 hours, by Tuesday, October 16, 2018, to allow for the efficient processing of fiat deposits. Until then, we apologize for the inconvenience of the situation.""The exchange also sort to reassure users withdrawls from the exchange were operating normally.It has been suggested that tether trading on the Bitfinex exchange, which has the same chief executive as Tether Limited, has helped to prop up the bitcoin price over recent months.Bitfinex dismissed allegations that it was insolvent in a Medium post last week, and said that withdrawals were functioning as normal.""Bitfinex is not insolvent, and a constant stream of Medium articles claiming otherwise is not going to change this,"" the exchange wrote. ""As one of only a very few exchanges operating since 2013, with a small team and low operating costs, we do not entirely understand the arguments that purport to show us to be insolvent without providing any explanation about why. The wallets below represent a small fraction of Bitfinex cryptocurrency holdings and do not take into account fiat holdings of any kind.""This morning's rise in the bitcoin price all but erase the losses bitcoin recorded late last week, leaving the bitcoin price roughly level since mid-September.As usual, bitcoin's price jump pushed up the wider cryptocurrency market, with the ethereum price and the ripple (XRP) price both recording around double-digit percentage gains.Short, sharp changes in the bitcoin price are often attributed to either trading bots initiating a buy or sell order that then gets picked up by others, causing a domino effect on the price, or by so-called whales (large holders of a cryptocurrency or another asset) buying or selling a big enough chunk at under or above the current market rate.This causes the market rate of the asset to suddenly move in the direction of the sale, often causing havoc for exchange operators.The bitcoin price has suddenly begun swinging wildly again after months of calm.Bitcoin's falling price since the beginning of the year (which is down from highs of almost 20,000 at the end of 2017) has been put down to a fall in trading volume since its peak at the end of 2017 — something that has hit cryptocurrency exchanges around the world, prompting some to cut costs and lay off staff.Elsewhere, some market watchers speculated the rise in the bitcoin price could signal a return to form for the U.S. tech-heavy Nasdaq stock exchange — which last week dropped sharply towards the end of the week.The bitcoin price last week fell after a wider sell-off of global tech stocks.The U.S. Nasdaq Composite Index last week became the first major U.S. stock market benchmark to dip into a correction, dragged down by losses across all the major technology-related companies.A correction on Wall Street is defined as down more than 10% from its high.Online retailer Amazon, streaming service Netflix, and Google parent Alphabet were all in correction territory after taking big hits due to fears around rising interest rates."

(Photo by Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)The modified vending machine receives a bitcoin payment via a built-in QR code and through the Lightning Network. While this is still far from a commercial proposition, it demonstrates how the Lightning Network could allow small bitcoin transactions to happen on a much bigger scale than is currently possible.Bitcoin's Lightning Network creates a layer on top of the bitcoin blockchain, where transactions can be passed back and forth before being added to the underlying blockchain.This should mean transaction speed is greatly increased while costs are significantly reduced and the concept has been backed by bitcoin fan Jack Dorsey, the founder of micro-blogging site Twitter and U.S. payments processor Square.The vending machine accepts bitcoin payments through the Lightning Network, via a QR code.When sending a Lightning payment, two parties deposit the funds at one bitcoin address, a so-called channel, in which they can exchange funds a limitless number of times.This maintains bitcoin's security but means small, regular payments don't need to be added to the underlying blockchain until the channel is closed.In September payment processing startup CoinGate announced it was adding all 4,000 of its merchants to the off-chain system.CoinGate merchants which can now accept payments via any Lightning Network-enabled bitcoin wallet include Swiss watch manufacturers Chronoswiss and Louis Chevrolet, gaming store Mmoga.com, hosting service Bitlaunch, and adult websites Livejasmin and Manyvids.Questions have been raised about what Lightning Network adoption will mean for the bitcoin price, with much of the price dependent on transaction fees picked up by miners.Most are though confident that with increased bitcoin adoption the price will continue to rise.The bitcoin price has been on a downward trend throughout much of 2018 after last year's bull run, which saw the price of one bitcoin soar from less than $1,000 at the beginning of the year, to almost $20,000 by December.The bitcoin price has somewhat stabilized after being heavily sold off earlier this year.This year it would appear investors are waiting to see whether established financial institutions decide to move into bitcoin and cryptocurrencies markets before they either buy more or bail out of crypto.Global regulators have also been trying to get a handle on the bitcoin and cryptocurrency industry, which has been accused of being a digital ""wild west."""

and ...","Sep 27, 2018,02:35pm EDT",Getty,"At the beginning of 2017 Bitcoin was trading at $968. During the year it grew to a high of $19,783. News stories sparked many to ask, ""Should I invest in Bitcoin?"" More recently Bitcoin's price had dropped back to $6,511 and the interest subsided.For some users, Bitcoin is a way to avoid government intrusion and illegally evade paying taxes. Most Bitcoin owners, however, want to comply with IRS regulations.The IRS classifies all cryptocurrencies as property. Buying Bitcoin is not a taxable event. But using Bitcoin to buy something else is considered a sale of Bitcoin and selling property for more than you purchased it for is a taxable event. If you ""sell"" some Bitcoin at a profit that you purchased within the last year, you will have to report short term capital gains on your tax return and pay ordinary income tax rates. If you sell a trade lot that you have held at least a year, you may only have to report long term capital gains which are taxed at a lower rate.Selling Bitcoin at a loss will generate short or long term capital losses which can be used to offset capital gains. But buying any Bitcoin within 30 days before or after selling Bitcoin for a loss may generate a wash sale and then the loss must be folded back into the purchase.
The IRS relies upon the taxpayer to correctly track and pay tax on Bitcoin and other crypto currencies. Even if the IRS doesn't know about your Bitcoin activities you are still responsible for complying with the tax code.Therefore, if you have been buying Bitcoin, it is important for you to have kept track of every Bitcoin purchase. Each purchase is considered a trade lot. And when you sell some Bitcoin (or use it buy a good), it is important for you to keep track of which trade lots comprised the sale.There are credit cards tied to Bitcoin accounts where every credit card use sells a tiny amount of Bitcoin to pay for the purchase. But every time you use such a card it is a taxable event which must be tracked. Other credit cards offer Bitcoin as the rebate rewards for using the card. Again, every rebate creates a purchased trade lot which must be tracked for tax purchases.Getting paid in Bitcoin is even more confusing. If you accept Bitcoin for services you have earned income. You owe ordinary income taxes. You also owe self-employment taxes. The same is true if you are mining Bitcoin. Mined Bitcoin must be valued as income at a fair market value the day it is mined. Once the Bitcoin is mined and you have paid income tax, it enters your inventory as its own trade lot. Any subsequent gains are taxed at long or short term capital gains tax rates.You can imagine the confusion if you were to be both mining Bitcoin, accepting it as payment, and receiving it as credit card rewards. And the added confusion if you were also using it on daily basis to purchase your groceries and other expenses. Nearly every transaction is both taxable and potentially a wash sale.For a currency intended to make money simple and easy, IRS regulations make it a nightmare of compliance issues."

Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork FUDSeveral analysts emphasized the uncertainty surrounding the hard fork that is scheduled to take place in bitcoin cash, currently the fourth-largest digital currency by market capitalization on CoinMarketCap.Craig Wright and Roger Ver, both major proponents of bitcoin cash, have begun advocating for two different versions of the digital currency. ""The end result will most likely be a split in the network resulting in two different versions of Bitcoin Cash when both upgrades go into effect this Thursday,"" Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at social trading platform eToro, told Business Insider.""There is a tremendous amount of FUD surrounding the Bitcoin Cash hard fork,"" said Joshua Frank, co-founder of cryptocurrency analytics platform TheTIE.io.""It seems like there is a lot of confusion in the market as to what is driving price and who will emerge as the winner in the BCHABC vs. BCHSV fight,"" he added. Frank stated:We have seen this FUD and confusion in Twitter conversations. This is reflected by the fact that Bitcoin Cash has had sentiment volatility three times higher than any other major cryptocurrency over the last 24 hours and BCH’s tweet volume is 217% higher than its 20 day moving average.With the uncertainty expressed by crypto traders on Twitter, both the short and long-term sentiment of Bitcoin Cash remain negative. It will be interesting to see how the sentiment of BCHABC vs. BCHSV as well as miner adoption play out over the next 48 hours. We anticipate this having a strong impact on future price movement.Technical DevelopmentsWhile Frank emphasized sentiment, other analysts pointed to market factors when explaining bitcoin's recent sharp drop.""As far as I can tell this move is more technical in nature,"" said Greenspan.Eric Ervin, CEO of Blockforce Capital, offered a similar perspective, stating that ""the recent price plunge is a cause of purely technical moves.""""The significance of the $6,000 support level shouldn't be understated. As the bear market has trudged along these past few months, that level has held steady,"" he noted.As a result, ""many investors have come to see it as a stop-loss measure. This would explain the large amount of liquidations that have occurred.""""Looking forward, today’s price drop may be a blessing for the asset as it could help push the market to a bottom, after which it can bounce back,"" added Ervin.Dual HeadwindsWhile some analysts chose to emphasize either the uncertainty surrounding the bitcoin cash hard fork or instead technical analysis, others asserted that the market's price movements were the result of both.Tim Enneking, managing director of Digital Capital Management, was in this camp. ""The markets have been incredibly soft and the BCH fork simply provided the catalyst for a drop that's been waiting to happen for a while now,"" he said.Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency fund of hedge funds BitBull Capital, provided a similar point of view.""Today's sharp drop in Bitcoin price is a result of both the Bitcoin Cash dispute (the upcoming fork) and the increasing pressure on the $6K price point.""He noted that ""Over the last several months, that price point has been repeatedly tested, and bounced back above it but to lower and lower highs.""""While many were seeing the rebuffing of the $6K price point as support, at BitBull we argued that the more the $6K price point is tested, the more likely it was to break.""DiPasquale emphasized that as market participants aim to spread FUD, it provides a catalyst for sell-offs. As a result, many traders may simply ""adopt a wait and see"" approach until things calm down, he concluded.Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ether."

Last year, the bitcoin price ballooned from less than $1,000 at the beginning of 2017 to almost $20,000 in December.The bitcoin price has since fallen sharply back, currently trading at around $6,500, and dragging many of the biggest cryptocurrencies with it — many of them recording 80% declines from their peaks.A sticker with a bitcoin logo is seen on a street lantern in the center of Bucharest, Romania on...

Earlier this year Ripple Lab's chief executive Brad Garlinghouse boasted there would be ""dozens"" of banks using xRapid by the end of 2019.Elsewhere, many big investment banks, including the likes of New York-banking giant Goldman Sachs, are experimenting with bitcoin products to allow clients to participate in the cryptocurrency market without having to deal with often clunky and relatively unregulated bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges.Meanwhile, a report out last month from cybersecurity firm McAfee found that cybercriminals are ratcheting up efforts to target devices with cryptocurrency malware. Christiaan Beek, the lead scientist and senior principal engineer with McAfee Advanced Threat Research, said that in the past few years devices like internet routers have emerged as possible targets for so-called cryptomining.Approximately $1.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency has been stolen in the past two years, according to McAfee.This isn't the first time the IMF has warned over risks from bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. The IMF's stability report last week said:Despite its potential benefits, our knowledge of its potential risks and how they might play out is still developing. Increased cybersecurity risks pose challenges for financial institutions, financial infrastructure, and supervisors. These developments should act as a reminder that the financial system is permanently evolving, and regulators and supervisors must remain vigilant to this evolution and ready to act if needed.The 2017 bitcoin bull run catapulted bitcoin and cryptocurrencies into the global spotlight.The IMF also said in its October World Economic Outlook report that the global economy is now expected to grow at 3.7% this year and next year, down 0.2 percentage points from an earlier forecast in April, as the U.S. and China ramp up their ongoing tariff fight.Earlier projections now appear to be ""over-optimistic"" given that risks from ""further disruptions in trade policies"" have become more prominent, said Maurice Obstfeld, IMF chief economist, in a prepared speech.The fund also cut its forecasts for global trade volume, with the total goods and services flow is expected to grow by 4.2% this year and 4% next year — down 0.6 and 0.5 percentage points, respectively from earlier estimates.The fund said in the report that the downward revisions were notable in several countries: Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Iran and Turkey — many of which have been experiementing with cryptocurrencies.Emerging economies as a whole have experienced larger volumes of capital outflows as investors shift their money out, often using bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to dodge capital controls, on the back of the U.S. raising interest rates.Countries such as Argentina and Turkey have been among the most troubled, with their currencies crashing to all-time lows against the greenback amid questions over their governments' economic management."

Deciding to accept cryptocurrencies is more like the decision to accept foreign currencies than just choosing to add a new form of payment processor. There are significant benefits to accepting crypto, but it is not without some drawbacks. Savvy business owners should weigh these pros and cons when making the decision for their company.Should your company accept cryptocurrency?According to Michael Foster, co-creator of localethereum — a decentralized Ethereum marketplace enabling peer-to-peer exchanges — “crypto enables cheap and borderless near-instantaneous transactions. This enables customers all over the world — even those without access to traditional banks, but with access to the Internet — to purchase your company's services or products.” Dibu Paul, of Alchetron, the Free Social Encyclopedia for the World, notes that this is a big change. “Especially for large payment amounts, which have historically taken extra time to clear, crypto transactions are nearly instantaneous.” In addition, cryptocurrencies are not bound by a specific country's exchange rate: rather, they are universally recognized, which makes them more attractive for many businesses. For international e-commerce companies in particular, these advantages can be significant.Paul also notes another benefit of crypto: it makes it easy for many people to contribute to a single purchase because everything goes to a smart public ledger, which can be trusted. This makes crypto a good medium for crowdsourcing. Using cryptocurrency as payment is also a good choice for high-risk businesses, since traditional payment gateways might not support them.Transactional benefits aside, Josh Reif of Reif Ventures, LLC, adds that “accepting cryptocurrency can help you attract a younger demographic of people who prefer the simplicity and anonymity of crypto transactions.” Carmen Mastropierro, the owner of three digital magazines and an e-commerce website which accepted cryptocurrency, concurs: “I believe accepting cryptocurrency as a payment is wise for many businesses. Just offering several payment options has always been linked to higher conversion rates. In addition, some customers feel safer paying with crypto as compared to PayPal or credit cards.”Alexander Winston, Managing Director of PPC Protect, adds: “I think it's important to always be open to new technology. If a customer wants to pay you in crypto, why should you turn them down? Originally, we only accepted payments in dollars through processors such as Stripe and PayPal. But with the vast increase in the number of cryptos available over the past few years, we've had quite a few customers request to pay in crypto.”What are the risks involved in accepting cryptocurrency?Foster says there are three primary risks of accepting crypto:  (1) you don't know how to keep your crypto safe; you or your business are risk averse. (2) Cryptos are highly volatile — just look at Bitcoin’s price chart this year; (3) the regulatory and tax schemes are confusing and depend on where your business is located.”CPA and COO Matthew May, founder of Acuity, adds: “Other risks include transaction fees, liquidity concerns and counter-party risks associated with using crypto exchanges, which act as the processors for businesses that do not directly accept crypto. Exchanges let you convert crypto to “fiat” — e.g., government-backed cash — but leaving money in exchanges leaves the crypto coins vulnerable to theft. “The crypto counterparty risk mantra is, ‘Not your keys, not your coins,” May continues.  “This is the educated person's acknowledgement that when you send crypto to any of the exchanges, you add the extra risk of someone else having full custody and ownership of your assets.” To address this issue, those who have any significant money in crypto usually move it to a “hard wallet” offline, like a Ledger Nano.How could your business accept cryptocurrency?If the pros outweigh the cons for your business, and you want to add crypto to your payment offerings, how do you begin? Antonio Madeira of CryptoCompare explains how crypto transactions occur. In order to accept crypto as a form of tender for products or services, your business needs either a digital mobile “wallet” or a Point of Sale (PoS) machine. While the two processes are essentially the same, having designated equipment and accompanying software and support enables a more seamless experience for your customer and your business. A QR code for the amount of the transaction is generated on the business end, which is then scanned by the customer to pay and complete the transaction. Different PoS machines have various benefits, but most charge a fee for this service.Madeira continues, “In order to accept crypto via your business website, sign up with a service such as Bitpay or Coinbase, which has plug-ins that you simply install automatically into your system. These gateways integrate with major e-commerce platforms. Customers will be able to check out using crypto, which is then deposited to your digital wallet or deposited as a local currency.”“Accepting crypto can be a great advantage to a business. For our new business, adding them was as simple as adding and configuring a WordPress plugin,” explains Jacob Murphy of GPS Tracking Made Easy.Whether choosing to accept crypto or not for your business, it is clearly prudent to know the facts. Ask other entrepreneurs about their experiences, evaluate your risk aversion level, and proceed with care. "

[+] company's technology lab in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, Canada. Photographer: James MacDonald/Bloomberg","The first week of September turned out to be a bad week for cryptocurrencies in general, with reports of Goldman delaying plans for its proposed cryptocurrency trading desk hurting investor sentiments. The news sent Bitcoin prices plummeting – erasing the strong gains the cryptocurrency witnessed over the first few days of the month. Bitcoin is currently priced below $6,300, which is around the levels at which it traded for most of August.While Bitcoin is no stranger to extreme volatility, the latest sell-off seems to have been overdone. We believe that Goldman’s decision is just a hiccup in cryptocurrencies’ path to mainstream adoption; ongoing efforts by a wide range of big and small companies across industries to incorporate blockchain technology should inevitably boost the adoption of prominent cryptocurrencies and tokens in the long run. As we detail in our interactive Bitcoin Price Estimator, there should be a steady recovery in the number of unique users as well as transaction volumes on the Bitcoin network over coming months – helping Bitcoin prices reach around $8,500 by the end of the year.The graphic below captures our base case forecast for the monthly average price of Bitcoin this year based on our estimates for transaction volume and number of Bitcoin users, and also shows a possible price range for the cryptocurrency taking into account a relatively bullish as well as bearish outlook for the rest of the year.What Drives The Price Of A Bitcoin?Like the price for anything, Bitcoin’s fundamental price depends primarily on demand and supply. Demand for Bitcoin is primarily driven by two factors: the number of active users, and how much they transact. On the supply side, the number of available Bitcoins is capped, and about 80% of the capped number is already mined. As such, it is sensible to focus on the demand, both in terms of users and transaction volumes.This also makes sense given the fact that Bitcoin prices over the years have primarily been driven by the perception of how a particular piece of news boosts or hurts the potential number of Bitcoin users and their transaction volume in the long run. This has held true for the period since Bitcoin was first introduced, barring the last few months of 2017 when the media euphoria surrounding cryptocurrencies drove Bitcoin prices to an all-time high of almost $20,000. Since then, Bitcoin’s price has moved in tandem with news that signaled either increased adoption in the future – like Goldman’s original decision to setup a cryptocurrency trading desk and IntercontinentalExchange’s ongoing work on a new trading platform that supports cryptocurrencies – or a setback in terms of long-term adoption – like a cyber-attack on two South Korean Bitcoin exchanges in June followed by the SEC more recently rejecting plans for a Bitcoin ETF.In our interactive Bitcoin Price Estimator, we forecast changes in the number of unique users as well as transaction volumes for each month over the rest of 2018 to arrive at our estimate for Bitcoin’s fundamental value. This video shows how to leverage our bitcoin pricing dashboard. While the dashboard looks fairly basic, in back-testing – a method to see how well it could have predicted prices in the past – it was almost 94% accurate.As we pointed out above, we expect the number of users on the Bitcoin network to continue to grow steadily over the coming months, which is why we believe the Bitcoin price will jump more than 30% over the next three months to reach $8,500. While this figure pales in comparison to the high it reached last year, and is also well below the $10,000-level seen in May, it should be noted that the SEC is still reviewing proposals for a few Bitcoin ETFs. Approval would act as the single-biggest growth catalyst the cryptocurrency industry has seen to date, and presents a huge potential upside to Bitcoin prices. Notably, efforts to improve regulators’ perception of the nascent industry should receive a boost in the near future thanks to the recent formation of the first full-fledged cryptocurrency lobbying group, the Blockchain Association. In our view, it is only a matter of time before Bitcoin sees another strong rally, but the pace of growth over the coming months is unlikely to be spectacular."

That's the widely accepted perception but is it possible to mine bitcoin more cheaply and in a less environmentally damaging way?","Northern Bitcoin, a German listed company, has begun mining bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies deep within a Norwegian former metal mine and claims it has slashed the price and energy costs of bitcoin mining.Bitcoin miners around the world have unearthed more than $4.7 billion in revenue so far this year, according to Diar, a bitcoin and blockchain research firm, but due to sky-high electricity prices and this year's fall in the value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, profits are increasingly hard to come by.The Lefdal mine near Norway's Sandane now acts as a data center for some of the world's biggest tech... [+] companies.The largest mining pool operator in the world, Bitmain, will soon be forced to average out electricity costs across all of its facilities in order to remain profitable, according to Diar.Northern Bitcoin claims it can mine one bitcoin for as little as $2,700 in Norway's Lefdal Mine, against a current market price of around $6,500 and giving it a profit per bitcoin in the region of $4,000.The Lefdal Mine, which last year opened as a data center hosting the likes of computing giant IBM, uses the cold water of the fjord to cheaply cool computers and the hydroelectric and wind power generated in the region to provide cheap, renewable, electricity.The mine, which was previously used to harvest the mineral olivine, had been closed for almost 10 years before being transformed to a sprawling underground data center, that includes a self-sustaining water cycle.Northern Bitcoin has found the Norway average cost for bitcoin mining is $7,700 per coin. It claims China has the lowest average of $3,100, along with Saudi Arabia. In Canada, the average cost of bitcoin mining is almost $4,000. At the other end of the scale, bitcoin mining can cost almost $10,000 per bitcoin in Australia.Racks of computers are brought into the mine on trucks.Northern Bitcoin, which in October ditched bitcoin mining for bitcoin cash in order to have a say in the up-coming bitcoin cash fork (but plans to revert to bitcoin mining after that), hopes to eventually be mining 100 bitcoins per day—up from what the company described as ""several bitcoins per day"" before the bitcoin cash switch.Meanwhile, bitcoin mining continues to attract attention for its huge energy consumption. The amount of energy required to mine one dollar worth of bitcoin is more than twice that required to mine the same value of copper, gold or platinum, according to a paper published in the science journal Nature this week.One dollar’s worth of bitcoin takes about 17 megajoules of energy to mine, according to researchers from the Oak Ridge Institute in Cincinnati, Ohio, compared with four, five and seven megajoules for copper, gold, and platinum.Last year it was estimated the power consumption of the bitcoin network was equivalent to that of the whole of Ireland, while another suggested it was producing the same annual carbon emissions as one million transatlantic flights.The Lefdal mine has a depth of 350 meters and hosts the likes of computing giant IBM.""Energy consumption is really a critical part of the system, and the bitcoin network is a balanced economic system,"" said Moritz Jäger, Northern Bitcoin's chief technology officer. ""The energy consumption and the investment it requires is an important part of the system.""The price of bitcoin and the energy required to mine it create stability in the bitcoin network, according to Jäger.Northern Bitcoin is in the process of turning on its own mining pool, which is expected to happen this month. The company has been recruiting other miners to join the pool, and will soon open it up for others to join. Northern Bitcoin plans to take a 2% cut from the pool.Northern Bitcoin’s revenue breakdown is then expected to be 60% from its own computing power, with the remaining 40% coming from the mining pool."

Gox who are about to unload a massive chunk of bitcoin and bitcoin cash to creditors. This 160,000 chunk of coins is going to thump the market and bring it to its knees.Crypto has coined and co-opted a whole new lexicon, one worthy of the Millennial generation that is adopting crypto as an alternative to old-fashioned ‘fiat.’‘Fiat,’ for one, is a new word for most. It’s a sneering point of view that looks at government money and says it is garbage. It isn’t of course, and you cannot buy a Lambo with bitcoin but you can with dollars.Then there is FOMO, ‘fear of missing out.’ The bitcoin bubble was driven by copious ‘FOMO.’ Bitcoin, ether, litecoin made a lot of people a lot of money fast and millions wanted a piece of that and piled in driving the bubble. The market went vertical and the old hands and cautious sold. A few said, like myself, bitcoin futures, bye. Others saw the vertical chart and went, cash me out dealer.It was the right thing to do and will always be unless you are the guy that sold at $7, $300, $2,000 a bitcoin.Hodl is what you need to do, if you can’t spell 'hold'; you still need to buy and hold, even as your exotic crypto coins turn to ashes in your hands. It will all come good, just come back in a few years, like an investor in Enron.Then there is moon. Mooning is not showing your buttocks, it is the act of a crypto currency going from nothing to a huge sum. Buy 10,000 ether for a few thousand dollars and come back in a year or two a multimillionaire. We all pray for the moon and many have landed on it by happy fortune by being taken up by the potential of cryptocurrency.I was in a cab in 2013 and the driver said he had bought bitcoin in 2010 and realized the week before it was now worth something, approximately $100,000 he said, he undoubtably found his private keys and sold at $1,000 like any sane individual. He was probably a very sad cab driver this Christmas and a little less sad now.Mooning happens: Bitcoin went from $1 to $20ll.000, Apple from a few adjusted cents a share to a trillion dollars market cap, Ether went from next to nothing to $1,200 a coin. The percentages just don’t make financial logic and if you get FOMO, you plow your ‘fiat’ into any old crypto coin, likely the one closest to hand, and end up Hodling the ashes of your rash investment forever.But this is just FUD.FUD: Fear, uncertainty and doubt. An old 1980s marketing technique to throw competitors off the scent and customers off buying competitors’ products. FUD is the reason prices fall, while FOMO is why they go up. The greenhorn Millennials praying for their Lambos say, “Don’t listen to the FUD, Hodl, it is going to moon.”It might, it really might, but all the acronyms in the world won’t make it so.So FUD says Mt. Gox’s billion dollars of bitcoin will crash the price.I hope so, I really do, because I’m still waiting for some cheap bitcoins; $2,500 a coin is cheap enough for me.I’m still waiting, because $1 billion of bitcoin will evaporate in a week or two of selling. $2 or $3 billion of bitcoin gets transacted a day, though you might imagine a lot is just froth, washing back and forth across exchanges. However, the flows of bitcoin are not complete fantasy, you can see it in the blockchain; a lot of money is flowing around the globe, dubious exchange volumes or otherwise.Already 82% of all bitcoins are mined and around May 2020 new supply will halve.You can love or hate that, but bitcoin is solid deflationary money. We shouldn’t hold the ‘digital gold’ moniker against it. Bitcoin is a global currency, with increasing acceptance, a huge brand up there with Trump and the NFL, a global audience and a record of appreciation.The downsides are clear: lack of practical security, inflammatory advocates who can’t keep their big mouths shut and just take care of business, and the army of criminals trying all avenues to steal bitcoin from anywhere they can. Bitcoin needs banking like wild west banks need vaults but no one has come forward with a solution because the old folks fear what bitcoin could be, a financial virus that could wipe out a financial center faster than a Brexit.Five percent of bitcoin’s volume a day should evaporate the Mt. Gox overhang in days and there will be a lot of people with their buying hat on to catch as much bitcoin as they can afford. Bitcoin cash should get absorbed even faster. Then again, what if the Mt. Gox victims Hodl their reinstated coins? What will the overhang be then?But you never know, in the wild west it doesn’t take much to create a stampede. I for one welcome one because if the herd wants to jump off a cliff, I’m going to start a hamburger joint at the bottom of it.Bitcoin has held up very well these last weeks, but I still can’t imagine we haven’t had the final capitulation. I’d like one, it would suit me.I always buy a crash, but only when they say it is all over for everyone forever and I’m sure that will be a headline if bitcoin suddenly crumples.Stay informed and ahead of the crowd with Forbes Crypto Confidential, a free weekly e-letter delivered to your inbox.

Back then, those in the know - initially just Hal Finney, a computer scientist, and Nakamoto, who some believe is the same person - were experiencing a new form of currency aiming to give people back the power to control their money, following the 2008 global financial crisis.Interestingly, in the Genesis Block, the first block on the network, Nakamoto made clear his dislike for the financial sector by embedding this comment: ""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"".Since then, the industry has grown, with more than 2,000 cryptocurrencies on the market, 1,700 of which have a market cap. Yet, even though new altcoins have been introduced none have been able to trump bitcoin.However, as it continues to attract interest while steadily gaining mainstream adoption, the industry is beginning to take a closer look at its future, one of which has issues that need to be tackled, namely, scalability, regulatory uncertainty and security concerns.According to Vlad Dramaliev, head of digital marketing of æternity, an open-source blockchain platform, bitcoin has become one of the ""most exciting technological experiments of our time"".It established the foundations of an entire industry that is currently engaged in extensive R&D in the fields of cryptography, data security, privacy, and self-sovereignty, Dramaliev added. Perhaps most importantly, bitcoin has presented an alternative system of global governance, based on tangible economic incentives and decentralization.And as a result of its continued dominance, today Fortune 500 corporations, financial establishments and governments are being forced to understand bitcoin and the technology behind it, the blockchain. The technology itself has kick-started a multibillion-dollar industry, delivering a novel way of processing millions of transactions with transparency and efficiency without the need for an intermediary.The last 10 years haven't just shown bitcoin as a ""unique financial phenomenon,"" said Angel Versetti, CEO and co-founder of Ambrosus, a blockchain-based IoT system that aims to improve the tracking of products through the supply chain, it has also shown the resilience of the blockchain.""[This has spurred] countless transformative innovations using distributed ledgers, ranging far beyond the financial sector, with use cases such as identity management, data ownership, decentralized autonomous organizations and the digital commons - all underpinned by the same promise of resilient technology where trust is established by all the participants jointly updating the ledger, but with no particular party being able to take control,"" Versetti added.Though bitcoin has had its ups and downs over the past 10 years, today it seems to have almost reached a level of maturity that is less volatile. Unlike mid-December 2017, when bitcoin was valued within touching distance of $20,000, it's currently valued at $6,340, according to CoinMarketCap. Yet, much of the rise in crypto prices in 2017 was linked with speculative investment and possibly the fear of missing out (FOMO).While the market is nowhere near what it was - in terms of price - last year, bitcoin's value has remained within the $6,200 and $6,800 range for several months. For some, this suggests that market speculation is on the decline, creating a less volatile market. According to data from Diar, a blockchain research unit, bitcoin's volatility is at an all-time low of around 1.5%. This is compared to nine percent at the start of 2018.This, in turn, has seen the creation of stablecoins, which are pegged to a stable asset such as gold or the U.S. dollar. Tether is more widely known; however, that has come under increasing scrutiny. Others entering the field include Digix, which is backed by gold, the Gemini Dollar and the Paxos Standard, both of which are backed by the U.S. dollar, as is the USD Coin from Goldman Sachs-backed startup Circle.In the opinion of Brent Jaciow, head of blockchain affairs at Utopia Music, a blockchain-powered music data tracking platform, ""a front-runner in the stablecoin sector will emerge and likely be used as a substitute given the reduced volatility relative to the current most liquid cryptocurrencies"".Of course, while bitcoin's price is down now, one thing that may drive it up is a decision by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the new year on a bitcoin ETF.[This] would arguably be transformative for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, since it would boost overall investor interest and provide stability to the crypto market, said Gabriele Giancola, co-founder and CEO of Qiibee, the Swiss loyalty token protocol which helps brands run their loyalty programs on the blockchain. If the ETF was to be approved, institutional investors are likely to cash in on the new product, given that it is relatively safer than directly investing in bitcoin.Ten years ago, interest from institutional investors wouldn't have been something to consider. Now, however, the tables are shifting. Institutional heavyweights such as Fidelity Investments, Nasdaq and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which owns and operates the New York Stock Exchange, among others, are just a few of the big names already getting into crypto.According to Versetti, rising interest from institutional investors and a lot of early bitcoin adopters able to build on their fortunes means that there's a chance this could push bitcoin to become a must-have asset for any sort of financial portfolio. The worst thing he thinks could happen is for a centralized cryptocurrency, such as XRP, to become the new standard.""I hope the latter does not happen though, as hopefully people will become more educated about what blockchain is and how it should work, and people will be making the choice for freedom from censorship and control,"" he added.With the first 10 years under bitcoin's belt, what can we expect in the next decade? With the space evolving at a rapid pace, it's difficult to predict what will happen one or two years from now. The sector is, though, expecting more decentralization, better technology, solutions to scalability, and just as important, increased financial power to the people."

(Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images)Bitcoin currently has a market cap of $117 billion, down from $127 billion at the beginning of the month. Meanwhile, other major cryptocurrencies have made significant gains as a wave of positive announcements rejuvenated trader and investor sentiment.Despite the bitcoin price ticking up by almost 5% over the last 24 hours to some $6,700, it has not been enough to erase bitcoin's loses for September — which saw bitcoin climb to over $7,250.The latest bitcoin price bump was sparked by a Bloomberg report suggesting a significant ""positive price movement"" is on the horizon — based on analysis of RIG trend lines, a leading technical indicator that is a combination of the RSI and momentum studies.However, much of the excitement over the summer that institutional money was about to be poured into bitcoin and cryptocurrencies has ebbed in September.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission further delayed its approval decision on a closely watching bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposal earlier this month and U.S. investment banking giant Goldman Sachs appeared to somewhat back off from plans to offer bitcoin products to its clients.Many are still hopeful the SEC will eventually approve a bitcoin ETF and are also looking forward to the launch of a bitcoin and cryptocurrency platform called Bakkt, in November — created by New York Stock Exchange owner ICE in partnership with coffee chain Starbucks, software giant Microsoft, and Boston Consulting Group.Bitcoin's dominance has tumbled through September.Elsewhere, the ripple (XRP) price surged as details of a new product launch that will see XRP used directly by some banks sending money across borders led to a more than 100% uptick to ripple's price.Ripple's percentage of cryptocurrency market share leapt from 5% to 10% in September.Earlier this week ripple briefly overtook ethereum as the world's second largest cryptocurrency by total market capitalization for the second time this month before falling back. Both ripple and ethereum are battling it out for the second spot, each with a market cap of around $22 billion.Both ripple and ethereum have fallen back sharply from their peaks at the turn of the year, though ripple's recent surge has meant it has made up ground on ethereum. Ethereum's percentage of cryptocurrency market capitalisation has been falling consistently throughout 2018 after peaking at 21% — and is now around 10%.Bitcoin cash was boosted from Bitmain's delayed initial public offering (IPO) proposal, finally filed in Hong Kong this week, and litecoin rose in value after it was yesterday announced SFOX, a cryptocurrency prime dealer for high-volume traders and institutional investors, it added litecoin trading support.Bitcoin cash's percentage of cryptocurrency market capitalisation climbed from 3% to 4% this week. Bitcoin has been outperformed by other major cryptocurrencies in recent weeks.This fall in bitcoin's total share of the cryptocurrency market cap could be short lived, however. There has over recent months been multiple reports of influential investors calling a bottom to the bitcoin price — predicting we're about to see a return to the price peaks at the end of last year which saw bitcoin reach highs of almost $20,000 per coin."

And like the other symptoms, if it is dealt with by the establishment, it will cease to be a problem.Bitcoin, blockchain, and cryptocurrencies have already changed the world. (Photo by Beata... [+] Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images)""Lack of political leadership in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis globally has created a tide of populism which has led to economic nationalism and trade wars,"" writes Rebecca Harding, chief executive of tech company Coriolis Technologies, in a report, The Global Financial Crisis and its Unforeseen Consequences, out today.Bitcoin, according to Harding, is a financial form of populism — analogous to the election of Trump, the rise of Europe's far right, and the return of socialism to the mainstream political narrative. Bitcoin is the natural response to a broken system. Fix that system and the need for bitcoin, public blockchains, and other cryptocurrencies evaporates.Banks are in the midst of mobilizing their response to the emergence of bitcoin and blockchain. Some of that response has been an embrace. Elsewhere, it has had a firmer hand. The cryptocurrency XRP, better known as ripple, is one such way banks are embracing cryptocurrencies — looking to use digital tokens on a blockchain to move money across borders faster, cheaper, and with (slightly) more transparency.""A lot of banks are healthily skeptical about bitcoin and blockchain,"" said Harding. ""They see the need to invest in it to keep up with technological developments, but they're waiting to see where regulators fall and are working closely with financial technology (fintech) companies to make sure they're not behind the curve.""""There is a lot of money being poured into [blockchain and cryptocurrenices],"" Harding added. ""Banks are at risk of becoming nothing more than large fintech companies, people in the industry tell me.""Meanwhile, the world's biggest tech companies are also taking an interest in the financial system that appears to have somewhat gotten away from those that have traditionally managed it.The likes of search giant Google, online retailer Amazon, social network Facebook in the U.S. and internet Alibaba in China are the tech companies that have shown the most credible interest in somehow disrupting the bank's fragile hold on the financial system.But even here, the new technological masters of the universe are hesitant to enter a market that is so closely regulated and fraught with potential hazards — hazards which could lead to a meltdown similar to 2008.According to Coriolis, ""trade is now used coercively to achieve national or domestic objectives predicated on a notion in the UK and the US in particular, that trade has become 'unfair'. Trade is now at the epicenter of the financial crisis’s aftershocks.""The report warns that: ""Unless banks and businesses speak out about the threats posed by increased bilateralism and economic nationalism, the dangers of miscalculation in international trade relations will increase.""According to the Coriolis report: Banks are challenged by this politicization of trade and at the other existential challenges like the emergence of new technologies, the rise of regulation [Know Your Customer and anti money laundering compliance], and increased competition from non-banks that they face. Technology, in particular, big data and predictive analytics, give banks the potential for managing these risks and increasing their relevance. They will need to harness these technologies in order to manage both micro (credit, reputational and counterparty) and macro (economic and geopolitical) risks.Much of this suggests bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain could be swallowed by the evolving financial system that spawned them. But for Harding, it's not quite so simple.""Bitcoin is here to stay. It's important. But as traditional banks increasingly adopt the features of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies they can, it will become less appealing to fewer people,"" said Harding."

(Photo by... [+] Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images)Bitcoin has dominated investor interest over the last ten years, but that could be very different in the coming decade.It's only in the last five or so years that bitcoin has had any major competitors. Ethereum, the world's second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was first conceived in 2013.Since then, hundreds of cryptocurrencies have exploded onto the scene, many of which were born and died in the cryptocurrency gold rush of 2017.Bitcoin has maintained its so-called dominance over the sector, however. Bitcoin dominance — its share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization — hit year-to-date highs in mid-September. Though it has fallen somewhat from those highs, it has remained above 50%.Bitcoin dominance barely dipped below 80% until March last year, according to CoinMarketCap data. But it has lost ground to the likes of ethereum, ripple (XRP), bitcoin cash, litecoin, and dash since then.The bitcoin price has grown massively over the last 10 years.""I believe that bitcoin’s influence and dominance of the cryptocurrency sector will drastically reduce in its second decade,"" said Nigel Green, founder and CEO of deVere Group, a financial advisory group.""This is because as mass adoption of cryptocurrency grows, more and more digital assets will be launched – by organizations in both the private and the public sectors. This will increase competition for bitcoin and dent its market share.""Green expects the bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency market will expand by “at least” 5,000% in the next 10 years — meaning it could be worth $20 trillion, up from $400 billion today.Elsewhere, Jim Blasko, the founder of Bitcoin Talk Radio, has said the bitcoin price could climb above $100,000 toward the end of 2020 or the first quarter of 2021 — a wildly ambitious prediction he bases on how mining rewards are calculated on the bitcoin network.Bitcoin dominance has fallen in the last year but remains above 50%.Fundstrat Global Investors analyst Tom Lee, well known for his bullish stance on cryptocurrencies, has said bitcoin could end 2018 at $22,000, pointing to the 200-day moving average price trend.""When bitcoin’s below its 200-day, it only goes up 50% of the time in the next sixth months, but when it’s above its 200-day, it’s up 80% of the time,"" Lee said.Meanwhile, many bitcoin and cryptocurrency bulls are banking on a slew of institutional products on the horizon pushing prices higher.A much-anticipated bitcoin exchange-traded fund, proposed by bitcoin companies VanEck and SolidX, is still being weighed by the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission.Bakkt, a platform for trading, storing, and spending digital assets, was established earlier this year by the owner of the New York Stock Exchange,  Intercontinental Exchange, and is expected to begin offering bitcoin futures in December.“A growing number of major institutional and retail investors, as well as financial institutions and regulators, amongst others, understand that cryptocurrencies are the future of money,"" Green added. “As such, the market will have grown beyond recognition when Bitcoin celebrates its 20th anniversary.”"

[+] Russia, Moscow","The price of bitcoin has been holding remarkably steady lately. For more than two months, the digital currency has been stuck around the $6500 mark.That may come as a surprise to those who follow cryptocurrency markets closely for a couple of reasons. One of them is volatility. The bitcoin price has been all over the map last year. It raced from around $6000 at the end of September to close to $20,000 by mid-December, before heading back to $6,000.Bitcoin USD PriceThen there’s timing. Bitcoin’s stability comes at a time of rising U.S. interest rates that have strengthened the dollar against several currencies.To technical analysts, price stability is usually followed by major moves. Will bitcoin have another wild ride by Christmas?To find that out Greg Giordano, my co-author in a research paper on Bitcoins “intrinsic” value, performed a simulation to three econometric models, the Hayes’s model and the Wheatley models, and the Market Model (our own).The results of this exercise are summarized in table 1.Table 1Bitcoin Price By Christmas: A Bullish, A Bearish, And A Moderate Forecast[Ed. note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment. Disclosure: I don't own any bitcoin. Greg Giordano owns bitcoin.]On the one side, the Hayes’ model predicts a price of $12,629.15, almost double the current price.As expected, that’s a bullish forecast. Hayes’ model focuses on the supply side of the bitcoin market, which is expected to grow at an ever-slower pace, as it gets closer to the limit.On the other side, the Wheatley model predicts a price of $816.91, a fraction of the current price.As expected, that’s too bearish a forecast. The model focuses on the demand side of the bitcoin market, measured by adoption rates, which has been growing slowly. That’s according to a recent Gallup survey.Somewhere in the middle is the market model—a combination of the previous two models -- which predicts a price of $8,573,56, not that far from the current price.Where does the Bitcoin and investment analyst community expect bitcoin price to be by Christmas?Raghav Reggie Jerath, CEO of Gath3r Web Miner, expects bitcoin prices to be in line with the predictions of the market model. “Historically, bitcoin has always had positive price movements during the months of November and early December, so it is possible to see price settle around 7500 -  8500 range for the remainder for the year,” says Jerath.Patrick E. Palacios, CEO of LoyalCoin, sees a moderate increase of the price of Bitcoin in the range of $7,000-7500.  “I do believe we will see a rise in bitcoin in the next few weeks and bitcoin will increase slightly to around 7k and 7.5K,” says Palacios.Bitcoin trader Abraham Merkin thinks that $6,000 is a “hard floor” for bitcoin. Meanwhile, he doesn’t see any major price movement by Christmas “The volatility we saw last year through the first quarter of 2018 is a thing of the past,” he says. “Bitcoin will not hit $8,000 in 2018; and it might not reach $7,300 before Christmas given the current calm.”Clement Thibault, senior analyst at global financial platform Investing.com, sees bitcoin staying close to $6,000. ""For now, it seems like the selling pressure keeps on pushing the price down,” says Thibault. “As for a bottom, Bitcoin has maintained a hard floor at $6K for most of the year, which I would be surprised to see broken."""

Four Signs Prices Could Continue To Climb,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2018/09/24/four-reasons-bitcoin-could-pass-40000-by-the-end-of-2019/,"Bitcoin ETFs will expand the pool of cryptocurrency investors. In June 
2018, as previously mentioned, the Chicago Board Options Exchange ( ...","Sep 24, 2018,08:30am EDT",Getty,"The bitcoin price recently climbed over the $8,000 mark for the first time since May 2018, according to CoinMarketCap. Many investors are now wondering if the tide has officially turned and the bull market is here to stay. Billionaire investor Marc Lasry told CNBC that the price of bitcoin could reach up to $40,000 as it becomes more accepted and easier to trade.I believe that as regulatory uncertainty in the space continues to be resolved, mainstream adoption continues to increase, and the CBOE application for a bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is passed — which it very likely soon will be, in my opinion — that the price may well surpass $40,000 by the end of 2019 and could continue to climb as we enter 2020.Make no mistake about it: as the co-founder of a bitcoin IRA company who has held bitcoin investments previously, I've noticed that 2018 has marked a year of major growing pains for the crypto sector. But with growing pains also comes great growth. As Lasry has purportedly said, I believe we will see bitcoin prices continue to climb. Let’s look at four reasons why.1. Bitcoin ETFs will expand the pool of cryptocurrency investors.In June 2018, as previously mentioned, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) was reported by NASDAQ to have filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to open the world’s first bitcoin ETF. If the application is accepted, then I believe bitcoin will become far more accessible to a wider range of investors who wish to invest in a crypto fund rather than directly into crypto itself.I am optimistic that the application will be accepted. SEC Director of Corporate Finance William Hinman already stated earlier this year that bitcoin and ether did not necessarily qualify as securities and, therefore, I believe it's likely they won't be subjected to the same stringent regulations as other securities. Furthermore, the SEC also recently proposed easing its rules for low-risk ETFs, ultimately enabling an ETF to enter the market through a quicker and easier process.Launching a bitcoin ETF (which seems to have been received with overwhelmingly positive feedback) would, to me, be a crucial advancement in the cryptocurrency sector, as it will make digital currencies more accessible to a wide range of people who might currently deem them too volatile or high-risk. As it stands now, investors holding bitcoin need a wallet to trade and store their digital currency. In a recent article, I explained the many nuances to look out for when choosing a cryptocurrency wallet. For a newcomer entering the space, this can be daunting. ETFs will likely appeal to a wider group of investors in that they are traded frequently and, in my experience, highly accessible via investors’ brokerage accounts. Furthermore, many potential investors also have concerns surrounding insurance plans and crypto custodianship or lack thereof.However, CBOE’s application addresses many of these concerns. For example, the proposal states that the funds will be stored in a cold storage solution, meaning they would be kept offline and therefore inaccessible to potential hackers.Additionally, an SEC report states that the CBOE's proposal includes an insurance policy for instances when theft or cyber attacks occur, which I believe will give customers peace of mind that their funds will be covered in the event that any wrongdoing takes place — a common concern about cryptocurrencies which may have kept many potential investors away. With these provisions in place, I believe prices will only continue to climb and cryptocurrency will become an even larger component of daily conversation.2. Mastercard’s new patent represents a trend in consumer thinking.According to CNBC, Mastercard got a new patent in July 2018 for a strategy it says will improve the speed of cryptocurrency-related transactions. Many sources put the current processing time for a blockchain-based transaction at around 10 minutes; however, the new Mastercard strategy could speed up this process with accounts that can make cryptocurrency transactions directly. Mastercard plans to reduce these transaction times by offering a new type of user account that transacts in cryptocurrencies. If the patented offering is brought to market, it could eliminate the middleman by allowing customers to instantly pay for items on their credit card using digital currency.Current trends suggest that there is consumer interest in blockchain technology, and I believe patents like Mastercard's are an important response to meet that shift in consumers’ priorities. The patent, along with organizations working to offer faster blockchain-based transactions, reveal the ongoing commitment in the crypto community to make bitcoin transactions faster, more scalable and more streamlined than ever before.This is crucial, because I suspect that many people, while fascinated by the concept of Bitcoin, remain unconvinced of the currency's practicality. Should these efforts go to market, I predict cryptocurrency will become a much more ingrained part of our daily lives, as it will be a viable option at many of the places where we conduct our day-to-day transactions.As bitcoin further cultivates a reputation as a trusted form of currency and subsequently gains greater visibility, I predict that bitcoin and other crypto prices will continue to rise in response.3. There has been a massive increase in institutional adoption. Just as 2018 has been a year of increased discussion of regulations in the crypto space, it has also been a year of increased institutional adoption. Thus far, I believe it has been a remarkable year in which the world of Wall Street and the world of crypto have already begun to intertwine. In May 2018, for example, The New York Times reported (paywall) that Goldman Sachs planned to launch a bitcoin trading operation.The environment does seem to me to be heading in a pro-crypto direction. With time, I predict we will only continue to see increased institutional adoption in the crypto space, and prices will continue to climb. Additionally, I believe that as more financial institutions build out crypto products and with the likely passage of bitcoin ETFs, more investors at both the individual and institutional level will get involved with bitcoin, which will reflect positively in the price.4. Momentum is building.Bitcoin’s price has rallied in July. But momentum appears to be building on the blockchain side as well. Data reveals that the number of transactions per day surpassed at least 230,000 on-chain transactions per day, the highest since the beginning of the year. I believe that this trend of more on-chain transactions is indicative of increased demand in the crypto space as a whole, which will only continue to increase as decentralized technology evolves and digital currencies grow increasingly accessible -- and useful — to a group of people that once deemed them radical.The information provided here is not investment, tax, or financial advice.

While 2018 has seen the value of bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market sharply decline, prices remain far above where they were before last year's bull run. ""Bitcoin was an extremely clever idea. Sadly, not every clever idea is a good idea,"" the European Central Bank Executive Board member said at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel.  ""Few remember that Satoshi embedded the genesis block with a Times headline from January 2009 about U.K. banks’ bailout. In more ways than one, bitcoin is the evil spawn of the financial crisis.""Bitcoin was created by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto 10 years ago towards the end of 2008, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the beginning of the global financial crisis.Coeure was speaking after International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde urged central banks to look into issuing digital currencies of their own earlier this week. The bitcoin price has soared over the last 24 months, though has slipped from its highs at the end...

(Photo credit: S3studio/Getty Images)""The White House in particular seems to be thinking about what it means to have 80% of bitcoin mining taking place in China and a majority of ether mining taking place in China,"" Ripple Lab's chief strategist, Cory Johnson, said in a wide-ranging interview with crypto-focused magazine Breaker.  ""When you look at XRP, there is no mining, so from a foreign-control aspect or from an environmental aspect, XRP is a very different beast. And in conversations we’ve had with the administration, they seem to get that and think that might matter.""China manufactures most of the world’s bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining equipment and its massive mining farms are supported by the country's cheap electricity prices.Meanwhile, Ripple Labs controls 60% of the ripple supply, leading to critics of the company and the digital token suggesting it is not decentralized like many other cryptocurrencies.September was a good month for Ripple Labs and the digital token it created XRP (which is often referred to as ripple).Ripple's Swell event in San Francisco saw former U.S. president Bill Clinton talk up the possibilities of blockchain and cryptocurrencies and Ripple revealed it had signed up three financial services companies to its new XRP-focused product -- news of which had sent the ripple price up by over 100% earlier in the month.The three companies – payment providers MercuryFX and Cuallix as well as cooperative financial firm Catalyst Corporate Credit Union – were announced as the first to sign up to xRapid by Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse.Earlier this year, global banking giant Santander launched a blockchain-based application for cross-border foreign exchange built by Ripple Labs — designed to speed up and cut the costs of sending money across borders. Many are excited by ripple's practical use case, which has seen it work with many of the world's biggest banks and financial service companies to bring cryptocurrency's speed and efficiency to the rather clunky legacy financial systems.""When I started to meet with people in government and regulators, I had very low expectations,"" Johnson added.

ether and other digital assets. In particular, the service is being ...","Oct 15, 2018,12:30pm EDT",Fidelity Investments Reportedly Plans Layoffs,"Fidelity Investments is spinning off a stand-alone company dedicated to bringing cryptocurrencies to institutional investors.Called Fidelity Digital Assets, the limited liability corporation based in Boston will provide enterprise-grade custody solutions, a cryptocurrency trading execution platform and institutional advising services 24 hours a day, seven days a week, designed to align with blockchain's always-on trading cycle. Fidelity Investments provides financial services for $7.2 trillion in customer assets and provides clearing, custody and investment services for 13,000 institutional advisory firms and brokers. But the fifth-largest asset manager in the world has largely limited its cryptocurrency exposure to a few peripheral services and through donations via their non-profit Fidelity Charitable.With Fidelity Digital Asset's first customers being onboarded now, and general availability scheduled for early 2019, the launch of the subsidiary with 100 employees marks the latest and perhaps the largest push into cryptocurrency by an institutional asset manager.“This is a recognition that there is institutional demand for these assets as a class,” says Tom Jessop, founding head of Fidelity Digital Assets. “Family offices, hedge funds, other sophisticated investors, are starting to think seriously about this space.”Announced at an event in Bloomberg’s New York City headquarters, Fidelity Digital Assets will offer three main services. The most elaborate of these appears to be custody services for bitcoin, ether and other digital assets. In particular, the service is being designed give institutional investors a compliant way to secure their assets by holding them in a physical vault.The vaults “distributed over multiple geographically dispersed locations.” are so-called “cold storage” facilities, according to Jessop, meaning they not only consist of software-based security protections but are physically separated from the internet, making them more difficult to hack.Other Fidelity Digital Assets services will include trade execution services that leverage an internal crossing engine and smart order router that will execute trades using multiple third-party cryptocurrency liquidity suppliers. Importantly, these trading services do not amount to an exchange; rather, they are the piping that directly connects Fidelity customers to existing exchanges. To make it easier for institutions that are new to cryptocurrency to get involved, Fidelity Digital Assets will also offer a dedicated client services team to help with the onboarding process.Collectively, Fidelity Investments chairman and CEO Abigail Johnson said the digital assets spinoff is part of a larger plan to make it easier for investors of all types to “understand and use” a wide range of assets issued on a blockchain: “Our goal is to make digitally native assets, such as bitcoin, more accessible to investors.”Leading the crypto spinoff is Tom Jessop, formerly the head of corporate business development at Fidelity. While Jessop is certainly no newbie to the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain, he only recently returned to Fidelity with the express purpose of advancing its digital asset offerings. Jessop joined the asset management giant in January 2018 after a brief stint at enterprise blockchain startup Chain, which was recently acquired by the for-profit subsidiary of the Stellar Development Foundation that helps oversee development of the stellar cryptocurrency.Jessop was brought on as president of Chain in April 2017 after 17 years at Goldman Sachs to leverage his deep Rolodex of contacts to help bridge the gap between enterprise financial institutions and non-cryptocurrency applications of distributed ledger technology.As president of Fidelity Digital Assets, Jessop's will provide a similar bridge between institutions and blockchain applications. In this case however, his focus will be on cryptocurrency, and in the future a wide range of other assets issued on a blockchain. “Our clients are thinking about this as an investable asset class,” says Jessop. “They’re doing their research, they’re developing a thesis around why these tokens may have value in the future, and that’s really driving a lot of interest.” Fidelity’s experiments with blockchain technology began in 2013, with the discreet launch of its Blockchain Incubator, a part of the Fidelity Center for Applied Technology, according to a statement. In 2015 Fidelity Charitable started accepting bitcoin donations, and by February of this year, cryptocurrency was the nonprofit organization's fastest growing kind of donation, bringing in more than $69 million.Last year Fidelity started letting its clients view their cryptocurrency balances via an integration with exchange and custody firm Coinbase, though at the time they were unable to actually trade via the Fidelity user interface. The integration led to speculation that Fidelity was building its own cryptocurrency exchange.So it was no surprise when in May of this year Fidelity partnered with the MIT Digital Currency Initiative to host the first Layer 2 Summit, which focused on the research and protocols being built to help address the scalability issues of blockchain assets as they reach an ever-growing market.The timing of the launch is interesting for a number of reasons. First, bitcoin’s price has dropped 68%, to $6,391, since its peak in 2017. Second, the price drop has given new ammunition to skeptics who have long doubted the scalability and use cases of bitcoin.Nevertheless, Jessop says Fidelity views crypto assets as more than just a store of value. They represent an investment in future use cases currently being developed, or perhaps not yet conceived.“Our long-term vision is really that you’ll see lots of assets exist in this new medium,” says Jessop. “And this new medium will bring a host of benefits around efficiency, around access, around automation, which is very exciting for financial services.”"

Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg,"Market analysts have repeatedly asked whether stocks and bitcoin are correlated.Long story short, it depends on one's time frame.In the short-term, there are certainly instances where stocks and the digital currency have moved in tandem.During 2017, for example, both stocks and digital currencies experienced notable gains. Then, earlier this year, when both asset classes started plummeting, it once again appeared the two were following each other closely.[Ed. note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]Sentiment's Key RoleSentiment can play a crucial role in situations where both more traditional assets (stocks) and more novel assets (cryptocurrencies) display significant correlations.These instances are frequently driven by events that motivate investors to move in aggregate, flocking to one type of asset (for example, assets perceived as strong safe havens).""Investors enter markets when they are optimistic, traditional or digital,"" emphasized Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency fund of hedge funds BitBull Capital.""They tend to exit when sentiment is negative,"" he added.Taking A Deeper LookWhile short-term analyses of stocks and cryptocurrencies may illustrate notable correlations, the story changes when observed through a broader lens.In the long-term, the correlation between the two is rather weak, according to Bloomberg data compiled by U.S.-based asset manager Blockforce Capital.The Blockforce analysis, which looked at bitcoin and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500) from January 2015 through Oct. 11, 2018, found that the correlation during this period was not substantial.S&P and bitcoin Jan 2015-Oct 2018.""Historically, the correlation between the S&P 500 and Bitcoin has been insignificant. Although correlation values between the two asset classes has ticked up this year versus historical averages, with the current correlation hovering around .11, we believe this to be an insignificant value and don’t believe the two markets to be related,"" said Blockforce CEO Eric Ervin.""While most people talk about how Bitcoin is not correlated to the S&P 500, it's important to recognize that not being correlated is not the same as being negatively correlated,"" stated Ervin.A Shifting Mindset?Going forward, the situation could change, noted analyst Tim Enneking, as more ""traditional"" investors, as in those more experienced with assets like stocks and bonds, enter the space.As more of these market participants get involved with digital currencies, it could result in the correlation between stocks and digital currencies pushing higher.One of cryptocurrency's ""historical advantages has always been the absence of correlation to fiat investment classes,"" noted Enneking, managing director of Digital Capital Management. ""If correlation were to increase on a sustained basis, it would make crypto a far less attractive investment,"" he said. Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ether."

Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]Bitcoin is about to move and move definitively. Guessing the direction is another challenge but timing is more important than direction.That might not sound intuitive, but if you know something is going to reprice imminently, then when it begins to do that, you can jump on the direction, knowing the direction of travel will be significant. Make or break times in markets do arrive and bitcoin is at such juncture.Here is the chart:The direction of travel in the Bitcoin/U.S. dollar chartNo chart would be complete without some pseudo-science, so what you see above is the end of a reprice series where the market has struggled to agree on a price for bitcoin. This has resulted in a series of rallies and dips that have developed into a tightening range. Once the range has shrunk to nearly nothing the price of the asset enters a new phase of discovery.In other words, once the price is agreed the market is then ready to go off on another valuation ‘wild goose chase.’ A new chapter begins.With the current setup the chart is telling us we are about to leave the aftermath of the bitcoin crash and enter such a new phase.The shape of the bitcoin chart is not a novelty. The history of boom and bust in markets is full of similar charts.The Nasdaq is a convenient example. This is the dotcom bubble:The dotcom bubble on the NasdaqThe big money is made getting out at the top of a bubble and back in at the bottom. As such, watching for a market bottom is at least half of the game in investing. It is the game most successful investors prefer to play, rather than picking tops. Tops can be very hard to judge and are vaporous, disappearing sometimes in moments. Bottoms like the one we may be experiencing in bitcoin give plenty of time for consideration.But nothing says bitcoin won’t slump from this pivot point. I’d like it to as I’m still waiting for an opportunity for some cheap coins, but I can wait all I like, the market obliges no one.What the market is telling us via the chart is that this post-crash market series is coming to an end pretty soon.You might say, who can say that bitcoin will not simply bob along, but that is the least likely outcome.$6,000 has been a very solid bottom for bitcoin and shows a resilience I believe bitcoin will not lose. The biggest risk for bitcoin is that it goes to $0 not $2,500; the real risk being that it is just the phantom asset the old school believe it is. If you don’t believe this, and I do not, then bitcoin is very cheap.The chart says the next chapter in the bitcoin story is close. I think it’s a final capitulation, but my reasoning is clouded by wanting that outcome.

[+] San Francisco, California. (Photo by Amy Osborne / AFP / Getty Images)The decision to un-ban bitcoin-related ads on the world's biggest search engine comes after a wave of bullish predictions for the bitcoin price last week.The ban was originally adopted as a way for Google to get a handle on the countless high-profile scams bitcoin's sudden surge in value created.The roll back suggests Google believes that regulators around the world (especially in the U.S. and Japan) are making real progress against the crypto criminals.When Google initially banned ads for bitcoin-related services in June it sent the price of bitcoin down by some 10% and bitcoin, as well as most other major cryptocurrencies, are far down from their all-time highs at the beginning of the year.The news has yet to move the bitcoin price, which is down some 3% over the last 24 hours.Bitcoin's price has remained unchanged on the news Google will remove a ban on bitcoin-related ads.Ads for initial coin offerings (ICOs), wallets, and trading advice will remain banned, according to CNBC, with the updated policy applying to advertisers all over the world, though the ads will only run in the U.S. and Japan.""This is a positive step for well-established cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum,” said bitcoin expert and a professor in the University of Pittsburgh’s Swanson School of Engineering, Chris Wilmer.""Bitcoin is a technological breakthrough, with many applications beyond being a new, better form of money. While platforms such as Google and Facebook need to be mindful of false and malicious cryptocurrency ads, simply banning all ads was not the right thing to do,"" Wilmer added.""The longer bitcoin has existed and continued to grow, despite the predictions of many, the more the world is realizing that this is an important technology that is here to stay.""Over recent months many of the world's biggest banks and financial services companies have been gearing up to launch bitcoin products, including the likes of U.S. investment banking giant Goldman Sachs.With the Google bitcoin ad ban at least partially lifted it could open the door for these established financial companies to advertise their bitcoin products on Google's platform.Elsewhere, the New York Stock Exchange owner ICE is planning on launching a bitcoin and cryptocurrency platform called Bakkt in partnership with coffee chain Starbucks, software giant Microsoft, and Boston Consulting Group in November — something it will no doubt be keen to advertise as widely as possible.This reversal also shouldn't come as a complete surprise. At the time of the original ban, Google didn't rule out undoing it, but said it wanted to proceed with ""extreme caution.""""We don't have a crystal ball to know where the future is going to go with cryptocurrencies, but we've seen enough consumer harm or potential for consumer harm that it's an area that we want to approach with extreme caution,"" Google's Scott Spencer told CNBC at the time."

A number of others, including Forerunner Ventures, 3K VC, SV Angel, FJ Labs, Alex Chung, Gokul Rajaram, and Brian Sugar, also contributed to boosting the unique cryptocurrency business.Lolli allows users to accumulate Bitcoin rewards when they shop at partners of the company. The firm already has over 500 partners like Hilton, Marriot, Walmart and Forever 21. The idea is to give the users up to 30 of the money that they spent back in Bitcoin.One of the reasoning for the creation of Lolli, according to Alex Adelman, its creator and CEO, is that Lolli will aid in building a strong use case for Bitcoin and assist in adoption and normalising of digital currencies.Attracting the big namesAs a company, Lolli has had some success already with reports of thousands of clients and they have also apparently processed six figures in sales. However, the interest of the investors from this seed round, and the gravitas of them seems to suggest there is more to it than just a cryptocurrency reward program.Traditional investors are of course looking more and more at cryptocurrency and blockchain projects, but some have even reached a level where they understand that it is not only a get rich quick scheme.Scott Friend, the Managing Director of Bain Capital Ventures, explains how they have identified one issue with Bitcoin, in general, is its lack of distribution.“We have been active investors across both the commerce-tech and cryptocurrency landscapes for many years,” Friend explains. “We have recognised that Bitcoin has a distribution problem. Mainstream adoption is low because the only way you can get Bitcoin is via investing or mining.”“We have also seen little innovation in the work of affiliate marketing for brands and retailers for many many years with last-generation affiliate networks and marketing channels still dominating the brand and retail marketing landscape. This despite a relatively inequitable balance of value between consumers, retailers, and the network... and then in walks Alex Adelman! [Lolli CEO]”Angela Tran Kingyens, a general partner at Version One Ventures, also echoes Friend’s sentiments.“Lolli’s mission of making Bitcoin more accessible to everyone very much aligns with our primary core belief of democratising access to resources in general. We also think that Lolli is intuitive and easy-to-use as people’s first experience with Bitcoin. The idea of 'earning' Bitcoin while shopping is much more frictionless than buying currency for the average person.”It seems that the key ingredient for the investors has to do with the way Lolli is looking to make Bitcoin accessible to those who are still unsure as to how one accumulates it.Lolli button seen on the Macy's front page which allows users to receive 3.5% of their spend back in... [+] BTC“Lolli's mission is to make Bitcoin more accessible to all, by simplifying the way people earn, share, and save Bitcoin. They democratise access to Bitcoin – perfect for people’s first experience with Bitcoin. They have over 500 plus top merchant partnerships already in place. You can earn Bitcoin while shopping for clothes, groceries, hotels, flights, and more. There’s no risk to the consumer, significantly improving the onramp into crypto,” Friend adds.This different take on the acquisition of Bitcoin coming from Lolli, allowing people to be a part of the cryptocurrency realm by doing something that is very normal, shopping. These investors have identified what they believe is slowing the adoption of Bitcoin down, and are looking to address it through projects like Lolli.The state of cryptocurrency investment.While cryptocurrencies do have their own funding mechanism, in ICOs, these have mostly found to be wanting, and this has opened the door for traditional VCs to come in and pick up viable and promising projects.Friend explains that at Bain Capital Ventures, their prerogative is about investing in founders, but it has also led them to the cryptocurrency space.“Bain Capital Ventures focuses broadly on investing in visionary founders who are going after the biggest market opportunities and tackling massive problems. We believe crypto represents a multi-billion-dollar market whitespace and has significant potential to become a robust asset class if the right infrastructure and protocols are put in place. Hence, we’ve made a number of crypto investments aimed at strengthening the underlying asset class as a whole.” Friend said.For Version One, the cryptocurrency investment game is not even that new for them, although they do see the entire space as still very much in its early days.“At Version One, we were early to blockchain crypto with investments in Coinbase, Blockstack, Crypto Kitties, Citizen Hex, Celo, to name a few. We also invested in hedge funds such at Polychain and Metastable when they first launched,” Kingyens said.Separating from the noiseThe downfall of the ICO furore, as well as the cooling off of the Bitcoin market, is also being seen as a benefit to investors such as Friend and Kingyens.The latter explains:“We are in a crypto/blockchain bear market right now but this is ultimately good for us as we’ll see a separation of great companies and projects from the frenzy and noise we saw last year. As we think about where to invest, we stay disciplined around backing the best teams with strong native use cases.”There is a lot of opportunities and potential left in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space though, according to these VCs, with Friend reminding that it is still early days.“We believe it’s early innings and that crypto represents a multi-billion-dollar market whitespace and has significant potential to become a robust asset class if the right infrastructure and protocols are put in place,” Friend concluded."

The U.S. continues to keep bitcoin and cryptocurrencies at arm's length.Elsewhere, some countries have banned bitcoin and cryptocurrency use entirely — though it is still possible to use them to an extent.Billingslea, who is also an assistant U.S. Treasury secretary and deals with terror financing, said the Islamic State group has used bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to fund terrorists in Syria after publishing instructions on the social network Twitter.""This is an example of a very worrisome trend-line that we see,"" Billingslea added. There are currently three bitcoin sellers listed in Syria on the person-to-person bitcoin exchange LocalBitcoins.You are able to buy and sell bitcoins in Syria via the LocalBitcoins exchange.Earlier this year it was revealed that neo-nazi donations via bitcoin were climbing ahead of a far-right demonstration in the U.S. earlier this year. Similar groups have also been known to accept bitcoin and cryptocurrencies donations to help avoid surveillance and existing banking regulations.Meanwhile, a group of British MPs today published a report arguing bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies need regulation to bring them out of the ""wild west.""“Bitcoin and other crypto-assets exist in the wild west industry of crypto-assets. This unregulated industry leaves investors facing numerous risks,” Member of Parliament (MP) Nicky Morgan, the chair of the committee, said.In June it was reported the European Union’s law enforcement agency Europol met with some 16 major cryptocurrency exchanges to assess ways to crack down on the use of digital assets for money laundering.The agency’s director at the time Rob Wainwright had previously warned that around 3% to 4% of £100bn in illicit proceeds in Europe were laundered through cryptocurrencies."

While information regarding each transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it is not directly linked to names, physical addresses, or other identifying information. This makes it anonymous to a certain degree, and complicates efforts by law enforcement agencies to identify individual transactions and link them to users.Terrorists and criminals use bitcoin for illicit transitions, as it provides financial security. The blockchain acts as an impartial intermediary, ensuring that coins are irrevocable once spent. The network hampers any attempt made to recall a verified bitcoin transaction unless the recipient actually sends the coins back to the sender. By doing so, it prevents double spending and ensures that money cannot be duplicated within the network. Moreover, a network of ‘miners’ works to ensure each bitcoin transaction is unique and legitimate. If an attempt at duplication is made, the block-chain rejects the transaction as forged and faulty. Therefore, it benefits both criminals and terrorists purchasing goods and services on the Darknet, who would otherwise be at risk of being scammed by rival criminal organisations on the other side of the network.In August 2015, for example, authorities in the United States convicted Mohamed Elshinawy, from Maryland, for providing material support of a financial nature to Islamic State. According to official records, Elshinawy had received approximately $8,700 through various financial channels including Western Union and PayPal accounts, from individuals with known connections to Islamic State, for the purpose of funding terrorist operations. Elshinawy, who had received the money between March and June 2015 from various overseas companies located in the United Kingdom and Bangladesh, intended to use the funds to launch terrorist attacks in the US. According to the US Department of Justice, Elshinawy and other members of Islamic State had used various means of secret communications to conceal their criminal association and activities from law enforcement.Since 2014, there have been reports of high-ranking jihadist fighters in Raqqa, a former Islamic State stronghold in Syria, making use of money transfer offices for small or domestic purchases, and using advanced modern technology in the form of bitcoin for long-distance international transactions. In January 2015 it was reported that Islamic State, in what was then an unprecedented move, had started raising funds through bitcoin. A fundraiser identified as Abu-Mustafa argued that a massive crackdown by US law enforcement on mainstream financial platforms, coupled with a lack of financial and other resources available to Islamic State supporters in the United States and South America, meant that the Darknet should be used to raise funds in bitcoins. Abu-Mustafa raised about five bitcoins, valued at approximately $1,000 (at the time) before the account was closed.Similarly, in June 2015, authorities in the United States convicted Shukri Amin, a 17-year-old in Virginia, for lending material support to Islamic State. Amin was charged with helping Islamic State supporters travel to Syria by using social media sites to ask donors to pay in bitcoin currency as financial support for the group. In another case, a woman was arrested in New York in December 2017 for fraudulently obtaining $62,000 in bitcoin, which she then allegedly wired to fund Islamic State. After a failed attempt to join the terrorist organisation in January 2016, the woman used false information to acquire loans and multiple credit cards, which she then transferred into bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies before sending the money via Pakistan, China, and Turkey to fund Islamic State. Prosecutors accused the woman of fraud and providing material support to a terrorist organisation.Though it is still unclear how successful both online sites and offline networks have been in raising bitcoin funds to support terrorist organisations, these examples demonstrate an awareness of, and interest from, groups like Islamic State in the merits of bitcoin as a medium through which to finance themselves online."

But it might just be the new Bitcoin.In just four months, the 'payment system of the future' has built a network of nearly three million adopters by offering ever-decreasing sums of their future currency in exchange for an e-mail address.Despite attracting over 100,000 new users each day, the invite-only registration process triggered instant retaliation from skeptics who dubbed the ambitious global currency a pyramid scheme.Of course, Initiative Q is asking for no more than a few pieces of digital information most digital natives share with companies on impulse. And with companies touting far inferior privacy policies.While it is imperative for people to question all financial decisions they're presented with, a company simply cannot exist as a pyramid scheme if there is no information - let alone money - to float up the pyramid.The reality of the enterprise is far less controversial than cynics would have you believe. The jury has been out on the intrinsic value of currencies since the fall of the gold standard. It is the case with dollars, pounds and every currency in between. Similarly opportunistic companies, like Dogecoin, have gone on to create immense value against all odds and it is not impossible for Initiative Q to follow suit.""It is not a get rich quick scheme and I think that's where people get confused,"" said Initiative Q founder Saar Wilf. ""You have to reach critical mass if you want to create a currency and that is what we're trying to do.""Wilf, who successfully built the integrated systems for online transaction verification and fraud prevention that were later acquired by PayPal, believes Q is possible but not inevitable.He explained: ""The world needs a better payment system. We are glued to its existing infrastructure and the only other option is cryptocurrency, which I don't believe answers the real problems.""Crypto - like all currency - has built its value based on trust but is decentralised from government. It circumvents the systems, which I think most people realise can be as bad as it can be good. We want Q to become mainstream and that's why we give it away for free to those willing to promote it.""Saar Wilf, founder of Initiative Q""There is no value in anything until people adopt it, so our strategy was incredibly clear. Building trust was and will always be our biggest challenge, but we will never abuse it. Our plan is to comply with regulations but make everything far more efficient than it is now.""We want to make all financial processes both easier and faster. We want people to be able to pay for a meal like they would an Uber. To use artificial intelligence to allow families and businesses to share accounts. To have an international currency that can be traded and shared without the ill-equipped processes that are currently in place and cost so much time and money. We want to use technology to trade smarter and more secure.""Some financial experts, however, have yet to be convinced. Mike Rymanov, CEO of Digital Securities Exchange (DSX), said: “The lure of fortune and the perceived lack of risk will undoubtedly attract many, but as it is a technology play rather than a payment network, they will ultimately be disappointed as their spam box fills up and their accounts remain empty.""While the company behind the scheme tries to justify its existence and marketing approach by making grand overtures it's missing two key elements – an actual product and regulatory control. Before it can become a viable option for investors, Initiative Q will need to ensure it meets all governing requirements across all jurisdictions it operates in – which can, and will take years. At the moment, it’s simply too early to commit.""Rymanov is not mistaken; Initiative Q, with an existing team of eight and no actual currency in circulation, is not the get rich quick scheme of dreams. But it is also not worth writing off.Like any digital evolution, nothing will happen overnight. A 'Q' - which the company hopes will become as valuable as a dollar within a decade - is in the eye of the beholder. Initiative's own timeline predicts nothing, hopes for everything, yet commits to utilizing the most advanced technology to bring a new global currency to fruition. The capacity to create Bitcoin, but better.Initiative Q offer their 'future currency' to those who register to the digital platform(Editors note: This article has been updated to reflect an array of views surrounding modern and future currencies.)"

With transactions worth $2 billion now carried out every single day in the cryptocurrency, Nakamoto’s Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System can be seen to have entirely revolutionized the global financial system.Nakamoto — whose identity has never been revealed — published his white paper with the intention of creating a decentralized digital currency that was not reliant on a central bank or single administrator and that could be sent from user-to-user on a peer-to-peer network without the need for an intermediary.Initially, bitcoin was used on online black markets such as the Silk Road but its use soon spread, with programmer Laszlo Hanyecz completing the first commercial transaction using bitcoin in 2010 when he bought two Papa John’s pizzas with 10,000 bitcoin. It is now accepted by a host of major companies from tech-giants Microsoft to home retailer Overstock.In Canada, 
 
KFC
 even launched a “Bitcoin Bucket”, where hungry consumers could purchase $20 worth of chicken tenders and waffle fries in bitcoin. The deal ended up being so popular that KFC actually entirely sold out of their “Bitcoin Buckets”.The cryptocurrency has also been endorsed by some of the world’s most successful businessmen and women.“[Bitcoin] is a remarkable cryptographic achievement… The ability to create something which is not duplicable in the digital world has enormous value… Lots of people will build businesses on top of that,” said Eric Schmidt, the Executive Chairman of 
 
Google
.His words were echoed by the Co-Founder of 
 
Microsoft
 Bill Gates, who stated that bitcoin is “a technological tour de force.”There is ₿16,858,762 of the cryptocurrency currently in circulation, worth an incredible $108,654,552,502 – more than the entire nominal GDP of Israel, Switzerland and Saudi Arabia. Up to 5.8 million people were also using a cryptocurrency wallet in 2017, according to research by the University of Cambridge, with the majority trading in Bitcoin.The United States has long been seen as a cryptocurrency hub with some of the most successful digital currencies originating there, such as ethereum, 
 
Ripple
, Dash and ZCash.However, Europe is rapidly catching up; ICO fundraising in Europe has reached $4.1 billion so far this year, compared to $2.6 billion in the United States and $2.3 billion in Asia.Governments in Europe have increasingly introduced “do-no-harm” regulation, such as in Gibraltar and Malta, which has attracted investors and entrepreneurs alike, while many states have granted tax exemptions on the capital gains from selling cryptocurrencies, such as in Germany or Switzerland. The continent also has near total internet coverage and bank account ownership, meaning that its population also has the necessary conditions to support fintech innovation and encourage co-operation, with crypto meet-up groups popular across Europe, such as P2P Ghent in Belgium, Bitcoin Bucharest in Romania and Coinscrum in the United Kingdom.So, as bitcoin celebrates a decade of success what are the emerging European cryptocurrencies that investors and entrepreneurs alike should be aware of?MIOTAFounded by Norwegian David Sønstebø and Italian blockchain-entrepreneur Dominik Schiener, MIOTA is a unique cryptocurrency designed for the Internet of Things. Rather than relying on a blockchain infrastructure to maintain its ledger, MIOTA transfers use a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), known as the “Tangle”.The advantage of using a “Tangle” is that it requires the sender in the transaction to both make and validate any payment, eliminating miners and thus producing an entirely decentralized system. This approach means that users can conduct transactions for free, making it ideal for SMEs or those unfamiliar with the cryptocurrency industry.Its creators believe that MIOTA can be used to revolutionize the microtransaction industry, by offering feeless transactions but at the same time also increasing security by removing third-party gatekeepers.MIOTA is firmly one to watch as its network speed increases as the number of people using its platform increases. Therefore, as the cryptocurrency grows in popularity it is set to only become more and more attractive to users.You can currently purchase a MIOTA token for $0.49104.LSK TokenFor those that work within the fintech industry, seeing the LSK Token on this list should come as no surprise. Lisk — the Swiss-headquartered firm who launched the token — hit headlines after launching one of the most successful crowdfunding projects in history, raising over 14,000 bitcoins worth of capital during its Initial Coin Offering.Thanks to the positive media attention generated by its crowdfunding and strategic partnerships with major industry players like Microsoft, the LSK Token has skyrocketed in value. At the end of 2017, one token was worth $17 but it is predicted to surpass $100 by early 2018.Parent company Lisk has launched a decentralized blockchain-run application network which is not too dissimilar from ethereum, using smart contracts powered by LSK tokens and JavaScript support.The firm launched a new mobile-friendly app in February of this year which has been praised for its easy-to-use nature, while its network is expected to scale further and the value of the LSK Token will increase, as it continues to work with blue-chip firms like Microsoft.AeternityLiechtenstein-headquartered firm Aeternity has been touted as a successor to blockchain giant Ethereum, with the firm aiming to avoid the scalability problems that have hit its rival. Similarities between the two are inevitable with Bulgarian co-founder Yanislav Malahov closely involved in ethereum’s launch and thus bringing a wealth of similar experience to Aeternity.Aeternity aims to allow consumers to trade in cryptocurrency but on a quicker network than currently experienced with Ethereum and with accompanying lower fees. The company also hopes that its network will promote user-friendly innovation by not only allowing consumers to create decentralized applications on the network but also allowing other tokens to raise ICOs on its platform.The firm held its ICO in May this year, raising roughly $70 million which went towards developing its own unique blockchain network. Miners using the platform vote to make decisions on how to adapt or develop Aeternity in response to market trends making it an uncustomarily democratic offering.An Aeternity token can currently be purchased for $1.32, which marks a significant increase from October 2017 when it was valued at $0.28."

Blockchain research firm Chainalysis found that bitcoin whales are “a diverse group, and only about a third of them are active traders. And while these trading whales certainly have the capability of executing transactions large enough to move the market, they have, on net, traded against the herd, buying on price declines.”Chainalysis' looked at the 32 largest bitcoin wallets, representing around 1 million bitcoin, or around $6.3 billion, for the study.Bitcoin's brief period of calm has been suddenly interrupted.Meanwhile, many investors are waiting on both regulators and the established financial services industry to show their cryptocurrency hands before deciding whether to cash out or double down on their investments.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is still weighing whether to grant approval to a closely-watched bitcoin exchange-traded fund proposal, which could open up the bitcoin investment market to a raft of fresh capital.Many are still hopeful the SEC will eventually approve a bitcoin ETF and are also looking forward to the launch of a bitcoin and cryptocurrency platform called Bakkt, in November — created by New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) owner ICE in partnership with coffee chain Starbucks, software giant Microsoft, and Boston Consulting Group.Global regulators are meanwhile grappling with how to best limit bitcoin and cryptocurrencies use for illicit activities and protect retail investors from potentially high loses, while at the same time nurture the emerging bitcoin, blockchain, and cryptocurrency industries.Earlier today the global Financial Stability Board (FSB) said that cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin do not pose a threat to financial stability but recommended further monitoring and consumer protection.""Based on the available information, crypto-assets do not pose a material risk to global financial stability at this time. However, vigilant monitoring is needed in light of the speed of market developments,"" the FSB said in a statement.The FSB's advice comes after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) yesterday warned the ""rapid growth"" of bitcoin and cryptocurrency assets could create ""new vulnerabilities in the international financial system,"" as the world's banks adjust to the recent bitcoin and blockchain boom.Earlier this week, European Union regulators said customised rules may be needed for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as warnings to investors over the high risks associated with crypto assets have failed to have a meaningful effect.Of the top ten biggest cryptocurrencies, bitcoin cash, ripple (XRP), and stellar were the most heavily sold off during the recent rout, at the time of publication.Bitcoin cash, an offshot of the original bitcoin, as well as ripple (XRP) were the most heavily sold...

But apart from those requests, anything would do.The response on the forum wasn’t entirely positive. One member remarked that 10,000 seemed like a lot: “You could sell those … for $41USD right now ... good luck on getting your free pizza.”Hanyecz did get his meal, creating the first ever transaction conducted in bitcoin. In today’s money, he paid about $65 million for it. I hope he got extra toppings.The story of bitcoin’s first transaction for pizza is now amusing (to everyone except Laszlo Hanyecz, perhaps), but it’s also a warning. Bitcoin wasn’t created to be an asset for investment. It was supposed to function as a currency: a cost-free way for people to pay businesses for goods and services online, around the world, without using a coin that could be influenced by governments and national banks.It hasn’t worked out that way. In December 2017, Steam, the online game platform, announced that it would no longer accept bitcoin for its service. The company cited high fees and volatility for its move, and the details were damning. Transaction fees had risen from 20 cents when Steam started using bitcoin, to as much as $20, the company said. Bitcoin’s volatility meant that in the time it took to complete a transaction, the price of bitcoin could change so much that Steam would either have to make a refund or demand an additional payment from the customer. Either way, there would be another $20 transaction fee.Faced with challenges that great, it’s no wonder that so few businesses, large or small, are now willing to accept bitcoin. When the value of the currency moves so quickly that you don’t know what you’re getting for your product, it makes sense to stick with something as reliable as the dollar.But some companies are still willing to accept cryptocurrency. Overstock, a rival to Amazon, still accepts bitcoins, as does NewEgg, an online technology retailer. Each of those companies is looking for particular advantages from using a cryptocurrency. Overstock’s CEO Patrick Byrne has even been planning to become a blockchain firm. NewEgg’s customers are exactly the kind of people most likely to have wallets filled with digital cash.If your small business caters to technology types, then accepting the currency they prefer could help to win their trust. If you sell internationally and want to offer customers a payment method that isn’t limited by borders, then bitcoin could well be a good option. If you’ve been hit by chargeback fraud or are fed up handing over 3% of your revenues to a credit card company, then bitcoin will let you keep more of your money. If you’re a strong believer in the blockchain and in the power of cryptocurrencies, then accepting payment in the largest digital coin in use would be a clear way of showing your support.And if you want to increase your bitcoin holdings, then selling your products and services for bitcoin will do the trick.But those benefits aren’t all going to apply to every business. They might not even apply to many businesses, which is why so few companies are willing to take on bitcoin’s high volatility and fees.If they do apply to your small business, though, and you are prepared to accept bitcoins, then look for ways to cope with those big price changes. NewEgg gives users just fifteen minutes to complete their transactions, keeping the dollar price in a relatively narrow band. Other companies, such as Bitpay, provide a bitcoin payment platform but give sellers the option of converting the bitcoins into fiat immediately, protecting the seller against sudden price drops. That’s how one outlet in Newport Beach has been promoting the sale of Lamborghini cars. It’s a relatively risk-free way to relieve bitcoin millionaires of their sudden fortunes.Until the price of bitcoin stabilizes, using it as a currency is always going to carry a certain amount of risk for small businesses. Prices could fall before the transaction is complete, wiping out the profit from a sale, or they could rise so high that customers demand their money back. The high fees that bitcoin transactions now demand also mean that they’re more likely to be used for large purchases than small ones.But there are ways to reduce those risks and accept a digital currency from customers around the world -- even if you’re selling pizza."

Photo by Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)Many bitcoin and cryptocurrency investors and traders are awaiting news from regulators or around growing institutional adoption before deciding whether to pour more money into the sector. Circuit Capital is, however, arguing the fall in bitcoin price over the last 10 months has obscured the growing use of cryptocurrencies among consumers and investors.""Despite what is happening with prices, we’re seeing adoption growing and a lot of people are looking to scale crypto businesses,"" Circuit partner Eugene Ng told Bloomberg. ""We are starting to see talent moving into this space and institutional infrastructure developing.""Circuit is planning to launch in the first quarter of next year after raising $30 million and another of its four partners, former technology stock analyst Bo Nam, said he expects Circuit will grow its assets to over $100 million.The bitcoin price plummeted in September to around $6,000 and has so far failed to recover.Circuit has meanwhile developed a bitcoin and cryptocurrency index that measures mainstream adoption of the blockchain technology that supports digital assets—which it is basing its bold prediction on. The benchmark, based on more than 10 data points including the number of active crypto wallets, transaction volumes, computing power, web searches for bitcoin terms, and industry hirings, shows bitcoin and crypto adoption is on an upward trajectory.Bitcoin and cryptocurrency Google searches have tracked the rise and fall in prices over the last 18...

""Fund redemptions, retail community not participating, funds buying via equity not ICO, institution-grade market infrastructure not ready for institutions to fear-of-missing-out, potential rehypothecation issue (#FakeGoodNews), and smart money shorting.""""The most compelling market narrative for the next bullish cycle is that institutions will be the main catalyst driving the market. For these traditional entities to gain direct exposure to crypto, they have to be able to trade, settle and store assets in an institutional-grade environment.""I am excited for 2019 because the foundations for a marketplace will be laid. The buildout of this infrastructure will grow alongside clarity in regulations and regulated investment product offerings that will bring massive inflows of capital.""Ng's comments echo a prediction made earlier this week by the respected chief executive of bitcoin exchange Binance, Changpeng Zhao, who said he expects another bitcoin ""bull run"" to happen ""sooner or later.""Changpeng Zhao, often known by his initials CZ, said that while bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading on Binance, the world's largest exchange by volume, is down almost 90% from January he still feels the company and the wider market are healthy."

cyber criminals to reduce ransom amounts, paying them in Bitcoins.","Sep 17, 2018,07:55am EDT","“Never pay” is the general advice when dealing with a ransomware attack. But it's not always possible to follow this rule, according to a company that helps small firms negotiate with cyber criminals to reduce ransom amounts, paying them in Bitcoins.","“We are pragmatists, and the ‘never pay’ mantra is simply not attuned to the reality of the choices businesses have when they are hit,” says Bill Siegel, CEO and co-founder at Coveware.In fact, a ransomware attack can have massive implications, sometimes forcing firms to lay off employees or close down. This is a far worse outcome than ""paying a few hundred dollars"", he points out. “The decision is obvious. That is the hard truth when firms have no other options for data recovery.”
And this strategy is working in practice. A few weeks ago Coveware helped a Texas-based wrecking company whose servers and files had become encrypted. “They had been down for two days when they contacted us and really did not know who to turn to for help,” says Siegel.Siegel and his colleagues were able to negotiate the ransom amount down by 80% over 36 hours, helping the company facilitate a secure cryptocurrency payment. “The decryptor tool was passed back and handed to the company’s IT provider who, with some guidance from us, was able to fully restore the client’s data,” Siegel says.It's certainly unusual to hear, but Coveware has had a 100% success rate receiving decryptor tools from attackers –  although the full data recovery rate after the decryptor is fully exhausted is about 90%, Siegel says.Indeed, paying the ransom is only half the battle: Encrypted files do not automatically decrypt themselves once the payment is made and specific tools are required to recover data. So how does Coveware ensure that data is actually returned after the firm has negotiated and paid? Siegel admits that decryptor tools are “extremely flukey and difficult to work”. “This is a major area where aggregated case data benefits our community greatly,” Siegel says. “Each case helps us improve and evolve our data set.”The firm uses tear sheets documenting the nuances of how decryptor tools operate, which configurations or file types they trip on; and how to use them as efficiently as possible. But even with all this, it is common to have to go back to the attacker and ask questions, he says. “For the most part the attackers do their best to be helpful, which creates an odd dynamic to say the least. But at the end of the day, the criminals are running a business, and they know that if their decryption does not work, word will get out quickly.”He also concedes there are scenarios “where a company wants to pay and we advise them not to, or at least to image the encrypted files and wait”. “Sometimes a company has partial backups and is unsure if they can complete their review in a time frame that matches the businesses need to recover. In these instances, we urge the firm to push through the review rather than taking the quicker route of paying.”Meanwhile, if the data encrypted by attackers is not mission critical, Siegel advises the company to make a copy of the information and move it to a ring-fenced environment.  “It is quite common for a decryptor tool to be published months or years after a given ransomware type is circulating, so if the data is not critical, they can often recover it much further down the line for free.”Siegel won’t give much away about his negotiating tactics, which are typically carried out via encrypted email or chat. But he claims the firm can facilitate a payment safely.First, Siegel and his colleagues – who between them have experience in cybersecurity and cryptocurrencies – help the companies procure cryptocurrency.  “A ransomware incident is not the time to learn the vagaries of the cryptocurrency capital markets,” he says. “We show the customer, to the penny, how, when, where, at what price, and with what transaction fees the cryptocurrency was acquired.”At the same time, the firm runs an anti-money laundering compliance program internally, developed from the founders' prior jobs at SecondMarket running a regulated broker dealer.  “We run checks on every party involved in each case, the company, their authorized representatives and any service providers assisting them,” says Siegel. He says his firm has “several ways to find information on the attacker” and determine whether they are “more than an everyday cyber criminal”. “Combined, we have as complete a picture as possible of the parties involved and the risks.”Siegel so confident in his services that the firm offers small businesses help for free. Of course, there is something in it for him, too: “Hard, real time case data” which he hopes will help to end ransomware altogether.“Most ransomware data is gleaned from backwards looking surveys of IT professionals, which are anecdotal and stale,” he says. “Attempting to craft solutions to this problem without this data is akin to a car insurance company writing policies without studying car crash information.  The only way to get hard data on ransomware is to jump into the trenches and help victims through incidents.”By managing the incidents, Coveware aggregates hundreds of data points that help it to craft analytics, alerts and shareable information that its clients, security manufacturers, and law enforcement use to stop incidents from occurring, Siegel says.Paying the ransom certainly isn’t ideal – and the advice is still the same. But for firms that unfortunately have been hit, Siegel underlines the importance of not becoming a repeat victim. After an incident, Siegel’s firm puts its customers in touch with IT providers able to improve their security posture. And he advises companies to avoid being hit in the first place by making “consistent investments” in IT security, as well as employee awareness training and disaster recovery tools.   "

A third (34%) don’t know.Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and their underlying blockchain technology, have over the last two years become a part of the economy and culture, in a way comparable to the rapid rise of the internet in the early 1990s.Last year's bull run meant a raft of bitcoin mentions in film, TV, and music as producers both praised and attacked the digital currency—that made many overnight millionaires and brought on the ire of the established financial industry.Public awareness has been a major driver of the bitcoin price, which last year ballooned to almost $20,000 from around $1,000 per coin at the beginning of the year.

It’s the fifth time this year, in case someone is counting.","There are a couple of things different this time around. One of them is that the sell-off began after a period of two-month stability rather than after a short spike. That’s especially the case for Bitcoin, which has traded close to $6,500 since early September, before plunging below $5,500.Another thing is that the sell-off broke though the $6,000 and the $5,800-marks, which has been seen a market “bottom” for the digital currency.That’s a bearish sign for some.BItcoin USD“For me, $5,800 is a more important level than $6,000 as this is the real bottom Bitcoin last hit,” says Clement Thibault, Senior Analyst at global financial platform Investing.com. “We're already seeing Bitcoin go back up to $6,000, and I'll believe a full bearish swing when I see it. We haven't had one of these since Bitcoin began trading between $6,000 and $7,000.”Cryptocurrency trader Abraham Merkin is concerned about the spike in trading volume accompanying the sell-off. “After months of low volume and low market interest this has all the markings of a triggered panic sell. Volume is up as high as 85% on some exchanges and 20-25% is common even among mainstream exchanges.”Henry James, deputy CEO and chairman at Fincross International, isn’t surprised by the sell-off. “This comes after a long period of tightening price action amongst Bitcoin, Ether and other cryptocurrencies and a breakout from this price range has been expected for a number of days, so the sudden volatility has not come as a surprise. This latest sell off suggests that buyers are still hesitant at this stage and are in search of more real-world use cases for cryptocurrency.”While different with previous sell-offs, the current sell-off has similarities to the sell-off of last January. It’s very broad. In the last seven days, Bitcoin is down 12.10%, Ripple is down 15.94%, and Litecoin is down 18.32%--see table 1.And it has been extending across the entire cryptocurrency list, with 93 out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies losing ground — see table 2.This means that money getting out of major cryptocurrencies isn’t being invested back into other cryptocurrencies. It is leaving the entire asset class.That’s what happened back in January—see tables 3 and 4.

""Quite honestly, I've never witnessed an asset holding a hard floor for months on end of trading like Bitcoin has done,” says Thibault. “Bitcoin hasn't dipped under $6K for a significant amount of time in a way that really strikes me as borderline unnatural. We've seen it happen once again, not even 24 hours ago. It's hard not to think that it will blow up at some point."" "

Photographer: James... [+] MacDonald/BloombergThe miners, who use hundreds of very fast, power hungry computers to solve the math puzzles that underlie the value of the cryptocurrency – and are then paid in that currency – were drawn to sleepy Plattsburgh because of its cheap electricity.“We have some of the cheapest indusrial power in the world, 2.7 cents per kilowatt,” Read explained. “They came here for that reason alone. They use a lot of power and employ very few people.”The cheap power comes from hydroelectric dams on the nearby St. Lawrence River that originally powered industries like aluminum smelting, which have drastically declined.Under a 50-year-old compact, Plattsburgh has access to a monthly quota of cheap power, but if the city exceeds that quota it has to share the cost of buying power at much higher rates.Once the miners set up shop, says Read, Plattsburgh started exceeding the quota regularly, and local residents’ electricity bills started going up by as much as 50 percent. If you were used to heating your apartment for $80 a month, all of a sudden it was costing you $120.More shocking, the power costs for Mold-Rite Plastics, a big, important employer in Plattsburgh, and a big user of electricity itself, went up $26,000 in one month, according to Read.“It was definitely enough to get people’s attention last winter,” Read said.In March, the Plattsburgh City Council imposed an 18-month moratorium on new cryptocurrency mining operations, the first such ban in the country, drawing coverage from every media outlet from the New York Times to PBS.“There’s little we can do with the existing operations,” Read said. “We’ll at least ensure the problem doesn’t grow worse and rate payers are protected.”With the moratorium in place, Plattsburgh is now looking at further regulation to deal with two more problems the crypto-miners brought: Heat and noise.“Our concern is the largest operators use all that power and dump huge amounts of heat into the atmosphere,” Read said. “A novel aspect of the new local law mandates they have to recycle a certain share of the power or heat generated.”The new law will go into effect in about a week, according to Read. Meanwhile, the moratorium remains while the town considers the noise problem.“There’s testimony from one couple across the (Saranac) river from an operator that they have to keep their windows closed in the summer time because of the noise,” Read said. “It’s mostly the fans that generate all the noise to cool the computers and keep them from burning up.”Plattsburgh, New York on 1880's map.

All the heat from the unit exhausts at a single point, making it practical to capture and recycle.“We could use it to heat homes in Plattsburgh,” Brienza says. “Our goal is to build them here in Plattsburgh and start deploying them around the city.”All Brienza needs now is for the moratorium to be lifted, which he believes could happen in as little as a month."

When on CNBC I have prefaced most of my equity market commentary with the view that as long the U.S. Dollar remains stable then the financial markets should remain calm. But if the U.S. Dollar rises, it creates risks to the global economy that are not captured by the VIX index.U.S. Dollar’s Role in the Global EconomyTo understand why this is so, we need to understand the role of the U.S. dollar in the global economy. Since WWII, the dollar has been at the center of the global economy serving as the “reserve” currency. Reserve currency status is both a burden and a privilege. It means that most currencies, commodities and debt are priced in U.S. dollars. It also serves as a reference currency for the majority of global trade. For a country, company or individual that does not hold U.S. Dollars they must first buy dollars before they can buy the raw materials needed to produce their product.In its latest report on the Currency Composition of Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER), the IMF reported that over 62% of foreign currency reserves are held in U.S. Dollars. The next closest currency is the Euro at a distant 20%. For all the talk of dethroning the dollar – it still remains King.A Rising Dollar Reduces Lending to EMEsWhat this and other IMF data tells us is that the U.S. Dollar is used as the base currency in international lending. In order to operate long supply chains – like building iPhones in China and shipping to the U.S.) - companies need working capital. This working capital is financed by global financial institutions and is denominated in U.S. Dollars. Herein lies the rub. What the IMF has found is that as the dollar rises, global financial institutions lend less to emerging market economies (EMEs). This reduction in lending has a negative impact on real investment in the EMEs.At this point, some might push back and argue that a weak currency in a net export country is positive for that country’s economy since its goods will be cheaper to foreign buyers. However, the IMF study shows that the diminished credit and the resulting slowing of real investment outweighs the positive effect of a weak local currency. This starts a negative feedback loop. As the U.S. Dollar rises – or local currency falls – banks curtail lending; this leads to a slower economy, which leads to increased default rates on bank loans. Banks respond by reducing credit and a deleveraging cycle ensues.U.S. Federal Reserve's Impact on the DollarWhile the Federal Reserve will tell you that value of the U.S. Dollar is the concern of the U.S. Treasury – the Fed’s actions have a profound impact on its value.When the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates below zero with Quantitative Easing it made borrowing money virtually free. Investors borrowed money at low rates in the United States and then invested in countries with higher interest rates. This fueled the economic expansion of EME’s. QE also had the side-effect of weakening the U.S. dollar, which as the IMF has shown increases lending by banks to EME’s. This influx of capital creates a boom. But when that flow reverses it ushers in the inevitable bust. This is what we are currently seeing in countries like Argentina, Brazil, and Turkey.RepatriationWe have all heard of the trillions of U.S. dollars parked in foreign bank accounts by the like of Apple. The primary reason these profits has not flowed back into the U.S. is because of taxes. Apple (and other U.S. companies) pay a reduced tax rate on international profits that are kept in foreign banks. But there is another reason.U.S. corporations has been able to borrow money at extraordinarily low rates. At the same time, they lend out the profits at foreign banks at much higher rate of return. This form of financial alchemy is known as a carry trade.But now U.S. corporations have both an economic and political incentive to repatriate dollars. The weaker EMEs create more risk to lending while the U.S. government has reduced taxes on foreign profits. This accelerates the dollar appreciation and emerging market currency decline.As investors bring those invested dollars home, the local currency falls and credit is curtailed. And the deleveraging bust ensues.The higher the dollar goes the more risk of a global deleveraging. Said another way the U.S. dollar is the new VIX.The Crypto ConnectionBitcoin -and other cryptocurrencies – were designed to be alternative currencies. The combination of the blockchain and a digital token create a financial system that replicate and automate much of what the traditional financial system has done. Importantly, the cryptocurrency financial system is not impacted by central banks, geopolitical tensions or capital flows in the traditional financial system.The autonomy of the cryptocurrency based financial system makes it a viable substitute for currencies financial systems that are in distress due to the stronger dollar. In 2013, when Cyprus had its financial crisis, citizens flocked to bitcoin. According to Google trends, interest in bitcoin has increased in Brazil and Russia over the last few months. To be sure, it is still quite early to declare a meaningful move into cryptocurrencies is imminent. Nonetheless, this developing trend is important to watch."

Proof of work is appallingly slow and expensive, and the fragmented cryptocurrency market structure means that there is a chronic shortage of liquidity. Furthermore, all transactions are visible to everyone, which makes markets volatile and invites front-running. Consequently, using Bitcoin for high-volume transactions is a nonstarter.","This is not my opinion. It is Blockstream’s.HONG KONG - 2018/10/02: A smartphone displays the Bitcoin USD market value on the stock exchange via... [+] the Yahoo Finance app. (Photo by Guillaume Payen/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)Blockstream’s comment is in the “Strong Federations” whitepaper, which underpins the Liquid sidechain that was released Wednesday, October 10th. The actual statement is in geek-speak, of course:Bitcoin currently facilitates remittance and cross-border payment, but its performance is hampered by technical and market dynamics. The high latency of the public Bitcoin network requires bitcoin to be tied up in multiple exchange and brokerage environments, while its limited privacy adds to the costs of operation. Due to market fragmentation, local currency trade in bitcoin can be subject to illiquidity. As a result, many commercial entities choose to operate distinct, higher frequency methods of exchange. These attempts to work around Bitcoin’s inherent limitations introduce weaknesses due to centralization or other failings.Here is a plain English translation of the sentences I have highlighted:It takes forever to move bitcoins around, so they pile up in stagnant pools. (""Tied up"" = ""illiquid"")Exchanges can run out of money. So you not only can’t move your bitcoins, you can’t exchange them for real money either.In short, as I have said many times, Bitcoin is disgustingly illiquid.Blockstream’s Liquid sidechain aims to make Bitcoin more liquid by enabling large volumes of transactions to be taken off the main chain. But it isn’t possible to improve liquidity while maintaining full decentralization and trustlessness. So Blockstream cheerfully compromises both of these prized features. It appoints a small group of trusted institutions to validate transactions and submit them to the main Bitcoin chain.A “Strong Federation” is a cooperative of market participants – called “functionaries” - who collectively validate transactions. Unlike Proof of Work, where miners drop in and out depending on their view of the market, the number of functionaries would not change; the paper talks about replacing the “dynamic miner set” with a “fixed signer set.” But it isn’t clear from the paper how the signers would be appointed. Who decides who should be a signer? Why should we trust them?For me, this is a huge hole.  Blockstream’s Liquid is at present the only commercial implementation of a Strong Federation. Just look what the whitepaper says its signers are:Liquid is a Strong Federation where functionaries are exchanges participating in the network.Unregulated, manipulated and insecure cryptocurrency exchanges are the “trusted functionaries” in Blockstream’s Liquid. This is the full list of exchanges and other institutions participating in Liquid (from Blockstream’s press release):Altonomy, Atlantic Financial, Bitbank, Bitfinex, Bitmax, BitMEX, Bitso, BTCBOX, BTSE, Buull Exchange, DGroup, Coinone, Crypto Garage, GOPAX (operated by Streami), Korbit, L2B Global, OKCoin, The Rock Trading, SIX Digital Exchange, Unocoin, Xapo, XBTO and Zaif.Would you trust this lot to validate your transactions and manage your liquidity? That is what Blockstream wants them to do:By moving the bitcoin-holding risk, intrinsic to the operation of exchange and brokerage businesses, from a SPOF introduced by a single institution to a federation of institutions, Liquid improves the underlying security of the funds held within the network.Instead of holding all your funds in one corrupt and hack-prone exchange, a bunch of corrupt and hack-prone exchanges will link themselves together so that it is much easier to move your funds from one corrupt and hack-prone exchange to another. This also makes it more likely that if one goes down, so do the rest. Didn't the authors learn anything from 2008?Of course, I am assuming that exchanges are both corrupt and risky. Perhaps I am being unreasonable – after all, they are not banks (or so they say). The whitepaper suggests ways of ensuring their honesty:Incentives can be aligned through the use of escrow, functionary allocation, or external legal constructs such as insurance policies and surety bonds.These measures would have to be extremely expensive to outweigh the potential gains to corrupt exchanges from controlling all the funds in a sidechain. Perhaps I am cynical, but multi-million dollar fines are simply a “cost of doing business” for conventional banks. Why should exchanges regard surety bonds and the like differently?The Strong Federations white paper seems to imply that because the exchanges are part of the Liquid network (and therefore not third parties), there is no risk:Strong Federations such as Liquid improve privacy, latency, and reliability without exposing users to the weaknesses introduced by third-party trust.So you can eliminate the risk to sheep arising from wolves outside the sheepfold by bringing the wolves into the sheepfold and giving them full control of the sheep. What could possibly go wrong?Of course, in prehistoric times, humans did exactly this. But it took thousands of years to train the wolves to round up and control the sheep instead of eating them. Exchanges are wolves, not sheepdogs. I forecast that any sheep venturing into Liquid will not survive for long.And nor will weaker exchanges. Cooperative platforms only work if the participants are cooperative, and unregulated exchanges hate each other’s guts. They are intensely competitive and their aim is to drive each other out of business. I do wish that starry-eyed technocrats devising schemes that rely on cooperation between entities that want to eat each other would pay more attention to psychology. Any scheme that relies on fiercely competitive market participants cooperating for profit naturally tends towards monopoly. Just look at Bitcoin mining.But despite the (considerable) risk of becoming tomorrow’s lunch, there is apparently a good reason for sheep to join Liquid:By moving business processes to Liquid, users may improve their efficiency and capital-reserve requirements.Apparently existing market provision is not good enough. Well, that is certainly true of cryptocurrency markets, but then they are extremely primitive. But the authors ignore cryptocurrency markets completely, and instead launch into an extraordinary attack on prime brokerage in conventional markets. They start with describing how prime brokerage generates market liquidity:….liquidity provisioning is the primary business model of Prime Brokerages and Investment Banks. Fund managers commit their funds to a single location’s custodianship under the premise of reducing costs associated with investment management and improving access to both investment opportunities and liquidity. Third-party broker dealers then grant each participant access to the liquidity of their respective counterparties; a function of aggregation of capital under a single trusted third-party custodian. This system offers investors a means of preferential access to liquidity by enabling customers to buy, sell, and hedge trades with their respective counterparties in a single location. These centralized systems provide convenience to market participants, but are not without risks.This is accurate as far as it goes, though as there are many prime brokers in conventional markets, a prime broker is hardly a “single point of failure” (SPOF) for the entire market. However, it is fair to say that prime brokers are weak points for their customers. Post-Lehman, of course, we have introduced regulations to protect their customers from losses. The authors completely ignore this.But the writers then go on to offer, as an example of prime brokerage failure, losses sustained by the Eurosystem due to Lehman Brothers’ collapse in 2008:One realized example of these risks is that of the Eurosystem following the global financial crisis, in the wake of the financial default of the Lehman Brothers. The effort of the Eurosystem to liquidate assets collateralized by 33 complex securities took more than four years, and resulted in over EUR 1 billion in losses.Eh?? This was not a prime brokerage failure. The Eurosystem is a central bank, not a fund manager. Central banks don’t place customers’ funds with trusted custodians. They lend their own money to banks in order to maintain market liquidity and manage interest rates. The Eurosystem had lent money to Lehman, in return for which Lehman had pledged securities as collateral. As the value of those securities collapsed, the Eurosystem lost money.Losses due to asset value collapse can happen in any market system. If the value of bitcoin falls, those who hold bitcoin – or have accepted bitcoin as collateral against (say) a USD loan – lose money. Making the system more liquid actually makes losses of this kind more likely, because people can dump collapsing assets more easily. Bitcoin’s illiquidity helps to support its price.But the authors' unfortunate choice of example inadvertently reveals the real issue with this paper. Rather than disrupting prime brokerage, as the authors seem to intend, the paper’s solution to Bitcoin’s liquidity problem in fact replicates the interbank market.The interbank market pools and redistributes liquidity across market sectors, just as Liquid aims to do. And it has key “functionaries,"" known as broker dealers, whose job it is to maintain market liquidity and act as gateways to the payments system. Without a functioning interbank market, transactions can be very slow or even fail, and banks can literally run out of money. Just like cryptocurrency exchanges, in fact.Far from reinventing the financial system, the cryptocurrency world seems to be gradually forming itself into a simulacrum of the existing system. Perhaps this is inevitable. After all, the existing system is the way it is because of thousands of years of trial and error. With all its faults, perhaps it is simply the best that humans can do.This article has been amended to include the date of Liquid's release. "

Pizac),"Crypto-friendly online retailer Overstock.com expects to formally begin selling bitcoin through its website in the first half of 2019, the company has revealed. Such functionality will be offered through Bitsy, a crypto wallet and portfolio company of Medici Ventures, Overstock’s blockhain-focused subsidiary which currently has investments deployed in 18 separate ventures. In an interview with Forbes, Patrick Byrne, founder and CEO of Overstock, announced Bitsy’s beta launch and emphasized that the roadmap is to fully integrate the wallet into the Overstock website by early next year.   “We will be offering this through Overstock,” he said. “Expect us to be offering bitcoin by Q1 or Q2 of next year.” While the announcement comes with crypto markets in a rocky state, Byrne shrugged off such concerns and stressed that Overstock’s commitment to crypto surpasses any short term woes - likening the turbulence to the early days of the internet. “When you had all these dot-com companies crashing, it wasn’t because something was wrong with the internet technology. Coins are going to come and go, but we’re long-term long on blockchain technology,” he said, adding:“There’s a parallel universe emerging with crypto, and I see Overstock as the wormhole between the two universes. You’re going to be seeing us bring this to our retail consumer base.”Dual AppealThe Bitsy wallet, which is projected to wrap up its beta test phase toward the end of this year, aims to serve as a user-friendly bridge between the fiat and crypto realms. It incorporates features that will appeal to both crypto purists and novices, such as Overstock’s core customer segment of middle-aged women who may not be tech savvy. For the die-hards, the wallet will allow the user to hold actual physical possession of the coins, rather than just a contractual claim to a bitcoin held on an exchange or with another third party custodian.Byrne explained:“The whole point of crypto is to have a form of money that no authority could control. This is crypto as crypto is meant to be.”But that core appeal will be augmented by the emphasis on user experience and ease of use for those individuals who may be nominally interested in crypto but intimidated by some of the complexities and computer jargon. “We’ve made usability our highest priority,” said Steve Hopkins, Medici's COO and general counsel. “We’ve spent a lot of time really understanding how people who don’t have a computer science background interact with payment applications.” For instance, the wallet will integrate biometric security measures such as fingerprint scans and facial recognition to verify identity and will offer a patent-pending key recovery mechanism that allows a user’s private key to be regenerated in extreme circumstances, thus reducing the probability of a user's holdings being lost forever if his or her phone is destroyed or stolen.  Byrne concluded:""Bitsy sets a new standard for cryptocurrency wallets. What it’s offering is quite special compared to most wallets in the marketplace."""

Both companies are using their proprietary operating system on top of their hardware.However, the Taiwan-based consumer electronics company, which launched its first Android smartphone 10 years ago in partnership with Google and is the creator of the popular Vive virtual reality (VR) headset, is among the very first to build a hardware-based secure crypto wallet using an off-the-shelf Android device that leverages ARM's Trusted Zone technology.Although the Exodus 1 could appeal to some of the 30+ million digital wallet users as well as early-adopter blockchain developers, we believe the window of opportunity is quite short - 6 to 9 months - as larger smartphone manufacturers could quickly jump on the cryptocurrency bandwagon by leveraging the same ARM technology, if the demand is there."

Currency quotes are falling.,"The market capitalization of crypto is 5% higher now than this date last year. That's a bit lower than the average historical return on stocks of 7%. Still, it’s not bad for a bear market. It’s a great return for the year that has been called “an asset bust for the record books.”To be sure, my data series is selective. It excludes the wild December runup, a time when the lines at bitcoin ATMs were around the block. Buying at the top and holding would have been … regrettable. You can read countless stories of how so many people have been suckered into a bubble and ruined their lives by investing in various crypto assets. People use this event as a way of saying that crypto is nothing but a shiny object signifying nothing. Actually, the story reveals an old truth. Most people buy high and sell low. That’s why there’s such profit in doing the opposite. But going against trend is more difficult than it seems because, as it turns out, the future is unknowable. Frenzy Feeds FrenzyIn 2013, I was working for a company that put out investment newsletters. The company never stopped trying to get new subscribers. But there was always the same problem. If you pushed an idea that no one had heard of, or a stock or asset that had recently been pummeled by the market, would-be subscribers would be unimpressed. You couldn’t close the deal.The time when people get excited about an investment is usually the precise time when it is already overbought. So the company would send out solicitations based on topics in the news, knowing full well, based on market experience, that the items were situated for a fall. Then a bunch of angry people would write in denouncing the company for pushing what turned out to be a dog. Half would cancel. The company was fully aware of this, but it marketed this way anyway. Its sales data demonstrated that this was the best way to get subscribers. If you kept half the people who signed up, you have a winning model. In any case, you can’t sell people on products they find boring. Underpriced financial assets are always boring. Overpriced assets are exciting. In this sense, the crypto markets are no different from any other, except that they have been more volatile. This is exactly what you would expect from a completely new technology. Investor sentiment flits between despair and irrational exuberance. The Abstraction of Crypto Crypto has the added problem that the whole thing seems so abstract. It’s made of code. Though we are a quarter century into the digital age, many people remain incredulous. They think wealth is what you can touch. Money is what jingles in your pocket. Value can’t be made of ones and zeros. Even now, speakers at conferences decry our world of social media, gaming, and online everything, and say it has been a giant bubble. “We need to get back to making things” is a theme you hear in both progressive and conservative circles. Added to that problem is the combination of features of crypto that people just don’t understand. Distributed network, hashing strategies, proof-of-work protocols, cryptography — who but specialists can make sense of all this? Most people have no idea what the use case is, much less what the ultimate point of it is (my quick answer: it’s the best technology ever discovered for documenting ownership rights). Because so many lack the patience to understand, and perhaps because so few can explain it coherently, there is a strange lust in the land to debunk the whole thing. Every single time the market drops, people get busy writing obituaries for crypto. I’ve been seeing these appear since the market price was $14. The tendency goes way back. There is a great site called Bitcoin Obituaries that has logged 315 obituaries. Look at the first one: “The only thing that’s even kept Bitcoin alive this long is its novelty. Either it will remain a novelty forever or it will transition from novelty status to dead faster than you can blink.” The price at the time of that writing was $0.23. I recall reading it and thinking: “Oh I can’t wait for this thing to hit $1,000; then people will stop writing this nonsense.” But you know what’s true? The price doesn’t matter at all for these people who want crypto to die. You would think that $5,000 would do it. Maybe $10,000. But no. Here is a recent declaration of crypto death. “It looks like we have an asset bust for the record books in the making…. Whether or not cryptocurrencies recover — and I doubt they will — it is clear that their volatility make them unfit to serve as a general medium of exchange.” This was written in September 2018, a time when that brilliant mind failed to check on data showing that transactions per block had been rising dramatically since February 2018. The same is true of transactions per day. As for volatility, most of 2018 has been a year of price stability, much to the regret of investors. These facts on the ground don’t matter to these people. The underlying technology doesn’t matter, because these people show almost no interest in it.To be sure, I’m not predicting that bitcoin core (BTC) will win this battle of the cryptos. I’m not even saying it will go up in price. Maybe it will crash again. I once perfectly predicted the first $1,000 price; what I failed to predict was its fall to $350. There’s no disgrace in that. What bugs me is that ridiculous sense of certainty these writers have, that their beautiful minds are smarter than the market itself. They are not.

This pushed Bitcoin to a high of $6,656, but the price retraced fast as the move wasn’t supported by volume. What this means is that any breakout, upwards or downwards, should have healthy volume behind it. Only this can assure that the price continues its move further. If the volume isn’t there, it is more than likely that the breakout is short-lived.","Staff members chats with visitors near the Lamborghini Huracan models on being displayed at the... [+] China Auto China in Beijing, Thursday, April 26, 2018. Auto China 2018, the industry's biggest sales event this year, is overshadowed by mounting trade tensions between Beijing and U.S. President Donald Trump, who has threatened to hike tariffs on Chinese goods including automobiles in a dispute over technology policy. (AP Photo/Andy Wong)What contained the bitcoin rally is that speculators failed to see that the IMF has also raised concerns about the cryptocurrency space. This was clearly stated in the IMF’s World Outlook Report: “Cybersecurity breaches and cyber-attacks on critical financial infrastructure represent an additional source of risk because they could undermine cross-border payment systems and disrupt the flow of goods and services. Continued rapid growth of crypto assets could create new vulnerabilities in the international financial system.”As it has been the case recently, Bitcoin’s upward momentum is lacking one critical element; participation from the wider community. Remember, last year’s move towards $20K was supported by the retail client. It was the masses going crazy about the cryptocurrency thinking that buying bitcoin is the shortcut to acquire the Lambo they always wanted.No matter which exchange you look at, there is one common theme; no volume. A lot of questions are being raised in regards to the opening of new accounts at various different exchanges and the key problem continues to be the lack of a reliable third-party auditor.Bitcoin needs some sort of a blessing to revitalise the rally. This could come in the form of an ETF approval from the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). To date, the SEC has rejected nearly nine applications in this space.  But there is still hope. The department has invited parties and public people to share their views on bitcoin ETFs. The date set for this is October 26th, 2018.I think that the SEC seeking public opinion about the Bitcoin ETF is a positive sign. It shows that the department remains open to the public opinion and most importantly wants to gauge the landscape. If the public shows support towards an ETF, it is highly likely that the department will accept an actual application which satisfies their criteria. In other words,  SEC’s softened stance towards the crypto industry could bring the bull rally that crypto investors have been longing for since last year.In terms of technical analysis, let’s avoid the heavy jargon and keep it simple. The definition of an uptrend says that we should have higher lows and higher highs. The definition for downtrend is the opposite, lower lows and lower highs. So, by looking at the chart below, we can't say that the price is neither in an uptrend nor in a downtrend. We have higher lows (shown by the green circle) and then we have lower highs (shown by red circles). Hence, the only take away from this could be that as long as the previous lower low stays intact, meaning the price doesn’t start to make lower lows, the odds remain intact that the price is likely to move higher.Bitcoin price making higher lowsTaking into account the nervousness caused by the global trade war, the uptrend for Bitcoin could come as early as this month; especially if the earning season over in the U.S. shows that analysts have downgraded their future forecast for earnings. This would create an even bigger rout in the markets. The U.S. mid-term elections aren’t that far either and the ongoing tussle between Italy and Berlin is only becoming worse. It simply remains to be seen how much turmoil it takes for investors to get interested in the crypto markets again.Disclosure: I hold bitcoin in my wallet"

Ether is the tradable token of the ethereum network.Musk's tweet may have been an indirect response to various news sites last week reporting that Musk's tunnel construction Boring Company was accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for its famous flamethrowers — something that turned out to be false. It's not the first time Musk has joked about the cryptocurrency scammers that follow him on Twitter. Last month, in an apparent compliment to ethereum, Musk tweeted that he ""wanted [ether] even if it is a scam.""Musk has also previously tried to solve problem, contacting the creator of dogecoin Jackson Palmer.“[I]f you can help get rid of the annoying scam spammers, that would be much appreciated,” Musk told Palmer. In responsonse, Palmer was able to create a script to block ETH giveaway scammers.Musk's candid Twitter feed has gotten him into trouble, however. In August Musk sent a now-infamous tweet saying that he had “funding secured” for a Telsa buyout at $420 a share — far above Tesla's share price at the time. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission then moved to fine and ban Musk from serving as Tesla's chairman in response to the tweet."

Ironically, in the financial markets, unusually low volatility often occurs before powerful, volatile moves - the ""calm before the storm,"" so to speak. When Bitcoin finally breaks out of this pattern in a convincing manner, a significant move is likely to occur.According to the chart below, Bitcoin's descending triangle has been forming since February/March of this year. $6,000 is the key support level to watch. Descending triangles are bearish patterns, so there is a higher probability of a breakdown from here, but it is important to be open to the idea of an upside breakout as well. Also, beware of the risk of a head-fake move in which Bitcoin initially breaks out in one direction, only to head in the opposite direction while making a more sustained move.Daily Bitcoin ChartThe weekly Bitcoin chart shows this descending triangle pattern a bit better:Weekly Bitcoin ChartBitcoin volatility is at unusually low levels according to Bollinger BandWidth, which further confirms that a major move is likely to occur soon:Volatility ahead?I'm watching for a convincing breakout or breakdown from this descending triangle pattern with strong volume for further confirmation.We at Clarity Financial LLC, a registered investment advisory firm, specialize in preserving and growing investor wealth in times like these.

It should help its adoption rate in everyday transactions, and eventually push the price of the digital currency higher, given the tight supply.David Drake, Founder and Chairman LDJ Capital, agrees, though for different reasons. “It is a bullish sign because right now more hedge funds are buying bitcoin than high net individuals and whales, and that intersection happened three weeks ago,” says Drake. “Consequently, more and more hedge funds will be buying bitcoin than whales because whales have gotten all the bitcoin they want so we are going to see a surge on crypto on the bitcoin side over the next two months.”Bitcoin Price[Ed. note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated.

It’s trader thinking. This coiled spring compression has got downright silly in recent weeks with the usually volatile bitcoin trading in an ultra-tight range. This tight trading range seemed very contrived to me and suggested something was “up.”,"Yesterday out of the blue bitcoin dropped 10%:Bitcoin dropped 10%According to my thinking this should be the start of a very significant fall. That is my “speculation.” An asset like bitcoin is an extreme speculative asset so if you are going to play this market you must be and are a “speculator.”$2,500 has been my target since the crash started at $20,000. I bailed at $18,000 and have been waiting since then to reenter in size. If it hits that price I will load up. It could bounce tomorrow, it could hit $1,000 but $2,500 is my target waypoint, my unreliable crystal balls are indicating. Price goals can only be guesses but as a trader you pivot around them as the market develops.What is this move about? What is going on?The obvious culprit causing this dump is bitcoin Cash, the ‘wannabe’ bitcoin usurper, which forked from bitcoin last year. It is forking again and there are competing forks and all sorts of conniptions are expected. It sounds plausible this is causing the move but the fact the bond market spiked at the same time suggests something else is going on to me.The stock market is crashing and the Nasdaq is crashing more and can crash the most.The Nasdaq - surely this is a bubble!Against this background, at some point large institutions are going to bail on risk markets and go to cash/bonds.This is what I think is going on.Risk capital is running to safety from risk assets and equities, especially in the bubbly Nasdaq that looks like a disaster in the making as Apple, its darling, tanks.The Nasdaq looks shakyIt is highly probably we are in for a market rout and Bitcoin is just going to be part of the spectrum of assets thrown overboard in a general market panic.We can, of course, forget the influence of the $25 trillion U.S. equity markets and look to the narrow crypto market for reasons. We can claim crypto is uncorrelated with stocks and bonds, but I do not agree, crypto often moves when equity markets open and as institutions and private individuals trade crypto, equities, commodities and bonds, it is impossible that there would be no interconnection between these trading assets.The whole crypto market has tanked at the same time, which strongly suggests large sellers hitting the bid across the asset spectrum. This large seller or sellers are realigning themselves for a major draw down in the financial markets and stuffing the receipts of that liquidation into bonds, a classic hiding place in dangerous market conditions.Of course it could all turn around tomorrow but for me this is another nail in the coffin of the longest bull market in history and another step along the road of a crash in one of the most obviously developing market “double tops” or “head and shoulders” we’ve seen in a long time.The crash scenario is unfolding and it will take a lot to turn it around.Stay informed and ahead of the crowd with Forbes Crypto Confidential, a free weekly e-letter delivered to your inbox.

adverse signal to the market and trigger what's known as slippage ...","Editors' Pick|Oct 23, 2018,05:44pm EDT",(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan),"As the entrance of institutional players into the crypto space continues to draw nigh, the market for a murky off-exchange form of trading known as over-the-counter is becoming an increasingly critical lynchpin to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. While most people looking to buy or sell cryptocurrency can do so through standard exchanges, large institutional investors and high-net worth individuals who transact in large volumes of bitcoin must look to the relatively uncharted world of OTC markets to execute these trades.Because cryptocurrency exchanges typically lack the technological infrastructure and the liquidity required to execute large block orders, big buyers and sellers are effectively forced to find one another by venturing into Skype chatrooms hosted by proprietary trading firms like Cumberland, private messaging platforms like Telegram and even public forums like LinkedIn. “The big deals have to go OTC. A lot of the exchanges limit the order size, so you have to break up your orders, and that’s just fatal,” explained Monica Summerville, director of fintech research at Tabb Group, a U.K.-based market research firm. Breaking up a large sell order of, say, 1,000 bitcoins, could send an adverse signal to the market and trigger what’s known as slippage - whereby the price of a trade at execution is different than the expected price.The appeal of OTC for traders, miners and the like, is that it provides a much-needed offramp from crypto into fiat - necessitated by the fact that most of the largest crypto exchanges don’t deal in fiat currency. “We prefer to hedge into fiat when we want to liquidate. Others go into (stablecoins), but there’s a lot of shadiness out there, so we prefer not to diversify,” said one trader, adding that simply transferring assets to a fiat-compatible exchange isn’t always a ready solution either:A lot of exchanges use banking services in different countries and geographies that aren’t necessarily respected. Just because you can get fiat into an exchange doesn’t necessarily mean you can get it out.”How Large?These markets have grown significantly more popular and competitive over the last 12 months, according to participants, as more sophisticated investors and traders enter the space. Many of these players have begun trading through brokers like Octagon Strategy, Genesis Trading, Circle, though the exact size and scope of this market remains difficult to quantify.A report earlier this year produced by the Tabb Group estimated daily bitcoin OTC volumes at $12B globally. Summerville reckons that this figure is two to three times larger than the daily average traded across standard crypto exchanges globally, though this is comparison is difficult to quantify because the volume figures reported by exchanges can be of questionable veracity:There is nobody checking the volumes that are being reported, and there are suspicions that exchanges are doing various things to increase their volumes that would not be legal for a normal regulated exchange.” Still, estimates of the actual size of the bitcoin OTC market vary widely. Lucas Nuzzi, director of technology at Digital Asset Research, pegs the total daily volume at around $250M.“This is very different from other figures we see out there,” he said. “Our estimation is based on things we can see and people we interact with that are actively participating in those markets.” Institutional Stumbling Block?While an influx of new institutional money into crypto has been a topic of endless discussion and speculation over the last 12 months, the lack of exchange infrastructure has pushed many of the players brave enough to venture in to the OTC realms. “Structurally, for a lot of institutional investors, OTC is really the only way they can trade the most liquid assets,” said Nuzzi.However, a general murkiness and lack of sophistication in OTC markets hasn’t created an environment that institutionals can be fully comfortable participating in. Somewhat paradoxically, crypto OTC trading requires a heavy degree of trust when cashing out into fiat is the end objective. “Currently, some parts of the cryptocurrency industry are organizing six figure trades over Skype and Telegram - very similar to how old-school Wall Street brokers and traders would call clients to bring buyers and sellers together,” explained Frank Wagner, founding partner of INVAO - an artificial intelligence-enabled investment vehicle for crypto assets.Wagner emphasized:Clearly, this can’t be the most secure and effective way to execute these trades and may be a reason that many institutional investors are deterred from getting involved.”In particular, crypto OTC trading brings with it several unique forms of counterparty risk. One aspect is that, because of anti-money laundering rules, many financial institutions are still averse to the idea of processing large wire transfers directly related to cryptocurrency transactions. This means that even if a trade is agreed upon by both parties, there is no guarantee that the fiat transfer will actually execute. A crypto for fiat exchange is also asymmetrical in the sense that the coin transfer happens much faster (sometimes by several hours) than the wire transfer.“When you execute a trade with an OTC broker, after the trade you need to deliver the currency to the broker. Until the broker delivers you the BTC/ETH or the Fiat you have a risk that for example he will default before he delivers your tokens or funds,” said Daniel Peled, co-founder of hybrid blockchain project Orbs and an experienced OTC trader, adding:Basically there is counterparty risk that the other side might not be solvent since it doesn't happen in real time, so you need to trust them to wire you the money.”Gene Grant, CEO of VRBEX - a crypto and security token exchange, explained that as transaction sizes grow larger, the process becomes more complex and a heightened layer of counterparty risk is added due to the high stakes. “The large transaction market is fairly small, and the players are deeply distrustful,” he said.  Still others contend that more robust regulation, custodial solutions and surveillance tools are needed to give mainstream investors the confidence needed to wade more aggressively into crypto OTC.""OTC is regulated similarly to other traditional trading ecosystems, but the industry is still missing the monitoring tools for enforcement,"" said Peled, adding:Therefore, the fear that certain parties are sharing knowledge and front running is a real concern for traders.""Solutions on the HorizonBut despite the downturn crypto markets have experienced since the beginning of the year, there are numerous onramps being built with the goal of bringing more sophisticated infrastructure to OTC markets.A sure sign of maturation is last week’s announcement that Fidelity, the world’s fifth-largest asset manager, is entering the world of storing and trading crypto - to be sourced from OTC markets - for institutional investors. Indeed, building software systems for crypto that can replicate the settlement, clearing and risk management systems to which traditional investors are accustomed is becoming big business. “Even though the market has disappointed a lot of people, the infrastructure wasn’t sacrificed and you still have a lot of things being built,” explained Nuzzi. “There are dozens of software providers that are tackling this need by OTC traders.”For example, OTCXN is building a multi-custodian network that seeks to address the lack of a clearing and settlement mechanism that can connect liquidity providers and exchanges with minimal counterparty and settlement risk. “What we have created is an institutional-grade Layer 2 network, like Lightning Network, except that it operates across all crypto assets and at institutional scale and capacity,” said Rosario Ingargiola, CEO of OTCXN.“You simply cannot scale the crypto markets to institutional levels without removing public ledger transactions from the real-time trading critical path,” he continued, explaining that his platform will facilitate OTC trades between counterparties to be settled and cleared in less than a second.OTCXN recently announced partnerships with Kingdom Trust and Prime Trust, which are both registered as qualified custodians with the Securities and Exchange Commission, to custody the crypto assets that are traded on its platform. Another solution making headway in this realm is Caspian, which recently raised nearly $20M in an initial coin offering with the goal of providing sophisticated traders and investors with better tools, such as a single user interface that connects to major exchanges. In early October, Caspian partnered with B2C2 - the crypto market maker - to better serve the liquidity needs of large OTC traders. But while there may be a Cambrian explosion of new platforms devoted to helping institutional traders manage risk coming onto the scene, Nuzzi of DAR argues that the market for duplicating legacy trading tools will likely end up a niche one:A lot of them will fail only just because there’s this infrastructure being developed that already exists in traditional financial markets."""

It’s just a pipe dream going the OneCoin way.,"Bitcoin and other major digital “currencies” begin on the supply side of the market. And they have big promise: to make market transactions fast, efficient, inexpensive, and free from the control of central bankers and big banks. But they have a big problem, too: how to gain broad acceptance by a critical mass of users.Thus far, none of the major digital currencies have solved this problem. They haven’t gained acceptance beyond the “technology enthusiasts,” a small group in the “Rogers Curve” -- a model marketers use to explain how new products reach the masses.Initiative Q claims to have a solution to this problem, by beginning with the demand side of the market. It is attempting to create a critical mass of users first, and then come up with the digital currency to serve it.Simply put, there’s no digital currency to speak of, a “new” Bitcoin that will solve the problems of the “old” Bitcoin.“Initiative Q is not the new Bitcoin,” says Shidan Gouran, President and CEO of Global Blockchain. “Initiative Q is actually highly questionable in its very concept, because it seems as if it was purposely meant to be mysterious. “Bitcoin Prices USDWhy compare it with Bitcoin? Apparently, for the buzz such comparison is expected to generate in the cryptocurrency community.“I would compare it as a ""new bitcoin"" in the sense of creating wide scale awareness and potential adoption, but it will function very differently in reality, “ says Jeff Ramson, Founder & CEO PCG Advisory Group. “Initiative Q is growing based on a brilliant social marketing scheme.  They are growing the network rapidly, and I can see this as a self-fulfilling prophecy of a new payment system as they will have an enormous number of global users.”A better comparison for this social marketing scheme would be a pyramid scheme, according to Gouran.“The comparisons of Initiative Q to a pyramid scheme are spot-on, because that is exactly the way Initiative Q looks. They promise some kind of irresistibly lucrative payout, in exchange for what seems to be nominal consideration, with the first step being to recruit people who you know.”Cryptocurrency trader Abraham Merkin would rather compare Initiative Q to Stellar. “Everything functional about Q Initiative is within the capabilities of Stellar, which is a better foil than Bitcoin.”Still, Q isn’t Stellar. “It's hard to say how Q payments expands on Stellar other than in its grandiosity. And although Stellar does have a distribution system for its currency, the viability and inter-organizational applications of the platform just give it greater weight than saying that 'if all your friends buy this we'll figure out the rest,'” adds Merkin.That’s why he sees Q going the OneCoin way. “I see Q Initiative going the way of OneCoin... Another MLM adjacent pipe dream with a different piper.” "

[+] (Photo by Murray Close/Getty Images)","Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies need regulation to bring them out of the ""wild west,"" according to the UK's Treasury Committee, which has oversight over the country's spending, as well as regulation of the financial sector.The influential group of MPs argue that, at a minimum, regulation should be introduced to add consumer protection and counter money laundering.“Bitcoin and other crypto-assets exist in the wild west industry of crypto-assets. This unregulated industry leaves investors facing numerous risks,” Member of Parliament (MP) Nicky Morgan, the chair of the committee, said.“Given the high price volatility, the hacking vulnerability of exchanges and the potential role in money laundering, the Treasury committee strongly believes that regulation should be introduced.”To do this the financial watchdog recommended placing the bitcoin and cryptocurrency industry under the supervision of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) — which looks after the country's banks.Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and crypto-fundraising schemes known as initial coin offerings (ICOs) are however a difficult thing to regulate unless you want them to become no different from the existing financial industry that many think they could one day replace.Too much regulation and bitcoin and cryptocurrencies lose their anonymity, their decentralization, and their peer-to-peer nature that make them attractive.Meanwhile, the UK government has recently said it also wants to try to bring the internet as a whole out of the ""wild west"" — with new laws being proposed in May.At the time the UK's home secretary, Sajid Javid, said: “Criminals are using the internet to further their exploitation and abuse of children while terrorists are abusing these platforms to recruit people and incite atrocities. We need to protect our communities from these heinous crimes and vile propaganda, and that is why this government has been taking the lead on this issue.""If the internet, which has had some three decades of mainstream use, dominated by the world's biggest global companies, remains a criminal wild west, what hope does the UK's FCA have of bringing bitcoin out of the wilds?Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have emerged as a way for people to subvert tight capital controls, for neo-nazis to move cash around the world, and (of course) for people to buy illegal drugs online.The internet has proven remarkably astute at evading regulation — and bitcoin, as well as the wider cryptocurrency sector, will be no different.Rather unhelpfully, regulators’ attitudes to blockchain and cryptocurrencies around the world vary wildly.In Asia, South Korea and China have cracked down on their bitcoin and cryptocurrency industries while in Europe France, Switzerland, Malta, and Gibraltar want to outline rules to tempt fintech businesses. The U.S. continues to keep bitcoin and cryptocurrencies at arm's length.The Treasury Committee report found that ""proportionate regulation could see the UK as well placed to become a global center for crypto-assets.""If bitcoin and cryptocurrency want to remain decentralized, governed only by a public blockchain, this kind of regulation will ultimately fail."

Now a new report shows that if Bitcoin is implemented at similar rates as other emerging technologies, it alone could generate enough carbon dioxide to push the planet beyond 2°C of warming by as soon as 2033. Given the global consensus that a temperature rise of above 1.5°C would lead to catastrophic effects on the environment this new statistic is deeply disturbing and worth all of us involved in, or rooting for, the crypto industry to consider our options. Many crypto and blockchain-based companies are looking to the technology to help solve social and environmental issues of our time, such as sustainable supply chains and decarbonizing and democratizing energy systems. That said, the exponential energy consumption and carbon emissions produced from the proof-of-work algorithm required for mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is directly at odds with this vision for the technology. So what, as an industry, can we do about it?Improving Efficiencies Of The Bitcoin ProtocolThe proof-of-work algorithm is an elegant solution. The very fact that it’s costly in terms of the computing power ‘work’ required to operate is what makes it unbreakable. One obvious solution to the issue of energy consumption then is to keep improving this existing protocol through further efficiencies. And everyday innovators are flocking to this new technology doing just that. The recent Lightning Network update, for example, allows a combination of off-chain and on-chain transactions which improves overall efficiency of the Bitcoin platform. Advances in computer chips are also continually improving the efficiency of computation relative to power. However Bitcoin’s core algorithm means that as long as there is money to be made, miners will continue to consume more power, and if the technology continues to expand and grow as we expect, these small concessions will certainly not be enough to save the industry from exorbitant energy usage. Developing Alternative Protocols As touched on above, what makes Bitcoin such an energy-intensive currency is the proof-of-work mining process required to mint new coins. Proof-of-work is competitive by nature, and the incentive model pushes miners to use as much processing power as possible. The more power you use, the faster you can solve the transaction encryptions and receive your reward. The benefit of this process means it’s extremely difficult to manipulate the blockchain, but the side effect is the increasingly complex computing power required to solve the algorithm in order to be rewarded with the newly-minted Bitcoin. As a result Bitcoin mining has become a competitive and profitable business and we are seeing large-scale mining warehouses, with more and more powerful computers, emerging daily in the hopes of profiting from this market. This exponential growth in computer power is guzzling energy at alarming rates. Though difficult to find consensus on the exact figures, one source estimates that miners use around 29.05TWh of electricity annually.  That’s roughly 0.13% of the world’s annual energy consumption. Another estimates it's closer to 73TWh per year.But other cryptocurrencies and blockchain platforms have been experimenting with alternative protocols with much lower energy consumption. Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin are currently in the process of transitioning from proof-of-work algorithm to a proof-of-stake algorithm called Casper, which will ideally eliminate the energy-consuming process of mining, while still securely recording transactions to the blockchain. In theory, proof-of-stake does not offer rewards in the same way proof of work does, only transaction fees. It's not a race to the finish like proof-of-work. There are a number of different versions of proof-of-stake being developed by different platforms but none have fully proven themselves yet and Ethereum have delayed their launch of  Casper. These signs are perhaps an indication that this transition to proof-of-stake is no small feat for the sector. But the fact that some of the brightest minds in the industry have realized its importance and are actively working on these algorithms offers positive signs for the future. EOS is a cryptocurrency and blockchain platform designed using a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) algorithm. With the DPOS system every wallet that contains coins can vote for representatives. These representatives validate transactions, form consensus and are paid for their efforts through the system. EOS  is the fifth largest cryptocurrency and many believe it could lead the way in alternatives to proof-of-work.   Choosing Renewables Over Fossil Fuel Sources Nearly three-quarters of Bitcoin mining currently occurs in China. Companies have flocked there for access to cheap energy, the majority of which is powered by coal-fired power plants. But if the industry is to curb its carbon emissions this pattern needs to change. The good news is there are other options. For example, there is also a trend for mining facilities to gravitate to sources of hydro-electricity, another relatively cheap energy option but one that is renewable. We’ve seen this occurring in hydro power-rich Quebec. In fact so many miners have lined up to open mining operations there that the power utility put a temporary moratorium on new applications, asking the energy board for guidance on how to proceed. Pumped-hydro plant in Austria. Photographer: Akos Stiller/BloombergThere are a number of crypto-mining companies proactively setting up farms fueled by renewables around the world. HydroMiner currently run two highly profitable eco-friendly cryptocurrency mining farms in the Austrian alps in Europe that use hydropower stations to fuel their hardware. Whilst in Morocco a  37,000-acre wind-farm site has been acquired by Soluna in order to generate wind power to mine bitcoins. If clean, renewable energy is going to be adopted by miners, rates for renewables will have to be competitive with the price of non-renewable energy. Although the price of renewables is dropping every year, to stack up commercially, mining kits need to operate around the clock and so low-cost storage is essential but a few years away.In another possible twist to this story these miners searching the world for cheap energy might inadvertently become the biggest investors in clean energy generation. Lack of data and the emergent nature of the industry makes it challenging to accurately predict energy usage into the future, but studies such as those released this week and the ongoing work of people like Dutch economist Alex de Vries are helping us understand the (unintended) consequences of this burgeoning technology. It’s critical we pay attention and continue to innovate to find solutions to ensure blockchain and crypto are contributing to the decarbonization of our economy, not accelerating the problem. "

[+] Canada, on Thursday, July 26, 2018. Photographer: James MacDonald/Bloomberg","Bitcoin could be significantly impacted by an election for perhaps the first time ever today as Québec voters go to the polls in the French-Canadian province's parliamentary elections.The general elections are the province's first since tensions arose earlier this year over how electricity should best be allocated for bitcoin mining.Bombarded with demand in early 2018 by miners from China and elsewhere, the provincial government - headed by the Parti Liberal du Québec - quickly applied heavy brakes to the nascent mining industry by ordering Hydro-Québec, the state-owned electric utility, to restrict the sale of power and charge higher tariffs to customers in the blockchain industry.  The government pointed to grid capacity and economic development concerns to publicly justify its actions, but that explanation didn’t resonate well among many in the local industry who saw the move as a political crackdown that has chased away investment and innovation.“These measures immediately damaged numerous mining operations in Quebec and deterred investors who went elsewhere,” François Remy, a former columnist at Les Affaires, a Montreal business newspaper, told Forbes. “The crypto community is really not happy about that.” “The Québec Bitcoin eldorado is dead,” Francis Pouliot, a voice in the Montreal cryptocurrency scene, tweeted in June. But the incumbent Liberal government is at risk of being ousted in today’s elections by Coalition Avenir Québec, an upstart center-right, pro-business party that is focused on luring private sector jobs and investment to the province. The CAQ has been the frontrunners for most of the past year and holds a small advantage in preliminary polling going into Monday's elections.While neither the Liberals, CAQ nor the separatist Parti Québécois, which is expected to place third, have taken an official stance on bitcoin mining, many locals regard CAQ’s platform as being, on the whole, friendlier to the blockchain industry. Thus, a CAQ victory could provide a fresh boost for cryptocurrency mining in the province should the new government loosen or undo the electricity sale restrictions placed on Hydro-Québec.“The (Liberal) government is about to lose the elections, and the other political parties, like Parti Québécois and CAQ seem more opened to blockchain,” said Remy, adding: “They want to attract these companies, to support them and use cheap electricity and cold climate as a competitive advantage for the Québec economy.”Wild RideQuébec became a magnetic attraction for cryptocurrency miners in late 2017 and early 2018 as the outlook in places like China became hazier. The province’s surplus of cheap hydroelectricity, cold weather and political stability, combined with its aggressive efforts to entice large electricity consumers, such as data centers, to invest locally made it an appealing destination for those looking to set up commercial bitcoin mining operations. Hydro-Québec was soon overwhelmed by demand from prospective miners. “The phone has been ringing off the hook,” CEO Eric Martel told Bloomberg in February. Reportedly receiving dozens of requests per day, the utility began signalling to potential customers that it would not be able to fulfill all of the connection requests. Coupled with the downturn in crypto markets, the question of how to address bitcoin mining reached the highest levels of the provincial government in March, when Premier Philippe Couillard articulated that he viewed mining in and of itself as a non-value-added activity:“If you want to come settle here, plug in your servers and do bitcoin mining, we're not really interested.”In May, an economic impact study commissioned by Hydro-Québec found that the amount of jobs created per megawatt by crypto miners is significantly less than for other types of large electricity customers, such as data centers. Nevertheless, post-industrial towns like Thetford Mines, where the last asbestos mines permanently closed in 2012, see bitcoin mining as a potential onramp to the new economy and as a way of re-purposing old traditional mining infrastructure.  ""We have 15 football fields of available buildings. We're really interested for (cryptocurrency) mining companies to get in touch with us,"" said Vicky Lachance of the Thetford Region Economic Development Corporation, who noted that she's been in conversations with upwards of a dozen interested parties. The Québec government moved to throttle the new industry altogether on June 7, when Energy Minister Pierre Moreau declared a moratorium on all new mining projects and ordered the matter to be referred to the Régie de l'énergie, an independent tribunal tasked with setting electricity tariffs for commercial customers, for further determination.Hydro-Québec then submitted a proposal to the Régie to create a 500MW pool of electricity to be made available to blockchain customers. This pool would then be auctioned off to applicants selected based on the tariff they are willing to pay and the number of jobs they commit to creating. The tribunal is slated to hold a new round of hearings on the matter in early November. Competing NarrativesThe Liberal government and Hydro-Québec have insisted that their motives for clamping down on the mining industry have primarily been over capacity concerns - namely, that if it were to give a connection to every applicant, the province’s electricity surplus would be exhausted. The utility initially claimed to have received requests totaling 18,000MW worth of power, roughly 40 percent of its total capacity, from some 300 interested parties. Among these requests was an enormous 2,000MW request that was widely believed to have come from Bitmain, the Chinese mining and hardware giant. For context, Hydro-Québec supplies the Bell Centre arena, home of the Montreal Canadiens ice hockey team, with a five megawatt connection. Specifically, the concern is that a “heritage pool” of 1,500MW of cheap, unused electricity that is made available to attract private sector investment could be completely exhausted by the mining requests. Should that threshold be surpassed, the additional electricity must, by law, be purchased on the open market at prices higher than those offered by Hydro-Québec. These costs would then be passed along to households and small business customers in the form of higher tariffs, which would be especially unpopular during Québec's frigid winters.  A similar situation occurred recently in Plattsburgh, NY, which is located just south of the Québec-New York border. The town ultimately banned bitcoin mining last spring because of the stress it had inflicted on the local utility - resulting in outrage among the populace as their electricity bills began to increase. Other municipalities across North America are grappling with similar issues. “We at Hydro-Québec are interested by the business perspective of Blockchain,” a Hydro-Québec spokesman told Forbes. “However, given the massive interest for our clean and reliable hydroelectricity we have decided to proceed in a fashion that maximizes economic spinoffs for Québec and revenue for Hydro-Québec—in turn, pushing electricity rates down for customers.”But many local observers reckon that the official story doesn’t add up. They argue that the move to throttle the industry doesn’t make sense given Hydro-Québec’s stated goal of doubling its revenues to $27B by 2030, with data centers and cryptocurrency mining clients ostensibly serving as core customer segments. “This position was divergent from the utility’s previous efforts to attract companies using large amounts of electricity, such as cloud technology giants or bitcoin miners,” said Remy. “Québec seems to have succumbed to the purely speculative impression of digital currencies portrayed by the general media and traditional economists.”Critics blame this contradictory position on interference by the Liberal government, reckoning that Hydro-Québec had been aggressively courting large miners from China and elsewhere before the government forced it to reverse course. ""Hydro-Québec now denies it, but they were seducing world-wide and local mining operations with the 'cheapest rates' in North America until February of this year,"" said Jonathan Bertrand, who runs a mining operation outside of Montreal.Jonathan Hamel of Montreal-based Académie Bitcoin says the situation exhibits all the classic signs of political cronyism:“There's a wide consensus both within the blockchain community and also from Hydro-Québec insiders that the mess we’ve seen since February was entirely based on political directives from the Liberal government.”Tensions between Hydro-Québec and the Liberals flared up again over the summer when Martel, a former executive at aerospace manufacturer Bombardier, became embroiled in a public dispute with Moreau over a proposed wind farm project in northern Quebec. First announced in 2015, the project has been heavily promoted by the Liberals despite Martel’s insistence that, should it proceed, Hydro-Québec would incur losses of between $1.5B and $2B over the 25 year life of the contract.     Others in the local mining industry accused the Liberal government of pressuring Hydro-Québec to exaggerate the amount of demand it was receiving to justify turning away smaller entities in favor of cozying up to foreign giants like Bitmain. They argued that the 18,000MW figure, as well as the monster 2,000MW proposal, are highly dubious and would dwarf the total amount of the energy currently consumed by the bitcoin network globally. In June, Hydro-Québec reduced its original 18,000MW estimate by two-thirds, attributing the revision to the drop in bitcoin prices, which would have likely deterred less serious potential clients.""I think we can easily say that there are 5,000 (to) 6,000 really solid megawatts (worth of mining demand),"" Rémi Dubois, director of large power customers at Hydro-Québec, testified at a June 26th hearing before the Régie.As for the less serious potential customers, he explained: ""We didn’t approach those people again.""""We didn’t get back in touch with them, given the moratorium we had set, but we expect that some of them might have decided to abandon their project. Others might have decided to go elsewhere, given the time limit we set.”Documentation submitted by Hydro-Québec to the Régie asserted that the utility was in discussions with 27 serious projects accounting for 6,500MW of electricity. However, just four of those projects made up 4,000MW of the total demand - including the 2,000MW proposal believed to be Bitmain. It's unclear if these projects remain interested or have since abandoned Québec for other locations. Bitmain announced in August that is building a 500MW mining operation in Texas. Its recent IPO application states that it has other facilities under construction in Washington state and Tennessee, and that it is ""contemplating"" setting up an operation in Québec to take advantage of the cheap hydroelectricity.""In the end, this crisis is not because of Bitmain, but because of our local public institutions that, once again, cannot accurately predict business transformation and try to centrally manage everything very slowly while the world around them moves at staggering speeds,"" said Bertrand.Seeing Québec's window of opportunity to be a global blockchain hub potentially closing, locals in the crypto industry are now eyeing a CAQ victory in today’s contest as a catalyst to easing restrictions and springboarding further development of the local industry. “It's not a secret that the blockchain industry is actively looking forward to a Liberal defeat in the upcoming election,” said Hamel. While CAQ has not taken a stance on mining in its official platform, its leader François Legault brings a pro-business, pro-growth acumen to the political arena that the province has not seen in recent decades.""CAQ has shown some support to bitcoin miners during the summer while we were stuck under the moratorium on energy sales,"" said Bertrand, adding:""That said, us bitcoiners tend to be a little skeptical of the political class.""For the last half century, elections in the province have primarily revolved around the single issue of whether to secede and become an independent country or to remain part of Canada. However, the separatist momentum has lost steam in recent years, and Québec political discourse has since reverted back to the standard Left-Right spectrum seen in the rest of the Western world.“Legault has been really open about saying one of his biggest priorities as premier will be encouraging private sector investment in the province,” said Carl Vallée of Hatley Strategy Advisors in Montreal, noting that Legault is specifically focused on creating jobs, raising standards of living and making Québec more wealthy vis-a-vis the rest of Canada, adding:“He wants to be an ‘economic premier.’ You could say that Québec will be ‘open for business.’”Perhaps most encouraging for the mining industry is that Legault is pressing for Hydro-Québec to export more electricity. “There’s definitely a will from Legault to fulfill Hydro-Québec’s potential and perhaps make it even more profitable than it is right now,” said Vallée, who previously served as press secretary to former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper.Neither the CAQ nor the Liberals responded to requests for comment about their respective positions on bitcoin mining.Playing the long gamePierre-Luc Quimper, president and founder of Bitfarms - which has set up several large bitcoin mining operations in southern Quebec - is taking a more measured approach to the elections. He explained that while all the political parties on the ballot have expressed an interest in his company and blockchain more generally, he is still waiting to see which one emerges as a champion of the industry:“The Coalition Avenir Québec, the Parti Libéral du Québec and the Parti Québécois have all publicly expressed support for blockchain innovation, but so far there has not been a comprehensive policy that will help blockchain innovation.”Bitfarms claims to have already invested more than $20M into Québec, and it currently uses 27.5MW of electricity and employs 90 workers across its facilities. It has new mining projects in its pipeline totaling 135MW, though these have been sidelined because of the moratorium. It also has a research partnership in the works with a local university, is developing a locally-based mining pool and is working to build out other non-mining blockchain applications.Quimper says that he is proactively communicating to all of Québec's political parties that there is a unique window of opportunity for the province to emerge as a global blockchain leader, much as it has successfully done for other industries such as artificial intelligence and video gaming, but also that there is a “sense of emergency” that this window could be closing quickly.“It’s crucial that the new government keep the hydroelectricity prices at a competitive rate and talk to Québec blockchain companies in order to establish a comprehensive framework for blockchain technology,” he said. If that doesn’t happen, there's nothing to prevent miners and innovators from packing up and moving on. “If Québec is not proactive, blockchain innovation can happen elsewhere on the planet.”Lachance of Thetford Mines concurred:""It’s a technology revolution and we have to position ourselves in a way that will not limit the progress of these companies. It has to be a very thoughtful process.""Note: some statements in this article have been translated from French"

[+] 2017.Earlier this year research revealed the majority of the world's cryptocurrency exchanges are based in the UK, but the vast amount of volume flows through the small island of Malta.While Malta dominates when it comes to volumes, the UK is home to the largest number of exchanges — although the country accounts for just 1% of global trading volumes, Morgan Stanley research showed.Cryptocurrency exchanges have in recent years come under increasing scrutiny from regulators worldwide as more and more money as flowed into the sector — and the UK is no different.The UK is home to more bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges than anywhere else in the world.Last week a group of influential UK politicians called for the government to regulate what they called the ""wild west” cryptocurrency industry, pointing to concerns around money-laundering, price manipulation and high risk of losses for investors.They called for, at a minimum, regulation to be introduced to add consumer protection and counter money laundering and recommended placing the bitcoin and cryptocurrency industry under the supervision of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) — which looks after the country's banks.“Gemini continues to explore potential jurisdictions around the globe to provide a best-in-class digital asset exchange and custodian which will enable growth and infrastructure to the entire digital asset community,” Gemini said in a statement to the Financial Times.“Although we have no immediate plans, we … will always evaluate opportunities that allow the global economy to buy, sell, and store digital assets in a regulated, secure and compliant manner.”"

More than 2.3 million people are estimated to have already left the country with a population of only 31 million, and that number is expected to rise. Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro’s socialist government is trending towards solidifying its authoritarian rule as the country reaches a diaspora level rivaling the ongoing Syrian crisis that led to the widespread migration of Syrians to Europe.  Fueled by massive hyperinflation that has surpassed 2 million percent, as of August 2018, Venezuela’s Bolivar has effectively become worthless. Crippling foreign exchange controls imposed by the government have further restricted citizens’ access to foreign currencies as a stable source of value. An emerging market for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has developed over the last few years in Venezuela, representing a profound case study of Bitcoin’s potential positive impact on the struggling Venezuelan people.The interest in Bitcoin in Venezuela initially began with the opportunity for mining it a few years ago. Due to the largely subsidized electricity market in Venezuela, electricity is practically free, so the costs of mining Bitcoin are drastically reduced. However, the Venezuelan government often cracked down on mining operations, sometimes arresting and holding individuals without cause.With the depreciation of the Bolivar continuing to accelerate at an unprecedented pace, Bitcoin still represents a more stable option for value storage than the Bolivar despite being down nearly 70 percent from its all-time high. This is solely due to the sheer magnitude of the Venezuelan Bolivar’s increasing hyperinflation compared to Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a fixed total supply of 21 million bitcoins and uses a deflationary model for introducing bitcoins into the network through an algorithmically maintained mining reward system. As such, it is not susceptible to inflation. Venezuelans have begun to turn to Bitcoin for other reasons too.  “We have forged several partnerships with Venezuelan nationals, to aid in capital flight and wealth preservation for victims of this regime"" Says Galiano Tiramani, CEO of U.S Based Tirex Trading, ""Lately, we have seen dramatically increased interest from those using bitcoin not only to store value, but as a means to move it out of the country.”As long as Venezuelans have an Internet connection, they can send Bitcoin across its network freely outside of the control of the oppressive Maduro regime. Access for citizens to exchanging Bolivars for USD is nearly impossible with only a fraction of citizens able to trade more than a few hundred USD worth of Bolivars per year. Further, the Bolivar is currently the worst-performing world currency against the USD this year, and the problem has been compounded by the government’s withholding US Dollars from importers, causing a dangerous shortage of basic commoditiesMetrics provided by CoinDance offer some excellent insights into the rates of growth and popularity of Bitcoin in peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplaces. Unlike exchanges that charge low or no fees, data on CoinDance from P2P exchange LocalBitcoins indicates legitimately high volumes due to the higher fees and lack of wash trading or limited day trading.According to CoinDance, weekly LocalBitcoins volumes in the Venezuelan Bolivar have gone parabolic since the end of March earlier this year. “Skirting government imposed regulation is one of the most important use cases for Bitcoin. This is a censorship resistant technology, specifically designed to survive attacks from centralized powers,"" Continues Galiano Tiramani, ""It's great that we can help people being victimized by another socialist failure, but it's a tricky situation. Although US sanctions are not yet prohibiting dealings with an average Venezuelan citizen, we tread carefully because US companies are barred from dealing with specially designated Venezuelan nationals.”The same pattern with Venezuelans exchanging the Bolivar for Bitcoin is mirrored in Argentina, where their own economic crisis and hyperinflation is emerging. The Argentine Peso is currently the second-worst performing currency versus the USD this year, behind the Bolivar. According to CoinDance, Argentina’s exchange of the Argentine Peso for Bitcoin has also exponentially risen, even accelerating to new highs over the last month. The situations in both Argentina and Venezuela demonstrate the potential of Bitcoin as a stable store of value outside of the influence of governments, particularly oppressive regimes. No limits on when and where you can send funds also contribute to the rapid increase in the volume of exchanging the Bolivar and Peso for BTC.Other cryptocurrencies and their communities have taken notice of the crisis in Venezuela and have offered their support. Nano, a fast and flexible cryptocurrency payment network,  started a Venezuelan outreach center and has been highlighting the problem to their users through their blog. For Venezuelan’s, the situation is desperate and Bitcoin offers one of the few opportunities to salvage any sort of real value from a collapsed economy. As the consequences of devaluation and subsequent hyperinflation continue to unfold at national levels, evaluating how Bitcoin and associated cryptocurrency initiatives participate as solutions will provide a valuable metric for Bitcoin’s potential.That said, cryptocurrencies also fluctuate and are very unstable, so they still can't be relied on completely. "

fever that engulfed Bitcoin near the end of last year, when the price ...","Oct 10, 2018,10:42am EDT",(AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews),"As most market observers have noted Canadian cannabis producer Tilray, is in the midst of a wild ride. After debuting at $17 in July, shares zipped past the $200 mark at one point in September, making the five-year-old company more valuable than CBS and American Airlines. Tilray has since retreated, but it’s still plagued by wild bouts of volatility, routinely experiencing double-digit, single-session swings.There are a few simple reasons for this. Because there are only a few publicly traded cannabis companies in the U.S., direct marijuana investments are limited. Making matters worse is that the company released a relatively small number of shares during its IPO. Also, with Canada set to legalize cannabis nationwide next week, it has set off a frenzy of interest among investors.Combined, these factors have led to speculation and made the stock prone to wild price swings. As a result, some have compared Tilray and other companies like it to the fever that engulfed Bitcoin near the end of last year, when the price flirted with $20,000 before plummeting more than 60% in a matter of weeks.After all, both segments are mysterious and deeply misunderstood, and because some got badly burned by the Bitcoin bubble, the conventional wisdom in some circles is that the same will happen to marijuana investors. However, when you take a closer look, it starts to become clear that Bitcoin and cannabis stocks have very little in common.The biggest difference is that the demand for Bitcoin is hypervariable, clouded by the fact that it’s not entirely clear whether it will ever become an accepted medium of exchange. For this reason, it’s realistic to think that Bitcoin could act as a safe haven during times of broader market unrest, but otherwise have a difficult time gaining broader acceptance – which, in part, is why it crashed.Marijuana, by contrast, has an established and robust market. As of 2015, an estimated 9.5% of adults used marijuana, almost double the rate of a decade before. That number is likely even higher today given the shifting legal landscape and softening public opinion.In all, the legal marijuana market in the U.S. is expected to near $150 billion by 2025, according to one study. But even that could be underselling the potential upside, since there is a burgeoning segment of the market that even some experts didn’t fully appreciate only a short time ago: cannabidiols (CBDs), a non-psychoactive component of hemp and marijuana plants that is increasingly being infused into drinks, as well as therapeutic oils and lotions.So, when you think about the volatility that has beset Tilray in recent months, don’t consider it a condemnation of the investment potential of the entire marijuana industry. Instead, it’s more of a reflection of the unique dynamics hovering over one company. Truthfully, Tilray is, at best, wildly overvalued and, at worst, highly manipulated, liable to take a huge dip as soon as the IPO lockup period expires and company insiders are able to unload their holdings.That doesn’t mean there aren’t opportunities in this area. Cronos is a vertically integrated cannabis producer that has a healthy medical marijuana business. Based in Canada, the company has soared this year.Meanwhile, marijuana retailer MedMen has locations in 19 states, including a recent expansion in Illinois and Arizona, and just received an injection of $57 million in financing from a Toronto private equity firm. Its stores, sometimes dubbed the Apple Store of weed because of their minimalist feel, are based in some of the hottest cannabis markets in the U.S., including Florida, New York and Nevada.Also, consider Constellation Brands, the largest beer importer in the world, which last month plunged $4 billion into Canopy Growth, a medical marijuana company, in an attempt to gain an advantage in the cannabis-infused drink market. Aurora Cannabis, meanwhile, is another interesting alternative, having made a series of investments across the broader cannabis market, so much so that some call it the Berkshire Hathaway of pot. The fast-growing company filed an application late last week to list on the New York Stock Exchange.Still, this sector of the market is both very young and increasingly volatile, and while all of the above companies have huge growth potential, not each one will prosper. The rewards could be high, but so are the risks, making pot perhaps the ultimate caveat emptor investment opportunity that exists today.Ross Gerber is CEO and president of Santa Monica, Calif-based Gerber Kawasaki Inc., a SEC-registered investment advisor with approximately $840 million in assets under management as of 9/30/18. Gerber Kawasaki clients, firm and employees own positions in Cronos, Tilray, Aurora Cannabis, Constellation Brands, Canopy Growth Corp. and MedMen.

help the money-transfer giant directly connect to customer bank ...","Editors' Pick|Sep 26, 2018,09:00am EDT","Veem CEO Marwan Forzely in Times Square, New York City on September 25, 2018.","Marwan Forzely has come a long way since his days at Western Union. The serial entrepreneur, who sold his previous company to Western Union to help the money-transfer giant directly connect to customer bank accounts, has raised $25 million to cut intermediary banks out of the payment process altogether.Instead of relying on a series of correspondents to move money between different jurisdictions around the world, Marwan’s latest venture, Veem, uses bitcoin to directly connect its clients’ bank accounts with suppliers and customers.While neither counterparty is required to directly hold bitcoin, and an algorithm automatically routes transactions along the most efficient payment rails, more than half the transactions processed by Veem rely on the cryptocurrency as a replacement for correspondents.Led by banking giant Goldman Sachs, with GV (formerly Google Ventures), Kleiner Perkins, Silicon Valley Bank, Trend Forward Capital, and Pantera Capital also participating, the investment in enterprise-payments startup Veem is primarily a move to accelerate the firm’s exponential growth.Central to the investors’ interest in Veem is the built-in stickiness of the model, which has proved to be adept at turning recipients of Veem payments into Veem users. Since the San Francisco-based company raised its first round of venture capital in May 2015, it has grown from a mere 590 customers to more than 80,000 today. As the price of bitcoin hovers around $6,500, compared with $300 when Veem raised its first round, the company is helping blaze the trail for next-generation bitcoin startups that give customers access to bitcoin’s speed and traceability without their even knowing it.“What’s important about this round is the acknowledgement of the size of the opportunity, the size of the market, the size of the pain point that we’re solving for,” said Forzley. “And it’s an endorsement of the growth that we’re experiencing.”This latest strategic investment follows on a $24 million Series B raised in March 2017 and brings the total amount raised to $69.3 million. Lead investor Goldman Sachs made the strategic investment via its Principal Strategic Investment Group, which has been increasingly active in the blockchain space. As part of the investment, Goldman Sachs managing director Rana Yared will join Veem as a nonvoting board observer.While Veem is not disclosing the terms of the investment or the valuation, Marwan says revenue has grown four times since the same time last year. Nondisclosure agreements prevent Veem from sharing a specific breakdown of the revenue sources, but according to Marwan a significant percentage of the company’s revenue comes from integration with online accounting services like Quickbooks, Xero and Netsuite.To maintain the exponential growth that has seen the company increase its customer base by 13,000% over the past three years, Veem has opted to focus spending from this latest round on building out new partner integrations. Meanwhile, the onboarding process itself will rely on increased automation, including built-in anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer compliance.Increasingly, Goldman Sachs’ Principal Strategic Investment Group is strategically backing blockchain companies that have the potential to improve service for the bank’s clients, including enterprise software developer Digital Asset Holdings, payments startup Circle and infrastructure provider Axoni. But fellow Veem investor GV—with Google parent company Alphabet as the sole limited partner—has a much more profit-driven motive. With investments including commodities trader LedgerX and central bank alternative Basis, GV general partner Karim Faris believes Veem could be the first bitcoin startup to go public.“We’re not a strategic investor,” said Faris, who also sits on Veem’s board of directors. “It’s definitely not a strategic thing. It’s an opportunity to create a stand-alone company and in the process make a financial return on a good exit or an IPO down the line.”While Forzley has so far remained quiet about the possibility of going public, this wouldn’t be his first time with an exit for a payments startup. Shortly after obtaining a bachelor's degree in computer science from the University of Ottawa, Forzley developed an interest in financial payments, eventually founding early online payments startup eBillme. In October 2011 Western Union bought eBillme for an undisclosed amount and Forzely joined as general manager in charge of strategic partnerships, helping to integrate his technology into Western Union for what would eventually be called WuPay. The reason for his career-long interest in payments is simple:“Whatever you do in life, at the end of the day there’s a payment,” said Forzley. “Payment technology is at the core of what people do and their livelihood.” If that early experiment with payments focused on making debit cards unnecessary, Veem is significantly more ambitious in targeting the massive correspondent banking industry. To give an idea of how big the industry really is, a 2017 report from the Financial Stability Board that looks at the resilience of financial infrastructures found that there were 470,000 correspondents using the Swift bank messaging platform alone. Since 2011 however, that number has dropped by 8%, perhaps as a result correspondent mergers, lost licenses or the movement of business to Swift competitors, according to the report.This graphic from a 2017 Financial Stability Board report shows that even as the total number of ... [+] correspondents decreases on the Swift platform, the total transaction volume is getting higher.Ironically though, even as correspondent banks face increasing competition, Swift has seen an increase in total transactions, according to the same report. Vying for that ever growing market are startups like Nairobi-based BitPesa and Veem, which seek to cut out those middlemen by replacing them with a mix of faster, more transparent bitcoin and other alternatives.“When you reconfigure the way money moves, when you use it with a different infrastructure, you simplify the cost structure and you turn money back to the business owner, the end user,” said Forzley."

million customers send money to Africa using the bitcoin blockchain.","Sep 24, 2018,09:00am EDT",A lion with modern city skyline in the background,"The Japanese money transfer giant SBI Remit is now letting nearly half a million customers send money to Africa using the bitcoin blockchain.Designed to be a faster, more reliable way to send money to Africa’s often overlooked markets, the new treasury management services are being provided by venture-backed firm BitPesa, which has raised $10 million from Greycroft Partners and others to turn the bitcoin blockchain into an enterprise payment rail.Instead of relying on a number of banks and other middlemen to move yen into U.S. dollars or euros and then out into African currencies such as the Nigerian naira or the Ghanaian cedi, the licensed BitPesa uses a combination of the bitcoin blockchain and other services to create new currency pairs.In addition to settling remittances in as little as one hour thanks to the bitcoin blockchain’s fast settlement times, SBI Remit director Nobuo Ando believes BitPesa’s multiple international licenses will help jump-start African commerce with Japan on a larger scale by adding a much-needed layer of trust and transparency.“Many companies are doing trade with African countries and they are suffering from the high cost and the slow speed and not very precise administration,” Ando says. “So this is the market that we would like to go in, together with Bitpesa.”The partnership aims to use BitPesa’s custom treasury tools sitting on top of the bitcoin blockchain to provide liquidity for small- and medium-size businesses. Specifically, the partnership follows a path laid out by BitPesa in targeting cosmetics companies, electronics companies, and the lucrative used-car market between Japan and Africa.Further, the partnership enables direct currency pairs between Japanese yen and the fiat currencies of Ghana, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.Historically, individuals and businesses wishing to do business between Japan and the countries BitPesa serves had to move Japanese yen through multiple correspondent banks. Along the way the yen was frequently converted to more liquid intermediary currencies like the U.S. dollar or the euro, accruing fees at each step.The average remittance fees for this process can reach about 7% of the amount moved according to World Bank estimates, but the cost can also be much higher. By removing the correspondent banks and secondary currency exchanges from the process, Bitpesa is able to provide similar services for about 3% of the total transaction. To avoid fluctuations in the price of both fiat currency and bitcoin, BitPesa founder Elizabeth Rossiello says, the company’s treasury services are designed to insulate SBI's customers from risk on either side. “If it makes sense for us to settle using cryptocurrency or fiat currencies, then we do,” she said. “And in this case, we’re happy that SBI feels the same way, so we’re open to using digital or fiat currencies to settle between us.”While the partnership marks the first time SBI has used bitcoin to serve its customers in Africa, this is neither its first push into the continent nor its first partnership with a blockchain company.Founded in 2010 as part of a spinoff from fintech giant Softbank, SBI Remit has 450,000 customers, 90% of which are foreigners sending money outside of Japan’s borders. In total, the SBI Holdings subsidiary has sent 500 billion yen abroad as of September 2018, much of which went to Africa using traditional payment rails.But in May 2016, SBI Holdings began to explore using alternative methods of payment. The company partnered with San Francisco-based Ripple to launch SBI Ripple Asia, a subsidiary that targets banks in the region looking for faster, cheaper ways to move money. SBI Ripple Asia is now exploring how both non-blockchain solutions and the XRP cryptocurrency might bring near-real-time remittances to Thailand.Then, in January 2018, SBI Investing launched a blockchain and artificial intelligence fund with 50 billion yen (about $444 million at today’s exchange rate) to invest in startups over the next ten years. According to documents provided to Forbes, parent company SBI Group has invested in 20 digital asset companies including Veem, bitFlyer, Templum, R3, coolBitX and its own cryptocurrency exchange, SBI Virtual Currencies, with more in the works. “We are planning to expand some blockchain solutions for international remittance,” said Ando.In Africa alone the room to expand is significant, according to Rossiello, who is among the earliest founders to launch a bitcoin company, having established BitPesa in 2013 when bitcoin was trading between around $100 and $1,000. Bitcoin currently trades for about $6,400.While the remittances market in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to grow 7% this year, to $41 billion, the continent represents just 6.4% of the $642 billion global remittance market, according to World Bank numbers. But with relatively little competition for African business, Rossiello is confident her company can use the lower costs of the bitcoin blockchain to help catalyze commerce between Africa and the rest of the world.In addition to serving eight African nations, the firm has a license from the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the European Union, to help create the unusual currency pairs that previously required costly transitional currency exchanges.While BitPesa already employs 70 people and last month conducted $35 million in transactions, it is poised to penetrate even deeper into the African markets with four pending license applications. Also helping with that process, Rossiello is working with the Japanese government’s Japan External Trade Organization  (JETRO) to deepen the ties between the yen and African fiat currencies.“Unlike a bank,” said Rossiello, “which might not be incentivized to become a magnet for liquidity in specific currency pairs, they might make a lot more money just trading their one currency against the dollar or euro, we are incentivized, it’s our core business and our core focus.”"

Bitcoin has a long history of large losses followed by even higher prices.  I’m in this for the long haul, so who cares.  (This is the second most common stage for HODLers).Anger.  By far the most common stage for HODLers.  Everyone is just stupid!  Can’t they see how revolutionary this is?  Why do they even let these ‘establishment’ idiots even comment on crypto!  Can’t everyone tell these people have no clue and are just protecting their own self-interest!  Just wait until Bitcoin hits $100,000, then these doubters will get what they deserve!Bargaining.  Just let the SEC approve ETFs!  I swear I will sell some the next time we get to $20,000.  I’ll be more careful next time and not so dogmatic in my approach.  Just let the ETFs sweep in a new wave of users and I promise I’ll sell some into that rally.Depression.  Did I get suckered into something stupid?  Why not just use credit cards?  I don’t have enough money to worry about all this.  Did I really think decentralized control was a good thing?  Do I have any clue how this really works?  What was I thinking?  How stupid was I?  How do I tell anyone I used student loans to buy this stuff? (No HODLer lasts in this stage for very long since it is contrarian to everything they believed).Acceptance.  It’s a great technology.  It will change the world, heck, it is changing the world.  It will just take longer than I expected.  I won’t hold all my savings in Bitcoin going forward, and I might even sell some on the way up, but I’m not giving up yet (at least not completely).This latest move should test the faith of many existing holders and create for some interesting discussions as we near the 1 year anniversary of the launch of Bitcoin Futures and that spike to $19,000."

The cryptocurrency being auctioned relates to forfeitures from various federal criminal, civil and administrative cases.This latest auction follows ones conducted by the agency at the start of 2018 (January 22) for 3,813 Bitcoins that were worth around $51.5 million at the time, and a subsequent Bitcoin auction on March 19. The latter was their seventh such auction to that point in time, which comprised around 2,170 Bitcoins, which were worth approximately $24 million at the cryptocurrency’s then market price on exchanges.The Marshals Service manages a wide variety of assets, including real estate, commercial businesses, cash, financial instruments, vehicles, jewelery, art, antiques, collectibles, vessels and aircraft. Specifically, they handle the distribution of proceeds and payments to victims of crime and other innocent third parties.As of September 30, 2017, the value of assets on hand was $1.8 billion within the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture Program, which was reported in a factsheet by the U.S. Marshals dated April 13, 2018. That figure was up from $1.5 billion as of September 2016. And, the amount distributed to victims of crime and claimants in fiscal 2017 was stated at $144.7 million, with $332.5 million shared with participating state and local law enforcement.The cryptocurrency (Bitcoins) being offered in this sealed bid auction, which derived from assets seized by the FBI and the U.S. government authorities amongst other parties (see list below), are in seven blocks and consist of Series A (six blocks of 100 Bitcoins) and Series B (one block of 60 Bitcoins).As well as a need to register a bidder’s interest, a deposit of $200,000, which is returnable to non-winning bidders, will also be required to participate. Failed bids will see the return of deposits immediately following the close of the Bitcoin transaction(s).Those participating in the auction, which will occur over a six-hour time period on November 5 between 8 am until 2 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST). They will not have the opportunity to view other bids or the opportunity to change their bid once submitted.Registration & RequirementsThose interested in participating in the auction process must firstly register by complete all necessary registration requirements as at noon EDT later this month on October 3. Bids will be accepted from pre-registered bidders via email only.One registration form allows a party to bid on multiple blocks from Series A and Series B at the same per Bitcoin price. However, it does not permit multiple bids to be submitted at differing per-bitcoin prices.Should potential investors wish to table multiple bids/prices on multiple blocks, they will need to submit additional registration forms and extra deposit funds (i.e. So, two differing bids/prices on different blocks will need $400,000 to be deposited, while three differing bids in a similar fashion will call for $600,000).The required registration items for this auction include the following, namely:Those wanting to participate must ensure they deliver the necessary registration items by email to USMSBitcoins@usdoj.gov. The USMS will then notify all bidders regarding their eligibility to participate in the auction by email no later than 5:00 PM EDT on Thursday, November 1, 2018.But should the USMS determine that a party is not an “eligible bidder”, then the deposit funds will be returned, and they will not be eligible to participate in the online auction.The deposit of the winning bidder will be retained by USMS and credited towards the purchase price. In the event that the winning bidder fails to close on the transaction through no fault of the USMS, the winning bidder will “irrevocably forfeit the deposit to the USMS.”The USMS will seek to notify the winning bidder(s) by 5:00 P.M.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File)","One of the beautiful aspects of Bitcoin is that the creator is still unknown. “Satoshi Nakamoto” is a pseudonym. I like it that way. Too often with big inventions in history, there are names attached that get an unjust share of the credit, often because their names appear on the patent records. This has created a false narrative of history. Think of all the mythmaking surrounding people like Eli Whitney, the Wright Brothers, and Thomas Edison. Awesome folks but their contributions have been wildly overrated compared with others working on the same projects at the same time. There is still controversy about precisely who was first in flight. For that matter, no one knows who invented the horseshoe that dramatically altered agricultural productivity for a thousand years. It's only since the invention of patent records, and the 19th-century cult of the inventor/genius, that we try to isolate the name behind the innovation. Bitcoin is different. Its technology was given to the world, eschewing both “intellectual property” and commercial paywalls. And that name! It’s so strange sounding and now legendary all the more so because no one knows precisely who it is. Some have even tried to claim to be The One, but such a claim seems disqualifying on its face. Satoshi appeared and then disappeared. I want to leave it that way forever.That said, articles seeking to prove the identity of his/her/they are impossible not to read. So I devoured one of the most comprehensive arguments I’ve read to date, appearing in a private newsletter called CounterMarkets, by programmer and writer Vin Armani. He makes a strong case that the real Satoshi is Hal Finney (1956-2014). Finney has long been on the short-list of would-be Satoshis. He was certainly there at the time, had shown a long interest in digital money, had ideological motivation, and had the technical skill. Armani writes: Hal Finney is unique among the group in that, at every step of Satoshi’s involvement with Bitcoin, “Hal was there.” Hal was on the cryptography mailing list where Satoshi posted both the white paper and the initial client software. Hal was a participant in both threads. No other “suspected Satoshi” participated in those threads. Hal was the first person other than Satoshi to run the Bitcoin client software. In other words, Hal was the first miner besides Satoshi. Hal was the first recipient of a Bitcoin transaction. In fact Satoshi didn’t even send a test transaction to himself before sending one to Hal…. Hal was the first contributor of code (including bug fixes in the first week) to the project Satoshi. Hal was the last individual Satoshi specifically responded to on the BitcoinTalk forum before he vanished. In my opinion, one of the most interesting times that “Hal was there” is the case of Crypto Twitter. Hal – and only Hal – was there at the beginning of Crypto Twitter.It’s starting to look pretty darn compelling right? Indeed. But this is the problem with this type of theorizing and why conspiracy theories of all sorts can become black holes. If you state your conclusion up front and then seek out the evidence, everything starts to look like proof. I recall when my old friend Joe Sobran was hot on the trail of the real identity of Shakespeare. He would invite me over to his house and go on for hours showing all his evidence that it was Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford. He made an incredibly convincing case. So I asked a genuine Shakespeare scholar who I trust, who put his hand on his forehead and shook his head, saying simply “That’s completely ridiculous. Shakespeare is Shakespeare.” Well, ok. Maybe we should do the same to these claims about Satoshi. Still, we can’t stop looking. On the point about the tweets, it is interesting that:On the evening of January 10th, 2009, Hal Finney took to Twitter and the word “bitcoin” entered that social network’s database for the first time. Hal proclaimed to the world, in a simple 2-word tweet, that he was “Running bitcoin.” Hal spoke about this moment in a sort of “farewell post” on the BitcoinTalk forums in 2013. “When Satoshi announced the first release of the software,” [he wrote] “I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test.”There were two additional tweets from Finney, and Armani makes the case that both reinforce the point. As to motive for Finney’s creation of a sockpuppet, it is rather obvious that the inventor of a new private money for the world, one that could in principle displace central banks and every government money-printing machine in the world, would want to remain anonymous. Further, as a second developer of PGP after Paul Zimmerman, Finney was there during the incredible controversy about this encryption software, how the US government tried to shut it down and how MIT bravely published the code in a book as a statement for free speech. More than anyone, Finney knew that governments would forever resist the new reality that our most exciting products and technologies in the future would be built of code, which is to say, speech, which is to say ideas. Nothing is more dangerous to the powers that be. Even given his known status, Finney himself was subjected to terrible blackmailing schemes and worse. But Armani goes further in his defense of the pseudonym: “By creating Satoshi, Hal could introduce Bitcoin without threat to his reputation, should Bitcoin turn out to have some fatal flaw. By appearing to support Bitcoin, Hal, a well-respected ‘cryptographic graybeard’ could make the project seem more attractive than even if Hal had released it himself.”Finney died in 2014 of ALS. Here is a note he wrote on March 19, 2013 (I was seriously into Bitcoin at this point):When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Today, if he were Satoshi, his Bitcoin stash would make him worth $6 billion in crypto alone. Those in control of the private keys have access, and the world is watching to see when or if they ever move. They may never. I rather hope that they stay where they are and that the identity of Satoshi always remains a mystery. All truly great innovation is crowdsourced. Genius is individual but no one person contains within himself or herself the intellectual capacity for creating anything truly meaningful from the ground up. That applies to music, products, ideas, and transformative software.Indeed, in one of his last notes before disappearing, Satoshi wrote: “I wish you wouldn’t keep talking about me as a mysterious shadowy figure, the press just turns that into a pirate currency angle. Maybe instead make it about the open source project and give more credit to your dev contributors; it helps motivate them.”That’s beautiful and perfect. Satoshi is Satoshi, no more, no less. P.S. for those interested in more of Vin Armani’s documentation – I've present only a bit of his evidence – he has posted this file. "

[+] Michael del Castillo on stage at the Forbes 30 Under 30 Summit 2018 in Boston, Massachusetts. (October 1, 2018)","The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston is just a ten-minute walk from Boston’s City Hall Plaza, where Forbes is hosting its annual 30 Under 30 Summit.To help kick off the two-day event, Jim Cunha, vice president of treasury and financial services at the Boston Fed, joined cryptocurrency leaders from around the industry to talk about the influence blockchain is having on the way people think about money, and how to make it.In the course of a 20-minute conversation, Cunha detailed some of the early-stage blockchain experiments a few members of his team of 200 have undertaken using ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric. Cunha also explained how the branch of the U.S. central bank interacts with other currency issuers and startups to learn more about how blockchain works.But the biggest obstacle Cunha says central banks face when it comes to embracing the speed and borderlessness of blockchain isn’t technological. Rather, the 30-year veteran of the Federal Reserve says that it's uncertainty about the security of the organizations building blockchain that has him most concerned.“We use private companies all the time,” said Cunha, who has been at the central bank for more than 30 years. “I don’t know if we’ll ever do that with cryptocurrency.”Many developers in the open-source blockchain ecosystem have opted to remain pseudonymous, and scams involving the technology have proved to be a successful way to make money on the technology. But for now Cunha is wasting no time exploring the technology from inside. Read More: Full Coverage Of The Under 30 SummitHe mentioned several other projects, including the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Project Ubin and Clearmatics Technology's Utility Settlement Coin, as examples of how central banks are being influenced by the cryptocurrency world.In spite of Cunha's cautious take on how third-party cryptocurrency companies might directly partner with central banks, he also listed multiple central bank efforts, including work being done in Sweden, as examples of what he believes could someday result in a state-controlled fiat currency issued on a blockchain.“I give it five years,” Cunha said.At first glance, the issuance of a cryptocrrency with some of the price controls implemented by central banks may seem like a lot of unnecessary work to fix a system that works pretty well for many people as is. But another speaker at the event, Circle Internet Financial founder Jeremy Allaire, thinks the integration of crypto and fiat could lay the groundwork for new kinds of markets.Last week Allaire formally launched USD Coin, a cryptocurrency powered by the public ethereum blockchain and backed by the U.S. dollar. Allaire argued that by backing the tokens with a more stable currency, he could first enable off-hours trading and eventually jump-start trading between markets around the world that are normally isolated.Lending support to Cunha’s concerns, however, was a panel on how to fix cryptocurrency’s broken reputation. Speakers including Jalak Jobanputra, founder Future Perfect Ventures, Yin Wu, founder of Dirt Protocol, and Will Warren, co-founder of 0X, talked about how the run up in the price of many cryptocurrencies in 2017 and a proliferation of poorly vetted projects led to a resurgence of skepticism.But to hedge such concerns, the panelists also reflected on distrust they see in the traditional financial sector, especially among Millennials. While Allaire sought to earn that trust by integrating the new technology with some of the old stability, panelists on a second panel focused on other possible solutions. Speaking on a panel about whether crytpocurrency would ever make a viable means of exchange, Neha Narula, MIT’s director of digital currency, joined Tadge Dryja, a co-creator of the Lightning Network for speeding up bitcoin transactions, and Linda Xie, the founder of crypto-token venture capital firm Scalar Capital, to argue that new technology, not traditional currency, was the best way to widespread use.Tom Jessop, head of corporate business development at event sponsor Fidelity Investments talked about what it would take for cryptocurrency to actually be spent, instead of just invested in. But one thing the speakers all had in common was a focus on reimagining what monetary systems can look like from the ground up. Meltem Demirors, the chief strategy officer of London-based crypto investment research firm CoinShares, proposed considering unconventional variables of a monetary system such as fairness, social access and equality of the system when imagining new ways to move money.“We now have to work together to define the future of who has the right to print money and who has the right to define for us individually and collectively what has value,” Demirors concluded."

prediction that the price of one bitcoin will rise to $250,000 by 2022.","Sep 25, 2018,08:55pm EDT",Tim and Adam Draper at Draper University,"Just five months ago, billionaire venture capitalist ‘Tim Draper’ made a prediction that the price of one bitcoin will rise to $250,000 by 2022. Even though the price has since fallen, Draper believes that bitcoin will bounce back.When the Silk Road collapsed in 2014, the U.S. Marshals auctioned 144,000 bitcoins and Tim Draper purchased 40,000 bitcoins for $24,000,000. In today’s terms, this is estimated to be worth $267,662,000. Both Tim and Adam Draper have been early supporters of bitcoin. Tim founded Draper University—which has a free course on bitcoin. Tim’s son Adam launched Boost VC, an incubator-fund that invests in blockchain technology and virtual reality. Here’s how the two Draper’s see bitcoin, crypto, and blockchain technology changing our world.What trends did you anticipate that has now happened, and what did you think was going to happen that didn’t?Adam Draper: ""I thought that payments would be a bigger piece of the overall crypto market, it's still a hope and I think will be true in the future. Fundraising on the blockchain was definitely anticipated and executed previously—but ethereum made it so much easier.""Tim Draper: ""I did not anticipate that the regulators would put a dark cloud over all this innovation. I had hoped that there would be some clear simple rules and we could then get on with it. But I guess there are a lot of old-school banking lobbyists trying to cling to the status quo. Years from now, governments will be judged by how well they manage this transition from fiat to crypto.""What did you think of the caliber of the new cryptocurrencies entering the market?Adam Draper: ""So many entrepreneurs planning out new ways that decentralization can change the world. I think it's amazing. There are so many smart and passionate people entering the space. The caliber, in general, has been great.""Tim Draper: ""They are a mix. We are seeing some that are just bitcoin copies and have no reason to exist. We are seeing others that we think are going to have profound effects on industry and government.""What do you see as being the biggest problem with the blockchain technology today?Adam Draper: ""The biggest problem in blockchain today is delivering true value to the end consumer and usability of the products.""Tim Draper: ""It needs time to mature and for all that creativity to come to fruition. I look forward to being able to fund companies in bitcoin who pay their people and suppliers in bitcoin so that all the accounting is done automatically on the blockchain. I look forward to paying my bills in bitcoin. I look forward to having all my legal contracts 'be smart' (in software) contracts. I look forward to seeing geographic borders dissolve around the world.""Luke Fitzpatrick: What do you think the blockchain landscape is going to look like in 2022 and beyond?Adam Draper: ""In 2022, no one will be saying, 'crypto or blockchain,' because it will be integrated into all technology. The same way that no one says, 'I am starting an internet company,' even though every startup is one.""Tim Draper: ""Well, my prediction is that the price of one bitcoin will rise to $250,000 in 2022. I think the products around bitcoin, blockchain and smart contracts will make it much easier to do business via crypto—so there will be a major shift over these next four years.""Some important things to considerThe world could be moving towards a cashless society. If Tim Draper is right with his $250,000 bitcoin prediction, we could experience the biggest financial change since the U.S. gold standard. So supposing that the Draper’s are correct, here are some big questions to ponder. Will the first cashless society be fiat-based or crypto? How will governments respond to these changes? How could these major financial transitions affect the $86 trillion fiat world economy? How will this impact us, our children and further generations to come? "

net-worth ...","Nov 5, 2018,11:00am EST",Getty,"Since the explosion of ICOs last year, the cryptocurrency market has undergone some noticeable changes. While the price of Bitcoin remains well below its all time high of 2017, institutional investors are replacing retail investors and high net-worth individuals, becoming some of the largest buyers of cryptocurrency. According to a report from Bloomberg, buyers such as hedge funds have become more involved in the cryptocurrency market through private transactions.Coinbase has also seen a large drop-off in active users, along with publicly-posted trading and transactional volumes. A Bloomberg report on data compiled by Tribe Capital shows that the number of active (continually buying and selling crypto assets) U.S. customers on Coinbase has declined by approximately 80% since its December 2017 high.“Due to regulations, one has to now be an accredited investor to have the best deal flow. The retail market isn’t currently built for ease, if someone wants to invest in a portfolio they have to sign up for multiple exchanges, move money across accounts, set stop losses, use hardware wallets, etc, Parul Gujral, Founder and CEO of Snowball, told me.”And while cryptocurrency fundraising through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) brought in billions of dollars from retail investors last year, a new report by Diar.co revealed that roughly 70% of ICOs are currently worth less now than when they were originally released. In turn, retail investor participation in the crypto market has dropped off.In an attempt to bring retail investors back into the cryptocurrency market, new consumer-grade solutions from Coinbase and other companies are being launched to provide tools to “smartly” navigate the murky crypto market.Coinbase Bundle, for example, is a recent solution from the popular cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase. According to Carly Emmer, a Product Manager for Coinbase Bundle, the product was developed for customers of Coinbase's consumer exchange product and was created based on their feedback about buying their first cryptocurrency.Coinbase Bundle offers a market-weighted selection of the five cryptocurrencies available to buy and sell on Coinbase. With Coinbase Bundle, users can buy a bundle of five cryptocurrencies for as little as $25. Ultimately, Coinbase Bundle is aimed at helping the customer form their cryptocurrency portfolio. Coinbase Bundle will also help customers decide on what cryptocurrencies to buy within a certain price.Coinbase Bundle is a new product we launched earlier this year that lets people buy a basket of five cryptocurrencies with just a few clicks. We talked to Coinbase customers while developing this product, and we often heard that it is really hard to choose which cryptocurrency to invest in first. With that in mind, we wanted to give customers an easy way to get started with a set of five cryptocurrencies, allocated according to market cap. Now customers can start their crypto journey by building a diverse cryptocurrency investment for as little as $25, Emmer told me.”Once a bundle is purchased, the underlying cryptocurrencies are stored in users’ respective wallets, behaving like separate cryptocurrencies in their Coinbase account. Users can buy, sell, send and receive each cryptocurrency as an individual asset. San-Francisco based fintech startup, Snowball, is also about to launch what they are referring to as the first “Smart Crypto Investment Automation” (SCIA) platform. Snowball will give users access to portfolio allocations and strategies of SEC-qualified, regulatory-compliant crypto indices with at least $10M assets under management with just a push of a button, and will be among the first of the “Smart Crypto Investment Automation” (SCIA) platforms. Hunter Harrison, Founding Partner of Konza Capital, believes Snowball is tackling a true pain point for retail investors. “The average retail investor doesn’t have proprietary deal flow or access to advanced trading tools. Passive investment platforms like Snowball’s SCIA will allow them to gain easy and advanced exposure into digital assets,” Harrison said.Once Snowball is officially launched later this month, users will no longer have to sign up for multiple crypto exchanges, download or purchase different wallets, decide what tokens to buy and sell, and will have their investments working strategically in accordance with market fluctuations.“The majority of people have no idea how to get started with buying their first Bitcoin, let alone diversifying their crypto portfolio. Snowball allows the everyday investor to participate simply by adding a bank account or credit card, ‘Millionaire Mentor’ and Chief Marketing Officer for Snowball, Jason Stone, told me.”Retail Investors Focused On BitcoinIt's also interesting to note that institutional investors entering the crypto market have displayed interest in Bitcoin. A new survey conducted by Wall Street strategy firm, Fundstrat, suggests that once institutional investors are interested in Bitcoin, they become even more bullish than their retail counterparts.Yet according to Bill Barhydt, Founder of Bitcoin wallet, Abra, Bitcoin will serve as the future cryptocurrency for the entire retail banking system.I believe Bitcoin is going to be the backbone of the future retail banking system. Consumers will utilize Bitcoin to get investment exposure to myriad assets, do payments and money transfers and even get credit via a global network of banks competing for consumers' business. In all cases, they likely won't even know they're using Bitcoin nor will they have to understand how it works. Much in the same way TCP/IP is the backbone of Netflix and Youtube, while being transparent to the global Internet user base. While institutional investors may provide the short term liquidity in Bitcoin, is likely to be the retail banking system of the future that profits the most, Barhydt told me.”In order to support this, Abra provides retail investments in different assets using Bitcoin as the backbone of their investing platform. Abra runs a single global platform that enables investment exposure to dozens of different assets all based upon collateralized Bitcoin contracts.A Little Help Goes A Long Way Interestingly enough, a recent survey conducted by securities trading platform, SharesPost, gathered responses from 2,490 retail investors and 528 accredited investors. The survey found that nearly three-fourths of retail investors plan to increase their cryptocurrency holdings in the next 12 months. However, it was also the case that current cryptocurrency owners remain highly-bullish on the nascent asset class, expecting mainstream adoption to take longer than they had when asked earlier in the year.An open financial system depends greatly on people’s ability to understand, explore and choose cryptocurrencies in which to invest. As a result of the consumer solutions from Coinbase and others, the cryptocurrency market could still see increased interest from retail investors moving forward."

Mining",https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2018/10/01/after-bitmains-ipo-filing-heres-what-everyone-should-know-about-crypto-mining/,"For example, the current mining reward for the Bitcoin blockchain is 12.5 
Bitcoins, worth approximately $82k under today's prices. By Design, ...","Oct 1, 2018,03:44pm EDT",Getty,"There is no crypto or blockchain company in the world more synonymous with mining than Bitmain. According to research from Sanford C. Bernstein & Co, the company owns 85% of the market for mining chips, which are the figurative brains inside special purpose-built computers that process transactions and produce new units of a given crypto asset. Furthermore, the company controls the most hashing power on the Bitcoin network (almost 35%) of any entity via its controlling stake in the network’s two largest pools, BTC.com and AntPool. This number may not mean much to casual observers and enthusiasts, but in crypto a miner, or set of miners, only needs to manage 51% of a network’s hashing (computer) power to control it.That said, Bitmain’s pole position is not impervious, and the company’s public listing is taking place in a time of extreme uncertainty and turmoil within the broader mining community. Although crypto mining was an innovative solution to what was once an intractable problem, it is far from perfect and in some ways its flaws are growing. For instance, the process is expensive, wasteful, and leading to centralization in the sector. Therefore, the teams and developers behind Bitcoin and other platforms such as Ethereum, Monero, and the SIA blockchain seeking ways to block or reduce Bitmain’s, and its direct competitors’, power over their networks.Anybody investing in Bitmain, purchasing a miner, or acquiring any of the crypto assets are mined needs to understand a few key items regarding the industry and its future outlook.Blockchains are powerful because they are able to do something that centralized databases cannot, which is to facilitate agreement on the current state of a network in a trustless environment. They can do this because they utilize a sophisticated algorithmic process that enables all users to validate and disseminate authentic transactions, while at the same time block illegitimate and duplicative ones. The transaction verification process seeks to prove common-sense facts about a transaction, such as whether or not the sender has sufficient funds in its account and those funds have not already been sent to a different recipient. All of this is enabled by a program called a ‘consensus mechanism’. There are a variety of ways to reach consensus, with the most common being of Proof of Work (PoW).Under PoW, participating nodes lend their computational power to a network, where they race against each other to solve a complex computational problem while simultaneously gathering and grouping legitimate transactions together into blocks. The winning node adds its block to the top of the chain and gets a reward in the form of new crypto. For example, the current mining reward for the Bitcoin blockchain is 12.5 Bitcoins, worth approximately $82k under today’s prices.The Proof of Work algorithms employed by Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and other blockchains require a process known as ‘brute force computing’. This means that solving the complex computational problem that gives a miner the right to add a block to a network can only be done by randomly guessing solutions as fast as possible. There is no way to game the process or get an advantage over the competition other than by buying a higher number of more powerful computers. Furthermore, solving one block does not give a miner an advantage over the competition when it comes to a subsequent or future block.It is also important to note that under Proof of Work blocks are added to their respective chains under specific time intervals, regardless of how much computing power is on the network. For example, Bitcoin adds a block on average every 10 minutes. To maintain this pace, the network automatically adjusts/increases the difficulty of the computational problem that miners are trying to solve. Simply put, there are no economies of scale when it comes to mining.There is a direct correlation between the computer or hashing power that a miner controls and their expected success rate. This set off an arms race that has created exponential growth for companies like Bitmain, but which also threatens the overall decentralization and sustainability of networks like Bitcoin. When Bitcoin was first created nearly-ten years ago, blocks could easily be mined on basic computer Central Processing Units (CPUs). Eventually, it was discovered that Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) could be repurposed to mine crypto at a higher success rate than CPUs. As the price of Bitcoin and other assets accelerated, developers in the community created Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which are highly efficient microchips that are custom-built for one specific purpose, to randomly guess solutions to the PoW algorithm employed by any given blockchain. The top ASIC miners can run between 14-16 terahashes (guesses)/second and cost thousands of dollars.Unfortunately, given the price appreciations throughout crypto in recent years, not to mention the gold rush that took place in late 2017, mining any sort of PoW cryptocurrency profitably requires the individual to either purchase an ASIC miner or join a mining pool that shares revenue based on allocated computer power. It is also very helpful if the individual purchasing the miners is based in a cold climate to keep the machines cool and has access to cheap electricity, as this cost directly impacts the overall profitability of any mining operation. Recent studies have shown that Bitcoin’s energy consumption is analogous to the amount of electricity necessary to power a country like Switzerland for a year.According to Bitmain’s IPO filing, the company earned $2.25 billion in revenue in 2017 from mining hardware sales and brought in $2.68 billion in sales during the first half of 2018. There is a saying that in a gold rush the only people who make money are those that sell the shovels; if that is the case then Bitmain is following this strategy perfectly.Despite Bitmain’s success to date, its executives may not sleeping well at night for a number of reasons. For one, their industry is becoming more competitive every day, and Bitmain must continue investing hundreds of millions of dollars in new ASIC chips to maintain its technological superiority and market share. For instance, one of Bitmain’s top competitors – if there is such a thing – Innosilicon claims to now have an ASIC miner called the Terminator3 (T3) that is superior to any miner on the market today based on speed, profitability, and overall efficiency. The T3 will be released in December this year. Startups continue to target the industry as well, with companies such as Squire who just raised $20 million to build ASIC miners.That said, many crypto enthusiasts and interested parties do not feel that the answer to mining’s shortcomings is more efficient and powerful miners. There is a growing belief in the industry that mining should one day be avoided altogether, or at the very least the industry should become less reliant on ASICs, which as noted earlier consume huge amounts of energy and trend towards centralization. Parties looking for a complete shift away from Proof of Work typically advocate for a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. There are many variants of PoS, which are beyond the scope of this article, but in general the common denomination for any PoS system is that the nodes that add blocks place use a portion of their crypto holdings as collateral or a security deposit. If the validators do not act in appropriately in their role they risk losing all or a portion of their funds. Peercoin is the first cryptocurrency that utilized PoS, and most notably Ethereum is looking to transition into a PoS system. New blockchains such as Cardano are also implementing PoS. PoS systems are designed to require significantly less energy than PoW while offering the same level of security. There are also proposed throughput and scalability benefits to a PoS model, though none of this is proven at scale.The other main strategy being utilized is altering the hashing algorithm of PoW systems to make them ASIC-resistant. As noted above, ASIC chips are designed to be highly efficient at one very specific activity, which could be running a given hashing function. If developers introduce subtle changes to an existing algorithm, it would make every ASIC miner running the old function obsolete. This is a strategy that was undertaken by privacy-focused Monero earlier this year.  Additionally, the team behind the Sia blockchain just announced that they would do the same. However, in an interesting twist they are not completely making their blockchain ASIC-resistant, just incompatible with large-scale miners such as Bitmain. It will remain to be seen how strategies like these will work as miners such as Bitmain continue to try and diversify the blockchains that their miners can support. Most likely, it will turn into a bit of a cat and mouse game.ConclusionThe current inflection point that the mining industry faces was in some ways inevitable. In the same way that Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto could not have predicted the protracted Bitcoin blocksize debate that dominated the industry for the last two years, it is hard to imagine that he or she could have foreseen the development of ASICs. In some ways, perhaps they would have been welcomed in the sense that their introduction meant that Bitcoin, and the broader crypto industry, had grown significantly. So, perhaps it is a positive that we reached this point. At the same time, now that we are here a significant shakeup is likely coming in the near-mid term. It will be critical for interested parties to follow the news closely. "

Superior Consensus Mechanism",https://www.forbes.com/sites/geraldfenech/2018/11/02/bitcoins-proof-of-work-carries-fundamental-flaws-blockchain-needs-a-superior-consensus-mechanism/,"Bitcoin uses a Proof-of-Work algorithm which has well-documented challenges 
that threaten to be fatal. Proof-of-Stake has gained in popularity ...","Nov 2, 2018,11:00am EDT",Proof of work and proof of stake,"The core purpose of a consensus mechanism is always the same: it is there to provide proof of something, to ensure that all network nodes can agree on the true and valid state of the blockchain. This is how malicious attacks on the network are avoided. Without it, there could be no value in crypto.In blockchain, it is the public who, by and large, verify and time stamp transactions. Once data is validated by participating users, or nodes, the transaction is added to a block which is permanently written onto the blockchain.The new block is linked to the previous block and broadcasted to the entire network thereby achieving consensus: every node’s copy of the blockchain will be identical.However, different consensus algorithms tend to face a similar problem; they struggle to guarantee both liveness and safety. There is not yet a solution that conclusively ensures ‘something good eventually happens’ at the same time it ensures ‘nothing bad happens’.Bitcoin uses a Proof-of-Work algorithm which has well-documented challenges that threaten to be fatal. Proof-of-Stake has gained in popularity as a result and entails users showing that they have staked crypto on validating transactions, but favors the already-rich and runs the risk of creating a 51 percent shareholder.The deep, structural issues with these methods are part of the reason that many startups have started looking for other ways of achieving consensus.Alternatives are in the worksWhile the development communities for Bitcoin and Ethereum constantly work to make their systems better, there are lesser-known consensus mechanisms looking to take center stage.1. Proof of AuthorityPoA is a type of Proof-of-Stake where the user’s identity forms the stake. A validator has to be personally identified and verified on the platform, making them a trusted node.Users who confirm their identity earn the right to validate blocks on the chain. The crypto rewards they receive are public, as are malicious actions undertaken; this means that individuals have their personal reputation at stake when acting to secure the network.Egor Homakov’s Fairlayer is very recent, so they are a distance from drumming up interest in the project, let alone releasing their coin to market. But Homakov has strong credibility and some in the tech community are prone to believe that he is doing exactly what he says: building an infinitely scalable blockchain that does not compromise on security.To begin with, Fairlayer will allocate themselves 100 stake-tokens and gradually distribute these to 99 other entities -- “the more famous the better” -- with at least two-thirds of the total number of stake-holding entities being required to validate each block.The idea follows that the first 100 validators will onboard three validators at a time until a critical mass of 10,000 is reached. In theory, this provides a near-unhackable attack surface. He makes incredibly bold claims in the project abstract so it’s well worth a read.Another prominent player using PoA is Vivacoin. They propose a different methodology with a few more layers, but the concept remains focused on staking identity. VeChain meanwhile has an extremely tenable enterprise solution centered on a PoA consensus mechanism.It would not be a surprise to see Proof of Authority become more commonplace in the blockchain space.2. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)It has, perhaps, been IOTA’s greatest success to communicate what is a complicated and non-standard technology amid the broad umbrella of blockchain.They run on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture -- dubbed the ‘Tangle’ -- and use MCMC to achieve consensus. This is a complex algorithm which is best understood by statisticians but the concept is straightforward when applied.After a user broadcasts their transaction, the algorithm randomly selects two unconfirmed transactions to verify. With IOTA, a small amount of Proof-of-Work is needed to confirm these transactions, and the user’s own broadcast can then be verified by someone else.IOTA will initially use ‘coordinators’, or master nodes, who act as a network failsafe by ensuring any fraudulent transactions and attacks can be dismissed. Additionally, no mining means a massive boost to energy efficiency.Matrix also proposes to use MCMC, as do BigTangle whose construct seems similar in design to IOTA though perhaps slightly less fleshed out.Built on the blockchain3. Proof of ContributionPOC is another consensus mechanism that doesn’t use mining. In essence, it is an algorithm which achieves consensus by measuring useful contributions from users that support the network’s functions.An attack on the network is theoretically prevented by the high cost required to overload the system. It is the system of choice for CyberVein: they propose a network of decentralized databases which run from user-donated disk space.POC is based on storage space and allows users to provide consensus by donating work that is useful to the network. This is converted into a secure, collective home for datasets and users are rewarded with crypto tokens.As storage capacity is a scarce resource, it is thought that an attack becomes infeasible due to the high cost required. This is not on its own a failsafe, however; they run off a DAG architecture similar in design to IOTA, and like them, will initially use centralized nodes to safeguard the main chain.A separate blockchain using Proof-of-Work is another solution they propose to secure the main DAG, ensuring that fraudulent transactions are dismissed and the entire network can be verified as true.Further to this, users are incentivized to become trusted full nodes -- achieved by donating enough disk space to store the entire network and all its transactions -- by being offered a higher payout of CyberVein Tokens (CVT) according to how much storage they contribute.Providing disk space to store value and smart contract transactions directly benefits the system’s purpose: to distribute stored data across user devices.4. Byzantine AgreementThe two most important BA systems are in Ripple and Stellar, and it is an attractive mechanism. Consensus can be reached quickly and economically, and it does not tie participation to the ownership of assets.However, this method requires a degree of centralization as it would otherwise require an unrealistic level of coordination and resource parity.Both Ripple and Stellar use a method of voting -- Ripple uses probabilistic voting, Stellar uses federated -- which favors liveness and safety respectively.So with Ripple: validator nodes collect transactions, turn them into proposals and send these out to other validators. When proposals are received, they undergo a series of votes to weed out fraudulent transactions.For practical purposes, this works, but the probability that validated transactions are actually valid is fractionally lower than 99%. This is where the compromise on safety exists and is why Ripple will likely have to either work on centralized grounds or develop a workaround.A traditional Byzantine Agreement system has closed membership wherein the number of participant nodes is fixed. Stellar allows open membership instead, where nodes can join and leave at will.Their federated model means that a node can reach consensus with a ‘consortium’ of nodes that it finds trustworthy, without involving all nodes in the network. While Ripple requires all nodes to accept the same transactions through a series of votes, federated voting means a node need only rely on a single group to verify its transactions.A Byzantine Agreement system is essentially costless and it is scalable: throughput is 4,500 transactions per second with 64 nodes. More nodes than this reduces network performance, but this is still a far cry from Bitcoin’s estimated maximum of seven transactions per second.Blockchain is nascentBlockchain as we know it is still being figured out; that is to say, it could be a while yet before we see the technology blossom into its full potential. A key challenge exists in developing an effective consensus mechanism that doesn’t compromise the notion of decentralization.Some compromise may be needed here, but perhaps not. While Ripple is centralized at its core -- though they have hinted at a ‘decentralized strategy’ -- IOTA and CyberVein are examples of networks which will begin with centralized controls, but only until they reach a critical mass of users.This will depend on what is possible and what works. Enough startups are working to design alternative methods of consensus so a winner could come from anywhere. Some show great promise: it may be that a future solution that marries security with scalability is already lying in wait."

underground data centres to keep bitcoin and ethereum safe.","Oct 22, 2018,05:00am EDT",A glimpse inside one of Vo1t's locations.,"– Crypto thieves stole $1.1 billion in the first half of 2018, with growing numbers of kidnappings, armed robberies and blackmail attempts.– In response Miles Parry started Vo1t in 2016, a secret global network of underground data centres to keep bitcoin and ethereum safe.– Today Vo1t’s clients include big banks, fund managers and crypto exchanges, including several FTSE 250-listed companies.So, you’ve become a bitcoin billionaire, with a fast car, luxury mansion and jet-setting lifestyle. There’s just one problem: How on earth are you going to keep your newfound digital fortune safe?At the end of a dark corridor, behind blast doors buried some 60 feet underground in the bowel of an abandoned nuclear bunker, a secret data center might hold the answer.This strange location, somewhere in the heart of Southern England, miles from the nearest train station, is where a frontline has been drawn in the billion-dollar battle to keep crypto safe.The facility is patrolled by a specialist team of ex-military officers, and Forbes was asked to keep its precise location a secret.This data center is part of a network around the world called Vo1t that sprung into existence in response to the booming billion-dollar enterprise of kidnappings, armed robberies and blackmail by crypto criminals.These aren’t one-off occurrences. Earlier this year British crypto trader Danny Aston, his girlfriend Amy Jay and their baby were the victims of Britain’s first armed crypto heist when four masked men broke into their home in the sleepy Oxfordshire town of Moulsford.The quaint English village of Moulsford was the site of the U.K.'s first crypto heist.The men held his family at gunpoint, tied up Aston’s girlfriend, left their baby outside in a stroller, before forcing him to transfer an undisclosed sum of bitcoin over to them, according to reports at the time. Aston declined to comment to Forbes.Such heists are lucrative. Crypto thieves got away with $1.1 billion in the first half of 2018 alone, according to cybersecurity firm Carbon Black, and on the day of the Moulsford heist, a single bitcoin was worth $10,772.A cold crypto war“This is a different world. What you really need to be asking is, what happens if you have a gun held to your head?” Vo1t founder Miles Parry told Forbes.Vo1t founder Miles Parry.It was questions like this, and stories like Aston’s, which led Parry, a former independent security consultant to the U.K.’s Ministry of Defence, to quietly launch Vo1t (pronounced “vault”) two years ago.Today Vo1t is trusted by some of the world’s largest companies to keep their bitcoin, ethereum and a host of other digital currencies safe.The crux of keeping cryptocurrencies safe is to put your private key—a line of code that lets you spend tokens—in a very safe place. Once a private key is compromised crypto thieves can pillage your holdings, leaving you little recourse.This simple vulnerability at the heart of bitcoin has triggered an arms race in crypto security, with people putting their private keys in “cold storage” (that is, on an offline device like a thumb drive) in increasingly elaborate locations, from putting thumb drives in safety deposit boxes to printing the private keys on steel plates and burying them.These options are far from foolproof, especially with crypto criminals becoming ever more audacious and willing to use force.Parry’s solution was to use his unique skill set to build a modern-day Swiss vault. A global “cold storage” network of underground crypto bunkers, protected by layers of digital, physical and human security.For its protection, Vo1t charges companies £25,000 ($33,000) annually, along with a £25,000 setup charge and a fee of between 0.01% and 0.06% on withdrawals, which it says can be made in as little as 30 minutes.The entrance to one facility in England where Vo1t operates from.Enter the vaultThe servers at Vo1t’s secret data center which Forbes visited are rigged, not to explode but to erase the digital fortunes they hold, if any of their hidden trip switches are touched.Even if the private keys in one vault are deleted, the team run duplicate data centers around the world, spread across different jurisdictions and continents to protect against both criminals and crypto-hostile states, so they can simply switch to the next one.Such a switch is unlikely, however. That’s because, besides the ex-military team that patrols above ground and the several layers of security underground, each vault is built with a final security gate that asks for eight factors of verification to open—requiring multiple employees with key fobs, codes and off-site authentication via video camera.This data center is also entirely disconnected from the internet, sealed within a Faraday cage to block the hint of a radio wave that might try to connect with Vo1t’s servers.The electricity which hums through their circuit boards has even been passed through military-grade filters as a precaution.And, for the peace of mind of Vo1t's corporate clients, its holdings are covered by a specialist crypto insurance policy from Aon.Vo1t's servers are primed with booby traps and rigged to delete the crypto keys they hold.It’s because of this that banks, fund managers and several crypto exchanges—including several FTSE 250-listed companies in the U.K. and large public companies in the U.S. which Forbes spoke to, but who asked not to be named for security concerns— today rely on Vo1t as their last line of defense against the growing threat of crypto theft.David Allen, the chief operating officer of Equity Trust, an IRA and 401(k) provider with $12 billion under management, confirmed to Forbes that it stores its crypto holdings with Vo1t.“Vo1t have the technology, speed and security to keep our clients’ digital assets safe and the ability to quickly withdraw and convert back to cash when they need,” he said.Allen was one of the few executives who agreed to speak on the record. Many in the crypto world believe even being associated with a custodian like Vo1t will increase their chances of having their companies, colleagues and families targeted by crypto criminals.It’s also the reason why Parry won’t disclose the total deposits held by Vo1t or his revenues and why, until now, he’s never spoken to the press.“Criminals want to know what their payout will be, and if you give them that figure it lets them risk assess and motivates them to act.”Which leads to the obvious question, why is Parry talking now?“We've kept very quiet, but it's become clear quite recently that people are starting to know about us, so it's about time that we put our head above the water,” the founder says.Part of the reason is the growing threat of crypto thieves attacking exchanges, individuals and custodians.Such an attack on Vo1t would be pointless, the entrepreneur says, as its system is designed in a way that neither Parry nor anyone on his team can override its security.“Even if someone got my entire team into the bunker together, past all the security, they’re going to trigger the failsafes anyway. And when they do the location becomes worthless.”As he puts it “we shouldn’t be a target, because there are no tools left in the van overnight.”Another reason Parry may have decided now is the time to speak up is because the financial giants of Wall Street are finally waking up to the opportunity of crypto custodianship.In recent months the crypto custody space has started heating up.Beating the banksLast week Fidelity Investments announced it would launch an enterprise-grade crypto custodian service next year for its 13,000 institutional advisory firms and brokers.In May, Japanese banking giant Nomura partnered with French crypto wallet provider Ledger and bitcoin investment manager Global Advisors to start building a new custodian called Komainu.Citigroup has also announced its plans to enter the space, while rumors are swirling that Goldman Sachs is considering launching its own service.And that’s not even to mention Vo1t’s biggest startup rival Xapo, the Hong Kong-based company is currently the largest crypto custody provider and has raised over $31 million in venture funding from the likes of Greylock Partners and Index Ventures.Vo1t is gearing up for the fight. It raised seed investment from angel investor and now board member Simon Johnson, along with blockchain investment firm Kryptonite 1. And Parry has just closed a $2 million venture round that will see businesswoman Ondine de Rothschild become a director of the company with an investment made by a Rothschild Family Trust. With funding secured, Parry is optimistic that Vo1t will have a key part to play in building the crypto infrastructure of the future.“Yes, I know the likes of Goldman Sachs or whoever are coming, but they will not want to hold all of that crypto themselves, they’ll want to diversify their risk and their exposure,” he says.“They’ll want to hold across many custodians and custodians with a reputable name. I like to think we’ll be one of those guys.”No arrests have been made following the Moulsford heist, and Thames Valley police continue to appeal for the public’s help."

While the Omaha, Nebraska brokerage wouldn’t say how much it invested and the stake it acquired as of a result,  it did say customer interest in digital tokens is still high despite the state of the market in 2018. Likening it to the heady days of the late 1990’s when anything with a .com slapped to its name garnered a lot of interest, Steve Quirk, executive vice president of Trading & Education at TD Ameritrade, said there was a day of reckoning for them similar to what’s going on with cryptocurrency. But just like the tech sector did, the digital token market should recover and surge.  One only needs to look at the popularity of FAANG stocks for evidence. “A lot of people see the second iteration of crypto to be so much better,” said the executive. “It's regulated and better understood. We don’t have the crazy volatility we had in the early days.”GettyBitcoin Interest Still There Despite Plunge In Value Rewind to last year, and bitcoin was setting new highs on a seemingly daily basis. The leading cryptocurrency at the time began 2017 trading around $1,000 and hit a high of nearly $20,000 toward the end of the year. That created near hysteria among investors with all sorts wanting in on the action.  That drove the launch of the CBOE and CME bitcoin futures and for the likes of TD Ameritrade to come on board. But with regulators cracking down on the cryptocurrency market and bitcoin failing to take off with the masses, a subsequent decline in the price of it and other cryptocurrencies has ensued. At last check, bitcoin was trading around $6,545 and according to CoinMarketCap.com, the capitalization for digital tokens has been cut in half so far this year. That prompted some of the discount brokerages to retreat. Worried the lack of regulation would present too much risk to their customers, leaders such as Charles Schwab and Fidelity Investments opted to take a wait and see approach to offering access to bitcoin. TD Ameritrade Customers Want  Regulated Way To Access Digital Tokens TD Ameritrade, on the other hand, held steady in its support of the bitcoin contracts and with this week’s announcement is doubling down further. The appeal of ErisX to TD Ameritrade: its a regulated exchange. “The value of doing it with them is that they are one of the largest market makers in the space and have already set up a regulated exchange,” said Quirk. TD Ameritrade executives including Quirk and JB Mackenzie, managing director Futures & Forex at TD Ameritrade said the fact that the exchange is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission was necessary in order to get an investment from the brokerage. “ErisX is creating what was a very interesting opportunity to have traditional capital markets with a legitimate regulated exchange that is bringing all the traditional partners on one centralized platform,” Mackenzie said. “Customers wanted to have the ability to invest in something that is transparent and that is regulated.” Another reason TD Ameritrade invested in ErisX: is expected to  provide access to futures and crypto products including bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, and ethereum. Rival Coinbase, which has a market value of around $8 billion according to media reports, offers spot trading of bitcoin only.  Mackenzie said the investment also presented an opportunity to make sure its customers are represented in any products ErisX launches since the exchange operator plans to tap the minds and opinions of its investment backers when developing its offering. “It’s a great way to make sure the cryptocurrency interests of customers are being met,” he said. TD Ameritrade isn’t the only firm that is backing ErisX’s new derivative exchange and clearing organization.

[+] Litecoin and Ethereum. (Photo by Jack Taylor/Getty Images)According to recent market research conducted by the porn studio VogoV, as of 2018 about 470 adult video sites, 50 webcam platforms, and 35 sex shops worldwide accept cryptocurrencies (crypto for short) as a form of payment. That may seem like a lot, but relative to the overall size of the sprawling adult industry, it really isn’t. In fact, for an industry that prides itself on a history of early tech adoption and popularization, from VHS tapes to internet payment systems, porn has approached this new form of remuneration gingerly at best. Big and well known companies especially, like Pornhub and Wicked, flirted with accepting crypto for years before making any moves. And most sites long focused on accepting Bitcoin, arguably the best known and most dominant coin, rather than exploring new or numerous alternative cryptocurrencies. Early attempts to develop coins meant to serve the adult industry specifically, like 2014’s (a little on-the-nose) Titcoin, flopped miserably.“Businesses didn’t need to use something hazy and new, like crypto,” says VogoV co-founder Aleksei Maetnyi, also known as Markus Dupree, his adult film performer and director pseudonym. “Traditional technologies worked, and still work, pretty well” for payments. Adult companies also recognized, he adds, that (until recently) few of their customers used, or were clamoring to pay with, crypto.Since the middle of 2017, though, the adult industry has switched gears entirely. Last year, major sites like xHamster and Naughty America finally started accepting Bitcoin. Over the first half of this year, Pornhub and some of its sister sites announced partnerships with cryptocurrencies Horizen (formerly ZenCash), Tron, and Verge, and VRPorn.com started accepting Litecoin.Simultaneously, and much more ambitiously, a number of entrepreneurs from the adult and crypto worlds have launched new coins and attendant payment infrastructures aimed at the adult industry. The creators of the OGO coin (VogoV), BOOTY token (SpankChain), Vice Industry Token, and WankCoin all seem to believe their systems can solve the economic woes bedeviling the industry—largely stemming from the fact few people pay for porn anymore—better than other crypto options. And they all seem to believe that, in short order, they will become the dominant crypto payment platform for adult websites and consumers worldwide, and perhaps other industries, too.“This is an exciting time,” says Alex Hawkins, vice president of major adult tube site xHamster, “with really creative people exploring new systems.”Cryptocurrency systems have a lot to offer the adult industry. Because credit card companies and banks consider porn a high-risk sector, rife with disputed transactions, adult sites pay considerably more in fees and workaround costs to process payments than most industries. VogoV’s materials claim these fees account for up to 13% of the cost of a digital porn purchase, but Maetnyi thinks it can go up to 19%. Crypto systems, argues Najva Sol, vice president of community at SpankChain, offer a clear record of definitive transactions that “mean that no one can consume a performer’s content and demand a fake refund or claim they’ve been frauded.” They also bypass the fees and infrastructure of banks, cards, and payment processors, radically reducing the cost of selling content digitally.For consumers, cryptocurrencies promise a new type of anonymity. Although Hawkins argues that adult companies do a good job of trying to protect the privacy of their customers, porn buyers classically (and with some merit) fear that people in a bank or in their homes will be able to tell not just that they consume adult material, but what kinds, through their card statements. Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, explains Sol, publicly record every transaction on a decentralized ledger, but use a pseudonym, potentially making it much more difficult for anyone to track a person’s porn habits. “Whether you’re a married religious conservative in the United States, a gay male in Indonesia, or a fetishist in the United Kingdom,” says Hawkins, “getting caught viewing or purchasing adult content can carry significant social and legal risks.” So a new degree of anonymity speaks to some.“The benefits of cryptocurrency for adult businesses are so great,” says Lisa Moore, vice president of VRPorn.com, that “we would love to go 100% crypto in the future.”Despite the fact that these benefits have been clear to many in the adult and crypto worlds since the early days of Bitcoin, it makes sense that crypto initiatives in this sector are only coming into the spotlight or taking off now. Crypto systems, points out Alec Helmy, founder and publisher of the adult industry news site XBIZ, come with a steep learning curve for any industry. A lack of consumer knowledge of, or engagement with, these systems for much of the past decade limited the appeal of pushing past early adoption barriers. But, Moore notes, 2017 especially witnessed a massive uptick in consumer knowledge and use of, and hype surrounding, cryptocurrencies. “With widespread mainstream adoption reaching a fever pitch,” explains Corey Price, vice president of adult streaming behemoth Pornhub, “we thought it an appropriate time to penetrate the market and start accepting cryptocurrencies.”Despite increasing popular engagement with and enthusiasm about cryptocurrencies, though, initiatives in the adult industry probably won’t take off in earnest any time soon—especially those like Vice Industry, VogoV, and WankCoin that hope to build wholly new crypto systems.Cryptocurrencies are still, Maetnyi admits, confusing for many consumers, conceptually and practically. This may be an especially big problem in porn world, Hawkins points out, because, “while fans of adult content come in all ages, actual purchasers of adult content tend to be slightly older, and are more conservative with their purchases and with the technology they use.”The new coin systems burbling up in the adult industry are especially complex, as most currently seem to require that users buy one type of established cryptocurrency first, then exchange it for their novel token, and store and use it in a specific fashion—a far less intuitive process than paying with a card.“Any system that requires massive hurdles, validation, mysterious transactions and transaction fees, and the creation of new accounts,” argues Hawkins, “is dead on arrival” in most cases.Coins in general, and especially new and small ones, are also notorious for their value volatility. Many fail quickly too, or vanish, sometimes after their inventors seemingly make off will all of early adopters’ hard assets. As Sol summarizes things: “There are a lot of shitcoins out there.”“The average porn consumer,” she adds, “doesn’t want to read a whitepaper, and a forum, and some Medium articles just to judge the validity of a payment option.”Promises of improved privacy alone probably can’t motivate consumers to overcome these barriers. As Hawkins notes, most “porn consumers are driven by impulse and immediacy,” rather than a careful consideration of their anonymity—beyond, say, entering a private web browsing mode. Some tech critics also argue that no coin truly offers the perfect anonymity some may seek.The adult world’s new crypto platforms are experimenting with all manner of incentives for user adoption. VogoV and Vice Industry advertise discounts on content at some partner sites if users pay with tokens. (Some sites already offer discounts for users paying in established currencies like Bitcoin. Discounts, alongside privacy promises, ideally acts as incentives for people to move away from streaming free porn and towards actually buying high quality content.) SpankChain and VogoV stress the measures they are taking to control price fluctuations in their tokens. VogoV also claims that its coin users can contribute to the porn making process by regularly providing input on the kind of scenes they want to see and voting on which potential scripts they want the studio to produce. The company has a lottery active now too, which offers early adopters a chance to win an all-expenses-paid trip to Los Angeles to attend an adult industry party. Vice Industry even offers to pay users tokens for watching porn; WankCoin claims that it will do the same in the near future. (This may seem counterintuitive, but basically they think this will lead to deeper and longer user engagement with content, and allow them to generate robust data on viewer habits, creating real value that is worth paying for.)Maetnyi also tells me VogoV is investing heavily in user interface and experience research to try to make onboarding intuitive for any consumer. SpankChain, Sol says, takes pains to create and promote educational content. Sex workers using their platform help educate users as well, she adds.Still, these incentives may not be enough to draw users to new crypto platforms. “Until consumers are comfortable with a particular coin,” argues Hawkins, “there will be limited use.”“In some ways, this mirrors the early days of internet payment processing,” he adds, “where consumers were very hesitant to enter credit card numbers. Where would they go? Who could track it? What would they get? It took a while for major payment processors to emerge,” and through their size and partnerships to earn legitimacy in the eyes of consumers.Established porn companies may be hesitant to lend legitimacy to new adult crypto systems via adoption or partnerships as well, limiting their ability to become ubiquitous and trusted payment infrastructures.Granted, all these new initiatives have already built partnerships with at least a few adult sites or networks, although some of them are not exactly prominent industry actors. SpankChain and VogoV work openly and prominently with major figures in the adult industry as well, who can not only market systems to fans, but help position coins to make their cases for partnerships. And Vice Industry’s “we’ll pay you to watch porn” pitch has generated gobs of mainstream press attention, much of it fairly positive.New adult-focused crypto platforms also make some strong business arguments for partnerships. Vice Industry’s promise of rich new data and better consumer engagement may be especially enticing—although one has to wonder about the value of data or engagement generated via a reward system that seems so gameable. (Vice Industry did not respond to a request for comment.)Competition won’t be a huge problem for these platforms, as (in theory) they can all co-exist within the same industry. Most seem to plan to eventually accept not just their own tokens, but a wide variety on their platforms, perhaps including each other’s. Eventually, they could all become ubiquitous. Helmy likens this to the many equally viable and accepted credit card payment companies in the world today.But, Maetnyi acknowledges, “most existing adult industry token projects will die,” whether due to flaws in their underlying models or due to their failure to build a broad enough usage ecosystem early on.The perks these new systems offer may not be enough to garner a critical mass of partnerships for functional growth, utility, and legitimization. Most of these systems have faced a few hitches in their early days as well: SpankChain reportedly recently dealt with a hacking incident. Sol tells me a firm just declined to do a security audit for them “because of ‘optics.’” And this summer, Playboy TV sued the party that was supposed to make Vice Industry Tokens work on their site, alleging the company had failed to deliver. Given the false starts of earlier attempts at building adult industry crypto systems, and widespread skepticism about fly-by-night operations in the crypto world, any early foibles, even entirely understandable and forgivable ones, could generate skepticism.Although startups like VogoV aim to partner with hundreds of porn sites and become ubiquitous and trusted within the next year, VRPorn’s Moore argues that most emerging porn-focused coin systems “have almost no traction whatsoever.” She believes that established tokens, like Bitcoin, will probably become the dominant crypto forces in the adult industry. Even if they are still somewhat volatile and don’t speak as explicitly to the needs of the adult industry, they similarly offer more efficient payments and new levels of consumer privacy. They also have larger and more active user bases and established payment systems and are easier to acquire for crypto novices by far.“I’m not sure why a payment system intended for porn would be chosen over a more mainstream coin,” she adds. “But maybe one of these projects will find a clever way to succeed.”Regardless of which types of tokens die or gain traction in the adult industry, though, Moore and others are convinced that crypto will slowly proliferate in the adult world as payment systems overall gradually grow better known, more widely used, and more intuitive.“Many of the technologies that we take for granted in adult today took years before they gained mainstream acceptance,” notes Hawkins. “When we think of the internet revolutionizing adult content, it actually took nearly a decade before it became the default point of consumption.”Update: This post has been amended to correct the spelling of ""Horizen."" "

Seen By Coinbase And Others",https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwolfson/2018/09/20/custodial-solutions-are-latest-innovation-in-cryptocurrency-ecosystem-as-seen-by-coinbase-and-others/,"“As Bitcoin and Ether are not defined by the SEC as funds or securities, 
these assets do not need to be held by a qualified custodian.","Sep 20, 2018,12:30pm EDT",Man looking through telescope forecasting bitcoin future,"Custody solutions (products offered by third party providers of storage and security services for cryptocurrencies) have become the latest innovation to emerge from the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The introduction of custodianship is expected to herald the entry of institutional capital into the industry, acting as the missing link investors and fund managers have been seeking for entrance into the crypto market.The largest U.S. cryptocurrency operator, Coinbase, estimates $20 billion worth of crypto is sidelined until custody solutions make sense. Sam McIngvale, who’s leading the Coinbase Custody project, believes that crypto assets will flow into custody services once they become readily available.“Coinbase Custody’s mission is to make digital currency investment accessible to every eligible financial institution and hedge fund in the world,” McIngvale wrote in a Coinbase blog post.This past June, Coinbase announced its Coinbase Custody product upon completion of their first successful deposit. The product is essentially Coinbase’s proprietary cold storage-as-a-service, wrapped in a regulated entity with robust insurance and additional client services.It was also announced last week that the multinational investment bank, Citigroup, will offer crypto custody solutions to institutional investors. Citigroup launched a product called “Digital Asset Receipt” (DAR), which is intended for institutional investors to securely invest in cryptocurrencies in a fully regulated and secure manner.And BitGo, the market leader in institutional-grade cryptocurrency security, has also revealed that the South Dakota Division of Banking has approved BitGo Trust Company as a public South Dakota Trust Company. This makes BitGo Trust Company the first qualified custodian purpose-built for storing digital assets.Custody has been the missing piece of cryptocurrency market infrastructure and this gap has kept institutional investors out of the market. Traditional custodians don’t have experience handling cryptocurrency. Exchanges that double as custodians present a conflict of interest and raise regulatory concerns. BitGo Trust Company is a qualified custodian, and therefore the only custody offering that delivers the highest levels of both security and regulatory compliance, said Mike Belshe, CEO of BitGo.According to Shahla Ali, Chief Compliance Officer at BitGo, the current state of the cryptocurrency market is broken due to a lack of custody offerings that resemble traditional financial models.Currently, you have large cryptocurrency exchanges, institutions and broker dealers holding crypto assets. All of these players are acting in a centralized manner to trade, deal and advise, while holding custody of digital assets. But this doesn’t happen in today’s traditional financial market. The crypto industry is another asset class and it should fit into the traditional financial model. We need to address this problem now by allowing institutional investors an option to custody their assets in a secure environment that resembles a traditional asset protection model, Ali told me.Other players like LOBSTR, the leading wallet in the Stellar ecosystem, also announced this week the launch of XDB Labs LLC, and will soon introduce XDB Wallet, to support custodial and wallet storage for digital assets on the DigitalBits public blockchain.DigitalBits is a fork of the Stellar blockchain, serving as a protocol focused on becoming the transaction and trading layer of certain digital assets, including the points economy. XDB Labs’ inaugural product, XDB Wallet, will act as a complete solution to manage and hold the DigitalBits native token, XDB, as well as other assets built on the DigitalBits blockchain.“We are excited to have the LOBSTR team join our partner ecosystem and build out a range of leading custodial and wallet solutions in the DigitalBits ecosystem. XDB Wallet will not only make management of digital assets, such as loyalty and rewards points, simpler, but also provide incomparable levels of security for its users,” said Al Burgio, CEO of the DigitalBits Foundation.What About Regulation?Not surprisingly, as more crypto custodial solutions enter the ecosystem, questions around regulation have also come to mind. According to the SEC regulation as part of the Dodd Frank Act, institutional investors that have customer assets worth more than $150,000 are required to store the holdings with a qualified custodian.  Most investment advisers are required by the SEC to keep client funds with a qualified custodian. For this reason, it’s particularly notable that BitGo has received approval from the South Dakota Division of Banking as a recognized public South Dakota Trust Company. BitGo Custody offerings provide the strict policies, procedures, controls, and disclosures that are only guaranteed with a qualified custodian. Although we can’t say that the South Dakota Trust Company meets the full requirements of the SEC for custody of traditional assets, we do believe that receiving the South Dakota Trust charter allows us to become the first, digital-asset custodian that is actually tailored for crypto assets. South Dakota is also the most prolific in terms of trust companies charters utilized by companies like Citibank, Wells Fargo and other large organizations that choose to do their trust charters in South Dakota. We wanted that oversight, hence BitGo’s choice of South Dakota as a regulator, explained Ali.Coinbase Custody is also a qualified custodian offering, through their partnership with ETC. However, according to McIngvale of Coinbase, a question that is not typically asked is whether or not all crypto investors actually need qualified custody?“As Bitcoin and Ether are not defined by the SEC as funds or securities, these assets do not need to be held by a qualified custodian.  Also, another question to ask is if anyone is actually able to offer qualified custody services for crypto right now? I think other than Coinbase and ETC, the answer is no, and there is a complete misunderstanding of that in the marketplace,” McIngvale told me.As the crypto ecosystem continues to advance, issues around regulations should gain clarity. In the meantime, custodial solutions have become the next wave of innovation to hit the crypto market, especially as more interest is seen from institutional investors."

Bloomberg reported that large buyers such as hedge and endowments funds have been consistently purchasing over $100,000,000 worth of digital coins through private transactions.Miners are now scheduling regular, over-the-counter (OTC) coin sales. Some have even set up their own liquidity desks and operations to accommodate the estimated $250 million to $30 billion in trades.Previously, large investors have stayed clear from the crypto-investing space due to high volatility of the key currencies. As bitcoin and ether prices have seemed to reach certain equilibrium this year, more and more traditional financial institutions have started diversifying their portfolios with crypto assets.For individual investors, this active interest from larger player presents a range of new opportunities as well.New crypto-investment products are underwayConsidering the current demand, large investment firms will not stay away from launching dedicated crypto-investment products for much longer. In fact, Goldman Sachs Group has just become the first investment bank to offer a bitcoin trading product to its customers. At the beginning of November, the company started onboarding a small number of clients to test their new crypto trading desk, which allows trading bitcoin non-deliverable forward contracts.Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the owner New York Stock Exchange, has also scheduled a launch of their bitcoin futures product for later in December. The contracts will be backed by bitcoin reserves held in ICE’s Digital Asset Warehouse, meaning that actual bitcoins will change hands once the contract expires. All futures contract will also be validated through ICE Clear U.S.“Legislative changes regarding financial products are bringing in more transparency and legitimacy to the crypto-trading space,” said Hayato Terai, Co-CEO of G8C token-issuing GanaEight Coin Ltd., a Ganapati Group company. “The ICO space will soon undergo similar changes as well. With better regulations and security mechanisms such as tokenized securities and stablecoins already being introduced, we should expect more interest and participation from institutional investors.”Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs’ Principal Strategic Investments Group and Galaxy Digital Ventures LLC jointly invested in BitGo’s product – a new generation custodian purpose-built wallet for storing digital assets, designed specifically for institutional investors.Clearly, institutional investors are growing their tech muscle to accommodate more crypto-trades. Individual investors should definitely stay alert for the new products entering the market.Institutional investors can prevent market imbalanceLarge volume crypto purchases took place over the counter to avoid swinging the crypto markets and crashing the exchanges. A lot in the industry fear that bitcoin liquidity may soon become a problem due to institutional investors’ participation. However, during the past two months, the crypto markets remained stable despite large volume purchases and did not tick upside.In fact, institutional investors can “anchor” the current market whales, possessing significant crypto holdings and capable to distort crypto prices with little-to-no consequences. Unlike individuals, financial institutions are largely restricted in their abilities to manipulate the markets on a large scale. So their active presence may actually contribute to more stable prices.Crypto-trading security will likely improveOne of the biggest issues preventing further market penetration for institutional investors is the lack of proper, secure infrastructure. At the moment, only a handful of custodians meet the security standards imposed by regulators.Additionally, most players have not yet figured out the optimal KYC procedures for their customers. In fact, a staggering 68% of cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the U.S. and Europe are not fully KYC compliant. Most of them allow users to trade fiat and cryptocurrencies without providing any identification documents or undergoing a KYC check. Trust in the crypto trading space remains low, especially among the regulators, who, in turn, try to push stronger regulations and verification procedures.However, most institutional investors are now working closely with the regulating bodies to develop clear KYC/AML policies and guidelines that favor both parties. Crypto EFT is getting closer to the approval with the SEC in the US. In Switzerland, Crypto Fund AG has recently become the first and only crypto asset manager, authorized by the local Financial Authority. The precedent has been set and more international regulators will move forward with approving new financial tools for both institutional and individual investors.Institutional investors offer a fresh inflow of capital and liquidity and propel the development and adoption of new regulatory frameworks. Ultimately, this will add more transparency and legitimacy into the crypto trading space and push the markets further. It's too early to assess the exact impact of institutional money in the space, but clearly, it signifies a new major milestone for the cryptocurrencies."

Agents were tipped off by four crypto enthusiasts who’d invested in Bitcointopia but who hadn't received land deeds from Rockcoons.In June Rockcoons tweeted that this was Bitcointopia's first town hall.The problem, according to the Nevada Records Office and federal law enforcement, was that Rockcoons owned only 4.9 acres of land in Nevada (which he paid $4,300 for, or around $877 an acre), despite Bitcointopia having “sold” over 18 acres by the end of July.To make matters worse, Rockcoons launched Bitcointopia while on pretrial release after allegedly running an unlicensed money transmitting business through which he exchanged more than $10,000 for bitcoin with an undercover agent without reporting the transaction.Las Vegas-based attorneys David Chesnoff and Richard Schonfeld have been retained by Rockcoons to fight the earlier charge of unlicensed money transmitting and told the San Diego Union-Tribune that Rockcoons will also plead not guilty to this latest charge.Neither Rockcoons nor Chesnoff and Schonfeld have yet responded to Forbes' request for comment.President Trump has yet to reply to Rockcoons’ tweet."

A quick look at any social media platform will reveal partisans on both sides of the aisle, vigorously debating pretty much every policy issue we face. It's not apathy, it's the friction involved in the process, a friction I have come to know first hand.Nine million votes are cast from overseas, about 6.5% of all votes tallied in the 2016 election. While in California earlier this year, I registered with the Secretary of State for an absentee ballot to be delivered by email. Now here I sit, a week before the election and I have still not received my absentee ballot. I could attempt to use the Federal Write-In Absentee ballot, but the last email I received from the state mentioned that I needed to mail in my ballot four weeks prior to election day.Voting process friction is not the only issue. Voter suppression is a far greater concern. This can often be done through voter purges or poll closures which create voting conditions in favor of the political party making those decisions. A transparent digital system of voting would not only help reduce friction for expatriots, voter suppression would become dramatically more difficult, with attempted purges leaving clear trails and poll closures no longer a concern.Many of us are expecting a blue wave to sweep through the U.S. on November 6th, but those frictions, accidental or intentional, may depress turnout and skew results. Even with a successful blue wave, having such a gap between possible and actual voters means that our government is not acting in accordance with a true democratic majority. Our democracies are long overdue for a technological upgrade to their voting process, one that is built built for a modern, globally connected and mobile world.So how will I be able vote from my apartment in Paris when my passport still reads U.S.A.? The blockchain technology behind Bitcoin may play a very important part.One of the biggest issues around digital voting is the concept of vote scarcity. One person should not be able to vote multiple times. This becomes a much bigger risk than a single individual accidentally voting twice. Nation state influencers like Russia may seek to manipulate our election outcomes. They need only impersonate a few hundred voters here and there to swing tight races. The 2016 presidential election famously swung on a total of 80,000 votes in three key states.Ensuring digital scarcity has actually been a problem for many years. The music and movie industries had issues with this, as it was basically impossible to stop someone from creating a copy of a file and sharing it online with a few hundred thousand of their closest friends.This is where Bitcoin comes in, as the very first digital asset that has true scarcity. It is essentially impossible to counterfeit Bitcoin. The innovation that enables this feature is a transparent, distributed ledger called the blockchain, and a consensus mechanism that requires a real world scarce asset, electricity, to be spent to validate legitimate transactions. What does that mean for voting? It means the same technology and principles of Bitcoin, which is a scarce asset that most closely represents money or gold, can be applied. Digital voting can be done on a transparent ledger, in real-time, over the internet, from anywhere in the world, with voting scarcity that is unhackable, with the right blockchain. That’s correct, no more risk of foreign hackers secretly adjusting things to suit their government.How do we actually apply this technology to the real world? I sat down with two companies, Voatz and Democracy.Earth, who are leveraging this technology to make transparent digital voting a reality.Voatz is a digital voting platform that combines smartphone biometrics, ID verification and blockchain to create a secure and streamlined experience. They have worked with 34 elections, including Tufts university, where they saw a voter turnout increase of 100% on student body elections over the two years the university had been using the system. And for the 2018 U.S. midterm they are piloting their system in West Virginia, permitting overseas voters to participate by mobile phone.Voatz Front PageHilary Braseth, the Director of Product Design & Communications at Voatz, shared how things are being done in West Virginia.We have worked with major state political parties, local towns and cities, internal conventions for political parties and universities. What really sets us apart in the market is the combination of biometrics, ID verification and blockchain. While the process for how Voatz works typically depends on the needs of the election administrator, here is how it is working in West Virginia. Overseas voters register to vote as an absentee through the federal voter assistance program. For most options, people can choose mail, email & fax. In West Virginia, people can also request a mobile ballot. If mobile ballot is chosen, Voatz sends an invitation to the user to download the application on a smart phone. Not all phones are secure, so the application only works with certain smart phones we deem secure enough.Once you download the application, you sign up with an email and phone number, which checks whether a person with matching information has registered to vote within the state, then it links your identity to your device. Next, you take a photo of your ID and a live selfie, which requires blinking eyes, and looking up and down to make sure you are a real person. Once the selfie is matched to the ID and the ID is matched to the email and phone number, your personally identifiable information is deleted on Voatz and you are able to access your account with a biometric key, such as a thumbprint or a facial scan. Forty five days prior to the election date, the voters receive their mobile ballot, which is designed to look and feel exactly like the ballot a voter would receive on election day. Along with this ballot are blockchain-secured tokens. The user gets one token per each candidate on the ballot. After you make your voting decisions, you validate your answers with your biometrics, the vote tokens are debited from your account, and credited to the candidates of choice.Leveraging blockchain-secured tokens, Voatz is able to ensure that there will never be more votes than there are registered voters. Just like with Bitcoin, the transactions are all pseudonymous, and the manner in which Voatz handles your identity makes your choices anonymous to anyone looking from the outside.When I had previously written about Voatz, they were leveraging the most secure blockchain, Bitcoin’s blockchain. For the West Virginia pilot, they are operating a permissioned blockchain built using the Hyperledger Framework, with about thirty known nodes, or vote validators, made up of different stake holders, such as the Secretary of State, universities and members of different political parties. We are about to see the first U.S. citizens voting through a blockchain-powered mobile application on November 6th. I can’t wait to see the results.Santiago SiriDemocracy.Earth is an interesting and ambitious solution that takes a very different approach on modernizing the voting experience. The 501c3 non-profit company came out of the globally renown startup incubator, Y-Combinator, in 2015 with the goal of creating a new kind of democratic system which involves liquid democracy, a hybrid system between a representative and direct democracy. I spoke with Santiago Siri, CEO of Democracy Earth, to learn more,I am originally from Argentina, a country with lots of corruption and inefficiencies within it’s economic system. My discovery of Bitcoin in 2011 was love at first sight. Finally there was an ability to escape the financial system of my country, to use tools that compete with the corrupt tools of my government. Democracy.Earth started in 2012, when I created a political party called “Partido de la Red” or the internet party. The goal of this party was to try to connect the internet with democracy. Candidates would vote according to how citizens vote online. We began researching how to do this, realizing that the technology behind Bitcoin would be crucial for this. In 2015, we were invited by Y-combinator to move out of Argentina and tackle the problem of digital liquid democracy from a global perspective. Democracy.Earth focuses specifically on the intersection of blockchains and voting systems.In 2016, we piloted a use case for Colombian expats to vote on whether to make peace and reintegrate FARC back into society. We allowed for a simple Yes/No vote as well as Yes/No for specific items on the agenda. While society as a whole voted no, we were able to pin point the exact measure in the peace agreement that was the deal breaker, being that the FARC would be able to establish it’s own political party within the current columbian government.On November 15, we will be releasing our flagship Sovereign platform, which is an open source software that allows pseudonymous social media participants to discuss political issues and vote on both mandates and candidates for all types of governing bodies. One thing we have realized is that the internet is no longer compatible with the nation state. The influence of Facebook on the outcome of an election is unmistakeable with the influence that fake news and Russian propaganda has had in the past. While governments currently take a hostile stance about how social media affects voters, we want to embrace it.Democracy.Earth wants to create a digital governance model that connects the influence of social media with the direct ability to vote, all while protecting the identity of individuals and ensuring that no bots, AI or fake accounts are able to penetrate the network.How does it work?Sovereign PlatformThe first thing you need is a digital identity. With Sovereign, you will never need to reveal anything about yourself directly onto the network, such as an email, a birthdate or a phone number. All you need is a public address with a correspondent private key to sign transactions. To obtain a unique identity, that wallet will need to receive a token that uniquely represents that identity, in our case, a non-fungible ERC-725 token. In order to get that token, it must be proven that the public address belongs to a living human and that this living human does not have access to any other ERC-725 tokens. This cannot be done through computers, as computers are only able to identify trends or patterns, not other human beings. To ensure that the system does not have bots, we need to leverage our perception of each other. This means we will have a consensus mechanism involving votes by real humans on the generation and distribution of ERC-725 tokens.Once you have your unique identity, you are able to vote. From a vote administration perspective, there are on-chain and off-chain votes. On-chain votes are expensive, but incorruptible. Votes are signed transactions with your public key which are then published onto an immutable, public blockchain. Off-chain votes are more scalable and less expensive, but are less secure. This is done through a proof of stake mechanism, where a cryptographic message is signed by your private key and weighted by the amount of stake you have. This signed signature can then be used on any application off chain.From the perspective of the user, we provide the liquid democracy model. What this means is that people can vote on the voting measures directly or they can delegate those votes to someone else, whether it be a candidate, an organization, a community leader or even a friend.In the upcoming November 6 elections, the number one worry on everyone’s mind is voter turnout. A new model for vote delegation has the opportunity to greatly increase voter turnout. Instead of not voting because of lack of knowledge or lack of time, people can assign their voting power to people they believe in while having the freedom to take back their vote or assign that vote to another person at anytime.But why stop there? Instead of thinking about how we can apply blockchain to the current way we vote, maybe we should think about how we can leverage blockchain to make it better? Why can’t we delegate our votes on a finer grained scale? Why do our votes have to be once every two to four years? Why can’t we decide to vote more directly on the measures being introduced?Perhaps we need an infrastructure upgrade that goes beyond our current election process.A previous version of this article previous mentioned the phrase ""IBM's Hyperledger Framework"".  IBM contributes to an open source project hosted by the Linux Foundation called Hyperledger Fabric. The phrase ""IBM's"" have been removed."

Cryptocurrency",https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwolfson/2018/11/13/cryptojacking-on-the-rise-webcobra-malware-uses-victims-computers-to-mine-cryptocurrency/,"Cryptojacking is an illegal process in which hackers hijack a users 
computing power to mine for cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin and monero.","Nov 13, 2018,12:01am EST",Getty,"The rise of cryptocurrency has resulted in a number of concerns. Yet while regulations and cryptocurrency hacks seem to be the primary worries, a new threat known as “cryptojacking” has entered the picture.Cryptojacking is an illegal process in which hackers hijack a users computing power to mine for cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin and monero. Funds are then sent to the hacker in control of the software.Computers infected with cryptojacking malware run much slower, and often victims are not even aware that their computers are being attacked, as “coin mining” malware is difficult to detect. Once a machine is compromised, a malicious app runs silently in the background with just one sign: performance degradation. As the malware increases power consumption, the machine slows down, leaving the owner with an unwelcome bill, as the energy it takes to mine a single bitcoin can cost anywhere from $531 to $26,170.And while cryptojacking is a relatively new threat, a recent report from the Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA) indicates a massive 459% increase in the rate of illegal cryptojacking this year. According to a report from McAfee Labs released in September, after growing around 400,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017, new crypto mining malware samples increased by 629% to more than 2.9 million samples in Q1 of 2018. This trend continues in Q2 as total samples grew by 86% with more than 2.5 million new samples detected.A New Silent Killer: WebCobraMcAfee Labs researchers have now discovered a new Russian cryptojacking malware, known as “WebCobra.” WebCobra infects a victim’s computer by silently dropping and installing the Cryptonight miner or Claymore's Zcash miner, depending on the architecture WebCobra finds. McAfee researchers believe this threat arrives via rogue PUP installers and have observed it across the globe, with the highest number of infections occurring in Brazil, South Africa, and the United States.While McAfee researchers are not entirely sure how this threat propagates, the WebCobra malware is unique in that it does everything possible to learn about the victim’s system.What is particularly interesting about WebCobra is that it learns everything possible about the user’s system, like what kind of architecture they are running, if there is anti-virus technology, etc. This cryptocurrency mining malware is also uncommon in that it drops a different miner depending on the configuration of the machine it infects. For instance, the main dropper is a Microsoft installer that checks the running environment. On x86 systems, it injects Cryptonight miner code into a running process and launches a process monitor. On x64 systems, it checks the GPU configuration and downloads and executes Claymore's Zcash miner from a remote server,"" Raj Samani, Chief Scientist and McAfee fellow, told me.After launching, the WebCobra malware drops and unzips a password-protected Cabinet archive file with this command:The command to unzip the dropped fileWebCobra is a nuisance infection - once you are infected, you don’t even know about it. And if you don’t have updated security software on your computer and it’s running slowly, you might not even know the reason why. With ransomware, there is usually a big splash on the screen telling you your computer has been infected. WebCobra is an infection that silently sits in background and uses your computing resources,"" Samani said.Increasing Cryptocurrency Prices Fuels CryptoJackingMcAfee researchers have also discovered that the rise of cryptojacking, particularly in the case of WebCobra, is tied with the rise of cryptocurrency prices. The increase in the value of cryptocurrencies has inspired cybercriminals to employ malware that steals machine resources to mine crypto coins without the victims’ consent.For example, the following chart shows how the prevalence of miner malware follows changes in the price of Monero cryptocurrency:The price of cryptocurrency Monero peaked at the beginning of 2018. The total samples of coin miner... [+] malware continue to grow.The growth of cryptojacking is tied closely with the price of cryptocurrencies. As the price of digital currencies increase, people will naturally want to mine more. In the case of the chart above, as the price of Monero goes up, you see the mining malware increase. As the price of Monero, decreases you see the malware respond to that. We are seeing a rise in cryptojacking as digital currencies increase in value,"" Samani said.Victims Of Organized CrimeWhile it may appear that consumers should be most aware of cryptojacking, this form of organized crime is impacting governments and enterprises as well.Cryptojacking isn’t just a story for the consumer, but also for enterprises. If you are paying for processing power in a cloud environment, then that will have a direct cost as well. Overall, this is just a numbers game. The more systems hackers infect, the more money they can make. If you are running a cryptojacking campaign, then most likely you don’t care where the people and businesses are from. People also need to understand that this isn’t just about your computer getting slower, but actually this is going to cost you money over the long term. We are talking about organized criminal gangs running these scams, making cryptojacking a form of organized crime that victims are helping fuel,""  Samani explained.Recently, researchers found that hackers stole the processing power of several Indian government websites to mine for cryptocurrencies. Citizen portals such as the municipal administration of Andhra Pradesh (AP), Tirupati Municipal Corporation and Macherla municipality are among the hundreds of Indian websites that were found to be infected by cryptojacking malware. Government websites in particular are prone to cryptojacking due to high traffic and because people tend to trust these websites.Cryptojacking is also targeting enterprise systems. PublicWWW found over 100 sites that are running Coinhive javascript, which mines Monero coin. The same script had earlier infected over 200,000 ISP-Grade routers globally and is among the top three crypto-mining malwares on the web.Moreover, in some cases, cryptojacking targets specific groups, rather than a broad field of potential victims. One cryptojacking malware strain has targeted gamers on a Russian forum by posing as a “mod” claiming to enhance popular games. Gamers were tricked into downloading the malicious software, which proceeded to use their computer resources for profit.And while crypto mining malware primarily targets PCs, other devices have become victims. For instance, Android phones in China and Korea have been exploited by the ADB.Miner malware into producing Monero cryptocurrency for its perpetrators.Protecting Yourself From CryptojackingUnfortunately, coin mining malware will continue to evolve as cyber criminals take advantage of this relatively easy path to stealing value. Mining coins on other people’s systems requires less investment and risk than ransomware, and does not depend on a percentage of victims agreeing to send money. Until users learn they are supporting criminal miners, the latter have much to gain.However, there are steps that can be taken to secure systems from being infected by coin mining malware. According to Samani, systems without any form of security are more prone to hacks.Good cyber hygiene is a must here. For instance, don’t click on random links and having updated security software is crucial in terms of the known mining software that’s out there. There are other things that can help such as browser add on extensions that can detect abnormal loads in CPU usage. However, the WebCobra virus is surreptitious. Of course, if your computer is running slow it doesn’t mean you have fallen victim to crypto mining, but you need the right technology to identify this problem.”"

How can you blame them? They have only started hearing about Blockchain and crypto during the bitcoin boom last year.","I say, it's time we know how to separate the technology from its application.Blockchain technology has the potential to cause a massive paradigm shift, that decentralizes systems and process for business, organizations, economies and governments. Blockchain technology simply engenders trust in inherently “trustless” interactions and negates the need to have a centralized intermediary to attest to events.Cryptocurrency for instance is an application of Blockchain technology that functions as peer-to-peer money without the input of banks as a central recording or settlement intermediary.""Compared to the internet, we're still very early. The internet was around for a while before the dotcom boom at the end of the nineties,"" tells me Ian Balina, a Blockchain influencer. ""There is a lot of volatility in the space, due to growth and speculation. Naturally, prices rise tremendously and fall tremendously. Each time this happens, the industry becomes more mature, with the current adopters filtering out the signal from the noise.”Unfortunately, Blockchain is still miles away from attracting the critical mass necessary to unlock its mass-market adoption. The results of a survey conducted by UK-based bank HSBC, last year revealed that 59% of customers polled have not heard about Blockchain and 80% of those who’ve heard about it don’t really understand what it is.Many people erroneously confuse Blockchain with Bitcoin and the earliest associations of Bitcoin with Silk Road is making many people averse to cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin came into limelight for its use on Silk Road as payment for illegal and borderline criminal activities because of the anonymity that it ensured in settling transactions.The subsequent media sensations of Silk Road and Bitcoin, and the eventual take down of the site and its operators succeeded in ensuring that many traditional financial institutions, businesses, and individuals would not entertain the idea Bitcoin as a means of payment.It is practically impossible to discuss Blockchain technology without a mention of its associations with cryptocurrency; hence, the first mention of Blockchain often evokes memories of Bitcoin and Silk Road. Nonetheless, Blockchain technology is fundamentally different from cryptocurrency. In fact, cryptocurrency is only of the many possible applications of Blockchain.Some fans believe Blockchain could change the world, but most of the ideas on the disruptive nature of this technology are still in landing pages, white papers and tech papers. For this most part, the truly disruptive applications of Blockchain technology beyond cryptocurrencies are still in ideation stage and it might take a couple of years before they even hit the market as MVPs.Interestingly, many of the enterprise clients that are experimenting with the technology are only using it to store their company data as they gradually reduce dependence on centralized data bases.Of course, some high-tech startups are already looking ways to use Blockchain to leverage existing technology. Nonetheless, the fundamental challenge is the chicken and egg paradox. Some companies won’t invest in seeing decentralized applications until there’s a mass-market adoption of the technology; unfortunately, there can’t be mass-adoption until there are market ready applications.“Blockchain is rapidly moving from the fat protocols stage, where all value is generated in the protocol layer, into the fat applications (DApps) stage, "" says Erez Ben Kiki, founder of 2Key Network, ""The foundations that have been built are strong enough to host applications, that will attract users that not necessarily interested in the financial side of it, but by the real usage.”The cryptocurrency market suffers huge volatility that is exponentially bigger than the kinds of volatility recorded in other assets such as stock and forex.  In the year-to-date period, the market cap of the entire cryptocurrency market has declined by 56% in contrast to massive gains in the same period last year.The SIFR Volatility Index for cryptocurrency is currently around 54.6 and it has been as high as 148.11 this year. For context, annualized historical, long-term average of realized volatility of the S&P 500 index is roughly 15%/year.The volatility in the cryptocurrency space and the collations between cryptocurrency and Blockchain, makes Blockchain, as a technology to be perceived as fragile and unstable. Unfortunately, the criticism and outright antagonism that cryptocurrency faces from traditional financial establishments invariably rubs off on Blockchain technology.Many traditional financial institutions believe that cryptocurrency is too volatile to be a reliable form of money – by implication, many people assume that Blockchain technology is inherently unstable or unreliable. Hence, other applications of Blockchain such as tokenization, Smart Contracts and automated governance are being overshadowed by the negativity surrounding cryptocurrencies.Interestingly, the Blockchain high-tech industry has seen some growth towards maturity in the past year. Gradually, it seems that entrepreneurs are coming to understand the need for such a technology and they are not afraid to dive into these uncharted waters.Ivan Liljeqvist, a well-known Blockchain influencer and the face of the ‘Ivan On Tech’ YouTube channel is optimistic: “Blockchain is an industry full of opportunities, we are open-sourcing finance and transforming the way Internet works by decentralizing digital money, computing and data."" "

Central banks need to embrace cryptocurrencies, Ver said. Photographer: Paul Yeung/Bloomberg","Over the past two years or so, many of my friends have asked me, “What is a cryptocurrency?” followed by, “Hey, why don’t you write a piece on this?”  I obliged this request last year and despite this, the requests have shifted to this: why has blockchain technology has become so popular? I have to wonder if cryptocurrency is just part of a complex saga such as Garcia-Marquez’ One Hundred Years of Solitude, but without the family tree at the front of the book for clarifications or if the issue is more about cultural interpretations of what cryptocurrency means for certain people.Some have written tutorials on this subject as well as Blockchain for Dummies all of which seem to have a positive slant on Bitcoin and “how it can work for you.” But does cryptocurrency really work for anyone? I mean isn’t buying cryptocurrency like buying stocks. According to John Hwang, former Senior Options Trader at Morgan Stanley, they are anything but, as he notes that cryptocurrency is prone to “pump and dump schemes” which favors insiders, lacks a deposit or any form of security insurance, is not backed by any assets or revenue, and lacks price consistency across exchanges that the SEC guarantees stocks. All this, plus the fact that banks in many countries like Switzerland and the United Kingdom have been rejecting companies that handle cryptocurrencies for fear of fraud and money laundering even if this posture has vastly shifted in recent months. Yet nothing is really explaining the popularity of these currencies culturally.For instance, many African nations like Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda and South Africa have embraced the blockchain experiment with exchanges being set up offering opportunities to the unbanked offering an opportunity, as some see it, to “democratize the economy.” Others view this sort of currency as a means of offering a third option to the current economic model, shifting from the public/private dichotomy. In fact, some view the financial collapse of 2007 purely the result of “public strategic assets run by private concessionaires” and the recent tragedy of Genoa’s collapsed Morandi bridge caused by Atlantia SpA, the private company holding the contract to the Italian highways, the result of lack of oversight when private companies take over public assets and safety. In short, one solution to the mishandling of public funds in the hands of the private or public sectors has been to hand this task over to the blockchain system which can manage strategic public assets.Perhaps the largest drive towards cryptocurrencies is the fact that there is no central authority on this product and it is based on maths instead of gold which is viewed, by many, as a democratizing force of economic power. No more is there the small entrepreneur against the larger corporations or the trust-fund babies who starts off with an advantage due to birthright. Cryptocurrency is viewed by many as a form of “employee equity” and as a “hedge against the future” of an already precarious job market. And we are seeing how popular this product is amongst the most experimental areas like London where a third of investors there back digital currencies as well as among millennials for whom financial stability is just a word as they grew up during the global financial meltdown. As Teddy Wayne writes for the Independent, he notes the younger generation as operating in a completely new way as opposed to savings, mutual funds and pensions: “As traditional paths to upper-middle-class stability are being blocked by debt, exorbitant housing costs and a shaky job market, these investors view cryptocurrency not only as a hedge against another stock market crash, but also as the most rational, and even utopian, means of investing their money.”Sure, crypto is hyper-volatile, but there is something about cryptocurrency which is appealing to many today just as day-trading appealed to many in the 1990s, then believed to be a get-rich-quick scheme (and it was for some) even if a majority of people lost money. The difference today is that for many in the developing world and millennials who see their futures as pre-determined by debt and the uncertainty of the precarious economic systems in place, cryptocurrency is their “glass half full” towards the future.  Even now many are using digital currency as their retirement fund as the degree of ""risk-taking"" is pretty much the same on either side of the equation. And why not reach for the new model which, at the very least, might offer a much needed change to the current system?With popular culture references to cryptocurrency making this venture seem more simplistic than it really is, this hasn’t stopped digital currency’s appeal to many because of its cultural currency. In “The Bitcoin Entanglement” episode on The Big Bang Theory, Sheldon attempts to teach the group a lesson about Bitcoin saying, “It’s a new online currency that’s been created. It’s just like actual money, except you can’t see it, hold it, or spend it on anything.” And the episode is a series of flashback to seven years earlier when Leonard and Howard write a program to mine Bitcoin with Sheldon being pessimistic about the whole affair. At the end of the episode, it is discovered that the Bitcoin that However and Leonard mined years earlier ended up on a Batman USB flash drive in the hands of Stuart who planned to erase the drive and sell it.While today we might wonder if Bitcoin is any more valuable in hapless Stuart’s hands than it is in real life, only those throwing caution to the wind in their current investments will be able to comment on their decision to take a risk. Personally, I hope the underdog wins—that African and Asian startups will prosper and that the millennials the world over who have been cut out of a post-neoliberal job market and economic security will be the future purveyors of a new system that reinvents the old. At the very least, these folks will be a wealth of knowledge on this subject for years to come."

This in a way is an example of the newness of the market. There are no sectors, indexes or ETFs--the market is judged by size alone.However, this is misleading, because all crypto are not the same.[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]An ERC20 token, which makes up a huge slug of the crypto landscape, is not a cryptocurrency like bitcoin. Tokens act like securities and are considered as such by the formidable regulators like the SEC. You can see a list here.Cryptocoins are currencies and are considered from a regulatorial position as commodities. Here is a list.Not all of these are equal. Some are centralized and unminable and some are, like bitcoin, decentralized and minable. Here is a list of distributed cryptocurrency built on the bitcoin model of distributed, trustless, decentralized tech-utopian ideal and ones that deviate by being centralized. Here's the whole universe.The key takeaway is that these categories are very different. They are as different as Forex is to stocks, as stocks are to commodities.All these categories might be huge but all might not survive. For instance, bitcoin is still the king and its share of the market has regrown in the crash. Initial coin offerings bubbled up the token market from nowhere but the new ICO landscape has almost evaporated for now. Yet ICOs represent a revolutionary way of raising finance and are highly likely to come storming back. Kickstarters are cool but ICOs are cooler still.The whole field is wide open and ripe for another boom event but investors need to split cryptos up into these three sectors, and there is a forth--blockchain equities. I predicted blockchain equities would explode and they did, in both senses. This phenomenon will come again and blockchain equities are already starting to twitch back into life as I write.Personally, I like blockchain equities and bitcoin and bitcoin-like decentralized minable coins. ICOs are definitely worth a look if they are more than pipe dreams floated by hucksters. That goes for the centralized private blockchain outfits too, if the structure of their coin is not a lobster pot for unwary gamblers.Which brings me to my final point and idea. I invest in what I call ‘blue crypts,’ which is a play on the words ‘blue chips.’ These are big cryptos I consider built for the long term. Investors should buy and hold blue crypts but trade the rest.Blue crypts can be what you want them to be but for me:That doesn’t mean you can’t HODL a minnow or trade a blue crypt but when you look at what is out there and ask, “What is a crypto blue chip, the universe of coins and tokens shrinks dramatically.What blue crypts do I own?I own a lot of coins but the blue crypts are bitcoin, litecoin, bitcoin cash, monero and dogecoin.No surprises there, but when you think about it, there shouldn’t be.For you there might be others, ethereum would be on most people’s list, but the idea is if you are going to invest you need a blue crypt backbone to your portfolio and only the very best should do. Otherwise you will be caught in the predicament of people that trade penny stocks and end up with a bag of dust and losses.Disclaimer: I own bitcoin, litecoin, bitcoin cash, monero, dogecoin and many other crypto coins.---------Clem Chambers is the CEO of  private investors Web site ADVFN.com and author of Be Rich, The Game in Wall Street and Trading Cryptocurrencies: A Beginner’s Guide."

In this climate, several projects and companies have shown flashes of great things to come.According to a brief research among industry veterans, followed are several blockchain projects and companies that might spark interest this upcoming year.This article is based on opinions, and is not a recommendation to invest, buy or sell any cryptocurrency related products or tokens. The crypto market is fragile, risky and you might end up losing your investment (or worse).New challengers emerge to take on EthereumWhile Ethereum has had a bumpy year, few doubt its future potential. In fact, many analysts are bullish and expect to see a trend reversal as we approach the end of 2018. However, global blockchain innovation is not slowing down and new players are dead set on grabbing Ethereum’s place in the crypto hierarchy. As we approach the year 2019, the following companies can be considered as top challengers to Ethereum’s perceived dominance. These three platforms have taken big leaps in recent months and pose a real challenge to Ethereum.QtumAs Ethereum and Bitcoin work hard to iron out their individual issues concerning governance, economics and security, Qtum continually refines their Proof of Stake platform. By incorporating the best parts of both Bitcoin and Ethereum, Qtum is a secure smart contract solutions representing what could eventually be a next phase of blockchain.The company recently released its x86 virtual machine, which will propel its value proposition over Ethereum by welcoming developers who code in any language. It has also encoded segwit by default, opening up interoperability with the Lightning Network (a cross-blockchain efficiency protocol).Qtum plans to launch QtumX in 2019, which will help major corporations take advantage of optimized smart contract automation, effectively welcoming the “mainstream” to blockchain.In a recent integration with Amazon, QTUM is providing a smart contract development platform on AWS marketplace. AWS users and developers will now have the ability to develop and launch smart contracts via an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) efficiently, and cost-effectively.TRONAt a time when new, disruptive platforms like Netflix are draining the dollars out of their respective industries, TRON aims to take it a step further.Instead of a centralized entity that chooses what content to host and how users can consume it, TRON puts this responsibility in the hands of the people. What results is a decentralized marketplace where people can host, store and consume user content on their own terms and free of middlemen.TRON takes action when it comes to developing itself, which was evidenced recently by its purchase of BitTorrent, and the launch of Project Atlas making it one of the largest decentralized networks in the world. As TRX is increasingly tied into the content ecosystem, people switch to the tokenized and tailored content subscription model instead of today’s buffet-style alternative.AelfAelf is building a scalable blockchain and decentralized cloud computing network. It wants to make blockchains more workable in the real world by increasing the number of transactions per second (TPS) that they can handle.While major blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin struggle to manage double-figures TPS, Aelf has proven that it can handle 15,000. This is done by splitting each single node into two clusters, spread over multiple computers.The goal is to make blockchains more feasible for businesses and enterprises that work with large volumes of data, bringing the technology into the mainstream.Standing on the shoulders of giantsSome blockchain ventures are a safer bet than others simply due to their association with accomplished, established and highly successful companies. Big companies are constantly looking for novel solutions to integrate into the company’s existing operations. In the following we look at three companies that have received the backing of global giants such as IBM, JD.com and Coinbase.VeridiumAnother industry said to be positively affected by blockchain is the environment and sustainability.  Veridium is an environmental blockchain company, producing sustainability solutions for Fortune 500 companies and collaborating with IBM.Using a set of proprietary protocols developed by EcoSmart Labs, this project has created a tokenized carbon offset solution, to bring new liquidity to environmental trading markets and create simplified carbon accounting for enterprise users. The protocols also offset the carbon emissions associated with the digital token itself, thereby mitigating the growing concern over the carbon emissions associated with the blockchain industry.CaspianAs cryptocurrency remains the top blockchain idea to gain adoption with retail users, and crypto assets mature, it becomes necessary to use more complex tools. For ambitious crypto investors, companies like Caspian have created a dashboard that allows one to build and control their own fund, including asset allocation and re-balancing tools, order execution management and connectivity with all major exchanges. Its crypto fund management suite is already in use, and partnered with Coinbase to deliver their solution to the masses.Caspian is an evolved cryptocurrency trade and risk management interface, like a universal remote commanding various exchanges, trades and assets in a portfolio.DeveryDevery is an open-source protocol for blockchain-based verification of goods and services. Coming out of JD.com’s accelerator, Devery removes the need for trust by leveraging unique, verifiable identifiers for products and services that are immutably stored on the blockchain.By providing open-source toolsets, users can integrate the Devery protocol that can be used to build application-level verification services. The inherent transparency of the underlying blockchain provides authentication and provenance, that facilitates a competitive market of third-party verification services - for specialty commercial markets such as ecommerce or luxury counterfeiting.Can blockchain startups disrupt innovative industries?Blockchain projects need a mixture of team, product, vision and developer engagement in order to reach a decent level.They also need to stay strong during the highs and lows of this fragile market. These companies are trying to change several different industries using blockchain.MediBlocSome of the industries blockchain was always counted on to disrupt, is the health industry. This project tackles the problem of centralized electronic health record data storage, by transferring data sovereignty back to the individual.MediBloc is a decentralized, open-source healthcare data platform, designed to give full ownership of personal data to patients with permissioned access control - and an opportunity to monetize its data. As part of its ecosystem, participants such as medical institutions, research organizations, insurers and healthcare providers can find a secure and transparent exchange of data.MediBloc intends to shift the medical data paradigm to a patient-centric approach, by building a medical information economic ecosystem with consumers at its core, and ability for medical services to be built on top of the platform.CardstackBlockchain exists in thousands of different shapes and sizes, and each platform or application built on blockchain is capable of something unique. The interoperability of all these disparate blockchains is an ever-present question facing the usefulness of blockchain, and while some have tried to connect blockchains, Cardstack suggests a different approach. Its system represents individual dApps or platforms as cards, and users can create custom business flows or services for themselves, by stacking different “cards” on top of one another or in a certain order.This open source framework is catching fire with developers who recognize its potential to scale blockchain for the mass market. The media is abuzz with rumors of new “Super dApps” spurred by the existence of platforms like Cardstack, which create the idea of “software orchestration”. Such a concept has a pertinent place in blockchain’s future and is likely to gain momentum in the coming years.CEEK Virtual reality (VR) is always a hot field. Some projects offer a universal, secure and transparent currency for the world of virtual reality. The VR industry is seriously growing, and CEEK is such company that wants to use blockchain and crypto tokens to allow flexible interactions and transactions - in a virtual universe.It has an existing VR infrastructure, including virtual venues where users can attend sports events, watch live music concerts, sit in classrooms and so on.Its token offers secure transactions and the ability for users to own virtual items. The platform uses proof of stake and voting to give users a level of control and choice over what happens in the virtual world. "

bitcoins ...","Sep 10, 2018,08:30am EDT",Getty,"(Disclaimer: Author holds investments in bitcoin and Ethereum.)Bitcoin has been compared to a new internet. It’s innovative, decentralized and will change the world, experts have said, but that’s an exaggeration. If you want to compare bitcoin to the internet, then cryptocurrencies aren’t the web but the websites. Ethereum, the technology that powers most cryptocurrencies, is like the World Wide Web, and the internet itself … well, that’s not bitcoin. It’s the blockchain.The blockchain is the distributed ledger that keeps track of where each bitcoin is located and where it comes from. It makes forging new bitcoins impossible and it prevents people from spending the same bitcoins twice. It’s an essential part of Bitcoin.But bitcoin represents only one use of the blockchain. A distributed ledger can be used to keep an unchangeable register of a host of different things, and companies are now busy spending millions trying to figure out what else they can do with it. Not all of those experiments will work. Most won’t. But a few will, and not only will they have significant effects on the way we live, but they’ll also affect the price of cryptocurrencies.One of the most promising areas for the blockchain is the sharing economy. A ledger that can keep track of the flow of digital coins can also follow the use of shared physical items such as bicycles, cars and even real estate. Ofo, one of China’s biggest city bike companies, announced in May that it would set up a blockchain research institute to look at how blockchain technology could improve the internet of things and facilitate big data.ShareRing is going even further. The company was formed at the start of 2018 to create “an eco-system for the rental economy.” Instead of focusing on one form of property—such as bicycles or mobile homes—any business or individual could use the service to rent out their goods. The company plans to launch an app in November that will already allow people to find goods that they want to use and arrange a rental agreement with the owner. Of course, it’s all secured by blockchain. The sharing economy has already changed the way we travel, making it simple to find a ride home in the city (think Uber) or a place to stay on the road (think Airbnb). Whether ShareRing turns out to be the application that powers the growth of that economy, it is already becoming clear that the blockchain’s ability to keep constant track of items used by large numbers of people make it an attractive technology in a hugely promising area.Banks And Beverage Companies Build On The BlockchainThe sharing economy is new and disruptive, like Bitcoin. But traditional businesses are also wondering what a distributed ledger can do for them. Last year, with UBS, banks like Barclays, Credit Suisse, HSBC, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, MUFG and State Street sought to develop a “utility settlement coin.” The coin would be convertible at parity with foreign currencies and would be used to settle international transfers. Other financial organizations involved in the project include BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank and Santander. The coin was expected to be released in late 2018.The linkage to fiat makes the banks’ digital currency very different from bitcoin, which floats freely and is highly volatile. The coin will also only be used by banking organizations, not consumers. But it would give the banks a quick and efficient way to settle international transactions, reducing transaction times, increasing reliability and clarifying audits.The banks’ efforts will look familiar to users of bitcoin, which was designed to make international transactions fast and cheap for everyone. But one experiment with the blockchain shows just how far the blockchain can go.Coca-Cola is now working with the U.S. State Department to produce a registry of workers in the sugar industry. The idea is to put the workers’ contracts on a blockchain built by Emercoin and the Bitfury Group so that agreements on work conditions can’t be changed and will always be accessible. The hope is that the transparency will increase pressure on employers to honor their contracts. By 2020, Coca-Cola says it hopes to be able to provide data regarding labor abuses, including child labor and forced labor in 28 countries. None of these three projects are guaranteed to succeed. To power the sharing economy, ShareRing will need to prove that the blockchain can keep track of shared goods more efficiently and more securely than current, centralized registers — and that there’s a demand for those goods. To find a role for a digital coin in international transfers, the banks will need to prove that their token is better at transactions than fiat currencies and current methods of moving them. To show that the blockchain should store workers’ contracts, Coca-Cola and the State Department will need to be able to point toward a decline in labor abuse.But if any those things do happen, the blockchain could receive a vital vote of confidence, and that confidence could spread across cryptocurrencies in general. More than 1,600 digital coins and tokens have now been launched, but few have produced a valuable service. Most never will — a failure that has contributed to the decline of cryptocurrency prices. The success of a blockchain venture, whether it’s in the sharing economy, traditional banking, labor issues or anywhere else, could help to prove that the blockchain has a real use and not just in creating digital coins. It will cause people to look again at those long lists of cryptocurrencies as they try to figure out which might represent real businesses. As they buy baskets of coins in the hope of landing the one that goes big, they’ll put upward pressure on prices.Keep an eye on blockchain technologies. A company could make it work and lift the entire sector with it."

or vice-versa. When trading crypto for crypto, it is extremely important ...","Oct 16, 2018,11:32am EDT",Credit: Getty / Royalty Free,"In the words of our country’s Founding Fathers, all [people] are created equal. But, in the world of fiat and monies, not all currencies are valued equally.Influenced by market inflation, debt, interest rates, trading agreements, and of course, political stability, the balance between any two currencies is in a state of constant fluctuation, directly impacting its exchange rate. An ""exchange rate"" is the price of a nation’s currency in terms of another currency. For purposes of this article, they are quoted in values against the U.S. dollar (USD).The Gateway To The Crypto WorldThere are two types of currency exchange rates—the spot exchange rate, or interbank rate, and the nominal exchange rate. From a consumer and traveler’s perspective, we often refer to the latter. The way in which we read and define an exchange rate is similar to how we measure cryptocurrency values against our own currency.Lesson #1: Why Are You Entering Into This World?For the novice, diving into crypto can be both exciting and overwhelming. Not only is there a need to decode the complexities of the technologies behind the currencies, but also a need in recognizing the difficulties associated with investing, trading, and monitoring them.But,  if you are entering the crypto world for the first time, there is one thing that is certain—you must understand how to trade and purchase.  Why? Not all coins are able to be purchased through fiat. Thus, you have to resort to using cryptocurrency exchanges.If you are getting into the space to make a quick buck, you better know how to earn that quick buck. If, on the other hand, you are in it for a long-term gain (and most likely some loss), you need to understand how the market works, especially as it pertains to exchanges.Lesson #2: What Are Crypto Exchanges?With over 1,600 cryptocurrencies in existence, there are only a select few exchanges available, allowing holders to convert their fiat or paper currency into the crypto-base currency (“base currency”) they desire (Bitcoin, Ether, or Litecoin). Consequently, some coins can only be purchased by using these bases, and cannot be bought using a domestic currency, such as the USD.It is for this reason that these three currencies (BTC, ETC, and LTC) are considered to be the “gateway” to the crypto world, and are identified as base currencies for cryptos.In its most basic definition, cryptocurrency exchanges allow an individual to do three things:Types of Cryptocurrency ExchangesBefore choosing an exchange, it is important to look at what it offers. There are three main cryptocurrency exchanges to be aware of:#1 –Centralized Cryptocurrency Exchanges (“CEX”)Similar to a traditional stock exchange, a centralized cryptocurrency exchange, or CEX, operates as the middle-man as between two parties. A “centralized” system means that one party is trusting another with some type of information, in this case, handling their money.The exchange, upon receiving a user’s money, holds onto it as a bank normally would. As an investor monitors market prices of available crypto on a particular exchange, he or she may want to trade their fiat for another crypto (trading pair), and eventually place an order.At this point, the exchange will find a seller(s) to match the buy, if they are selling, eventually, finding a buyer and completing the exchange. When the world of crypto exploded last year, platforms such as Coinbase, Robinhood, Kraken, and Gemini became extremely popular because it made it easy for fiat/crypto pairings.There are also exchanges out there that only provide crypto to crypto pairings–purchasing or acquiring one crypto, by trading in another crypto. Examples include the popular Binance, Huobo, and Bitfinex.But, more about trading pairs later on.Maintaining Your SecuritySince 2011, there have been over 60 cyberattacks aimed at cryptocurrency exchanges and other digital currency platforms. Renowned attacks including Mt. Gox (Japan, 2014), Bitfinex (Hong Kong, 2016), Coincheck (Japan, 2018), Coinrail (South Korea, 2018), and Bithumb (South Korea, 2018) continue to present a high potential for system crashes. But, what did each of these attacks have in common? The attacks were all targeted towards CEXs, attracting the attention of black hat hackers galore.Taking into consideration the security vulnerabilities these centralized systems contain, the idea of decentralized projects and ventures has exploded with two goals in mind–maintaining security and removing intermediaries so as to provide for efficient, direct transactions.On-Boarding the NoviceLooking at such a cyberattack such as Hong Kong's Bitfinex exchange, I decided to take a look and see how the Hong Kong (HK) market is responding to the space since I last traveled there. One company, Coinsuper, recognizes the seriousness of maintaining strong internal security, operating in the heart of central HK.Functioning as a “fiat to crypto” exchange, the platform allows for deposit and withdrawal in addition to BTC, ETC, LTC, and other popular token offerings. It has been consistently listed in the top fifteen exchanges by daily volume, globally, according to CoinMarketCap data.With less than 2% of the Hong Kong population involved in the crypto space, I learned that there aren't too many major “fiat to crypto” exchanges based in the Hong Kong/APAC region. Coinsuper aims to be the “on-ramp” for those individuals looking to on-board the space. “As an exchange, in order to successfully utilize “fiat to crypto” conversions, you have to be prepared for regulatory scrutiny,” said Kenny Shih, Executive Director of Coinsuper.“We pride ourselves on having this level of self-compliance within our framework; our head of the anti-money laundering (AML) division was also the former head of AML at HSBC Private Banking.”But, the company’s team is worth bragging about. Its CEO, Karen Chen, is the former president of UBS (China) Ltd. and its COO, Dr. Anthony Ng, a former Managing Director of CITIC Futures International, Morgan Stanley, and JP Morgan.When I asked Shih about the frequency of regulatory communication, he told me that they are in constant communication with both Hong Kong and Chinese regulators. “We want to be considered the model exchange out here, and thus, we are doing everything we can to follow the rules.”While self-funded, they have since entered into strategic equity partnerships with ventures such as Pantera Capital and 8 Decimal Group. In its 7-month life span, the exchange currently offers over 50 tokens and is heavily focused on the ""know your customer"" (KYC) approach, providing 24/7 customer service. It previously hosted a successful initial public sale for the Metadium project, helping it to raise over 5,900 ETH over a period of five days.Shih also told me that for young millennial investors, it’s important for them to embrace the online space as we all enter into what some call the “Web 3.0” phase of the net.#2 –Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchanges (“DEX”)The introduction of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies into our markets is the result of society expressing its view that transactions should be decentralized, or more closely connected to the transacting parties, without the need for intermediaries. Decentralized crypto exchanges, or DEXs, are created for the sole purpose of removing the middle man to any transaction. It is a marketplace where buyers and sellers come together and engage in transactions directly.These peer-to-peer (P2P) systems such as Stellar DEX and Waves DEX, are much harder to exploit and/or hack. From what we've seen, more often than not, it's the user who inadvertently locks themselves out of their account.While these seem to be a much better alternative to CEXs, popularity is still weaning. The reasoning behind this is the lack of commodity and overall user support, which would help to attract a mainstream user base. Until this happens, DEXs will continue to offer low volume and low liquidity. Personally, I would like to see this continue to gain popularity.#3 –Hybrids Lastly, the hybrid crypto exchanges are designed to combine the benefits from both CEXs and DEXs. The focus on this is to provide privacy and security of a DEX. While the first hybrid exchange, Qurrex, was launched earlier this year, the space is still looking to tighten functionality up with both systems.Lesson #3: Finding A Local Crypto Exchange That Accepts Your Domestic Currency The number of available exchanges that accept fiat currency are limited in the number of coins readily available for purchase.That is why a platform like Coinbase has become one of the most popular exchanges in the world, allowing investors to purchase Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Ethereum—all with their fiat. Other examples include Robinhood, Gemini, and Kraken.Keeping in mind the limited options most local exchanges provide, investors instead, look to purchase a base currency (BTC, LTC, ETH) in order to then purchase other crypto, or altcoins.Lesson #4: Going From One Crypto To AnotherSince a user cannot purchase altcoins directly from an exchange that accepts fiat, more likely than not, the user will not be able to determine the value of the altcoin based off their domestic currency.The term “trading pairs” describes a trade between one type of crypto and another. For example, if you were to look at the trading pair ETH/BTC, you’re looking at the potential to either buy or sell one for the other. A user can either buy Ethereum with Bitcoin, or sell Ethereum for Bitcoin, or vice-versa.When trading crypto for crypto, it is extremely important to understand how these trading pairs work.While not an economics lesson, be mindful of the potential tax implications associated whenever you convert one crypto to another crypto, or convert cash into crypto. Understanding why you are choosing to utilize one trading pair over another could be the difference between gaining and losing everything. Literally.Lesson #5: Regulation  When utilizing exchanges, take note of where the platform is licensed to exchange in money transmission. For example, Coinbase, is licensed to engage in money transmissions in most U.S. jurisdictions. Additionally, it is registered as a “money services” business with FinCen. This is worth mentioning because late last year, the IRS entered into an agreement with Coinbase to share user account information with it.The level of regulation differs with each exchange, so users should conduct their own due diligence when determining which platform may be best suited for their transacting needs.We have already seen platforms like Binance and Kraken finding its way into the New York Attorney General's Office for potential regulation violations. Back in February, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioner, Brian Quintenz, expressed favor towards operators adopting self-regulatory standards to help police the space.“I think a self-regulatory organization, or SRO, for cryptocurrency exchanges could spur the development of standards around cybersecurity policies, data retention, protection of customer accounts, trading practices and other issues.”At the end of the day, it is still extremely important to take appropriate safeguards to ensure your wallet, key, and any other associated information are stored in a safe place. Additionally, be mindful of where you are going to purchase and/or sell crypto.This space is a playground for black hatters looking to take you for a run for your money, so be smart and educate yourself first."

The study was conducted by consulting firm Accenture with support from the technology service providers Digital Asset (DA) and R3. The report does not mention enterprise blockchain startup Axoni, which announced a partnership with DTCC in 2016.“This project answered key questions and built serious confidence in blockchain’s ability to drive large scale transformation,” said David Treat, Managing Director and Global Blockchain Lead at Accenture, in a statement. To assess the capabilities of DLT in the equities market, Accenture built a network of more than 170 nodes to model the ecosystem of exchanges, market participants, and broker/dealers that DTCC supports. DTCC’s subsidiaries processed securities transactions valued at more than $1.61 quadrillion last year, and it provided custody and asset servicing for securities valued at $57.4 trillion. Its trade repository service maintains 40 million open OTC positions per week.While DTCC says the study proved that DLT is capable of processing an entire day's worth of U.S. trading volume at peak rates (115,000,000 trades, or 6,300 trades per second for five continuous hours), it noted that the study should only be used as a test of basic functionality. More tests will be needed to determined whether DLT can meet the other requirements of DTCC's current systems, like resiliency, security, and regulation. "

Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, still holds the top spot by a wide margin however, with a total market value of $113 billion.Ethereum, which is traded through the digital token ether, has been heavily sold off this year. Many believe this is because of the huge number of so-called altcoins that were built on the ethereum blockchain last year, only to be sold off throughout 2018.Ripple (XRP) has now become the second biggest cryptocurrency in the world, according to... [+] CoinMarketCap data.Ethereum is down some 84% so far this year, falling from around $1,400 to just $215. Ripple meanwhile has decreased by about the same amount, peaking at $3.71 at the beginning of the year and dropping as low as $0.26 earlier this month. Ripple began 2017 at just $0.006.Today's latest surge, which has pushed ripple up by almost 25% in 24 hours, was sparked by the announcement U.S. cryptocurrency exchange and wallet provider Coinbase is considering listing more cryptocurrencies.""Today we’re announcing a new process that will allow us to rapidly list most digital assets that are compliant with local law, by satisfying listing requests in a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction manner,"" Coinbase said in a blog post. ""In practice, this means some new assets listed on our platform may only be available to customers in select jurisdictions for a period of time.""Many have taken this to mean ripple could be listed on the platform, though it is far from guaranteed, opening up a whole new segment of the market to trade the token on what is the number one U.S. cryptocurrency exchange.The price was given a further boost by Nigel Green, founder and CEO of investment advisor deVere Group, predicting ripple will rise to $1 per token by the end of 2018.Green said:Cryptocurrencies are the future of money and, clearly, XRP is proving to be one of the most useful cryptocurrencies for businesses, organizations, and individuals. The use of XRP is set to increase, and naturally, this will positively impact its price. I think it is likely that we’ll see it hit the $1.00 price level before year-end. It could even be double this in 12 months’ time as XRP adoption and usage soars.""XRP has been cleverly positioning itself to become a leading international facilitator of global remittances and inflows,"" Green added. ""This is a huge and growing market, especially in the emerging economies of Latin America, Asia and Africa.""The ripple price fell earlier in the week after more than doubling in price last week.Last week's more than doubling of the ripple price was brought on by the company behind the tradable token, Ripple Labs, saying it's close to launching a new product that could help banks speed up transactions using XRP — amongst other developments that boosted sentiment.Ripple, which was created back in 2012 by Ripple Labs (making it one of the oldest cryptocurrencies), sets itself apart from many other major digital tokens by working directly with the established financial services sector."

Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies are showing signs of doing the same. Blockchain is a technology platform that uses cryptography, algorithms and participant incentives to enable secure transactions without regulation and validation by a major institution. Cryptocurrencies are a key class of applications enabled by blockchains: e.g., Bitcoin or Ethereum.","Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain have fascinated the start-up and venture investor community for the last four years. Techcrunch counts ~1,500 Blockchain-related start-ups that have raised about $4.0 billion since 2012. Plus, in the last two years at least $10 billion has poured into public sale of newly created cryptocurrencies, called ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings: the unit of cryptocurrency is a “coin”). Prestigious venture capital investors have come to the party, e.g., Union Square Ventures was an early investor in Blockchain-related businesses.Photo credit: Getty Royalty Free.Boosters make the case that Blockchain technology is a disruptive force that will create new markets and topple mighty incumbents. It promises a better way to implement key functions of an information economy: moving money, keeping important records, maintaining security, providing privacy to users. How is it better? Blockchains are claimed to be highly secure. Blockchains are free of control by major institutions: governments, banks, health insurers, etc. And the rise of the Blockchain ecosystem creates an impetus to redesign processes such as identity verification or credit assessment using modern architecture and understanding of customer needs.These characteristics fuel the disruptive instinct of young entrepreneurs and remind investors of the wealth creation driven by past technology waves like PCs and the Internet. The Blockchain ecosystem has become a recognized new, new thing, attracting a corps of bright and ambitious entrepreneurs, many from Stanford. They have developed sophisticated schemes to move key parts of the economy to Blockchain; these schemes are laid out in “white papers” that often become the offering document (like an informal S-1) for an ICO of the cryptocurrency that is part of the proposed business model.ICOs are potent oxidizer for this rich venture fuel: they provide large amounts of capital on entrepreneur-friendly terms. ICO pitches that I have seen promote the potential for growth in the value of the coins, arguing that the new ecosystems built on Blockchains will give value to the coins needed to transact in them. They point to run-ups in the value of early coins such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The promoters emphasize that cryptocurrencies are liquid by design, so investors can exit whenever they wish by selling coins on a Cryptocurrency exchange. I’ve heard generally-sober venture investors enthuse over ICOs: “I’m not a speculator, of course, but you could make a lot of money fast doing this!”However, evidence now accumulating indicates there is little steak behind all this sizzle. Cryptocurrencies are not used much for payments: Chainanalysis estimates that the volume of Bitcoin transactions was about $60 million/month in May 2018, sharply down from 2017 levels, and an infinitesimal fraction of global financial transactions. And Cryptocurrencies’ volatility makes them a poor choice as a store of value or unit of account (the other main uses of money). The Economist in a recent article concluded that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are useless. Warren Buffett’s verdict is earthier: “Bitcoin is probably rat poison squared”.Some impediments to Bitcoin transactions like high transaction costs and few places to spend could diminish with time. Others are hard to overcome. Bitcoin has security vulnerabilities: cyberattacks have hit the exchanges that translate Bitcoin to official money regularly, most notoriously when $473 million was stolen from Mt. Gox. And, the IRS requires Bitcoin to be reported on the tax return like a sale of stock, creating gain or loss.Blockchain evangelists often say that the true value of the Blockchain is its ability to create new businesses and disrupt important, established ones, not just to enable Cryptocurrencies. Their advocacy often has moral/political overtones: “Bitcoin is not just mere speculation, it’s a movement. There’s a growing number of individuals favoring the principles embodied by Bitcoin’s decentralized network instead of the established banking systems.”Although many disruptive Blockchain businesses have been proposed, no important example of disruption by Blockchain technology is yet visible. This could be a matter of time, of course. However, strong arguments are surfacing that make a case that the usefulness of Blockchain is fundamentally limited. Jimmy Song analyzed Blockchain’s potential for commercially useful systems and found a series of important limitations:Resource-intensity, which drives cost of Blockchain transactions, is a big obstacle to growth and disruption. Alex de Vries, a bitcoin specialist at PwC, estimates that the current global power consumption for the servers that run bitcoin’s software is a minimum of … 22 terawatt-hours per year—almost the same as Ireland. A report published this year by the Bank of International Settlements, a keystone of the global financial system, said that “[Bitcoin, if scaled up] would eventually overwhelm everything from individual smartphones to servers … The associated communication volumes could bring the Internet to a halt.” Past predictions of Internet crashes have not come to pass; however, the key point is that Blockchain is expensive. In large-scale business cost is often king. The high costs created by Blockchain architecture will make it uncompetitive in many large-scale transaction-based businesses.The bottom line for entrepreneurs: don’t expect Blockchain to change the world anytime soon. Blockchain architecture faces an uphill battle in many large-scale applications. Major near-term impact will be limited to a few markets with lower transactions volumes and higher importance for security and direct end-user control of personal data: medical and personal financial records are possibilities. Much of the currently-vigorous activity in the Blockchain world is option-buying or pure speculation."

The first is a technological breakthrough that sparks interests in commercializing it.

It took a while to work out the commercial applications of the transistor, beginning with the radio, then, in a powerfully transformative way, in computers. The second is an existing demand waiting for a new technology to be invented to meet the need. The invention of the internal combustion engine in the 19th century fits this pattern. The industrial revolution led to proliferating demand for a machine that can provide rotary power to move mechanical devices, including powering land and water vehicles, and eventually aircraft. The internal combustion engine was the answer.The technology of blockchain and its application called Bitcoin, however, came as a single package. It is a digital currency without a central bank, with transactions verified and recorded in a distributed ledger, the blockchain. Along with the package also came the libertarian utopian hype that this is the beginning of a revolution that will make government, and indeed, any centralized authority, obsolete. And it was this hype, not any commercial success of Bitcoin, that powered an investment craze, pushing up the dollar value of Bitcoin to the stratosphere, spawning a whole host of other cryptocurrencies in the process. In 2017, schemers launched the so called initial coin offerings that attracted over $20 billions of investment, mostly from retail investors, according to the website Coinschedule. Since the beginning of this year, the dollar values of cryptocurrencies have collapsed. The two leading cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ether, collapsed most spectacularly, losing up to 70% of their dollar value, and it appears that the retail investors are also the ones who got hurt the most.So, what’s next for cryptocurrencies?It is abundantly clear by now that cryptocurrencies have utterly failed in their purported function as money. The text book definition of money stipulates three criteria: it must be able to serve as a medium of exchange, a storage of value, and a unit of account. As many have pointed out, cryptocurrencies have failed in meeting all three criteria. For example, see the lecture delivered by Augustin Carstens, general manager at the Bank for International Settlements, given at the Goethe University on Feb. 6. Very few day-to-day transactions are conducted with any of the cryptocurrencies, the exceptions are in the so-called dark web where they are used as anonymous medium of exchange of large transactions, equivalent to suitcases full of unmarked large denomination dollar bills that are favored by drug lords and terrorists. Their dizzying volatility means their values are mostly speculative, not for storage. And the fact that cryptocurrencies continue to define their value in dollar terms underscores how useless they are as a unit of account.
Apart from meeting the criteria of the text book definition, the function of money in a modern economy is also critically dependent on its institutional underpinning and support. Governments need to accept it as payment of taxes, the market must accept it for debt issuance, there must be a reasonable independent central bank that competently manages its supply to ensure price stability. In other words, the ability of money to perform all its critical economic functions are embedded in a deep sense of social trust secured with public institutions built around a central authority, the government.The failure of cryptocurrencies reveals that the attempt to do away with central authority and replacing it with self-governing and decentralized technology is nothing more than a pipedream.  In fact, as Nouriel Roubini, economist at New York University, has argued in his testimony to the U.S. Senate, the ownership and trading patterns of cryptocurrencies are highly concentrated in the hands of a small group of owners and companies, with over 99% of all transactions taking place in centralized exchanges. Roubini also pointed out that wealth is incredibly highly concentrated in the cryptocurrency universe. Wealth distribution in Bitcoin ownership is about twice as worse as income distribution in South Africa, a country with one of the worst levels of inequality in the world. In other words, instead of some kind of decentralized libertarian utopia, the patterns of ownership, transactions, and control reflect a highly centralized and undemocratic operating environment in cryptocurrencies.If cryptocurrency as a specific application of the blockchain technology has been a spectacular failure, what then of blockchain itself? Once we unbundle the package of blockchain and cryptocurrency, we are then back to the first pattern of technology commercialization: an invention looking for a viable commercial application. Because blockchain was invented to create Bitcoin, what else can blockchain do on its own is a matter of exploration. As yet, nothing has been proven. There are a number of experiments taking place, and significantly all of them are with direct involvement of either the government or regulatory authority. For example, several Japanese banks have recently launched a mobile app for domestic payment called Money Tap that is based on blockchain technology, but it was done with formal approval from the Ministry of Finance of the Japanese government, the operations of which will come under the usual government financial regulation and oversight. And because viable commercial applications of the blockchain technology have yet to be realized, the valuation of the technology today is therefore exactly zero. This does not mean that blockchain is useless. It could be the transistor of the 21st century, or it could end up in the garbage heap of technological inventions that failed to find a commercial application. We will have to wait and see."

Vector Illustration,"Following the collapse of the cryptocurrency market in June, many in the professional community have been asking big questions about what role cryptocurrencies play in society.While Nouriel Roubini continues with his passionate assertion that 99% of cryptocurrencies are worth ZERO  and that it is fintech, and not blockchain that will innovate the banking system, Fidelity, one of the largest mutual fund managers had just launched its crypto trading desks, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has announced a partnership with Ripple's Interledger for mobile payments.It seems that economists and digital innovators are divided on the role that cryptocurrencies and blockchain might play in the financial system.Help. We need some insight!I reached out to Navroop Sahdev and asked her to do a series of interviews to help us better understand the role of cryptocurrencies in future society, of which this is the first.Navroop is an economist and specializes in blockchain technologies both as a researcher and practitioner. She maintains her childhood curiosity and often sounds more like a social anthropologist than an economist. Her TEDx talk on complex systems and innovation is a must watch for helping to understand how the networked world we live in works and can help us innovate and move from centralized systems.Navroop and I share many interests and communities, most recently we were both speaking at the UN SDG Frontier Finance Summit on how blockchain technologies can help to scale the financing and transparency of projects to help achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.Lawrence Wintermeyer: Are cryptocurrencies valuable to society? If so, what is the main job cryptocurrencies will do for society in the future?Navroop Sahdev: Cryptocurrencies can certainly be very valuable to the global economy, and to society in general. Money has always played a critical role in the evolution of society. In order to understand the role cryptocurrencies can play in our future society, let’s look at what money does. Money provides four basic functions; it serves as a store of value, an exchange of value, a means of payments and a common measure of value. Here’s an easy way to remember this:Money's a matter of functions four, A Medium, a Measure, a Standard, a Store. Alfred Milnes - [1]Historically, it was the invention of money that opened the doors to increased trade (effectively overcoming the challenge of “double coincidence of wants”) and economic growth around the world. But the world that money was invented in had no digital assets. With the invention of the internet and all that it has enabled, we are witnessing a steady transition away of value embedded in physical assets to value created by digital assets. Take, for example, the world’s top five companies are all technology companies, with data as a primary asset.The 10 Most Valuable Companies on the Fortune 500Source: http://fortune.com/2018/05/21/fortune-500-most-valuable-companies-2018/With that, a fundamental rethinking of the meaning and functionality of money - the primary bearer instrument - is underway. While digital money is not new at this point, the underlying mechanism - where money is pegged to physical assets - hasn’t changed since the collapse of Bretton Woods and the advent of the petrodollar in 1974. (For a quick history of the petrodollar, see here).With the invention of bitcoin - as the world’s first cryptocurrency - and the current wave of decentralization, a fundamental rethinking of value has been rather overdue. Link here to my view of  ""how we perceive and measure value?""Wintermeyer: Are cryptocurrencies a suitable alternative to fiat e-currency? What role can they play in developing largely fiat cash based economies?Sahdev: Cryptocurrencies can serve as a stable store of value in a world where the value of fiat money is directly dependent actions of national governments, both in the domestic economy as well as in the international currency markets. They can be particularly useful for countries with a weak national currency or excess inflation. Since cryptocurrencies are based on a distributed global ledger, no one country or national government has control over its price (say, bitcoin or ethereum). “What cryptocurrency is, is essentially the tokenization of electrons, as opposed to petroleum molecules and it is becoming a reference storage for all the things that are useful in your life.”If “data is the new oil”, then from a monetary economics point of view, I think it makes sense to have a common global currency which can serve as the reserve currency of the world, effectively acting as a substitute for competing national currencies. With a distributed global network, the price of the cryptocurrencies is determined by market demand and supply. No one national government would have excessive control over the supply of a certain currency. In other words, new money cannot be just minted at the whims and fancies of the government.  Wintermeyer: We often speak of mass adoption as the point on the adoption curve that defines the success of a  technology, should we be viewing cryptocurrencies in this light – will we ever see mass adoption? What are the biggest barriers to society adopting cryptocurrencies?Sahdev: The technology adoption lifecycle can serve as a useful framework to understand the adoption of any new product or innovation, including cryptocurrencies and the underlying technology, blockchain. For cryptocurrencies to become a viable reserve currency, the first and the foremost thing that needs to happen is for a viable process of price discovery in the currency markets and subsequent stability in price. The process is always contingent upon time. One of the necessary preconditions for the success of a global cryptocurrency would be true decentralization with least susceptibility to centralized control. This is where the debate around concentrated mining power (in case of proof of stake consensus as in the bitcoin blockchain), challenges around scalability, liquidity, etc. come in. I think we are witnessing this right now with the current slump in the cryptomarkets: the challenges inherent in a new technological infrastructure and the speed with which they can be addressed, become key determinants of market demand. Regulation can become a key barrier in mass adoption of cryptocurrencies as well, depending on how different governments choose to regulate the technology as well as how different market players interact with the technology. It is the complex interplay of these factors that would dictate whether or not we witness mass adoption of cryptocurrencies. Last year, I wrote an interview piece explaining why cryptocurrencies are here to stay and the fact that greater regulation is good news for the crypto space. With more regulation comes greater protection for retail investors (but, in fact, all players in the market) which, in turn, drives greater adoption. Wintermeyer: Many industry leaders speak of cryptocurrency being like the early days of the internet and e-mail, is this comparison helpful or a hindrance in thinking about cryptocurrency and adoption?Sahdev: I definitely find it a useful comparison to help explain where we are in terms of societal adoption as far as blockchain technology goes. A lot of the projects that have managed to raise millions of dollars in “blockchain funding” - this includes Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales - are yet to build out their technology platforms and hence the comparison with the early days of the internet. But what is promising, in my view, is that there are enough exciting projects out there right now and use cases that are sufficiently diverse, that say 5 years from now, the big industry platforms of the decentralized web would start to emerge. Speaking of the internet, if you look at the crypto space from an Innovation Studies perspective, I think it's the most exciting segment within emerging tech (more than AI, AR/VR, etc) because of its potential to transform business as we know it, our interactions (social or economic) and the pace and direction of economic change. Only this time, the internet infrastructure already exists, unlike the early days of the internet, for a new infrastructure technology like blockchain to piggyback on and gain traction much faster than the internet did. It’s this creative destruction that I am most excited about. [1] Milnes, Alfred (1919). The economic foundations of reconstruction.

this type of attack has yet to happen to Bitcoin, one mining pool, GHash.","Oct 12, 2018,08:15am EDT",Getty,"Blockchain is often touted as a secure way of storing information, but just how secure is it? While nothing is 100% secure, blockchain is designed to be immutable, tamper-proof and democratic. It achieves this, more or less, through three defining characteristics:1. Decentralization2. Cryptography3. ConsensusThe complex interplay of these characteristics are what secure blockchain transactions and discourage foul play. For the purposes of this article, we’ll look at the first and most well-known blockchain of them all: Bitcoin.Decentralization: Creating A Single Version Of The TruthTraditionally, anyone wanting to store, share or process information has to own it. This involves creating, borrowing or buying that information, obtaining permission to use it (if necessary) and then ensuring everyone is aware of any changes. Sound confusing? It is. Handling information this way can easily become a complex game of telephone with hundreds of weak points and a high margin for error. Blockchain, on the other hand, distributes the same information to every user (or node) on the blockchain network. When you make a change, the network validates it and then miners (nodes rewarded for updating the blockchain) add that transaction into a new block, which is then added to the blockchain. This is decentralization -- a single version of the truth but no single point of failure. Change one block, and you’d need to change every subsequent block before any new blocks could be mined. Otherwise, nodes would spot your fraudulent behavior and discard your changes. Given there are thousands of nodes confirming new blocks, it’s unlikely anyone could beat their combined computing power to add a bad one. Cryptography: The Perfect DisguiseIf decentralization is the bones of the blockchain, cryptography is the muscle -- the sinewy, complex mathematical algorithms that deflect attacks. All data on the blockchain is cryptographically hashed; in other words, it's processed to hide its true identity. Hashing takes any input value and applies a mathematical algorithm (SHA-256 in the case of Bitcoin) to produce a new value of a fixed length. Hashing is similar to a kind of password protection, a unique ID for sensitive data. Every block has a unique hash derived from that block’s transactions (each transaction ID is also hashed) and the hash of the previous block. Change the block retroactively, and every preceding block -- the entire history of that blockchain -- would also need to change. Your private key used to access and move your bitcoins is also hashed to become a public key, so people can send you bitcoins without being able to steal them, too. What makes hashing special is that it’s impossible to reverse engineer. You can’t take a public key, for example, and deduce the private one. Also, one tiny change in the input value creates an entirely new hash ID, which means fraudsters can’t get away with making small changes without invalidating the whole block.Consensus: We Agree -- Do You?Consensus is the brain of the blockchain. It decides which blocks to add by pitching nodes against each other in a cryptographic race for a Bitcoin prize. First, nodes validate that the block meets the preset rules for the Bitcoin blockchain. Then, miners compete to solve a cryptographic puzzle based on the data contained in that block. When a miner solves the puzzle, they share their solution with the network. If at least 51% of the network nodes agree with that solution, the block is added to the blockchain. This particular type of consensus is called proof of work. It ensures each block has gone through a complex, mathematical process before becoming an immutable part of the blockchain. It’s labor-intensive, which helps deter criminal activity, and because miners earn a reward of 12.5 BTC for every solution, they’re incentivized to play by the rules. But do they always? Cracks In The FacadeA threat to the proof-of-work consensus model is the 51% attack. If over 50% of the mining power is owned by a minority of colluding nodes, they could prevent other nodes from adding new blocks, effectively controlling the network. This would enable double-spending and other types of fraud, but the 51% attack does require a great deal of energy and money to succeed.While this type of attack has yet to happen to Bitcoin, one mining pool, GHash.IO, exceeded 50% in 2014 but voluntarily reduced its mining power to maintain the integrity of the network. Other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin Gold, weren’t so lucky. Perhaps the most pressing blockchain vulnerabilities stem from how the blockchain interacts with other things. Smart contracts, for example, can automate many blockchain tasks, but they are only as good as the code they’re written in. Strictly speaking, they’re not a part of the blockchain but do interact with it, so if the code is poorly written, hackers could infiltrate the smart contract and steal, alter or divert wealth (or information). Similarly, centralized institutions that interact with the blockchain could put the network at risk. Hackers are only interested in big jobs where millions of dollars are at stake, so they generally target centralized repositories where there is a single point of failure, a vulnerability they can exploit. Much of today’s cryptocurrency trading volume is through centralized exchanges, and since 2011, nearly a billion dollars worth of digital assets have been stolen. Better, But Not Perfect Blockchain is still an emerging technology and evolving with each passing day. Most security vulnerabilities are patched up quickly, and in extreme cases, they can result in a new version of that blockchain known as a hard fork. This is what Ethereum did to recover $55 million worth of Ether when it was stolen from the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) smart contract.All things considered, blockchain is a much better solution to storing and exchanging digital value than anything that has come before it. Does that mean it’s perfect? No, but then nothing is. What’s important is we keep developing and improving the blockchain ecosystem to make it as secure as possible."

[+] currencies.","The 2017 boom in crypto prices encouraged many entrepreneurs to build or launch their own cryptocurrencies or tokens to fund development projects.Following the decline of crypto prices in 2018 the crypto market is having its .com moment. BitCoin, the bellweather for crytpocurrencies, pulled back to its 2017 lows in June 2018. The whole crytpoasset market is currency valued at $200 billion, less that the size of the reported money landering scandal from a single Danske Bank branch.I thought it time to get to the bottom of some of the technical issues with industry expert, Dr. Jerome Rousselet.Jerome has a PhD in Theoretical Computer Science and is the founder of Jita, a blockchain and crypto advisory services business helping startups and companies to define their strategy, build their team, review their technology roadmap and improve their security practices.I first met Jerome in the crytpo community in 2017 in the token project space where he has worked on numerous projects across protocols and I was impressed by his practical and frank views about the sector and the technology. His credentials as a blockchain technologists are impressive and he has been active in blockchain for a number of years, including as the Chief Revenue Officer for Mycelium, the digital wallet.I spoke with Jerome about his observations during the crypto boom period to better understand some of the drivers of crypto prices and community behaviour, and as importantly, to better understand what is going on right now in the blockchain and crypto space that’s worth paying attention to position for the next cycle of development and growth.Q. As an advisor to crypto firms, what are the major issues you see in how different protocols have been deployed to date?A. The open source nature of blockchain projects make it particularly easy. It is trivial to take the whole bitcoin source code, modify the project name and launch a new crypto currency that is 99.99 percent identical ""under the hood"" but with a big marketing push to position it differently. Many 'old' crypto currencies were created like this. Other are also based on Bitcoin but add a few new features, tweaking the mining process, the block size, or trying to add more features. Litecoin, Dash, BitcoinCash are in this category.Next to these bitcoin-like currencies, we have seen more interesting entirely new blockchains like Ethereum, which still use proof of work mining but offer new features, the so called smart contracts and the token economy.Recently we have seen niche blockchain, technologically innovative, applying computer science programming languages research to blockchains. We could call them smart contracts 2.0: Tezos, Zilliqa, ZenProtocol. They aim to offer verifiable smart contracts, which trade some Turing Complete capabilities of Ethereum smart contracts, for higher speed, higher capacity, lower costs, and execution guarantees (the smart contract will always finish). While there is strong momentum around these platforms, they are still looking for their killer app.Finally, many token economy projects (dapps) have lately discussed building their own blockchain. We believe this both under estimates the complexity of running such projects and over estimates the market size for different blockchains. We believe there are three segments in the industry:Trying to address two layers is very challenging. There is a high risk of losing focus and under delivering, and ultimately the economics are all different.Q. What are the various strengths and limitations of the different protocols?A. Bitcoin is the oldest, most mined and most liquid blockchain. This year it has positioned itself as a store of value, after a challenging 2017.Litecoin has proven itself to be a reliable alternative to bitcoin, with less money at stake and a more consensus driven community. An ideal place to test in production controversial new features for Bitcoin.Ethereum is still the main smart contracts platform, in terms of brand, community, projects, token sales and market cap. We see more and more interesting projects being built on Ethereum, so assuming it solves its scalability issues some Ethereum could deliver real innovation in terms of decentralized governance and tokenized economic models.EOS was the biggest ICO, lasting one year and raising $4 billion. Its long token sale managed to attract a diverse community. Its focus on existing programming languages like C and C++ will attract a huge experienced developer base who have had nothing to do with crypto currencies and blockchains to date.EOS is well positioned for enterprise solutions, it solves scalability in its initial design, relies on an entirely different security model called delegated proof of stake (instead of proof of work), and solves economic pain points for Ethereum users and businesses: businesses acquire some EOS tokens, this guarantees them capacity on the EOS network, and they know how much it costs, offering cost predictability.Users don't have to pay anything for EOS, and smart contracts can be stopped and upgraded by their owners, just like a company can update its website - Ethereum users must pay gas to execute contracts, and if they don’t put enough in it will fail. The governance model of EOS takes humans into account, while Ethereum requires humans to be errorless, write perfect code and estimate gas costs accurately.Q. The cryptocurrency market has had a tough year with most coins down year on year and especially from Q4 2017 all time highs. What factors do you attribute to this downward price movement and where does this leave the market?A. I believe a lot of Ether was bought to invest into ICOs, and some investors and ICOs were reinvesting into other ICOs with the Ether they raised.They obtained 10 times to 100 times returns and were chasing similar returns in new tokens. They may also have convinced themselves that as long as they were only exchanging crypto to crypto and not government issued fiat currency, it was not taxable. This remains to be seen. At some point these returns began to level off, likely due to a lack of new money entering the system. Large ICO and recent investors started cashing out, and the same reasons that led to the rapid rise of the token economy led to its deflation.Interestingly, while Bitcoin is also three times lower than its December 2017 high, it de-correlated from the other crypto currencies and tokens, emerging as a store of value in the crypto currency market. Bitcoin represents now around 55 percent of the whole of crypto market cap.The deflation of the bubble was very healthy. Many amateurs projects disappeared, retail investors will stop losing money, and only a few projects can now raise more than $20 million.  Better sized investments will be better both for the development teams who now have to deliver, and the investors who now have a chance to see a return on investment.In Europe, the EU is discussing an ICO framework with KYC rules and a $8 million hard cap. This could be good news for the ICO retail market, facilitating banking and reducing retail investor risks.Q. Ethereum has seen a downturn despite being the protocol of choice for most ICOs to date. What do you put this recent movement down to?A. Exactly, because it went so high so quickly last year, it was extremely volatile. Vitalik himself was warning against such valuations, and we now observe the same volatility going in the opposite direction.Ultimately the vast majority of money that went into Ethereum was invested into ICOs, and the vast majority of ICOs have not delivered viable projects yet. It was extremely speculative.According to TrustNodes research ICOs dumped three times more ETH in September 2018 than August 2018 to hedge their risks and safeguard their project's budget.It is possible to monitor these funds on the blockchain so this is very visible.There are still tons of ETH remaining in these big ICO smart contracts. What they will achieve remains to be seen.There is also still a lot of talent and a big community behind Ethereum. If some of the money is well spent, and if Ethereum succeeds its technology transformation to become more scalable, we may observe exciting product launches on Ethereum.Q. What industries are you seeing move to credibly explore and adopt blockchain?A. We have seen industries move one after the other into blockchain. For instance, in March we were discussing a token for a football club to reinvent the relationship with the football fan. In September we have seen several such projects being publicly launched, notably by French football team Paris St Germain.Last year transparent betting systems, video games and virtual worlds were very active in blockchain.Currently, we observe many projects in the loyalty schemes for retail merchants, insurance, health (electronic healthcare records) and accounting solutions (intercompany close process with a major fashion brand).Whatever the season and the crypto market, it seems there is always a new industry to discover blockchain.Q. Security Tokens have become more prominent since the Howey test and the decline of crypto prices. What are your views on Security tokens and what developments do you think are needed for STs to become more widely adopted?A. We see a lot of effort on the supply side, with finance professionals tokenizing their favorite products, developers introducing new standards such as EIP1400 enabling whitelisted secondary markets, entrepreneurs and VC building new security marketplaces, and regulators and governments trying to attract them.But ultimately the demand for such products is not clear yet. The current token market has clearly been looking for high yields at 100 times over six months. Unfortunately some of our clients suffered from this market, as there is little demand for a five percent annual return security token from this investor base.This may well change, but with lower velocity it will take more time. In a few years time security tokens may make crowdfunding a much more affordable option, currently it costs around 14 percent of the funds raised, excluding post raise costs.  STs may also attract more longer term investors at the lower end through P2P (retail) and at the higher end through asset managers (institutional).More exciting, truly innovative products and services may well emerge built on top of ST but we have not found them yet.Q. What is happening in the stablcoin space and do you see these new tokens as offering a better proposition to consumers? A. Very good question, stablecoins are very popular these days!The general idea is to reduce the price volatilities in the crypto economy. It could certainly increase interest in the crypto economy if not all tokens were so highly correlated with ETH and BTC. Currently, diversifying in crypto is like buying several flats in the same building.I am very doubtful of many of these attempts, they are very R&D and academic oriented. I am thinking here of algorithmic stable coins, which supposedly self stabilize their prices by controlling supply, emitting and burning coins.To me, it is liquidity that brings stability. So reserve currencies are stable coins, and maybe Bitcoin and Ethereum are becoming stable coins (compared to other crypto currencies and tokens). Bitcoin is currently at its lowest volatility for the past 12 months.Tether (a token representing 1 USD, managed by exchange bitfinex) and the new USDC (created by Circle, with a governance structure) are the tokens who are going to provide stability. Many people dislike tether, and say it is manipulated. I am not so sure. In recent months, BTC-Tether was apparently the largest trading pair, so it is very popular. Last week there was another rumour that the bank used by bitfinex for tether was going to go bankrupt. I think these rumours are there to manipulate the market.In any case, USDC has a clear governance structure, banks in the US and could become bigger than tether. These are very boring stable coins, but maybe boring and stable are synonymous :)"

Most tokens aren’t underpinned by assets or a store of value, so instead driving awareness and interest is primarily what supports their value.But after a flurry of action in 2014, the boom of crypto sponsorships in the world of sport ended. As the price of bitcoin tanked at the end of that year, the sponsorship money dried up and tokens would spend the next few years recovering from the decline, until now.2018’s crypto sponsorship boomFlush with cash from 2017’s bull market, crypto sports sponsorships are again suddenly back in vogue.U.S. gaming token CashBet kicked off the year in January by signing a sponsorship deal for an undisclosed amount with top-tier Premier League soccer club Arsenal, a deal which saw CashBet’s ICO promoted on pitch side in LED ads.In July crypto exchange CoinDeal became the official shirt-sleeve sponsor of Wolverhampton FC, and in October social-trading platform eToro signed a deal to sponsor Tottenham Hotspur and six other Premier League soccer clubs in August, a deal it paid for in bitcoin.CoinDeal sponsored Wolverhampton FC in July.“From the very beginning we had a plan to mark our presence globally. We wanted big players, very good brands, and what in football can be better than the Premier League team and the tremendous fan base around the world,” Kajetan Mackowiak, CoinDeal’s cofounder and chief marketing officer, told Forbes.British soccer obviously has global appeal, but crypto sponsorships are already expanding beyond the beautiful game.This October the British Masters golf tournament was sponsored by LIFElabs, creator of a crypto token LIFEtoken, a third of which are set aside for investing in philanthropic causes.Luke Chittock, CEO of LIFElabs, told Forbes that the Masters were just the start, “we are looking at diversifying our brand footprint into different sports such as motor-racing, as well as winter and water sports.”Outside the U.K. 25% of Italian soccer team Rimini FC was acquired by sport investor Heritage Sports Holdings (HSH), a purchase that was made in crypto token Quantocoin and also saw the token become a sponsor.Pablo Victor Dana, founder of HSH, told Forbes that since the Rimini acquisition he’d “already been approached by several other teams willing to receive crypto/Quatocoin in exchange for shares. One of them in England, by the way.”LIFElabs joined Sky Sports in becoming a sponsor of the British Masters.What next?While crypto sports sponsorships are trending upwards, there remain two elephants in the room that could curtail the climb.The first is around regulation. Many sports sponsorships are promoting ICOs and exchanges that sit outside U.K. regulation, often because they are based overseas.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has previously warned investors that they should be prepared to lose their money, however an FCA crackdown on token sales or a move to fully regulate the sector would clearly have a chilling effect on crypto sponsorships.The second unknown is around pricing. The bitcoin bellwether has remained stable above the $6,000 mark throughout the middle of 2018, but a sharp decline, as seen at the end of 2014, would likely send sponsorship cash running for the hills.For industry-watchers the question now is whether the sport-crypto relationship will continue to blossom or be a short-lived repeat of 2014’s flirtation."

like most retail investors, you were late to the party and bought ICOs ...","Daily Cover|Oct 29, 2018,10:11am EDT", I,"n May 2017, with a white paper and a small team of developers mostly located in Belgrade, Serbia, MobileGo raised $53 million in an initial coin offering (ICO). At the time, ICOs were new to the world of finance. Unlike initial public offerings, or IPOs, they required no lawyers, bankers or regulatory approval and were more akin to Kickstarter-style crowdfunding, except funds were raised in cryptocurrency, typically bitcoin or ethereum. MobileGo’s goal was to build a cryptocurrency platform for making purchases inside video games and betting on esports, which had become a sizzling-hot trend. The ICO was one of the biggest such deals of the year. But today, few people know where that $53 million is. The startup claims 150 people are working on MobileGo products, but Sergey and Maxim Sholom, the brothers who lead the project, keep company financials private. According to former employees, the Sholoms have moved away from cryptocurrency as a central aspect of their business plan. A spokesperson for MobileGo insists they are still trying to deliver on their original goals. Or take the case of Polybius, an Estonian project named after the classical Greek father of cryptography. It raised $32 million through an ICO in the summer of 2017. Its lofty goal was to create a crypto version of the popular personal finance service Mint. “Financial Peace of Mind for the Digital Generation” was its promise. More than a year later, Polybius doesn’t expect to launch the first version of its product until November. Its tokens, trading under the symbol PBLT, have sunk by 84%. That has dragged down its market capitalization (circulating supply of tokens multiplied by market price) to about $6 million, despite the fact that its ICO proceeds, sitting in a series of secure wallets mostly in the form of bitcoin, have since risen to a value of $40 million. Since the ICO explosion began in 2017, some 800 ICOs have been offered, raising a total of about $20 billion. MobileGo and Polybius were eagerly oversubscribed when they launched and were among the top ICO offerings of 2017. Not all ICO issuers have treated their token holders as shoddily, but because of the lack of controls or disclosure rules in the world of cryptocurrencies, the status of projects and the uses of ICO funding are often anyone’s guess. In an effort to peek inside the operations of newly hatched tokens, Forbes investigated the ten projects that, as of the beginning of September 2018, raised the most money and were at least a year old. By speaking with the crypto entrepreneurs, investors and industry analysts, we set out to answer two questions: How far have the largest ICO-funded projects progressed in their plans, and where is the ICO money now? As a starting point, we used recent research on public, digital accounts for ICOs. But those numbers can be deceiving, and the only way to get the full story was to talk to each team. As an investor, if you had purchased all 10 of the largest ICOs during the token sale, you would have fared well through the middle of October 2018. A $100,000 investment would now be worth $160,936, compared with $113,722 for the S&P 500. But six of the 10 have negative returns since their ICO, and one has mysteriously vanished. If you had simply sunk your $100,000 into bitcoin, you’d have $264,417. If, like most retail investors, you were late to the party and bought ICOs after the coins began trading on leading exchanges, you likely did far worse. Of the 141 largest ICOs in 2017, 86% are trading below their listing price, and 30% have lost almost all their value, according to EY.  The 10 ICOs we investigated raised $840 million combined. How much do they have left? Surprisingly, they’re still holding the same amount—an estimated $840 million in cash and crypto. That’s because some large projects, like Tezos, were largely funded in bitcoin, which traded at about half its current price at the time of Tezos’ July 2017 ICO. Others shrewdly converted their crypto into fiat currency near the peak of the crypto bull market, locking in huge gains. Three of the 10 projects currently hold more in crypto and cash than what they originally raised. That’s one of the most intriguing aspects of these startups. Because they raised funding in crypto, their leaders—most of whom are computer programmers—have been forced to become not just entrepreneurs but asset managers. They’ve had to decide what to do with an extremely volatile asset, meant to keep their business afloat for years. “For a long time, everyone believed everything was going up and to the right,” says crypto investor and CoinShares chief strategy officer Meltem Demirors. “They’re not financial planners or investors—they’re developers and engineers.” Several of the startups remain financially healthy, but they’ve also spent significant money, largely on salaries. Four of the 10 have seen their funds dwindle by at least one third. Status, which raised $95 million in June 2017, has $53 million left. The startup has 98 employees in 24 countries and a high burn rate of $1.3 million a month—a typical rate for an early-stage tech startup is closer to $500,000. Oddly, three of the 10 ICO projects have more in cash and crypto on hand than their total market capitalization. To stock investors, this scenario would normally indicate deep value, ripe for the plucking. However, in the bizarre world of cryptocurrencies, where ICOs and crypto projects are often run in an absence of legal contracts, it’s unclear whether token holders have any claim on a startup’s cash. Nic Carter, a former Fidelity analyst who cofounded the crypto VC firm Castle Island Ventures, says a large treasury is a target for lawsuits. Angry investors who’ve lost their shirt could try to make the case that a token was sold as an unregistered security and go after the idle currency in court. “2019 will be the year of ICO lawsuits,” Carter predicts. Product: Decentralized cloud computing platform, Ethereum competitor Token price*: $1.31 ICO return*: 228% Bitcoin return over same period*: 174% ICO end date: 7/14/17 Funds raised: $232 million Funds remaining: $500 million Funds per token**: $0.82 Employees: About 40, funded through grants program Project status: Main network launched on 9/17/18, has about 450 “bakers,” or entities running software to validate transactions Founded by Arthur and Kathleen Breitman in 2014, Tezos aims to be a decentralized computing platform that applications run on top of, like Ethereum. Early on, the project was plagued by in-fighting between the Breitmans and their former business partner, Johann Gevers. The Tezos ICO funds are controlled by the Zug, Switzerland-based Tezos Foundation, a seven-person governing body that doles out money for operational costs like software development, research and marketing. It has only one full-time employee—even the founders don’t have permanent roles. “Arthur and Kathleen are independent community members,” says Ryan Jesperson, president of the Tezos Foundation and the only full-timer. “We’re very serious about decentralization.” Tezos was one of the highest-profile ICOs of 2017 and has a cloud of legal uncertainty hanging over it. In a class-action lawsuit, some investors allege that Tezos didn’t follow through on its promises and its currency was sold as an unregistered security. The Tezos Foundation argued that the case should be handled by Swiss courts, but a U.S. judge dismissed the argument in August. The foundation declined to comment on the ongoing lawsuit. It still holds about $500 million in its treasury, mostly in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether. That’s down from about $1.2 billion in December 2017, when bitcoin peaked. Of the 10 ICOs Forbes investigated, Tezos has produced the second-highest return, delivering nearly 230% for investors. The platform launched in September 2018 after months-long delays, and it has about 450 individuals and organizations participating in the network, which involves running software to help validate transactions.   Product: Decentralized exchange for converting one cryptocurrency to another Token price: $1.28 ICO return: -67% Bitcoin return over same period: 143% ICO end date: 6/12/17 Funds raised: $153 million Funds remaining: At least $75 million (Forbes estimate) Funds per token: $1.30 Employees: 61 Project status: Main network launched in October 2017 This Israeli company aims to be a decentralized exchange where people can quickly convert one cryptocurrency into another. The question of whether it’s truly decentralized has been hotly debated, particularly after the company froze customer funds to recover stolen coins. Today, Bancor adheres to a less strict definition of decentralization. “At the time of the token sale, I don’t think they were as candid about how it’s a more marginal process, rather than binary,” says venture capitalist Nic Carter.  Of the nearly 400,000 ether Bancor raised in its ICO, it allocated 150,000 to a murky “price stability” contract that essentially propped up the coin’s falling price by buying back tokens from those wishing to exit in its early days. Bancor cofounder Galia Benartzi says the goal was to make the ICO more inclusive and to mitigate price volatility. Bancor declined to say how much it has left in its treasury, but based on staff size and typical burn rates, Forbes estimates it has at least $75 million. The BNT token is down more than 60% from its ICO. As for Bancor’s platform, which has been live since last fall, traders move a mere $4 million per day on it in different digital currencies, according to crypto analytics site tokenanalyst.io. But its own coin only has an average of 125 daily users, reports Trivial.co.   Product: Browser for decentralized applications (think Google Chrome for crypto apps), digital wallet and chat app Token price: $0.04 ICO return: -5% Bitcoin return over same period: 140% ICO end date: 6/21/17 Funds raised: $95 million Funds remaining: $53 million Funds per token: $0.02 Employees: 90 Project status: Test version of the app launched publicly with digital wallet and chat capability, has less than 1,000 daily users. The token has about 130 daily users. Status is an app where people can find crypto applications, store tokens and chat. The company has 98 employees in 24 countries who earn an average salary of $108,000, leading to a high burn rate of $1.3 million a month. It has managed its treasury by leaving virtually all of the funds in ether. Of the $95 million Status raised, it has $53 million left, mostly due to the decline in ether. At one point in early 2018, its cash hoard stood at roughly $375 million. Status’ burn rate is worrying, but a bigger problem may be its entire model. “I worry about whether the time is right to have decentralized apps,” says Salil Deshpande, a managing director at Bain Capital Ventures. “Full decentralization is happening a lot slower than we think. A lot of these projects are too early to market, and they’ve already spent too much because they’re getting the timing wrong.” The Status token has almost no functioning purpose, and the app is controlled by the company—Status plans to decentralize it later. Why didn’t Status go the traditional VC route? “Status’ token model provides the opportunity to our growing community to not only participate in the network but help shape the direction of the software itself,” says Status COO Nabil Naghdy. When will Status release its core products? No telling. “We don’t want to put unnecessary expectations on people,” Naghdy says .   Product: Debit card that lets you spend crypto Token price: $0.55 ICO return: -28% Bitcoin return over same period: 148% ICO end date: 6/24/17 Funds raised: $83 million Funds remaining: $104 million Funds per token: $0.96 Employees: 80 Project status: After the first debit card was recalled, TenX says it’s almost ready to ship the second version to 100,000 customers. Singapore-based TenX makes a debit card for spending cryptocurrencies at traditional retailers. The company released a Visa card in 2017 by partnering with payments company WaveCrest. It had “100,000 cards live,” says cofounder and president Julian Hosp. But in January 2018, Visa pulled the plug on its WaveCrest integration, causing cards from TenX and other companies like BitPay to stop working. Since then, TenX has been rebuilding its debit card product, Hosp says. It has 80 employees who it pays $84,000 a year on average, leading to a monthly burn rate of about $530,000, or $6.4 million a year. On Twitter, cofounder Hosp has been criticized for his Instagram posts showing an extravagant jaunt on a private plane. Says Hosp, “That was a one-time trip for our wedding. And that’s my personal funds, it has nothing to do with the company.” In September, TenX released a detailed financial report, claiming its ICO treasury held a total of $104 million, or $21 million more than it originally raised. How did that happen? Hosp shrewdly started converting ether into U.S. dollars in July 2017. He decided the project would keep a 50/50 crypto-fiat split while the market was going up. Currently TenX’s cash per token exceeds its price by almost 50%. Hosp says TenX is a month or two away from shipping new cards. “We’re just waiting for the final go.”   Product: Aims to be an ad-free digital content platform that lets readers pay through microtransactions Token price: $0.05 (but very thinly traded) ICO return: Not available Bitcoin return over same period: 223% ICO end date: 7/15/17 Funds raised: $82,000,000 Funds remaining: Unknown Employees: Unknown Project status: After China’s ICO ban, PressOne reportedly released plans to return funds to investors. But Forbes was unable to confirm the tokens were returned. China-based PressOne was created by entrepreneur and crypto investor Li Xiaolai. Its original goal was to build a digital content platform powered by microtransactions. The project raised $82 million, reportedly without even publishing a white paper. When the Chinese government issued its ICO ban in September 2017, just weeks after the PressOne ICO ended, the project made plans to return the tokens to investors. But Forbes hasn’t been able to confirm whether the company carried out those plans, making it yet another unsolved crypto mystery. A group of developers are apparently still working on PressOne, posting periodic development updates. Although Li Xiaolai was cited as PressOne’s CEO as of April 2018, he recently said he’s making a career change and won’t make any more blockchain investments. He didn’t respond to repeated interview requests from Forbes.   Product: Digital currency platform devoted to gaming and esports Token price: $0.42 ICO return: -44% Bitcoin return over same period: 180% ICO end date: 5/25/17 Funds raised: $53 million Funds remaining: Unknown Employees: About 50, down from a peak of about 100 Project status: Digital wallet completed, but the original goal of a gaming platform is in question. Serbia-based MobileGo originally aimed to be a digital currency for gamers, allowing them to bet on esports and pay tournament entrance fees. But it has pivoted away from cryptocurrencies, according to former employees. “I had this feeling the whole time that we were just tools in some greater scheme the Sholoms had in mind,” says an engineer who worked with the company’s leaders, Sergey and Maxim Sholom. A MobileGo spokesperson says the startup is still focused on its original goals and recently partnered with a gaming company that will use its tokens.  Former employee Jack Kuveke and freelance engineer Samad Sajanlal have written publicly about their experiences working there. MobileGo’s leadership had “repeated failures meeting timetables,” Kuveke has said. Maxim Sholom is “truly incompetent,” according to Sajanlal.  Forbes was unable to determine the status of the startup's funding.   Product: “Fog computing” platform that hosts computer applications—like cloud computing software—across multiple computers in a decentralized architecture. Token price: $.06 ICO return: -66% Bitcoin return over same period: 223% ICO end date: 7/15/17 Funds raised: $42 million Funds remaining: $18 million Funds per token: $0.05 Employees: 70 Project status: Live Moscow’s Sonm aims to be a decentralized cloud computing platform that hosts applications and competes with the likes of AWS and Dfinity. After raising $42 million in July 2017, it converted a large chunk of its ether into dollars and tried to store it in a traditional bank account. But it collected no information on its investors, apart from email addresses. To avoid running afoul of the SEC, Sonm took measures to prevent U.S. residents from investing, like banning IP addresses and clearly stating on its website that U.S. investors couldn’t participate. “That’s really easy to get around,” Nic Carter says. “You just use a VPN.” Since Sonm couldn’t pass “Know Your Customer” (KYC) checks, banks initially wouldn’t accept its ICO funds. So Sonm paid most for most of its expenses, including salaries, in Sonm tokens and other crypto. Its network launched in June 2018, but it has only 50 to 100 users so far. Funds per token are an estimated $0.05, nearly as high as its trading price of $.06. The startup has 70 employees and is burning cash at a rate of $500,000 to $800,000 a month, says Sonm cofounder Aleksei Antonov. Forbes estimates it has just $18 million of its $42 million left. At the current burn rate of $500,000 a month, and with an ambitious goal of disrupting Amazon’s AWS, Sonm’s future is in doubt. “If you’re going to be decentralized, you have to be just as good as Amazon in every other way,” says Bain Capital’s Salil Deshpande. “I just don’t think enough people care enough.”   Product: Web browser with a built-in ad blocker that allows users to reward content creators directly with crypto Token price: $0.24 ICO return: 580% Bitcoin return over same period: 183% ICO end date: 5/31/17 Funds raised: $35 million Funds remaining: At least $30 million (Forbes estimate) Funds per token: $.03 Employees: 90 Project status: Live Brave aims to be a faster, more private Web browser with a built-in ad blocker, where users can directly reward content creators. To make money, Brave takes a small cut of those payments. The browser came out in January 2016, and eight months later, it integrated with bitcoin to let users transact in crypto. Over the past year, Brave has used most of its funds to pay salaries for its 90 employees. The startup has also spent money on Facebook and Google ads, and it has grown from 400,000 monthly active users last year to 4.7 million today. Revenue so far is “tiny,” Brave CEO Brendan Eich says. “We’re all about growth.” Brave’s lucky ICO investors have seen a six-fold rise in its price, and its funds left per token are $.03, compared with its current trading price of $0.24. Anyone buying Brave in the aftermarket has had flat returns, even though usage of its browser has grown steadily and strongly. Venture investor Carter thinks Brave doesn’t need its own token, because it would be easier for readers to transact in a more liquid coin, like ether. “It’s like traveling abroad, having to change your money at the border. That sucks,” Carter says. A spokesperson for Brave says the token is useful for rewarding publishers through a referral program and ensuring price stability. According to Carter, the paradox of Brave’s impressive user growth and relatively weak coin price performance illustrates the inherent problems with certain token issuances. “It’s a great case study on why most utility tokens are doomed,” he says. Brave claims that the growth of its app has been mostly on mobile devices, while its token is only available to desktop users. It plans to add the token to its Android and iPhone apps later.    Product: Software that lets you verify your identity without having to store your information in a central database Token price: $0.14 ICO return: 36% Bitcoin return over same period: 139% ICO end date: 6/22/17 Funds raised: $33 million Funds remaining: At least $20 million (Forbes estimate) Funds left per token: $0.06 Employees: 42 Project status: Live Through mobile and Web app software, Civic aims to let people verify their identities without having their information stored in a central database. It wants to reduce the risk of data breaches and eliminate the need to trust a company to keep your data private. Serial entrepreneur and Civic CEO Vinny Lingham started working on the project in 2015. Lingham aggressively sold 80% of the crypto he collected in the few months following the ICO, converting it to U.S. dollars. So far, Civic has spent its funding mostly on salaries—it has 42 employees today. Its product has more than 100,000 downloads, Lingham says. Over a recent 30-day period, the app was used 8,000 times to verify an identity. Many agree that identity verification will be an important use case for the blockchain in the future, but the question is whether Civic will be around when that time comes.    Product: A wallet and app with analytics on your crypto and euro holdings, like a Mint.com for crypto Token price: $1.58 ICO return: -84% Bitcoin return over same period: 148% S&P 500 return: 14% ICO end date: 07/04/17 Funds raised: $32 million Funds remaining: $40 million Funds per token: $10.08 Employees: 13 Project status: Prototype stage  Polybius, named for a Greek historian, aims to create a portal for crypto investors to store digital assets, trade them and see portfolio analytics. Its token serves little purpose in the ecosystem, other than to distribute a dividend if the company reaches “stable profitability.” The Estonian- and Belgian-based startup has been using the ICO proceeds to fund staff salaries for 13 people, user testing, corporate structure consultants and financial auditing. About 85% of its ICO money is still in crypto, currently holding roughly $26 million in bitcoin, $5 million in ether and $150,000 in stable coin tether. Because Polybius collected more of its ICO funds in bitcoin than ether, it has fared well financially since the ICO. After 16 months, it has about $8 million more in its treasury than when it started. Meanwhile, its coin has performed terribly—it’s down 84%. Polybius hasn’t yet released a product. CEO Anton Altement says that if Polybius actually makes money, it will create a dividend pool, offering 20% of the funds to token holders and 80% to the founders. * Token price as of 10/19/18, according to CoinMarketCap. ICO and bitcoin returns compare ICO end date to 10/19/18. ** Funds left divided by the total circulating token supply. Comparing this metric to token price gives a sense of how richly valued a startup is relative to its cash holdings. In Tezos’ case, its cash represents about 60% of its total market cap ($.82 / $1.39 = 59%). Since it has a total market cap of $744 million, investors are valuing its non-cash assets at about $300 million ($744 million * 40% = $298 million). Reach Jeff Kauflin at jkauflin@forbes.com.

","A lot of people pay attention to Erik Voorhees when he talks about Bitcoin, he is a crypto pioneer.Following the popping of the first bitcoin bubble in July 2011 where the price fell from $31 to close at $2 on 31st of December that year, Erik predicted that the future bitcoin price would hit thousands of dollars, like a stalwart high conviction manager.Bitcoin hit its all time high on the December 17th 2017 at $19,783.Successful speculators in crypto have posted returns in the thousands and funded the ICO boom. Many lost as the market turned in early 2018 - crypto had its .com moment.An economist by training who followed financial markets, Erik was initially sceptical about Bitcoin. The more he read about the power to liberate people from governments, central banks and fiat currency the more his views changed until he got the Bitcoin bug.Erik is one of cryptos greatest libertarian advocates, and often sounds like Thomas Paine.He is the founder of Shapeshift, a non-custodial crypto to crypto exchange, and has attracted investors like Lakestar and Blockhain Capital, and heavy weight insdustry influencers on the Board like Oliver Bussmann, the President and Co-Founder of the Crypto Valley Association in Switzerland.His past blockchain company affiliations include: BitInstant, Coinapult and, most notably, SatoshiDice, which was responsible for most of the Bitcoin transactions in 2012 and 2013.Erik and I had a fireside chat at the Money2020 conference Amsterdam in May, a month before Bitcoin hit its 2018 low of  $5,938. We caught up this week to further discuss where the crypto market is going, overcoming industry roadblocks through education, regulatory improvements, and Shapeshift's plans.Where the Crypto is Market GoingQ. Have we hit a bear market in cryptocurrencies?A. Yes, I’d say we’ve hit a bear market in cryptocurrencies. In terms of price I think we’ve neared our low, however we could very well stay here for a while before a bull market returns. That being said, crypto is crypto. This bear market could last for several years, or we could see it end in a month or two. Neither would surprise me. The one thing we can be certain of is that this is uncertain territory, and while we have the freedom to speculate, we’re really just along for the ride.Q. How has the cryptocurrency market impacted the ICO and token market? A.  I haven’t really considered these separate markets… but maybe I should? Digital assets as a whole are uncorrelated with traditional assets, which is great, but they are highly correlated with each other. I haven’t noticed cryptocurrencies doing one thing and ICO tokens doing another. However, the big cryptocurrencies are also older and more trusted, so generally they are less volatile than the ICO coins.Q. You tweeted recently that ""Global finance is becoming further integrated with crypto finance"", what did you mean? A. Stablecoins are really helpful as a bridge between traditional finance and crypto finance. They help with liquidity in the market, but also get “normal” people used to sending, receiving, storing crypto assets. For those who want to use crypto assets but not be exposed to the volatility, stablecoins are very helpful. Gemini and Paxos both released a stablecoin on the same day, amazingly, so I’m looking forward to the competition between these two.Q. What are cryptocurrencies biggest roadblocks to mass adoption?A. The biggest roadblock is education and habit, we need more educational resources and simpler, easier to understand and less intimidating products and services for first time users - The education of people in how to safely and effectively use this stuff, and the breaking of their old fiat-based habits.We need better educational resources for non-technical individuals with no experience in cryptocurrency or blockchain technology. We can’t just keep catering this to ourselves, and hoping for everyone else to get on board. We have to do more to help people see the potential of this technology and make them comfortable entering into it.There are not technical aspects that are roadblocks right now… there’s always innovation and improvement, of course, but crypto works, and works decently, and the rate of advancement and experimentation is phenomenal, so I wouldn’t mark this as a concern.Overcoming Issues with Global RegulatorsQ. Should regulators be as concerned as they appear to be about decentralized exchanges?A. I don’t think regulators realize the extent to which fully decentralized services will displace and disempower them. Most regulators are still trying to realize what Bitcoin is, debating whether it’s money, what that means, and trying to see how many tokens will be categorized as securities. They do all this while decentralized alternatives are built, and the harder they clamp down on these markets, the more power the decentralized alternatives will have.Ultimately, people want to be free, and deserve to be, so long as they aren’t harming others, and since decentralized platforms enable that tendency, they are inevitable.  When it comes to ShapeShift, many people wrongly assume that we’re decentralized. ShapeShift is a non-custodial digital marketplace, meaning that users can trade cryptocurrencies with our service, but we do not hold their funds like a traditional exchange.Q. What steps can regulators take on a global scale to accept this technology?A. Regulators can learn from jurisdictions such as Wyoming that are implementing crypto-friendly regulation. It’s easy for regulators to focus on the negative characteristics and risks associated with cryptocurrencies, but they should recognize that much of the reason this technology has been built is because people are tired of trusting government bureaucracy to protect them. With crypto technology, consumer protection can actually be programmed, and can thus be far more effective than the status quo. If the regulators truly want to protect people, they should be thrilled at these developments.Q. What steps does ShapeShift take to comply with changing regulations?A. We’re building out our compliance team, most recently with the hire of Greg Arroyo as our Chief Compliance Officer and Veronica McGregor as our Chief Legal Officer. We’ve literally had to spend millions of dollars just to navigate the changing and unclear global regulations, so we’re taking it very seriously but it’s an immense burden that distracts from innovation and productivity.Q. Why did ShapeShift move forward with Know Your Customer (KYC)?A. It was a very difficult decision. Ultimately, we felt the risk of not doing so was too great given the uncertain regulations globally. There are many problems with KYC as a concept - namely, that they violate every innocent individuals’ right to privacy.The ShapeShift Business ModelQ. What makes the ShapeShift business model so special?A. ShapeShift is non-custodial, meaning that we do not hold customer funds. Security in terms of consumer protection is a core principle for ShapeShift, and something we always consider as we build our business.Q. What were the motives behind ShapeShift acquiring Bitfract, a diversified digital asset portfolio management tool?A. Bitfract was building a product that we at ShapeShift were ourselves beginning to build. They’re vision played into our own future vision for ShapeShift, so it seemed a natural move to acquire the company.Q. What does the ShapeShift strategic roadmap and direction of travel look like?A. We have some incredibly exciting projects in the works right now, but we aren’t quite ready to talk about them just yet. As these projects unfold and come to light, ShapeShift’s strategic roadmap will begin to publicly take form along with them. However, we did just announce the first phase of our Membership Program and the FOX token, which gives customers better rates and higher exchange limits.CONTRIBUTORS NOTE: Interview amended on 18 September 2018 to add responses to additonal late responses to questions on Erik's Tweet, ICOs, and KYC."

While some might win, many lose and it's a very fragile way of handling money.First emerging in 2009, Bitcoin’s structural framework has since drawn substantial attention from many institutions due to its industry disrupting potential. It brought awareness to blockchain technology, and inspired firms worldwide to dedicate resources to blockchain integration- as it has the ability to securely enhance systems. Blockchain technology is essentially a public ledger of transaction records that has a steadily increasing set of data blocks. As each additional block is added to the existing chain, the entire ledger is verified and synchronized by other participants. Every single piece of data is continuously being verified, resulting in a chain of unmodifiable data blocks. This ensures the security of crypto transactions.Just like in the regular startup industry, initial investments of any kind can be intimidating as investors never know for sure if the product/service will succeed. Managing investments is complex, but allows entry to an $85 trillion global funds market, which entrepreneurs should definitely get educated about and see if they're interested in.Many consider investing too risky or resource consuming. Some on the other hand, invest emotionally in unworthy projects and end up losing money. Regardless, there are just far too many cryptocurrencies, token generation events (TGE) and projects going on simultaneously for any one individual to properly assess the market, especially novices. For most of last year, cryptocurrencies and TGE's have shown to be a good investments, with most yielding 10 to 100x returns in just weeks. It is the most direct way to invest in blockchain with high rewards, but it is also the one with the most delicate balance.This year, markets have dropped massively and most of those returns are gone. People have lost their money and some even their homes. However, it's good to keep in mind that Bitcoin was already declared dead several times in the past (actually, 312 times), and has always come back better and stronger.Backing a project requires one to do their due diligence and confirm that the company’s business model works, their blockchain implementation case is valid, and that the company’s vision is clear.One of the the ways to invest is an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), that essentially tracks blockchain companies. ETFs do not directly invest in crypto and are baskets of publicly traded company stocks that use or are related to blockchain. The funds are actively managed, which more likely means the managers do believe in the technology itself and not just the crypto-craze.When most people think of investing in blockchain, they think of exchanges such as Binance, Bittrex  or Poloniex. But in those exchanges, you replace fiat for a cryptocurrency or the other way around.It’s important for new crypto investors to keep in mind that blockchain does not equal Bitcoin: it is simply the technology behind it. That also means that investing in blockchain (instead of crypto) is a much safer alternative. Finding blockchain startups on the other hand, is a whole other issue. There’s a plethora of startups that are simply offering coins for sale, or a method to transfer those coins to somewhere else conveniently (which is exactly the same as every other coin.) That said, for all the bad projects out there, there are a few good ones worth investing in, or at the very least looking into for assistance. CoTrader plans to be a platform that decouples fund management from custodianship, letting users manage funds on chain. Fund managers handle these Smart Funds and trade on decentralized exchanges, where success is rewarded with a percentage of the profits they have made for investors. Innovation Shares and their NextGen Protocol is another platform which may be useful for novices. It is a digital protocol for authentication that allows parties to bypass a centralized administrator. It is crucial for entrepreneurs to take their time to carefully research and select who to invest in. They should look back through history at the major technological gold rushes: personal computing, Internet, mobile, and social media. They all sported the same flags  with thousands of new startups claiming to revolutionize the field and investment in those platforms skyrocketing. But when each respective craze died down, the few left standing really did revolutionize entire industries. Blockchain is potentially one of those revolutions, as it can change the way information is passed throughout the web, with decentralized networks on its way towards becoming the norm. Entrepreneurs that invest intelligently in this tech, could be on the winning side - but need to know, they could end up losing."

I came out of my cabin wondering what was going on. I opened the sliding door of the room to get to the balcony. I saw the sky lighting up in a midst of a strong thunder while our crypto cruise (organised by CoinsBank Blockchain cruise) was sailing from Monaco to Ibiza. The situation is no different from the crypto market today.,"MIAMI BEACH, FL - DECEMBER 13: John McAfee is sighted in South Beach on December 13, 2012 in Miami... [+] Beach, Florida. (Photo by Larry Marano/WireImage)Pain is the word written all over the crypto markets. Miko Matsumura, the founder of Evercoin who has helped ICOs to raise over $250 million, said, “Pain is good.” I looked at his face wondering what he meant. “I am not saying that the phase of experiencing pain is good. It just connects things with the reality,” he remarked. “Whatever dreamland you are in, it brings you to the reality.” “Makes perfect sense,” I replied. The ICO market is insane. Fantasies are evaporating, and scammers are having tough time now at tricking innocent investors like before. His comment about pain providing a reality check was true. If there was smooth sailing, I would not have woken up at 3 a.m. to sit at my balcony upset.What investors find difficult to understand is why projects like ethereum, which is known as the enterprise solution, are facing such pressure. The fact is that the smart money is buying ethereum on the over-the-counter (OTC) market massively. After all, if you want to issue another ICO based on the ERC20, you would need ether. Right now, it is the biggest sale. So, I asked Matsumura his opinion on it.“If investors bought ethereum thinking they are gaining super control, then they are completely wrong. It is not even close to that. But if you have bought ethereum thinking that this is the foundation on which others can build their platform, then the potential still hasn’t changed,” he explained. So, why panic now? Perhaps, greed and fear are the two most important factors investors need to pay close attention to.Speaking of paying attention, I looked out to the sea and saw another cruise coming out of nowhere, sailing parallel to our cruise. The race is on. ""Which one will win?"" was the question lingering on my mind. A similarity can easily be drawn between bitcoin cash and bitcoin. During the conference, there was a huge debate between Jimmy Song and Roger Var, founder of Bitcoin.com. My view about such debates is that it is more of an entertainment than anything else. Nonetheless, it attracts many fun seekers, just like back in Roman days Gladiators used to attract large audience.Roger’s argument is always the same. Look at bitcoin’s whitepaper, the first line is about peer to peer cash.  Roger Var refers to Bitcoin’s whitepaper as if it is religion. I asked Matsumura why Satoshi is treated like God. “Roger is very clever. He is using believer’s belief against the religion,” he replied. The fact is that it is way too early to say who will win the race and at the same time, one cannot deny that bitcoin cash has become an important part of the crypto market. Which one is Satoshi’s vision and how much regulation we need, if any, is difficult to say.Another crypto crash debate- entertainment sessionOne prominent person who doesn’t hesitate to speak his mind in this space is John McAfee, founder of McAfee associates. I sat with him and asked him a key question. “Given the current regulatory landscape, do you still hold your price prediction of one bitcoin to touch 1 million dollars?” I asked. “Absolutely,” he replied. “Seems difficult or nearly impossible under the current situation, especially if institutions are not going to get involved in this space.” A frustrated look appeared on his face. “We do not need them, we do not need any regulator or their permission. The whole concept is that we do not need a bank. If I want to send you money, I should be able to do it directly, just like with Bitcoin.  We do not need third party here anymore, we do not need them (bank), their days are over . Tell me, why do I need my bank’s permission to withdraw my money out of my account? Sir, this is my money!” he exclaimed.Image drawn by an artist who was on board painter. FYI I do not look like this and I wasn't wearing... [+] Bitcoin sign.I took a long breath and decided to shift the conversation. “What else do you think is going on in the market? “, I asked. McAfee replied “There is a lot going on in the market. We have exchanges which are making millions of dollars like HitBTC. We do not know who they are, where their offices are. We know nothing about them and yet they are processing hundreds of millions of dollars every day. This is a very dangerous situation, as proven by many exchanges stealing money.”, McAfee replied. Well, that’s why we need regulations in this space, someone who can stop such processes, I thought to myself, but decided not to speak out for now.Our cruise continued to cut through the big waves and making its way forward, with me having faith that there is enough power in this ship to fight the storm. Thus,  having faith in your investment is important and facing difficult times will only make the crypto ecosystem more robust.The current sell-off is good for the ecosystem as it will shake out all the scammers out of the system. Solid projects are here to stay and they will continue to penetrate in this market.Disclosure: I hold bitcoin and Ethereum in my wallet"

A Medium article titled: ‘Why Bitcoin and Crypto have no future’ goes on to list around 40 evidences that suggest counter to the title’s claim.However, although the article lists recent events, such as NYSE’s cryptocurrency trading platform Bakkt, and Fidelity's foray into the space, it leaves out a growing web of adoption at institutions of tertiary education across the globe.Universities and colleges have been quietly growing in their understanding, appreciation, and involvement in blockchain technology as well as cryptocurrencies.Blockchain courses are now available at some of the top colleges in the U.S. — from Cornell to Stanford and MIT, as well as other international universities. More so, some of these major institutions of education are even putting their money where their mouths are with their endowment funds investing in cryptocurrency funds.It is not only that these traditionally rigid and conservative institutions believe there is worth in teaching this new technology to the next wave of leaders and champions of industry, they are even trusting and invested enough to see the value in them in the long run as an investment.Ones for the futureUniversities, especially those of the Ivy League and other top international institutions, are steeped in history, enrobed in tradition, and although they cater to the students who are often more radical and revolutionary, the status quo is usually one of a more conventional approach, especially to learning.However, the emergence of cryptocurrencies has brought to light not only an exciting financial system that plays to Millennials and others of university age, it has also brought forward a technology that has the makings of a future standard.Blockchain technology is being touted as the next internet, the foundation of the fourth industrial revolution, and other highfalutin titles. But, for those who are looking to their future, it is enticing.This level of interest and demand has perhaps forced some universities hands, as they have offered and curated blockchain courses. But it also shows an open-mindedness to accept a controversial technology with its associations to cryptocurrencies.Associate Professor of Computer Science, Emin Gün Sirer was, in the first half of last year, scheduled to teach on blockchain technology at Cornell University - an advanced class intended for PhD students - but was surprised at the turn out and interest.“Usually when you have five to a dozen students in such a class, you're teaching a popular class,"" Sirer said.But when the professor showed up on the first day to teach, he was shocked as 88 students were waiting. ""It was pretty interesting to see that level of interest,"" he added.Most of those students were also undergraduates, Sirer remarked, again giving rise to the idea that there is a keen interest from the youth.Emin Gun Sirer, director of the Initiative For CryptoCurrencies & Contracts (IC3), speaks during the... [+] Token Summit in New York, U.S., on Thursday, May 17, 2018. The Token Summit explores the economics, regulation and best practices around blockchain-based tokens, protocols, and crypto-assets. Photographer: Alex Flynn/BloombergTraditionally, one has seen the likes of Wall Street banks, governments, and other traditional institutions shun Bitcoin and its associates, however, Universities have been bold enough to embrace, understand, and teach them clearly with an eye on the future.“We are not teaching people how to use today's blockchains — tomorrow's blockchains will look nothing like today's,"" Sirer adds.Additionally, it is not even about pure blockchain, both Sirer and Kevin Werbach, from the University of Pennsylvania, explain how these courses are effective and supplementary to other areas of study, giving insight into the permeating nature of blockchain into different facets such as sociology, economics and finance.""In order to understand blockchain well, you actually need to learn a bunch of subjects that we already teach in the university, things like economics and finance and law and distributed systems in engineering,"" Werbach explains. ""I think someone who is taking a bunch of related courses because they're interested in blockchain is going to get a well-rounded education that is going to serve them well and be useful even if this industry falls apart.""Sirer adds, in agreement:""What you want to avoid at all costs is overspecialisation early on in your career. If you end up going to a program dedicated to blockchain, I think I personally would say you're making a mistake. The right thing to do is establish a broad, strong base.""Putting money on itWhile it is easy and pertinent for universities to offer courses that could shape the future to those who will be shaping the future, it is a lot harder for them to invest in something so new and untested. Yet, this has been seen to be happening.The endowments of Harvard University, Stanford University, Dartmouth College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of North Carolina have recently made investments into at least one cryptocurrency fund, it has been reported.However, it must be understood how these endowment funds operate within a university framework. Sirer, speaking to Forbes, explains that there is a level of separation between the money men and the actual university, but it is still an important step in the right direction.""The investment arm of universities is typically entirely independent of its scholastic mission,"" Sirer told Forbes. ""What we have here is an organic decision by the money people that this area is lucrative and has staying power. This doesn't necessarily imply anything at the academic level. In fact, academics are typically set in their ways and can trail behind the reality in the trenches by years.Still, while Sirer alludes to the fact that there is this trailing for the traditional universities, their endowments funds are starting to take on riskier investments with a clear eye on a good pay out.""Universities have historically followed two investment strategies with their endowment funds: most have followed a very conservative strategy of investing in household names and solid sectors, while a few savvy schools have taken on risky bets in emerging areas, to big gains,"" the professor adds.""We are now seeing a mix of schools, from the relatively risk averse MIT to the more maverick Harvard, take the same position that this area is here to stay.""So, while this decision to invest in crypto may not necessarily be driven by the heads of the university, Sirer still thinks it is a big statement of support for cryptocurrencies.""There's no greater show of support for an emerging area than what we are seeing here. All else will follow from the people voting with their money,"" Sirer said. ""I'm excited to see universities beginning to understand the importance of this new area, and hope that they will follow up with greater numbers of courses and interdisciplinary programs on blockchain technologies.Michael Sonnenshein, managing director at Digital Currency Group subsidiary Grayscale, has said nonprofit institutions, including these types of university endowments, have now made investments in its products this year after expressing interest in the area last year.“We’ve had a couple of smaller investment allocations come through, in that they have been starting to dip their toe into the asset class in a way that forces them to have a little skin in the game,” Sonnenshein said.A better understanding, a less traditional approach, and a bit of foresight for this asset class by traditional institutions will no doubt have a big effect on normalising cryptocurrencies, something that is indeed needed, and slowly happening.Normalising the assetThe cryptocurrency space moves fast, and has been rapidly accelerating since it took a big leap into the mainstream with its headline making rally to near-on $20,000 last year December. However, the next wave of adoption will come from normalising the asset more, and this is being aided by universities in this manner.Can Gulec has a similar train of thought through blockchain venture Kambo, which aims at normalising crypto as an asset which can be used as collateral for loans. Gulec explains how the intersection between this new disruptive asset class and traditional technologies is fast approaching.“As the connection between disruptive and traditional technologies gets stronger, the rate of change and increase in complexity becomes faster,” Gulec said. “Crypto is already much more institutionalised compared to 2014 and this is only going to increase.“As institutionalisation increases, so does regulation and governmental guidance which is all good news for end customers.”Gulec adds, on a more philosophical level, that the starting ideals of cryptocurrencies may have evolved from pure libertarian anti-establishment ideals, but they are growing with the institutions and complementing each other rather than replacing them or overthrowing them“Cryptocurrencies follow and build on many ambitious ideas of the early days of the internet - decentralisation, liberty of information flow, liberty of flow of value, borderless, non-sovereignty. However, utopia and drastic changes can’t happen overnight. Many early dot com companies failed not because their business ideas were infeasible but the world wasn’t ready. The adoption potential just wasn’t there.“I believe the crypto world is in a similar situation at this point in time. We want to facilitate this adoption and believe traditional financial systems and disruptive fin-tech systems should be integrated and seamlessly connected.”A juxtaposition and a coming togetherThis may be a stretch, but the juxtaposition of a university is that it is a traditional institution with a huge history of conventional mannerism, yet it is a breeding ground of radical and revolutionary world-changing ideas. Both of these world collide and meld in these institutions.For cryptocurrencies, and the world we live in, this same sort of melding needs to take place, the asset needs to be normalised and treated on its merits. If this disruptive technology can work alongside the way things have always been done, and help evolve it, it needs to happen through better understanding and acceptance."

While Bitcoin remains legal in most OECD jurisdictions, the crypto market and its participants are being increasingly penalized for using the digital assets of their choice.In some countries, including blockchain industry hubs such as the USA and Israel, banks may block users’ access to their fiat bank accounts if they deposit liquidated funds from crypto exchanges and trading venues. This has led to a situation in which vendors that used to accept Bitcoin have backpedaled from their decision to do so, in order not to jeopardize their businesses.These draconian measures are not always government led, but originate in most cases from the unwillingness of banks to serve their clients according to their needs. Financial institutions will often cite Anti-Money-Laundering guidelines to justify their actions. Although tracking Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies is much easier than tracking cash, most banks will treat them as untraceable “dark money” and refuse to come anywhere near them. If this is due to a lack of understanding, fear of competition or good-old laziness remains anyone's guess.2019 the year for crypto?However, 2019 might be the year in which all of this changes. Regulatory uncertainty, an uncooperative banking sector, and shady, fragmented institutions dominating the crypto market, have created a huge demand for a clean, compliant, and consumer-friendly solution that is willing to fill the gaps left open by the current financial establishment.In fact, the first outspokenly crypto-facing bank has already been incorporated and licensed. EQIBank plans to open its first private and corporate accounts in December 2018 and will allow its customers to hold cryptocurrencies in insured accounts alongside international fiat currencies. The bank will also operate its own in-house cryptocurrency exchange and offer a peer-to-peer crypto-loan system.As an offshore bank, regulated under international standards, EQIBank will be the first official point of contact between crypto markets and the international financial system. However, it will probably not be the last. Several small European banks have already partly joined the crypto bandwagon and are seeking to incorporate Bitcoin holdings into the service packages provided to their clients.Since the blanket prohibition on crypto originates more from the decisions made by established banks than by regulatory oversight, these new small players have a true chance to capture a significant market share. There are currently thousands of legitimate businesses and individuals seeking well-deserved banking services. If the ‘old boys’ club won’t provide them, apparently someone else will.With the cartel-like dam suffering its first cracks, the flood is imminent. Established banks will not waste much time and will fight back to regain some of their lost market share. We should not be surprised if financial institutions suddenly flip 180 degrees and declare the blockchain as the best AML tool ever developed (which it indeed is). This will probably not happen overnight, but soon enough to declare 2019 as the year in which crypto finally gets connected to the global financial system."

Almost two weeks ago, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) had to lower this year's sales growth forecast to 6.5% from earlier estimates of between 7% and 9%. “Chip orders are down,” says Zhang Jian, founder of Fcoin/F1, a cryptocurrency exchange from China. “This is a clear reflection of the continuing bear market within the cryptocurrency space. It is no secret that mining cryptocurrency has accelerated the advance and sales of computing power, but this pace has slowed significantly in Q2 and Q3.”Cryptocurrencies are shedding some of their magic. The proxy for legal tender had once charmed investors while spawning countless fintech startups that are building services based on blockchain technology. But prices for bitcoin have slumped 60% this year, making it more difficult for the miners to turn a profit by using their powerful computer systems to generate and verify units of cryptocurrencies.TSMC produces high-performance computing chips for clients like AMD, which has also been showing signs of a slowdown. This industry news report went so far as to say that AMD saw a “huge” decline in second-quarter business from crypto mining chips and that the company was not anticipating a rebound in the third. TSMC declined to discuss cryptocurrency mining chips for this report.More on Forbes: Will Decentralization Powered By Blockchain Allow Greater User Privacy?Interest in cryptocurrency mining has tapered this year in part because Bitcoin prices have tumbled. This commentary predicts a bear market through year’s end. Mining has also grown increasingly competitive and reward formulas more complex. When the market slumps, a miner’s equipment’s income will “sag a lot” and “even become unprofitable,” Intelligent Investing says in this July commentary.""A decline in demand for cryptocurrency mining equipment has to do with the high cost of purchase,"" says Peng Mao-jung, an international strategy center manager with the Taiwan government's Industrial Technology Research Institute. ""The lack of interest in mining equipment also has to do with the implosion of crypto prices.""Just a leveling off in demand?To be sure, slumping prices of cryptocurrencies aren't the only reason for the slowdown. Orders for mining processors may have “leveled off” as buyers wait for an upgrade in chips from a 16-nanometer to a 7-nanometer process, says Shone Anstey, executive chairman and cofounder of BlockChain Intelligence Group, a Vancouver-based cryptocurrency tracking firm. Chips made through a 7-nanometer process would offer more power per machine, with more energy efficiency. Producers may find this scheme “profitable,” Anstey says for this post.Mark Liu, chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., speaks during a forum at the Semicon...

Kwok/Bloomberg)“The indicators are there that the market has been slowing down in preparation for this new family of mining chips to come into production,” he adds. “The increased power of these new mining chips may prompt the smaller mining operations to pool resources in order to scale up.""Today bigger miners have an edge in generating new units of crytocurrencies because of their relative computing power.Blockchain technology is expected to grow anyhow as financial institutions and stock exchanges use it more often. ""The key factor that drives the growth of this market is the ability to share the ledger and continually reconciled database,"" Peng says."

Shippers could see if a truck is full before they schedule a delivery. Grocery stores could verify if a carton of eggs is actually cage-free. Or could they? As blockchain gets closer to its marketplace debut in the food system, it’s important to scrutinize just how the technology will actually work.Blockchain was initially developed as part of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, but the technology in the cryptocurrency context looks different from how it’s being developed for the food space. Bitcoin’s blockchain is an immutable digital ledger that works through a consensus of computer systems.Computers on the Bitcoin blockchain are essentially racing to correctly solve a calculation, and when one “wins” the race, it wins a unit of cryptocurrency and a block of data is added to the chain. The huge numbers of computer systems on the Bitcoin blockchain are why there’s a huge energy cost associated with Bitcoin, a feature that would be detrimental in the agriculture space, where farmers needs to grow more and use less.In the Walmart-IBM blockchain that made news this past week, the system is far more limited in scale. It’s only open to those in Walmart’s leafy green food supply chain, which will likely translate into hundreds of users, not tens of thousands. As a result, there are fewer digital additions to the data chain, which means fewer verification nodes and, most importantly, far less energy expended overall.

Because the truth of that data isn’t actually evaluated, there’s no aspect of blockchain technology that can make sure that the cage-free egg is really cage-free or that the lettuce is actually free from contamination.For Walmart, the technology will be used to tell stakeholders that a particular head of lettuce came from a particular harvest on a particular farm, so if a consumer gets sick, government investigators will have a head start on the investigation. Rather than chasing a paper trail for days, they can get to the source of a tainted head of lettuce within seconds, and that should mean less wasted produce, fewer sick people and more confidence in the food system.Though blockchain is being touted as the technology that could potentially solve all of agriculture’s challenges, it’s not necessarily clear why blockchain is better than something like a database or any other form of digital information storage. Companies could simply build a database rather than build a blockchain, particularly as some of the original features of the Bitcoin version, like trustless verification, aren’t a feature.It’s not entirely clear why blockchain is the best technology for the job of transforming the food industry, and it may not be. It may just be that it’s the one getting attention right now, particularly as technology experts look for ways to transfer their experience and make their mark in the burgeoning agritech sector.Where blockchain starts to reach its potential is when it’s used with other technologies and systems. At the same time that the blockchain is implemented for food traceability, for example, producers can also put into place systems like enhanced water testing mechanisms or increase buffer zones between leafy green growers and livestock operations.When used with sensors and precision delivery systems for pesticide and water all connected to a network, as with the Internet of Things, blockchain can be used to gather a wealth of data and employ it in the field.While blockchain can’t verify that an egg operation is truly cage-free or what that cage-free operation really looks like, it might offer a way for farmers to get more information to consumers. Farmers, particularly the ones who don’t sell their food to a farmer’s market or get an opportunity to interact with consumers, often struggle with how to engage with the public, looking for ways to explain how and why they grow food the way they do. Blockchain enables farmers to get data to consumers, but what if it could provide more context, too? That’s the thing consumers really need to make informed decisions about their food.Blockchain could be used to tell consumers that the corn was grown with herbicide, for example, but maybe someday there could be a mechanism for explaining why that herbicide is used, or a comparison of that herbicide to other weed prevention systems or removal methods. The complicated nature of agriculture doesn’t always translate so well to a smartphone app, but then again, that might be a challenge that’s too big for blockchain to solve anyway."

[+] bills","It is often said that cryptocurrencies are the modern-day version of a Rorschach Test. Stare into a Bitcoin address deeply (1BvBJDEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJkdN2) and the individual will be able to see whatever he or she seeks. To maximalists and ardent libertarians that ascribe to the most puritan ideological vein of the movement, cryptocurrencies offer a refuge or escape hatch from today’s monetary and financial system bereft with corruption. In their eyes, a crypto-denominated system will no longer see citizens subject to abrupt and whimsical currency devaluations. Governments will not step in to save banks, because perhaps banks no longer need to exist, or at the very least they are no longer “too big to fail”.On the other end of the spectrum there are devout defenders of today’s monetary system. While they acknowledge problems stemming from the Great Recession needed to be addressed, most notably finding a better way to manage risk, they believe that overall the system is healthy. They feel that as long as banks act responsibly henceforth, the system should go back to working order. After all, the post-World War II financial system – first defined by Bretton Woods and then by today’s free-floating exchange rate system - is what is responsible for American prosperity in the first place. Furthermore, they question the need for a new form of money that does not have the backing of a central government. Fiat currency, which most readers are already aware is just paper, only has value because governments say it does. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have no intrinsic value – so they essentially become a confidence game.However, a large swathe of the populace in the U.S. and around the world falls somewhere in the middle of these two boundaries. These are individuals who ask why it costs so much money to send wires around the world, yet at the same time they cannot be told when it will arrive.  They wonder why their local grocery store places a $10 minimum on all credit card transactions, when they can buy a $.75 candy bar at a 7-11 across the street with their American Express.  They even question why they cannot pay for content article by article, rather than buying a $35 a month subscription to a newspaper when they only read 5% of the content. Furthermore, these scenarios do not even get into countries bereft with economic and monetary instability like Argentina, Zimbabwe, and Venezuela today, or Greece in 2014, where citizens face a daily struggle to protect their wealth and even move assets out of the country.  However, at the end of the day most people around the world still sleep comfortably at night because they know that the money in their pocket will be accepted by any merchant in the morning.There needed to be a better way, and originally it was supposed to be Bitcoin. It was hailed as much in Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto’s omnipresent white paper, ‘Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System’. Under this utopian system individuals could do everything from buying coffee at a local Starbucks to sending thousands of dollars in remittance payments around the world for a matter of cents in transaction fees.However, from inception Bitcoin was never designed to handle the throughput necessary to support a global monetary system.  A block on the blockchain has a size limit of 1MB, which allows it to typically handle no more than 7 transactions per second.  This is a drop in the ocean compared to the bandwidth of networks such as Visa and Mastercard.  Additionally, as the system evolved people started to identify more uses for Bitcoin beyond just payments, such as a store of value, or they began using the network tokenize/anchor assets to a blockchain like land titles.  This growing ecosystem placed impossible stress on the system and necessitated a way to ease pressure on the network.  Everything came to a head in the famed ‘blocksize debate’, which saw an acrimonious and protracted debate between conflicting ideas and scaling proposals that ended up in a number of Bitcoin forks, with the most notable being Bitcoin Cash, which supports 32MB blocks.  That said, neither has seen wide adoption.Around this time alt-coins and ICOs became the craze.  The thinking here was that we are going to be changing how we interact with the internet.  Rather than having to pay money to access services, we will utilize consumptive tokens that can be bought and sold around the world on liquid exchanges.  Due to the east of creating a token (often through Ethereum’s ERC-20 protocol) and raising an ICO, there was an explosion of interest in the space.   During 2017, the price of Ethereum rose from $7 on January 1 to $719 on December 31.  Bitcoin was also swept up in the craze, as its price rose from approximately $1k on January 1 to almost reaching $20k before ending the year at $12.6k.  A large reason for these price appreciations was that it was necessary to buy into the ICO gold rush with cryptocurrencies.We all know what happened next, the price of all major crypto assets cratered. This occured due to a number of reasons, such as the unsustainable frenzy surrounding crypto, a rash of negative stories such as Bitcoin ETF rejections by the SEC, and a realization that several ICOs were outright scams.  The aftermath: today Ethereum is $172 and Bitcoin is $6,275. Plus market cap of all cryptoassets is a fraction of what it once was.So where do we go from here?This is where stablecoins come into play.  These tokens a designed to maintain a consistent value, either because they are backed 1-1 with fiat currency, utilize collateral, or employ a computer algorithm that adjusts supply accordingly based on activity.   There is no shortage of stablecoins in the market today (Tether, TrueUSD, Dai, Basis, Carbon, etc).  Just this week two more came onto the market, Paxos Standard and the Gemini Dollar, which both received approval from the New York Department of Financial Services. With these assurances, logic dictates that users should not be fearful of spending their coins only to see their value double-overnight.  They will also provide a needed source of scalability and liquidity in the market, which can help smooth trading around the world.Will they work?It remains to be seen.  Although stablecoins may represent our next, best, attempt at promoting crypto use they are not without their drawbacks and limitations.  For instance, Tether has a market cap of $2.7 billion and a daily trading volume of $2.4 billion.  Therefore, the velocity of money supply is very high.  Tether claims to have one USD in reserve for every Tether in circulation, yet there has never been an authoritative audit that proves this assertion.  In fact, Tether is one of the few truly “too big to fail” or “systemically significant” enterprises in crypto today, and if word got out that it did not have sufficient reserves (not to imply that it doesn't), it would have a calamitous effect on the entire ecosystem.  Additionally, other coins that use smart contracts and take algorithmic approaches are unproven, and as we saw with the 2016 DAO hack, smart contracts are not airtight.  If the populace loses confidence in one stablecoin it could reverberate throughout the world.This does not mean that stablecoins are not worthwhile endeavors, because they certainly are.  However, like any other cryptocurrency they are going to go through growing pains and challenges.  How its multiple creators respond will ultimately dictate its future.Perhaps it would be easier just to have crypto fiat already?"

Some voice concerns that the U.S. overuses sanctions tools while others convey that the U.S. must increase targeted sanctions to hinder the financiers that enable terrorists and corrupt regimes. But there has never been the prospect that sanctioning could become a moot option against some states embracing new financial technologies. Until now. Today, various regimes are trying to develop sanctions resistance through cryptocurrency technology.Governments that get sanctioned by the U.S. always seek ways to evade the economic restrictions that cut them out of the financial system. They usually find paths of least resistance, through frontmen and front companies allowing them to do business, secure capital, and move funds around the globe. This brings about a cat and mouse game where the U.S. Department of Treasury works to uncover deceptive schemes and fine parties that facilitate sanctions evasion. This cat and mouse game now includes easy-to-acquire blockchain software.U.S. Adversaries Seeking an Alternative SystemSince the end of World War II, the U .S. dollar has been the world’s dominant reserve currency, and the vast majority of cross-border trade is conducted in dollars. This gives the U.S. immense financial—and political—leverage. Losing access to dollar-clearing and correspondent relationships with banks in New York would be a death sentence for most foreign financial institutions. The U.S. used this leverage to urge European Union regulators to oust Iran from the international financial messaging system known as SWIFT as part of nuclear sanctions in 2012. The next year, Iran decided to begin negotiating a nuclear deal to get out from under sanctions.Emerging powers like China have been calling for an alternative international reserve currency for years. And in the midst of growing trade disputes between China and the United States, some Asia regulatory experts earlier this year proposed that a digital currency system would be the ideal way to develop this alternative. Sanctions Resistance Projects are Open SourceIt is no surprise that states like Russia, Venezuela, and Iran are looking to build blockchain technology to develop sanctions resistance for their financial sector. Officials in each country claim that state-based cryptocurrencies could eventually help blunt the effects of Washington’s financial coercion. But what has not been discussed much is that the main technological ingredient for these efforts is open-source; software that is freely available on the internet, not owned by any one entity, and for practical purposes, can not be prevented from being acquired by these states.For example, Iran’s central bank announced in late August that it is planning a national cryptocurrency running on a Hyperledger Fabric private blockchain. Hyperledger Fabric is an open source software platform for enterprise blockchain systems. It is a product of the Hyperledger Consortium, a group of companies led by the San Francisco-based Linux Foundation, a non-profit that supports open-source technology projects. Hundreds of firms around the world are engaged with Hyperledger blockchain projects.The Iranian effort is not affiliated with the consortium and there is little the Linux Foundation or any one else could do to stop the regime in Iran from using Hyperledger.There is certainly nothing wrong with any nation setting up more efficient, blockchain-based payment systems. In fact, governments developing financial processes with the greater auditability that blockchains allow is a positive step for transparency. What is problematic is that Russia, Iran and Venezuela state outright that they intend to use blockchain technology to get around sanctions. They seek to undermine one of the few nonviolent tools that the international community has to respond to governments that grossly violate human rights, sponsor terrorism, or do other malign activities. Thus, one potential step forward for transparency is accompanied by a step backwards that in some ways enables authoritarianism. Russia is subject to U.S. and EU sanctions against many of its major banks and has slowly been integrating blockchain technology pilots into its financial system. Earlier this year, Sberbank—the largest bank in Russia—completed a $12 million corporate bond transaction, settling purchases using Hyperledger Fabric software. Current sanctions prohibit U.S. firms from providing debt or equity financing to Sberbank, but not software.Venezuela was the first country to attempt to launch a national cryptocurrency several months ago, claiming to create the oil-backed petro token based on a public blockchain platform called NEM. The claim was plausible, because anyone with limited computing skills and resources can develop a token like the petro in a few easy steps.  The accessibility of this open technology brings an opportunity; a way to conduct financial transactions outside of the current financial systemWith conventional banking, financial authorities pressure sanctions targets by freezing their assets and blocking their transactions. But these sanctions resistance projects rely on software that allows for financial transactions impervious to third party interdiction.Open Source Software is a Net PositiveBanning or sanctioning open source software would be an elusive and impractical goal. Open source code intrinsically is easy for anyone to replicate and share anywhere in the world. It also would be ill-advised on another count: Open source technology has tremendous societal benefits. Open source software platforms have driven the key business innovations of the past twenty years; mobile phones, transportation systems, and medical technology have advanced greatly from non-proprietary code. Open source software promotes collaboration among software developers, strengthens security by enabling crowdsourced fixes for bugs, and increases the pace of innovation as platforms iterate through wider use. U.S. policymakers should be careful not to respond to these efforts in a way that would indirectly jettison American developers from the open source software community. This would undermine U.S. technological competitiveness in the long run.This does not mean that financial authorities are powerless against sanctions resistance strategies. For example, if Iran does launch a cryptocurrency, the same sanctions that target Iranian currency would apply to the digital rial. National Cryptocurrencies not Enough to Counter Sanctions in Short RunToday, cryptocurrencies derive their value through supply and demand on cryptocurrency exchanges. Treasury’s sanction restrictions against Iran means that cryptocurrency exchanges under U.S. jurisdiction (including some foreign exchanges with U.S. financial connections) would not be permitted to trade the new token. This sanctions pressure should have a deflationary effect on the price of the “crypto-rial.” So, although the U.S. might not technically be able to block cryptocurrency transactions, Iran’s new token would not fundamentally alter U.S. sanctions leverage. It also would not likely provide a boon to the Iranian economy. Digitizing a floundering fiat currency is not enough to make it attractive for foreign investors or creditors. Sanctions evasion using cryptocurrencies is not likely to be a major threat for the short term. In the long run however, if a reliable blockchain-based system emerges that can support financial transactions on par with the SWIFT system, U.S. sanctions power could be diminished. Still, a true “blockchain SWIFT” is something that probably would take decades to unfold.U.S. Adversaries Playing the Long GameChina and Russia are long-term planners. The Chinese government has invested more than $3 billion in blockchain technology projects in 2018. And a Russian intelligence official expressed earlier this year, “the internet belongs to Americans, but blockchain will belong to us.” And businesses in China and Russia are collaborating. In late 2017, large blockchain firms from both countries set up a joint $100 million cryptocurrency fund to invest in blockchain ventures. Both governments are working on establishing technical standards for distributed ledger technologies for their respective nations.It is too early to say exactly how or if blockchain systems will take hold. No one can predict whether fully decentralized protocols like Bitcoin or Ethereum will become more relevant to global finance, or if cryptocurrencies will be insignificant in a few years. A middle path may be more likely, with banks embracing hybrid features of blockchain technology, embedded within current banking infrastructure.What is clear is that the leaders in any new financial system of the future will be those who build its platforms.So, the greatest sanctions risk is a long term one; that nation-states that desire to displace the U.S. dollar as a global trading currency might do so slowly, by creating a functioning parallel value-transfer system that does not move U.S. dollars or go through New York City. This would be an alternative to the SWIFT infrastructure that is essential to transferring funds today. Such a system would not respond to the current sanctions enforcement playbook.The U.S. Should Not Rest on its LaurelsThe best U.S. strategy against this may be counter-intuitive. It is not to try to stop the proliferation of these nations’ blockchain projects. That would be ineffective due to their reliance on open-source protocols. Rather, the U.S. should increase its own influence within blockchain-based finance by expanding American expertise in these new systems, just as U.S. adversaries are doing. Also, although it is unclear how a true “blockchain SWIFT” would work in practice, the U.S. should take the lead now in setting technical standards for blockchain protocols used for large-scale international commerce. Standards should include requiring layers for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism. The U.S. and its partners should dissuade nations from joining any blockchain banking platform that emerges without such standards. Before the U.S. can do that, it first needs to do two things: One, the U.S. government should assess the status of blockchain technology development by key U.S. adversaries like Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. Second, America should develop a National Digital Currency and Blockchain Strategic Plan that maps out ways to ensure that American firms, talent, and government agencies stay ahead of the potential cryptocurrency curve. Recently, U.S. Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard expressed her confidence that the dollar will remain the world’s dominant reserve currency. Let’s hope such sentiments do not lead to complacency. If they do, the cat and mouse game could instead turn into the fable of the tortoise and the hare."

The offering, dated September 18, 2018, has so far received commitments to raise $5.6 million in capital for the “free speech” social network, which is a favorite of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and other members of the “alt-right.”Since the shooting on Saturday, Gab has been shut down by a host of mainstream services including payment processors Stripe and Paypal, Web-hosting company Joyent and briefly, domain registry GoDaddy. But that might not matter, because Gab has already taken the first step toward freeing itself from dependence on traditional infrastructure and support mechanisms, thanks to its funding via the ethereum blockchain. Ultimately Gab’s goal is to build an entire ecosystem beyond the reach of centralized authorities—whether Facebook, Twitter or venture capitalists—making it nearly indestructible. On this, the tenth anniversary of the publication of Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper, which gave birth to bitcoin, Gab epitomizes the darker consequences of his vision.Gab’s ICO is a vivid demonstration of blockchain's ability to let people raise money anonymously outside of mainstream financing. But Gab and others now have access to even more powerful tools that could make centralized servers, domain managers, and much of the internet infrastructure as we know it obsolete.“Ultimately, what we’re trying to accomplish is to cut out the middleman,” said Gab co-founder and CEO Andrew Torba on a Bitcoin Uncensored episode last year. “I want to see VCs tremble, just crumble.If it weren’t for Andrew Torba’s associations with the alt-right, his success in tech might be heralded. A Moosic, Pennsylvania, native who graduated from the University of Scranton in 2013, Torba caught the attention of the storied Silicon Valley incubator Y Combinator after he created an automated advertising company called Kuhcoon, Inc. Torba’s startup received seed funding from the incubator as a graduate of Y Combinator’s winter Class of 2015.Those dreams fell apart when after the 2016 presidential campaign, Torba, whose company had been renamed Automated Ads, was kicked out of the Y Combinator alumni network for taunting fellow members on Facebook. “I helped meme a president into office, cucks,” flamed Torba, known to wear a green MAGA hat, admitting he spread Trump endorsements over the internet during the months leading up to the presidential election.Torba appeared on a July 2017 episode of Bitcoin UncensoredIn August 2016, Torba launched Gab, citing censorship by Facebook, Twitter and Reddit as examples of why he founded the ad-free social network. His initial funding came solely from donations. Almost from the start, membership on Gab took off like a rocket despite that fact that it was rejected by Apple’s App store and Google Play. In July 2017 Torba told the controversial Bitcoin Uncensored host Chris Derose that Gab had 200,000 users. By the time Gab filed its paperwork to use the ethereum blockchain to raise capital, the number of users had almost doubled to 394,000. In an updated SEC filing from last month, that number had grown to 635,000 people. It reportedly now has around 800,000 users.According to Torba, it wasn’t just Google Play and Y Combinator who shunned him, but also venture capitalists who “blacklisted” him, preventing Gab from realizing its true potential and scaling even more rapidly. So Torba sought out StartEngine, a crowdfunding website launched in 2014 that had been taking advantage of Obama’s Jobs Act exemptions to help companies sell equity to small investors. In 2018, StartEngine launched a new ICO funding service, which Torba quickly signed up for.Starting in January, Gab offered 2 million tokens issued on the ethereum blockchain at a price of $5 each. According to the most recent SEC documents, a fully subscribed offering would give token investors a 12.5% ownership stake in Gab while Torba and his cofounders would retain the rest. Despite blockchain's promise of democratization, Gab token holders have no voting rights. Based on the StartEngine website, Gab has so far sold tokens to 1,820 holders, committing $5,630,502.64.In terms of financials, Gab’s most recent filings show that it had gross revenues of $93,260 in 2017, mostly from premium subscription services that allow its members to monetize their audiences. Despite donations of more than $116,000, Gab was still losing money at the end of 2017, according to its offering statement. Operating costs were reported to be $364,676, including $65,000 in salary for Torba.While the world has come to know the social network as a place where extremists like the synagogue killer could gather and swap hate speech, the company, as it describes itself in Securities and Exchange Commission documents, paints a very different picture.Cryptocurrency entrepreneurs Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss invested in Blockstack, which is using blockchain technology to build a censorship resistant internet without centralized serversThe offering documents portray Gab as a supporter of free speech and a defender of “the free flow of information,” mirroring in many ways the rhetoric increasingly used by promoters of blockchain to describe the democratizing benefits of the new technology:“We empower creators, support free speech and defend the free flow of information online. We stand for bringing folks together of all races, religions, and creeds who share in the common ideals of Western values, individual liberty and the free exchange and flow of information. Our mission is to provide people with the tools they need to create and shape their own experience.”What tools? GabTV, for example allows members the ability to build followers and tip revenue by streaming video programming on Gab’s platform.Perhaps in a veiled message to would-be followers, the image plastered on the front of the company’s offering statement is that of a green frog, similar to the Pepe the Frog meme that has been co-opted by neo-Nazis and the alt-right.Today, Gab tokens are still being sold on StartEngine.Earlier this week, as the FBI and Department of Justice investigated the Pittsburgh shootings, Paypal, Stripe, Joyent and GoDaddy terminated service to Gab. In a post on his disabled website, Torba claims the company is cooperating with the authorities “to bring justice to an alleged terrorist.”Of course, Torba hasn’t stopped ranting against the establishment. “No-platform us all you want. Ban us all you want. Smear us all you want,” he says on Gab’s homepage in response to being shut down. “You can’t stop an idea.”Torba may be right. There are blockchain alternatives to every single service currently disabling Gab. Paypal and Stripe may not want Gab using their services, but Gab can easily accept payments directly using bitcoin, ethereum, or privacy cryptocurrencies like zcash and monero.And Gab can also use other blockchain services if mainstream providers try to kick it off the internet by refusing to provide critical services. If Gab needs to replace GoDaddy for domain service (the addresses people use to find websites), Ethereum Name Service provides domains for decentralized applications built on the ethereum blockchain. Web hosting? No problem. Ethereum’s Substratum provides a decentralized alternative to Joyent. Others have already pioneered the idea. PeepEth is a nascent ethereum-powered social network, and Mastadon is a blockchain-based Twitter.If navigating all of those blockchain alternatives seems daunting, Gab and other blacklisted entities could simply tap into Blockstack, which is creating an entire stack of Web services designed to create an uncensorable web. Earlier this year Blockstack, which is backed by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, announced $1 million in grants specifically for social networks that could one day put Facebook and other centralized social networks out of business. Already, one of 300 grant applicants, Afari, claims it will give users of its social network control over their own usage data by increasing privacy.As we mark the tenth anniversary of bitcoin’s birth, it may not be the corrupt banks and totalitarian regimes envisioned by Satoshi that we should be fearing most, but the dark corners of the internet and the dark minds that inhabit them.Bitcoin Uncensored host Derose, who condemns the synagogue attacks but has himself been accused of racism, sexism, and bigotry, offers a stern warning:“What happened with Gab is that people of a like mind brought their ideas together and created something that’s worse than a sum of their parts.” He adds, “We created the bogeymen we fear, and encouraged them.”"

[+] Tuesday, July 10, 2018. Wells Fargo & Co. is scheduled to release earnings figures on July 13. Photographer: Christopher Dilts/Bloomberg","In the early days of bitcoin, I was explaining the technology to economist Edward Stringham. This new market-based money allows individuals to exchange peer-to-peer without financial intermediation, I said. All transactions are finally settled, regardless of geographic proximity, with no previous trust relationships, with zero access to financial institutions. It’s as if everyone in the world is exchanging cash. I thought this was the best case I could make at the time. It seemed obvious to me that this represented an obvious improvement. Professor Stringham immediately recoiled. “What? No chargebacks? The customer bears all risk? Institutions no longer vet people party to an exchange? This has some major downsides. The market has worked very hard to create reliable intermediation. It’s not going away anytime soon.” (I’m paraphrasing.) You see, Stringham is the author of Private Governance, parts of which are a hymn to the brilliance of intermediation and how it protects consumers and sellers from fraud and makes life so much easier. The system is expensive but the elaborate industry of intermediation massively improves our lives. He couldn’t see a case for getting rid of this wholesale, and he saw many downsides to the very notion of P2P exchange. It was hard for me to wrap my brain around this critique of cryptocurrency. At the same time, looking back and reflecting on some recent experiences, I can see a case for his point.Only a few months later, I had a buggy wallet on my phone hacked. Poof, there went 10 bitcoins. To this day, I can see this transaction on the blockchain. It just sits there. It’s never moved. That transparency is beautiful to behold. But there’s a problem. I have no idea to whom the owning public address belongs. Otherwise I would write that address and say: hey, give me back my property!But in what sense is a stolen bitcoin still my property? I am free to think of it as such but the reality is that someone else owns it. There is no governing body to adjudicate this dispute. There is no way to get my money back because, well, it’s not really money that belongs to me anymore, if you think of ownership and control as the same. Stupid Wallet MistakesJust yesterday, I accidentally tried to send $930,000.00 in crypto to someone. Fortunately I didn’t have that much money, so the wallet balked. If I had, another address would have been in control of exactly that amount. How did this happen? I used the wrong currency denomination, just because I wasn’t paying close attention.Yes, it was my fault. It’s called a mistake. Current crypto conventions are radically intolerant toward mistakes. Instant settlement. No counterparty risk. No trust is necessary. Poof, you are broke. We are all one tiny click away from full bankruptcy. No going back. A few months ago, I was standing around after a speech and handing out two bucks in bitcoin cash to anyone who wanted it. Nice party trick! Meanwhile I was carrying on conversations. So I got a bit distracted. At one point, I was about to click send but something tickled my brain. I did a second look at my screen. I was on my way toward sending a stranger $2,000. I backed out of the transaction just in time. Had I gone ahead, I would have found myself in an awkward position of having to beg some stranger for my money back. He would have been under no legal or contractual obligation to cough it up. Welcome to the world of P2P exchange. There is no third party authority to adjudicate disputes at all. I’m thinking of other cases. Just a few weeks ago, I sent $50 to the wrong address, simply because I had pasted the wrong address in the window on my phone. I had relied on the Mac-OS system that duplicates copy-paste from the laptop to the phone, but, for whatever reason, it didn’t happen to work in that instance. Probably my fault. Fortunately, the address to which I sent the money was one I controlled. The more you use this stuff, the more stories you have to tell about mistakes. They are legion. With the scaling problems that came to fruition in 2017, users discovered another source of uncertainty. You didn’t know in advance that the transaction would be expensive or affordable, fast or slow. I was stunned by the middle of the year to discover that I could no longer send a buck or two to a new adopter, unless I want to pay three or four times that much in transaction fees. To whom does one complain? Bitcoin is not a company, has no 800 number, has no terms of use, and offers no support at all. It’s all on you. To be sure, there are wonderful aspects of this. The near elimination of counterparty risk is great. That there are no chargebacks is a godsend for merchants who deal with a constant fraud problem with credit cards. There is no identity theft. You don’t open up your account to find that someone has spent a few thousand dollars in a casino in Louisiana. It really is like cash for the Internet. The Trouble with ExchangesMany of us have complained for years about how crypto exchanges are dominating the market. Coinbase today has more users than Charles Schwab. It’s just a bank. You are trusting someone else to control your access. It can be shut down at any time. In fact, you face a greater risk of getting your crypto exchange account closed that you would in having a conventional bank freeze your funds. It happens to people all the time. If you are using an exchange, you do not control your private keys. It’s a trust relationship, not all that different from the existing financial system. We can kvetch about this all day, and I do, but we might also recognize that the success of Coinbase really is the market speaking. You can say that people are stupid and so on, but the truth is that consumers rather like...consumer services. When I bring up this subject to my crypto friends, they immediately talk about the role of smart contracts, better user interfaces, and further innovations down the road. All of this is true. Remember that there were many problems with email in the early days, and they were mostly all solved in time. The same will be true in crypto spaces. That said, we are probably being overly confident in claiming that the great merit of crypto is disintermediation of all things. That probably won’t happen. In fact, if the market decides that it does not want that, it probably should not happen. And let’s recall that there is a huge difference between forced intermediation and voluntary intermediation. What we are really seeking is not universal disintermediation as such but rather universal competition and choice. Here is where we find the true brilliance of the crypto revolution. We now posses the ability to use a money that is entirely disconnected from the nation state and its macroeconomic policies. It’s all about choice in money, and many choice in everything. If we get our utopia someday, it will be because crypto killed forced monopolization. "

[+] Credit: Getty Royalty Free,"Ether prices have taken a beating lately, repeatedly hitting fresh, annual lows in recent weeks.Earlier today, this digital currency, the world's second-largest by market capitalization (market cap), dropped to $170.26 on CoinMarketCap.At that point, it was down close to 90% from its all-time high of more than $1,400 in January.[Ed. note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]After the cryptocurrency suffered this sharp decline, is now a good time to buy ether?Several market analysts weighed in on this question.Valuing Cryptocurrencies ComplexValuing digital currencies can be difficult, as not everyone agrees on which fundamentals to use and how much weight they should be given.""There is no clear valuation model for digital assets,"" emphasized Marius Rupsys, a cryptocurrency analyst.""People look at number of transactions, then at number of daily active users but there is no one model to derive actual value of protocols such as ethereum.""""This technology is still in its early stages,"" he noted. As a result, ""it would be rather difficult to say at this point of time if ether should be valued at $200 or at $1,000."" Ether's Great PotentialWhile some emphasized the difficulty of accurately valuing digital assets like ether, others stressed the cryptocurrency's upside potential.""I still see ETH as having the brightest prospects of any cryptocoin, both as a platform for dapps etc and as a globally usable digital money/store of value,"" said Jacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager.By fulfilling that role, the digital currency is far more than its current market capitalization, he stated.However, ""ETH is far from a mature product and if wide adoption does occur it could be years away,"" noted Eliosoff. ""So I'm cautiously optimistic...  But it will take patience!""Ether 'Undervalued'Of the analysts polled, most respondents claimed that ether was trading below its true or ""intrinsic"" value.""Crypto assets in general, including Ethereum, are undervalued at this stage,"" asserted Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency fund of hedge funds BitBull Capital. While digital currencies have lost more than two-thirds of their market cap this year, he noted that ether has fallen even more.""The Ethereum network has some of the best development talent and community support, so buying it for medium to long-term holds would make sense,"" he added. Iqbal Gandham, U.K. managing director for social trading platform eToro, offered similar input, stating that:""I believe it is undervalued based on the development that has occurred since it was last at this stage.""Eric Ervin, CEO of Blockforce Capital, concurred, offering some figures to back up his claim. ""At its current price it is reasonable to consider ether as undervalued,"" he stated.""According to our research, the current logarithmic price difference between bitcoin and ether is greater than 3 standard deviations from its average.

","In the fast-paced world of blockchain and cryptocurrency, every move power players make is important and success is determined by their intuition, skill set, team and acquired knowledge. Much of the latter comes from reading various books. So here are a few of the top picks currently trending and favored by a few leaders in the space. Take note and learn.We kick off with a very transparent Joseph Lubin, founder ConsenSys and co-founder Ethereum, who is a confident enough notable to keep it real. Lubin says he that just doesn't read books because he doesn't have enough time. (He’s kinda busy whipping up Web 3.0 most days, as you may already know). However, he notes that he's always been a fan of cypherpunk sci-fi books like Neal Stephenson's Snowcrash and Cryptonomicon.Joseph Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum, pauses while speaking during a Bloomberg Television interview... [+] in New York, U.S. Photographer: Christopher Goodney/BloombergOn the other hand, ConsenSys CMO Amanda Gutterman more than balances out the void and is a true multi-tasker when it comes to her reading list. Her favorites right now are  Reinventing Organizations by Frederic Laloux and Ken Wilber as well as Techgnosis by Erik Davis. She is also reading Diaspora by Greg Egan, How To Change Your Mind by Michael Pollan, Evolving Ourselves by Juan Enriquez and The Sovereign Individual by James Dale Davidson. No small reading feat. Gutterman is also a huge fan of Bird By Bird by Anne Lamott. The CMO is starting to write a book of her own and says that this work is the best book she's ever read about writing a book.For Dr. Spiros Michalakis, quantum physicist and manager of outreach and staff researcher at Caltech's Institute for Quantum Information and Matter (IQIM), physics advisor on such films as Ant-Man, and all-around physics guru who is also featured in the upcoming documentary Trust Machine: The Story of Blockchain, his pick is definitely not for those interested in a bit of light reading before bed.Michalakis reveals, “The last book I read was The Order of Time by Carlo Rovelli. In my opinion, one of the most profound books on physics and the nature of reality ever written, by one of the deepest thinkers out there.”Next on the list is Chris Fabian, the technologist who co-founded UNICEF's Innovation Unit and currently leads UNICEF Ventures. He takes a specific approach to his book selections. Even in themidst of overseeing the $17 million-dollar UNICEF Venture Fund which he launched in 2015,  he has time to read a couple of selections. “I always read two books at a time, a fun one and hard one,"" he explains.Chris FabianFun, first. The winner is Gnomon by Nick Harkaway. ""I’m reading it because it’s smart, near-future science fiction about surveillance, DAOs, governance, recursion, and also sharks.  It also has a wonderful global cast of characters, a bunch of humor, financial markets, art, and also …sharks,"" Fabian says.Now, the hard one which is Quantum Computing: A Gentle Introduction by Eleanor Rieffel and Wolfgang Polak. “Quantum is coming fast, and I needed to brush up on my understanding and some of the computational models for a variety of reasons, including cryptography.  It has accessible and clear exercises as well as good descriptions of use-cases and historical context.”  “Brush up”?!? Uh-huh.  That’s why he’s Chris Fabian.Onto Mark Moss, cryptocurrency analyst for Market Disruptors for whom reading is all about a holistic approach. ""To really grasp and understand the Bitcoin revolution you have to understand many different aspects including the history of money, sound money, Austrian economics, geopolitics, cultural shifts, and technology and more importantly technological adoption cycles,"" says Moss. ""So I am currently reading and re-reading books on the topic of Austrian economics, personal privacy and freedoms.His picks are as follows. The Constitution of Liberty by F. A. Hayek, recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1991 and co-winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1974. Moss says that the book discusses the ideals of freedom and liberty that lifted western civilization to its place among nations today. “This book helps the reader to understand the ways political power manipulates situations to its advantage and the author does a good job of using factual history and philosophy to help get the points across clearly,” he explains.In addition,  Moss is reading The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous, Ph.D.  “This book does an awesome job tracing the history of money and showing how throughout history, civilizations have changed as their money systems have changed, specifically going from hard sound stores of value to inflated assets and fiat,” Moss adds. He says that the author makes a compelling case for gold being the best store of value and how the entire globe prospered when gold was the standard. “The author then introduces Bitcoin and explains how it's just like gold but better and can bring us back to a globally recognized hard store of value again,” Moss concludes.Now for Bill Tai whose reputation kinda precedes him. He’s the founding chairman of Treasure Data; Board Director of Bitfury; Chairman Hut8; seed investor in Canva, Color Genomics, Tweetdeck/Twitter, Wish.com and Zoom Video; catalyst for Airswap, and backer of Cryptokitties, among other activities. Ummmm… whatever he’s reading to generate all that influence, give us some!Bill Tai prepared to kiteboard in the San Francisco Bay off of Crissy Field in San Francisco,... [+] California. Photographer: Erin Lubin/Bloomberg News.Tai says, “Next on my list is The Square and the Tower: From Freemasons to Facebook by Niall Ferguson, which is a look back at the recurring power struggle between what we'd call today 'open source movements' (represented by the town square) and existing power in established hierarchy (represented by the tower).  Niall weaves in the impact of technology on communications at various points in history.”Tai adds that there have been two additional books that have influenced his thinking on Bitcoin, cryptocurrency and blockchain, to date. “One is The Mystery of Capital by Hernando de Soto, which lays out in my mind, granular ownership and empowerment - which Blockchain can facilitate - as the foundation of capitalism."" He emailed me that  The Ascent of Money by Niall Ferguson helped him to understand the role of community in what any group defines as currency and value exchange as a backdrop for today's ICO movement.In addition, Tai notes,  “I am not far into it, but I suspect that The Square and the Tower has a shot at influencing my viewpoint on how and why Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will play out - or not - as a foundational part of our economies long term.” Let’s see.And finally, Tim Draper successful venture capitalist and a crypto millionaire many, many times over has a few entries on his current reading list. He told me, “I am finally getting around to reading Satoshi’s whitepaper. I also love all the sci-fi being created around crypto, like all the Neal Stephenson books.”  In addition, Draper is hard at work updating his own book, How To Be The Startup Hero which will he says will include some hot, new Bitcoin and crypto stories.“Oh, and I’m reading a lot of emails from people who want to do ICOs. Some of the technologies are awesome!” "

Transactions can take minutes and even hours to confirm. Most cryptocurrencies are also too volatile to use by businesses. These, however, don't mean blockchain has no place in the payments space. As a technology, it has proven to be quite revolutionary especially for financial applications. While the aforementioned concerns may be largely true for most of the pioneering cryptocurrencies, newer projects have been working on to address these limitations. Banks and card companies are all working on their own blockchain payments projects.Digital payments has become an increasingly competitive space as consumer purchases shift to e-commerce and mobile commerce. 726 billion digital transactions are expected to be made in 2020. Because of this, banks, card companies, tech giants, and blockchain ventures are all competing for relevance.Blockchain and crypto technologies are also starting to evolve and mature. Further development may finally make crypto payments viable for daily use. Here are three issues that must be addressed by blockchain payments projects. Businesses aren't particularly happy with crypto's volatility. Merchants that support cryptocurrencies have to be wary of their wild price swings. Product pricing in crypto must be dynamic enough to cope with fluctuations. Many smaller operations also find it impractical to keep money tied-down in cryptocurrencies since business expenses require fiat currencies to perform.This is where pegged cryptocurrencies could come in. These coins match the price of fiat currencies to which they are pegged. For example, popular price-stable coins like Tether (USDT) and TrueUSD are US dollar-pegged. Using such coins for transactions allows businesses to avoid the volatility of coins like Bitcoin and Ether.While these dollar-pegged coins offer a greater degree of stability, they are still subject to the fluctuations of foreign exchange rates for businesses in non-USD territories. A better solution is to have more coins pegged to the local currencies in the countries in which they are used. Blockchain project T.OS seeks to provide such a mechanism. The venture is working on ways to allow each country to have its own stable coin. Through T.OS, consumers and merchants can go to designated exchanges where would be able to acquire tokens pegged to the local currency. These TOSP (Payable T.OS) coins essentially function as blockchain-based digital cash which can be used for just about any transaction within the territory.Transaction speed has become central to customer experience these days. Card companies have been working on improving contactless and frictionless payments technologies in order to further hasten the checkout process. However, pioneering cryptocurrencies aren’t exactly known for speed. Bitcoin, for instance, has been highly criticized for its slowness. It can take minutes for the network to confirm a single transaction. This could even take hours when the network is experience high volumes of traffic. This lack of speed makes Bitcoin ill-fitting for payment scenarios such as brick-and-mortar retail.Newer blockchains have been working on speed and scalability improvements. Blockchain-based financial platforms Ripple and Stellar both seek to match or even exceed the scale of payment networks like VISA which has a capacity to process 24,000 transactions per second. Ripple boasts that its network is capable of handling twice as much. At these speeds enable transactions to complete virtually in real-time.Blockchain-based payments must also offer customer experiences that make it easy for users to adopt. Fortunately, most of the crypto payment gateways feature interfaces that are easy to use. They now feature mobile and web apps. Also, gone are the days when users have to download clients and even run nodes of Bitcoin in order to receive and transfer funds.Some even make crypto payments work with traditional and legacy payment systems. Services like Bitpay and Cryptopay, for example, offer crypto-backed debit cards which can be used in just about any point-of-sale system or ATM. SpectroCoin also offers virtual cards that can be used for online gateways that accept card payments.These projects also offer merchant services and integrations with various point-of-sale and online shopping carts. By bridging the crypto payments experience with what’s familiar, both consumers and merchants would be able to readily adopt these solutions. It does seem that crypto payments have progressed well enough to overcome many of the issues that plagued early currencies like Bitcoin. These improvements appear to put crypto payments ventures at par with what other payments services can offer technology-wise. Crypto payments even have the advantage of leveraging blockchain's inherent security features. Transactions can easily be audited. Since blockchain payments are final, businesses can also avoid the cost of fraud and chargebacks.What's ultimately needed for crypto payments to succeed is widespread adoption. A key advantage of traditional payment methods over crypto payments is their ubiquity. They already have established global networks and infrastructures and consumers are already familiar with how to use them. Crypto payments, in contrast, is still developing its ecosystem and its linkages. The upside for crypto is the increasing tech-savviness of consumers and businesses. As users continue to embrace blockchain and crypto activities, crypto payments will eventually gain wider adoption. As it stands, however, the technology seems ready to overcome its initial barriers in payments.While we can all agree that Blockchain in payments is the underlining idea behind the creation of Bitcoin, one can't help but wonder if we are really ready as a society to cut middleman like banks and governments all together. These legally covered and organized entities have been around for decades and fact is - they still work. "

It did not stop there; now that we had digital money, we could do something paper cash never could; program the money. Suddenly, we could replace lawyers and contracts in financial transactions. This ""programmable money"" took decentralization to the next level as they could automatically execute the agreed contracts with full transparency and without human influence.But how do they work? Can we really rely on them and put our trust in these trustless systems?Nick Szabo, an American computer scientist and cryptographer was the first to introduce Smart contracts – back in 1994. However, smart contracts gained popularity with the introduction of Ethereum, which uses the Solidity language to program the contracts. Bitcoin also supports smart contracts, but one must know opcode programming to use it. This makes smart contracts usage in Bitcoin very limited, not to mention that its capabilities are less too.To offer full smart contract support on the Bitcoin network, Rootstock was developed. Like Ethereum, Rootstock (or RSK) uses the Solidity language, but it can achieve 100 transactions per second and adds news blocks at 10 seconds average interval, which is lower than the current Ethereum block with an average block interval of 16 seconds.Smart contracts are open-source, self-executing code that runs when certain conditions have been met: have all involved parties signed the transaction? Has the 30 days limit passed and the tokens can be liquidated? Did the ICO reach its soft cap or should the funds be reversed?The Ethereum platform has been used for many projects, as it lets anyone easily create their own tokens on top of it. Due to its open nature, and due to the fact that the contract code is known in advance and it cannot be changed or altered by malicious actors, many suggest that smart contracts could replace traditional contracts. Smart contracts are fast, they execute immediately and autonomously and there is no way any party could influence it.However, there is also resistance to this belief: instead of reading a contract written in plain English, the user now has to study the code and understand programming language. Few users have the knowledge to do so and fewer spend the time to go through it. Thus, those who reject smart contracts argue that this system is not “trustless” after all; the users must still trust in the developers and the community - and there have been cases where they failed us.While Blockchain’s structure prevents any outsider to alter the code, hackers still find bugs or overlooked pitfalls in the published codes and use them against the system. The most infamous example is the DAO hack, one of the first hacks where the attacker stole $60 million. During Parity’s hack, 150,000 ethers where stolen. However, a while after that, a user “accidentally” triggered a bug in the smart contract which caused more than 513,774.16 ETH to freeze – equal to $280 million at the time. Ironically, the hack consumed vulnerabilities in the security fixes from the last hack.Bancor was hacked for $23.5 million, however the company managed to counter and block parts of the breach, which is very unusual for a decentralized platform.Usually, reverting these losses typically requires consensus from the majority of the community, which must agree to “forks” – i.e. they must agree to update their system to a new version where the stolen tokens are reverted. And in some cases, they have been reluctant to agree to the updates.There are many fields that can be disrupted by smart contracts: voting, management, supply chains, healthcare and real estate. The ability to have several parties cooperate without any of them being able to manipulate or use the system in their favor, being unhackable and transparent not only paves the way for new innovations and collaboration between bodies not possible before, but also makes those procedures much more efficient. But as explained, smart contracts also have their downsides and vulnerabilities.For this reason, some projects have evolved around making smart contracts more secure and accessible to the everyday person.Etherparty has invested heavily into user research to identify common challenges experienced by users today. The platform completely spares users of the coding knowledge needed to create smart contracts. The core of this platform is centered around the FUEL Smart Contract Engine which abstracts the complexity of deploying to the blockchain and maps user-provided information directly to smart contracts pulled from its internal library. This lets users create what they need quickly, apply modifications with ease, and obtain results that already contain industry best practices which are secure. Furthermore, the platform is blockchain agnostic, which means it can create smart contracts on multiple blockchain networks (currently it supports Ethereum and Rootstock).Of course, creating just any smart contract with a UI could eventually become too complex. Instead, Etherparty has focused on two products: Rocket (for ICOs), and Hero (for charities). Rocket is currently live and is Etherparty’s first product that helps ICOs create tokens, define addresses and breakdown of the sales and discounts during the different milestones. Version 2.0 of Rocket will have the option to deploy security tokens, allow people to indicate voting rights, and include customizable features that will better describe the crowdfund.This approach creates a final product that runs automatically and ensures safe contract execution. But there are cases where we also need the “intention” of the contract before it has been executed. The legal world requires all involved parties to understand what they are signing, and the spirit of the contract eventually decides the fate of unpredicted scenarios.Ian Grigg coined Richardian contracts in tribute to David Ricardo. These contracts add markup (e.g. JSON or XML) to human readable contracts, making them understandable by machines. After all involved parties sign off the contract, it is hashed to ensure no party can change it. The crypto-community has welcomed these kinds of contracts in projects like OpenBazaar and EOS. SciDex has taken this concept and evolved it to “RASC”: Ricardian Adaptive Smart Contracts. The aim of the RASC is to create human-readable contracts that can be indexed and used by machines while also accounting for variations of the contract, and third parties that validate the transactions.Without making this a John Grisham novel, legal contracts can face years of dispute. Smart contracts are still behind their “legal” counterparts as they cannot be that inclusive, but they execute swiftly and leave no room for double-interpretation where they are applied. It probably won’t put lawyers out of jobs, but could greatly reduce the load – on them and on their clients."
119,https://www.forbes.com/,"Oct 22, 2018",There Is Bipartisan Agreement That Cryptocurrency Is Good For Politics,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerhuang/2018/10/22/there-is-bipartisan-agreement-that-cryptocurrency-is-good-for-politics/,"Kentucky Senator Rand Paul accepted bitcoin as part of his presidential run

Jared Polis, now running for Colorado governor) and a Republican (then Rep. Mick Mulvaney, now Acting Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Director of the Office of Management and Budget). It has two Democrats and two Republicans as its co-chairs.While it is focused on extending blockchain for data ownership, healthcare, and different government applications, it represents a forward-thinking attitude towards all the applications of the blockchain. Cryptocurrencies certainly seem to fit the bill.A recent study indicated that 60% of eligible voters believed that the same standards for monetary donations with the United States dollar should apply to cryptocurrency.It also shows a remarkable bipartisan consistency in those views, with 63% of self-declared Republicans and 52% of self-declared Democrats agreeing.Both 27% of Republicans and 25% of Democrats would be more inclined to donate to political campaigns if cryptocurrency was something they accepted.This was a study based on a weighted survey of eligible US voters done through Mechanical Turk -- and though the sample size of 1000+ is impressive, it is based on self-reported data and therefore can't be regarded as entirely accurate. However, it seems indicative of a bottoms-up enthusiasm for cryptocurrency in politics, which is being adapted by some forward-thinking political campaigns.Candidates from both sides of the divide have started accepting cryptocurrency as part of their campaign.Brian Forde, a Democrat and a White House senior advisor in the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Obama Administration started accepting cryptocurrencies as part of his bid to become the Democratic nominee for the California 45th District (he ultimately fell to fourth in the top-two primary system for the district). Kentucky Senator Rand Paul accepted bitcoin as part of his presidential run in 2016, becoming the first presidential candidate of a major political party to accept cryptocurrency donations. Democrat Andrew Yang, running an upstart campaign focused on basic income, has also indicated that he is willing to accept cryptocurrency donations, making the presidential candidate's effort to raise funding through cryptocurrencies something that has crossed into both major parties. The FEC (Federal Election Committee) has stated in an advisory note that political committees can receive bitcoin donations as long as it counts them per their current monetary value and treats them like any other contribution.Bitcoin can be received as an ""in-kind"" donation -- political committees have to liquidate any Bitcoin they hold in order to spend the funds, and they can't spend the cryptocurrency directly for any service or good. The FEC hasn't staked a position on any other cryptocurrency, but it can't be hard to imagine that same principle applying to any number of altcoins.However, that's all we've heard from the FEC and the note is merely advisory and only holds sway for federal elections (i.e elections to Congress and presidential campaigns) -- it doesn't have any binding regulatory power, and states like Kansas have gone so far as to ban cryptocurrency contributions in state and local elections, citing it as being ""worse than the Russians.""California (despite being the hub of cryptocurrency activity in North America) and North Carolina followed up by outright banning cryptocurrency donations in state and local elections. Several other states are currently weighing the matter, with states like Oregon, Colorado, and Tennessee supporting a more permissive stance.What this mix of blue and red states shows is that cryptocurrency is one of the rare true wedge issues that cuts across partisan lines. This may be due to a general lack of knowledge -- only 8% of Americans in a study of 2,000 Americans held bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in early 2018. Prominent politicians such as Senator Elizabeth Warren have started voicing opposition and skepticism about cryptocurrency so this may change.Fears and concerns were voiced by eligible American voters about foreign interference in elections using cryptocurrency, and the possibility of increased criminality. Rand Paul voiced concerns about cryptocurrencies being in a bubble even as he accepted bitcoin contributions. It isn't all sunshine and roses for cryptocurrencies in politics.Yet hidden within the din of partisan politics is a rare grassroots consensus among some Republicans and some Democrats that cryptocurrencies are good for politics."

This cryptocurrency is pegged to the dollar, but built on the blockchain so that it can be transferred on the Ethereum network. It is also potentially subject to a higher regulatory standard than other stablecoins, such as Tether. Ultimately, this is a useful innovation, but a poor investment option.A Important BridgeStablecoins may fill an interesting role in creating a bridge between digital money and fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar. There is clearly a technologically valuable role to be played here. The U.S. dollar is a standard unit of accounting used just about everywhere. Whereas, pricing things in Bitcoins, for example, can create complications for easy-to-understand pricing or simple contracts. For example, if I tell you a bottle of Coke costs $2 you probably have a pretty clear sense what that means, if I tell you it costs 0.00032 Bitcoin then the mental math is a bit trickier. Plus tomorrow a Coke will likely still be $2, but it may not stay 0.00032 Bitcoin if the Bitcoin price moves. In this way, stablecoins may create a platform for further innovation in digital currencies and contracts. They offer a simple link back to the world of fiat currencies.Nonetheless, during a downbeat year in which many crypto-currencies have halved or worse at the time of writing, some are praising stablecoins for the prospect of low volatility they offer. This is the wrong conclusion to draw. It is not where the value of stablecoins lies. First, off just about any financial asset is less volatile than crypto-currencies over the past 12 months. Saying stablecoins are less volatile than other crypto assets is not much of a statement. Just about anything is less volatile than many crypto assets today.The Problems With The U.S. DollarThere's little reason to own stablecoins as investments. The main issue is simply that the U.S. dollar itself has historically been a very poor investment. Ironically, one of the interesting promises of crypto-currencies is decentralization. Basically, the government cannot create more of cryptocurrency when they have bills to pay. That's a good thing. When governments print extra money it dilutes the value of the currency. For example, if you owned a dollar in 1918 then, now a century later than dollar would be able to purchase the equivalent of 6 cents back in 1918. That's an enormous drop. A dollar is still a dollar, of course, but what you're able to buy with that dollar is far less.The value of currencies tends to steadily decline over time, some faster than others. In fact, the U.S. is one of the better examples. Zimbabwe shows what can happen when excessive money is printed and the currency's value falls effectively to zero. Basically, by pegging a stablecoin to the U.S. dollar, you are forcing it to be a relatively bad investment because its value derives entirely from a relatively bad investment. Yes, the U.S. dollar may be less volatile than many crypto-assets, and indeed many other fiat currencies. Nonetheless, being better than several potentially bad investments, does not make something a good investment. Also, unfortunately, by pegging a stablecoin to a currency with the problem of centralization, some of the decentralized benefits of most cryptocurrencies are lost. Again, stablecoins are a useful interim technological step, but offer little more than that to the investor.AsymmetrySo, stablecoins have a role to play in financial innovation, but being drawn to them as investments for their stability makes little sense. It's also worth considering the asymmetry inherent in stablecoins. Yes, a stablecoin may hold its value over time. However, it's highly unlikely that a stablecoin will ever trade at a premium to the underlying asset it tracks. Nonetheless, a stablecoin could trade at a discount. This could happen for reasons of lack of trust or, in certain cases, lack of use. Therefore, you have an undesirable setup where, in the best case, your stablecoin dollar is indeed worth a dollar, but in the worst case it trades for less. Hence with stablecoins you're potentially only taking on downside risk. This is different from traditional crypto-currencies, where there is more symmetry to risk, meaning they can plausibly both rise and fall in value just as history shows. Hopefully, the regulatory environment for the Gemini dollar and the processes behind it work as expected, but again if it's solved there's little upside to be had, just downside should it not work. On day one, there's little reason to take those odds.A stablecoin, especially in the early days of its introduction is as if you were flipping a coin and your outcomes were that heads you get your money back and tails you lose. Normally, with investments the prospect of upside and compensate for or hopefully exceed the downside risk, but since stablecoins have little upside, buying a stablecoin ""at par"" or at the same price as the value of the instrument it tracks makes little sense, especially if the asset being tracked is an undesirable investment. Nonetheless, over time certain stablecoins may be able to establish credibility and it will likely be good for financial innovation if they are robust.So stablecoins have an important role to play in driving innovation in digital currencies and contracts. However, that doesn't mean you need to own them today. The prospect of apparent stability by being tied to the U.S. dollar is not the same as a good return, even though it may feel that way in today's crypto market. "

defining strategy when it comes to the space, and the difference in ...","Sep 17, 2018,03:46pm EDT",The Great Wall of China,"For a couple of years now it has appeared as if the Chinese government is seeking to “have its cake and eat it too” when it comes to crypto assets and blockchain technology. The simple phrase “Blockchain not Bitcoin” has become the country’s defining strategy when it comes to the space, and the difference in approaches that the government has taken regarding open v. closed ledgers and assets is a study in contrast.Consider the following – all of which happened in the last month:At the same time, the CPC has been overtly hostile to any and all activities related to crypto assets. Last September the government banned all ICOs in the country, and in the same month local Chinese exchanges were ordered to cease operations. The end result, in the last 12 months 90 different cryptocurrency exchanges and about 85 ICOs have closed in China. Now the government extended this ban to over 100 international exchanges that served the Chinese market, ending one of the last options that crypto traders had to get access to crypto assets without using a Virtual Private Network (VPN). Furthermore, the government is blocking crypto-related accounts on the country’s predominant social media platforms such as WeChat.This leads to two critical questions:A small anecdote and an example can help shed some light on the Chinese mentality.10 years ago, a senior official within the George W. Bush administration gave a speech in New York City on America’s foreign policy. The discussion eventually turned to the U.S.-Chinese relationship, and the official shared a conversation that he had with a counterpart in Beijing. The American began discussing what kept him up at night, mentioning the invasion of Afghanistan, the Global War on Terror, and future attack in the U.S. as key concerns. He then candidly asked the Chinese representative the same question, expecting an answer along the lines of controlling Tibetan unrest or maintaining peace across the Taiwan Strait. Instead, he got a one-word answer, 8. Upon being asked for clarification, the gentleman said he was referring to a need to maintain at least 8% GDP growth on an annual basis to keep unemployment low and the country stable. He made it clear that nothing less than the stability and legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) was at stake.  The takeaway from this conversation: the Chinese government focuses on domestic stability above all else, and economic growth is the key enabler. Therefore, officials in Beijing will not let crypto, or any other technology, threaten its authority or legitimacy to rule.As a sign of the government’s commitment, it is important to note that this is not the first time that China retrofitted a breakthrough technology for its own market. While most enthusiasts praise the business models and success of leading Chinese technology firms such as Alibaba and Tencent, they exist in their current state today largely because of the protection provided by China’s “Great Internet Firewall” as well as protectionist regulatory measures that delayed or outright prevented American companies like Facebook from accessing the market. Additionally, these firms all enjoy close ties to officials in Beijing and collaborate with Internet monitors to ban speech and content that is contrary to domestic stability, showing that censorship and success are not mutually exclusive.That said, the stakes are higher this time around and taking this same approach to blockchain technology is nothing less than a double-down of its strategy vis-à-vis Google and Facebook. First, blockchain technology is naturally distributed, which is a significant complicating factor, but not insurmountable. Second, never before has the government had to deal with crypto assets and cryptocurrencies that cannot be banned or sanctioned without blocking the Internet as a whole. Monetary policy plays a key role in China’s economic strategy, and if Bitcoin or another crypto asset or crypto currency was to gain widespread acceptance, it would limit Beijing’s ability to steward the country forward in continued prosperity in more ways than one.For instance, if Bitcoin or a stablecoin became a medium for exchange, especially for international trade, it would limit the efficacy of China’s exchange rate policies that have historically supported its export industry. Additionally, crypto assets are extremely volatile, and investors in the space often hear the common disclaimer that they need to be prepared to lose all of their holdings. China has almost 1.4 billion citizens, and if even a small percentage of those individuals lost 90% of their holdings, as many investors in the U.S. did last year, it would cause a significant strain on their social service programs.Therefore, while it is easy to advocate for open policies, there also need to be emergency breaks in the system.Looking ahead, it is clear that China will continue to rely on strategies that have worked for it in the past. However, it remains to be seen if government officials in Beijing will see the same results. Even with these restrictions in place the country will continue to be one of the most critical hotbeds of innovation in the space. Over time as the industry develops, the government may be more amenable to crypto assets as well."

This was a bit of a surprise for some squatters who for some nefarious reason or other had been given access to the house. They were friendly enough and were working on Ethereum derivative contracts for their pre-startup startup.Hopefully they had a bucket of cheap coins when the boom came, but if they did they probably sold like any sensible person would when they had turned hundreds of dollars into thousands.You have to be a bit madder than the average squatting Ethereum derivative contract startup member to hold onto your assets from $20 to $1,200.Plenty of people have held from $1,200 to $200.[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]Crypto was last year’s bubble and now we are in the pit of that crash. Perhaps not the bottom of the pit but we are certainly getting there and for altcoins, getting there fast.In my mind without doubt, just like the dotcom spawned a pile of listed companies with no business at all and huge valuations, the same is true in cryptocurrency and tokens. The market contains a huge amount of trash like the Nasdaq did in 1999 and like the trash loans wrapped up in the fancy investment bank derivatives of the credit crunch in 2008.That is what drives a bubble, money chasing trash. Then the blowtorch of reality steps in and after the fire the real deals are left behind.You can already see the obvious winning crowd in the charts of crypto. They are bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash, litecoin, monero, dash and doge. Yes, these are all distributed blockchains without fallible groups of people to mess up, go to jail, run off with the money, go mad, drop dead etc. Private blockchains and tokens will have winners too, perhaps, but while their figureheads jabber away on Twitter I prefer to bet on the systems without humans that have no fear, have no remorse and can’t be stopped.Whatever the outcome, one thing seems clear, the crash is not over yet. For most coins and tokens the trend is obvious and down.Naysayers say that trend will extend to $0 but it won’t. Bitcoin has already based and no one should believe even if it took another leg down that bitcoin will vanish.Here is the chart:chart of bitcoin USD from October 2017 to the presentI still have hopes of getting some cheap BTC but it is clear the market currently thinks BTC is cheap enough. We will know in a few weeks. I’m gently acquiring bitcoin because it is demonstrating its dominance.Meanwhile ethereum is another matter. Let me be clear, as someone blamed by the crypto press as a serious factor of bitcoin’s slump back down from $10,000, it is about time I crashed ethereum. I need to flex my pundit power.So here is the chart and what could well transpire:The ethereum price since April 2016This destination is $100 a coin. By the way, I do own some ethereum.The problem for ethereum is that a huge number of owners got ethereum by selling their pipe dreams in ICOs. Startups are generally pipe dreams and some payout hugely. ICOs as a replacement for venture capital is a massive innovation but it makes funding startups no less risky, fraught or flaky.There is a huge group of outfits rich in ethereum, spending in fiat. That fiat must be covered in sales of ethereum. Their money flow has to be out of ethereum into fiat. Ethereum was the currency they got paid in and it is fading fast, no sensible startup would hold onto it, when they must pay bills in ‘real’ money. This is what is dragging heavily on ethereum. When it will stop is hard to know.This flow can reverse and will when a next generation of ICOs come to market and people buy ethereum to buy tokens.It doesn’t take a Nostradamus to see the ethereum trend. If it doesn’t base now, it is on its way to $100. That’s the way bubbles and crashes work. Here is a simplistic anatomy of a crash:The anatomy of a market crashTo trade a crash, you have to let the instrument base. Crashes that make a V-shaped bottom are extremely rare, the W-shaped bottom above is how crashes tend to pan out. You do not try to get the absolute bottom, you want to buy when the panic is over and the recriminations are underway. If you get out near the top and get in someway after the initial recovery you will do very well indeed.This bottoming will occur when the money flow in or out of crypto is neutral. This equilibrium creates a base, the bottom of the market. Market bottoms do not reverse quickly; however fast it came down it recovers much less fast. Confidence takes time to repair. So you do not have to hurry to re-enter.When in doubt, take a look at the dotcom crash and the 2007-2008 credit crunch crash. This is how crashes pan out.It is not fate that $200 is not the bottom for ethereum, but as the above crash anatomy shows, if $200 was to be the bottom then a period of trading around this price is needed to establish a level of safety to return to the market.That certainty is not in place.When you look at companies that have gone on to do well after the dotcom crash, they were few and their low points were very low indeed.In this crypto-winter, spring is still someway off.

ICE is the owner of ...","Oct 4, 2018,11:43pm EDT",Wall Street Intercontinentalexchange,"After a brutal beat down of bitcoin's price this year, digital currencies might be poised for a rebound with two milestone projects coming online in November. One has the backing of the owner of a major stock bourse, while the other is stacked with crypto's biggest virtual currency exchanges. Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, is aiming to develop a new crypto trading platform through a company called Bakkt. And the venture's first step in developing its open and regulated global ecosystem for digital assets will be the launch of one-day bitcoin futures contracts that will start trading on ICE's exchange in November. The futures contracts will be physically delivered, which means holders will get bitcoin rather than cash upon settlement. Competing exchange groups Cboe Global Markets and CME Group both launched cash-settled bitcoin futures last December.ICE is the owner of the New York Stock Exchange and a dominant player in the futures market. It's new venture has already garnered the support of the Boston Consulting Group, Microsoft, Starbucks, as well as Li Ka-shing's Horizons Ventures, among others.The heavyweight lineup behind Bakkt led many to believe that they might soon be able to use bitcoin to buy their lattes, but Starbucks clarified that it was only at the beginning stages of exploring a new payment option. In an email exchange with Forbes, a Starbucks representative wrote: ""Our role as the flagship retailer for Bakkt is to consult and develop applications for customers to convert their digital assets into U.S. dollars, which can then be used in our stores.""Even without being able to directly swap BTC for frappuccinos, the mega-chain with roughly 27,400 stores and 15 million members in its rewards program demands a large audience. The Seattle-based coffee giant believes that ""a range of cryptocurrencies will gain traction with customers,"" and it wants to be a first mover in what it refers to as a $270 billion digital asset marketplace, at the time of the company's announcement. ""Our role as the flagship retailer for Bakkt is to consult and develop applications for customers to convert their digital assets into U.S. dollars, which can then be used in our stores.""The total market cap of all crypto currencies skyrocketed to more than $800 billion at the market peak in January, before a massive selloff ensued. Meanwhile, Wall Street has been abuzz about Bakkt, the brainchild of CEO Kelly Loeffler and husband Jeff Sprecher, the CEO and chairman of ICE, the world's third-largest exchange group. She traded in her post as chief communications and marketing officer of ICE for the better part of the last two decades to lead the new venture.""Bakkt is by far the most significant development in the cryptocurrency space this year,"" says Jehan Chu, cofounder and managing director of blockchain firm Kenetic. ""It legitimizes the space and creates a doorway for institutional trade and enterprises."" Others believe a player like ICE illustrates the maturity of the market, but ""an ETF would be a much bigger win for the industry,"" says Ken Lo, CEO of ANX International. The SEC has rejected no less than 10 such exchange-traded fund proposals in the past year. Starbucks has already garnered considerable attention from its partnership with Bakkt, but the involvement of Horizon Ventures, the venture capital fund of Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, is just as noteworthy. Li controls a global empire that spans drugstores, supermarkets, consumer electronics, telecoms and utilities, among others. And although a spokesman for Horizons Ventures was unable to provide comment on the fund's investment or plans, Bakkt has said that its overall aim is to enable ""consumers and institutions to buy, sell, store and spend digital assets on a global seamless network."" Bakkt's potential for gaining widespread adoption through brick and mortar stores contrasts with that of Terra, a crypto project launching next month that relies instead on e-commerce.""We feel e-commerce is fundamentally more efficient and scalable,"" says Daniel Shin, cofounder of Terra. His Singapore-based startup is preparing to launch a payment method called TerraX that will be transacted using a ""stablecoin"" that he says can provide the benefits of digital currencies without the volatility. The Terra token will be backed by a second token called Luna, which will derive its value from transaction fees on the Terra network. TerraX Shin, too, has the backing of major bourses, not stock exchanges per se, but some of the crypto world's largest, including OKEx, Huobi and Binance's incubation program, Binance Labs. TerraX also counts among its investors Asia's hottest crypto hedge fund, FBG Capital, which became an overnight sensation for turning $20 million into $200 million in under a year.Additionally, TerraX has already established partnerships with some 15 e-commerce platforms that include food tech firm Woowa Brothers and South Korea's popular fashion site Musinsa, among others. The service is slated to begin with Ticket Monster, one of Korea's top online marketplaces, also a company that Shin himself founded in 2010. Collectively, the sites offer access to more than 45 million active users across Asia. ""Instead of integrating with each merchant, you integrate with the platform itself and get access to all the consumers and merchants,"" says Shin, who makes no secret that his model is derived from the successes of Alipay and PayPal.Which single-syllable company will unleash the most potential in the crypto economy? Both will likely have a role to play in the future form of money and the way people spend it. ""We don't know how big the pie is. The crypto space is not crowded enough,"" Lo says. "

TechCrunch Disrupt, the world's leading authority in debuting revolutionary startups, gathers the brightest entrepreneurs, investors, hackers, and tech fans for on-stage interviews. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg","This week it was announced that the most prestigious venture capital firm in Silicon Valley, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), made a $15 million investment in the decentralized token MKR, created by MakerDAO.   MKR is a complementary asset to the actual stablecoin, Dai, which will maintain a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar even though it will actually be backed by Ether.At first glance, this investment may seem irresponsible or mis-guided.Why would a company that has positions in technology blue-bloods such as Airbnb, Box, Facebook, Groupon, Lyft, Skype, Slack and Twitter, have an interest in an investment that has the word “stable” as part of its title? One would think that the team behind any stablecoin would not even get a meeting with the a16z investment team, let alone a term sheet. Think about it, stablecoins are programmatically designed to never increase in value. This is the antithesis of venture capital.That said, firms like a16z do not become successful because they are in the business of losing investor money or making bad decisions. While any investment is inherently risky, there must be a reason why they felt this to a prudent allocation of their capital.However, before we get to this point, a brief refresher on stablecoins.Stablecoins are simply crypto assets that are designed to maintain a consistent value no matter the circumstances. Although this goal seems basic, it addresses a significant pain point in the crypto ecosystem, price volatility. Bitcoin was designed to be a slightly deflationary asset with an issuance cap of 21 million. This simple monetary policy was intended to encourage Bitcoin’s use as a currency or stable store of value because it was programmatically immune from government-driven inflation.However, even casual watchers of the space over the last 12 months remember the extreme bull market that took over the industry and saw Bitcoin approach $20k and Ether rise to over $1k. As exciting as these appreciations were, they were crippling to anyone’s hopes of using crypto for payments and commerce. Nobody would pay for a good with money that could double in value tomorrow, and conversely no merchant would accept payment in a currency that could similarly lose 20% of its value overnight.Liquidity is critical to the functioning of any economy, and with so many people holding on to their crypto in hopes of price appreciations, it was – and still is – drying up. According to the latest figures from Chainalysis, 4.8 million Bitcoin, or 32% of the total outstanding supply, is held in personal wallets with some activity since August 31. Furthermore, these numbers are actually up from the end of 2017, when only 3.8 million Bitcoin were held in active personal wallets.There was a bottleneck clogging the system, and crypto enthusiasts are hoping that stablecoins will open things up again.But again, even if they succeed, why would a venture firm be interested in making this happen?There are two key reasons.First, most prominent firms, such as a16z, Sequioa, Union Square ventures, etc have made multiple multimillion-dollar bets on decentralized protocols and applications that have yet to either launch or pay off. To get a sense of the amount of money at stake consider this, according to August 2018 data from Bloomberg, ICOs have raised $18 billion this year alone. Many offerings either initially or exclusively targeted accredited or institutional investors, such as venture capitalists, because that strategy allows the founders to complete their rounds without having to worry about much regulatory scrutiny. According to data from CoinSchedule, 18% of these funds raised were done so exclusively through private sales, and 37% of all sales included a private pre-sale. In fact, the team behind a competing stablecoin, Basis, completed its $133 million raise entirely through a private round.A lot is at stake for these investors, and while there is plenty of risk in any investment, poor liquidity could be fatal for all.  In theory stablecoins address this because rather than forcing each user to keep a wallet with 25 different utility tokens that are each used for a specific application, the individual could hold most of its money in a stablecoin and easily exchange it for the required token. The individual should have no issue making this exchange because the stablecoin will be worth tomorrow or next week as much as it is today.Put another way, stablecoin investments are a form of insurance for their crypto portfolio companies.However, that is not the only reason.The longer-term potential for stablecoins and their wallets is to become retail banks and monetary systems in their own right. Most issuers today charge fees for redemptions and withdrawals, and some like MakerDAO also charge a form of interest for a user to purchase the stablecoin. In time these assets can be used to everything from facilitating loans to making IoT payments. It makes perfect sense that the founding teams and investors behind these applications and services will take small fees for each transaction along the same lines as the interchange fees that banks and card networks take for payments that go over their networks.Assuming that one stablecoin, of the more than 20 that exist today, can win out and achieve network effects, the payoff could be both huge and sustainable. Venture capital firms are not the only ones who recognize the opportunity. Goldman Sachs, who long eschewed retail banking, has gone “all in” in the sector, starting with small consumer loans under its Marcus brand, and now offering savings accounts, credit cards, and has plans to provide point-of-sale loans, wealth management tools, insurance and car loans, among other services. The company is hoping that its retail banking business will generate $1 billion in revenue by 2020.  Citibank, which has a much more established consumer banking arm generated $8.4 billion in annual revenue in Q4 2017 alone. These numbers would surely interest any investor based on Sand Hill Road.Therefore, while it may seem counterproductive or irresponsible, there are very tangible reasons why venture capital firms like a16z are very active in the stablecoin space. The key will be finding the right balance between using their funds and expertise to grow the networks, while maintaining a requisite level of decentralization to support growth."

In order to attack ...","Oct 11, 2018,05:04pm EDT",The possibility of theft from blockchains via 51% attacks is very real,"Not that long ago cryptocurrency startup Horizen (formerly zencash) was the victim of a 51% attack that could have caused the loss of millions of dollars through fraud. While there were no losses, the creators of Horizen wanted to make sure it never happened again. So today they released a whitepaper they believe will mitigate the risk of devastating attacks such as the 51% attack on bitcoin gold where attackers were able to steal about $18 million in cryptocurrency by reversing transactions sent to various exchanges where they had already traded in bitcoin gold for other tokens, effectively double-spending them.[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]Since the very beginning, 51% attacks and the threat of double spending have been an existential issue for proof-of-work blockchains (which constitute the majority of blockchains, including bitcoin). The 51% attack, skewered in HBO's Silicon Valley and noted as early as 2014 by mainstream media outlets like the Guardian, refers to the problem of having concentrated computing power dedicated to mining a blockchain turn malicious in an attempt to defraud the blockchain.Proof-of-work blockchains work on the principle of the ""longest chain"". In theory, most computing power dedicated to a blockchain will be honest, so a blockchain will often regard its ""truest"" chain as the one with the most blocks that follow one another, as the majority of computing power will be dedicated to authenticating as many legitimate blocks as possible.The volume of blocks in a chain serves as a proxy for the underlying honesty of the chain, with the longest chain assumed to be the one that holds as few malicious actors as possible because it has the most computing power dedicated to it.That's all good and well -- usually. But what happens when somebody holds a large amount of the computing power dedicated to a blockchain and has malicious intent? What happens when they can flood the longest chain with new blocks because they hold more computing power than the rest of the miners/validators of a blockchain?In theory, attackers can make transactions on a developing public chain (like say, for example, sending a merchant cryptocurrency in exchange any number of goods: your famous cryptocurrency Lambo, Michelin-star meals, or maybe a year's supply of Lao Gan Ma) while mining a private set of blocks that contain none of those transactions.If the attacker then adds corrupted blocks at a faster pace on the private chain than the public one, then successfully surpass the public chain in reconciling the two chains, all of the transactions they made on the new longer private chain are broadcast to legitimate miners and then taken on as the new ""legitimate"" chain -- after all, the longer the chain, the more likely it is valid.The new chain with the corrupted blocks contains none of the transactions where the attacker sent cryptocurrency to other people. This means that the malicious actor is able to effectively reverse transactions that just happened, effectively granting them the ability to ""double-spend"" cryptocurrencies.While popularly known as a ""51% attack"", in theory, you could mount this sort of attack without controlling more than 50% of all of the computing power dedicated to a blockchain -- it'd just be much harder. The more control of computing power you have, the more likely it is that you'd be able to defraud the blockchain in question and hold cryptocurrencies you've already ""sent"" to others.A 51% attack hasn't happened to bitcoin yet, even though increasing amounts of concentration of mining pools pose a concern. In order to attack a blockchain as robust as bitcoin, you'd need a nation-state level of resourcing. However, it has happened to other less well-resourced blockchains such as bitcoin gold.The boom in cryptocurrencies has brought forward a number of opportunities and problems. One of the most interesting problems is the space 51% attacks (once a theoretical concept) have been granted with the rise of economic value in altcoins.With blockchains that don't have much computing power dedicated to them, yet increasing economic value brought on by demand from community supporters and investment hunters, the ability to protect against 51% attacks has steadily declined while the incentive to commits them only keeps rising.The rise of ASIC mining chips has also made it easier to concentrate computing power in the hands of a nefarious actor, as ASICs significantly outperform standard mining hardware from CPUs to GPUs -- it is now impractical for many individuals with a laptop to have any part in the balance of mining power while one single malicious actor with many ASIC mining chips can make quite a difference.All of these factors have spurred applications like this 51% attack calculator which highlights cryptocurrencies where it would cost as low as $16/hr to mount a credible attack and a renewed vigilance around the 51% attack issue, which has gone from theory to practice at a very rapid pace.In May and June 2018 alone, there were seven successful double spend attacks executed on proof-of-work blockchains. Horizen went through this problem shortly after listing on popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance: an attempt was made to double-spend tokens that had shot up in value, which was only mitigated after the engineering, ops and marketing teams behind the platform worked together to shut down the 51% attack attempt, after having had several safeguard indicators they had placed trigger that an attack was taking place.Based on that experience, Horizen has released the white paper that proposes a way to reduce the risk of 51% attack. This is a tweak to the consensus algorithm that governs which blocks in a blockchain are accepted or not to one where blocks that have been mined privately (a predictor for a 51% attack) are penalized with a block acceptance delay in relation to the amount of time the block has been hidden from the public network.This helps to mitigate an important mechanism of 51% attacks: the nefarious private chain that is created concurrently with the developing public chain it is trying to hijack. By enforcing a penalty on blocks hidden from the public, the risk of 51% attacks is theoretically reduced because the cost of mounting them is higher -- and if an attacker chooses to make their blocks public, an attack can be anticipated, and counteractive measures can be taken such as temporarily increasing block confirmation times.The solution isn't perfect: 51% attacks can still be mounted though they would be more costly. It hasn't been rigorously tested across any blockchains other than the one managed by Horizen.Still, the open-sourced innovation is something that is being tested by Horizen right now in production-level settings. It offers a promising route to reduce a risk that has always plagued blockchains since Satoshi's whitepaper. With a partnership with ZCash on blockchain vulnerabilities already in place, it's clear that Horizen's innovation -- and call to action-- is something they genuinely want the whole ecosystem to embrace."

Photographer: Luis Tato/Bloomberg","One needs to look back at why, and when, Bitcoin and blockchain came into being. It was 2008, post the latest global financial crisis, and there was a feeling that a better system would be needed. One where banks are not fully in control. Satoshi Nakamoto wrote an eight page white paper that introduced the world to blockchain and digital cash, but he also spawned a massive libertarian movement.If Bitcoin and blockchain were catalysed by a financial crisis, and seen as a solution, it should follow that where there is ongoing financial crisis, the digital cash system, with its underlying technology, could be extremely beneficial. It is to this end that many believe that the true worth of this revolutionary technology will be felt in places across the African continent, not necessarily in the modern first world.There are plenty of problems that need solving in Africa. These problems potentially can also be solved with a few key principles that are inherent to blockchain, such as transparency, and decentralization. From elections, to international remittance, as well as energy services and alternatives to banking; Africa has many broken systems that could be fixed by a new technology.It is not even about using blockchain to do a patch-job on the continent, there is a real chance for many African countries to fully embrace blockchain technology even more so than their first world counterparts to become world leaders in this new space. Africa has, through colonisation, been dictated to in terms of its infrastructure, and this has mostly been a failure. But there now exists an opportunity for the continent to build its own technological infrastructure that could leapfrog it forward.However, this ideal is more philosophical than tangible at present. There are a number of limitation to blockchain implementation that the entire globe is feeling, but Africa also brings in its own application issues. So, while the potential abounds, there needs to be a real effort to implement it successfully to make it work.An African historyAfrica was until the 1950s and 60s a predominantly colonised space. In her decolonisation, countries were left to rebuild off a foundation that was mostly used to exploit the land and the people. From city plans to banking infrastructure, Africa was modeled after European structures rather than ones that suited the people and the landscape.As such, banking for example, has been problematic for a big portion of the African population as these financial structures are limited to cities whereas the majority of the population is rural. However, to survive in the globalised world, these banks are needed, especially for people who work outside of their borders and have to send money to family.More so, a lot of the corruption and mismanagement in leadership and government in Africa comes down to a system that is easily corruptible and monopolised. African dictators are common occurrence as there is much room for centralised control and dictatorship, as well as ways and means of distorting democracy.As such, the African continent has been put on the back foot, trying to sustain a system built to exploit its people, and without her own particular needs in mind.Enter blockchainOn a philosophical level, blockchain technology has at its core principles of decentralisation, as well as transparency, and anonymity. It is the two former mentioned principles that really have a lot of application in Africa.Firstly, looking away from the financial side of things, blockchain technology is aimed at taking away intermediaries - and in Africa - there are a number of spaces where intermediaries are corrupt, and inefficient. So, with blockchain, the processes that they can replace can also be made more efficient, and less prone to corruption.It is things like elections that often come up in this instance. Still done with paper, pen and an election box, the system is not only inefficient, it is also highly susceptible to corruption.But there are a number of other instances where blockchain technology can improve matters - such as energy and the power infrastructure across the continent.Andy Li, CEO and Founder of Eloncity, a company that is looking to both greener electricity in Africa, but also decentralised electricity which is controlled by communities, explains how this solution works better than the current set up on the continent“I am perhaps a bit biased, but I would say energy would be a good start for trying out blockchain in Africa. The infrastructure is missing and there is not much modernised productivity. Many cities in certain countries in Africa have limited energy, preventing them to innovate and grow. Therefore, energy as a shared economy seems to be a good start.”Li touches on this idea of community - a strong African value which is also prevalent in the blockchain model. Blockchain infrastructure, with its decentralised nature, relies heavily on the community to effect its advancement and how it progresses, and in this case, energy and electricity which is community run rather than by inefficient centralised governmental agencies would be beneficial to the population.Another view point on Africa’s best use case for blockchain comes from Lorien Gamaroff, CEO of Bankymoon, a blockchain and cryptocurrency consultancy firm in South Africa, as well as Centbee, a cryptocurrency payments and remittance company. Unsurprisingly, he believes the financial benefits of cross-border payments and remittance in cryptocurrency are prime for Africa.“The best use for blockchain in Africa is as a currency for international remittance,” Gamaroff argues. “There is a lot of friction when it comes to cross-border remittances and cryptocurrencies allow for cheap and efficient transfer mechanisms. There is still the issue of regulatory uncertainty and access and so it will depend on companies developing products and ensuring regulators that local KYC and AML obligations are fulfilled.”Again, Gamaroff also alludes to the issues that are being faced in implementing these blockchain solutions, and a big one will always be regulators regardless of where in the world you are.The problem of implementationBoth Li and Gamaroff are trying to implement blockchain solutions where they believe they are desperately needed in Africa, but they both attest to a number of difficulties in doing so; some of an African context, and some of a more general blockchain context.Li touches on third-world issues that Africa has when it comes to blockchain application, from something as simple as internet access, which is now mostly taken for granted in the first world.“I believe the most challenging development issue would be the lack of the Internet infrastructure,” Li said. “Most of the connection goes through satellites and the throughput is very limited. This means nodes might have trouble stay synced with the blockchain, and that it would be probably more expensive to mine or run a node independently, rather than in developed countries.”“Another challenge would be the development itself. Programming a blockchain requires knowledge in cryptography and databases, and there is a huge demand for blockchain developers worldwide. Why should they go to Africa? The ecosystem must be worth their while, and that creates an issue for the future.”For Gamaroff, he sees more traditional blockchain implementation issues within an African context.“Blockchain technology exists largely in a regulatory grey zone. Companies and businesses are reluctant to invest time and resources into research and development because they feel that regulators might retroactively punish them. What is needed is assurance and frameworks provided by regulators before sufficient effort can be invested.""“Additionally, most blockchains are not suited for the use cases for which they are being applied. This is largely due to the issue of scale. Scaling blockchain technology to many users has been difficult. This must be addressed before blockchains can gain wide-scale usefulness.”Where does Africa stand today?It is clear the potential is there, but with that comes a host of issues in implementation, so where does Africa stand in terms of its blockchain ecosystem currently? It is clearly - not yet - taking off and leading the continent to a technological revolution, but it is neither being left behind and abandoned.“There are a number of companies across Africa that are researching blockchain technology. There are still no implementations that are in full scale production apart from cryptocurrency related initiatives,” Gamaroff explains, going on to point out a potential pitfall in the future. “Many companies that are offering services that leverage blockchain technology are operating outside of existing securities, currency and commodities laws. It is only a matter of time before regulators apply pressure and those business models prove to be unsustainable. If any blockchains are to survive it will be first and foremost due to the application and adoption of a cryptocurrency. Once the currency reaches broad adoption other applications be possible.”To this end, Li believes that it is important to engage and operate with governments and regulators to be a blockchain solution that can survive the African environment.“While I've heard IBM is conducting research about blockchain in Africa and that Binance has launched a cryptocurrency exchange in Uganda, we are trying to get pilot programs going with the help of governments,” Li said.“We are currently in talks with governments and energy companies in African countries to begin pilots in local communities. We intend, just like in Mexico and California, to build an infrastructure for them to generate their own energy using solar panels or windmills, and sell or to share it across our microgrid, using the blockchain to utilize transactions and have supply meet demand.”Clearly, the road is a long one for the continent of Africa if it is too embrace blockchain technology. It is all too easy to point to problems and match them with blockchain solutions for the technology is so far reaching, but it is another situation to try and get these solutions to be viable and adopted to any useful scale."

Well, that and her midriff baring crop top that’s basically a raised finger to to Bay Area meteorologists.She wasn't wrong when it comes to Bitcoin — since it peaked at $20,000 in December 2018, it now stays pretty consistently in the low $6,400 range. Fortunes were lost, bubbles were burst, but people party on — just because Bitcoin wasn't the pot of gold doesn't mean you can't get there with currencies such as Monero, Stellar or Tron. Or that the blockchain isn't valuable.Zedd at OMF.That’s the theory behind Our Music Festival (OMF) and their similarly named OMF Token. On October 20th, 2018,,The Greek Theater in Berkeley held what might be the world first cryptocurrency music festival. OMF was created by Prime Social group, DJ and producer 3LAU and blockchain entertainment network SingularDTV. Around 8,000 people turned up to party, blockchain style. Naturally, you could buy your ticket with cryptocurrency, but real money was also accepted.In essence, what this meant on the night is that you had the usual EDC crowd bobbing up and down while the headliners — Zedd, Mati and Kim, 3LAU and more — got up to their usual tricks, with occasional shout out to the crowd for ‘my crypto cool’ friends.Crypto bracelet rewardsThe venue was stunning, with an array of smoke, lasers and lights making the stage glow like a LSD rainbow. The performers were energetic and entertaining, and when they started remixing the theme tune to Pokemon, it was clear they’d read the crowd right. 80% of people instantly jumped to their feet, mouthing the words.During 3LAU’s set, the DJ made a plea for more ‘people to get on the blockchain,’ — he said some other stuff, but people around me used that time to blow their whistles and so I missed the rest.Cryptocurrency confetti.The best part of my night — and most relevant, considering the theme — was during the confetti cannon bursts that fluttered down at the end of 3LAU’s set. Instead of paper, tiny pieces of white paper printed with QR codes floated down from the sky like so many discarded candy wrapper on Halloween. Later I discovered that was thirty pounds of paper confetti. These could be scanned on the OMF app, and traded to gain rewards at the merchandise tents — basically, knotted friendship bracelets in different colors.Crypto confettiThe high level idea here is that OMF is more than a music festival. In fact that’s the tip of the iceberg when it comes to their ambitions. Their idea is that festivals cane be improved, and they’re targeting ticketing, engagement, and data. OMF tokens were available to purchase at the event (it's not clear if you can purchase them at the moment.)Now I’ll give OMF props for trying to push their crypto-message — the high level concept was that by simply by attending, fans can earn OMF tokens, which can be used for upgrades, food and more. Big picture, this type of tech could prevent ticket fraud and inflation and make events far more equitable. At this event.. not so much. Yes, QR codes could be tokenized and exchanged for bracelets and some people were randomly upgraded, but overall, the kinks still need to be worked out. As a fledgling brand, that’s to be expected, and they talk a good talk about wanting to effect some real change.Matt and Kim at OMF.“Those goals may sit on a distant horizon, but we need to start somewhere,” said Justin Blau, a.k.a DJ 3LAU. “In year one, we’re enabling crypto payments for tickets and are giving all attendees their first ethereum paper wallet in the form of token cards.” As a PR push, they were successful, totaling 2009 OMF payments and getting 61,290 OMF tokens into concertgoers wallets by the end of the night.Hidden among the neon dancers was a scattering of crypto-royalty, including Fred Ehrsam, founder of Coinbase, Daniel Gross from YCombinator and Adam Ludwin, founder of Chain. I’m betting they had a good time, and amongst a crowds like that, they faded into anonymity (insert crypto related pun here).Crypto detailsBut that’s a good thing — this was a music event at its best, with the cryptocurrency aspect secondary to the sound. Which is as it should be. There’s nothing worse than going to an event then realizing you’re spending the whole time being sold to.Here, they just let people get on with it — and their ‘Decentralize’ selfie board was pretty genius. For some attendees, the set list was a little scattered — all the acts, while well established, aren't exactly the cutting edge of current, and I heard complaints that they were ‘too random’ and that it was like ‘listening to an iPhone DJ.’ Even so, the grounds were packed, so clearly people were not that concerned.The cryptocurrency world is young, figuratively and literally. Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum is 24-years-old, and there's a host of crypto-royalty who has more experience in classrooms than boardrooms. That's the real power of the blockchain, not just a leveling of transparency, but of equity and access for all.Blockchain security expert Reuben Jackson, sums this up very well in in Bitcoin  Magazine. ""Millennials are waking up to the inequity present in the world and are hyper-aware of the status quo’s faults as well,"" he wrote. ""Many in this age group see open-source blockchain technology as an accountability tool, one that will create a better system for voting, sharing data and advertising for instance. Blockchains provide not just productive ways for them to air their grievances but also social and financial tools allowing millennials to demonstrate what the problem areas are and, at the same time, exactly how to fix them. ""As an events group, I’d say that OMF has a lot of potential, and they've certainly figured out who their market is. In a world where the best referral is from someone you know, incentivizing people to share events is a smart way to reach a wider audience.Zedd at OMF.The Good: If this is what cryptocurrency festivals are about, I’m all for it. Basically, a night of fun without any of the hassle, and people with a relaxed mindset out for a good time. New Kids on the Blockchain!The Bad: Much of the crypto stuff happened thought the app, which was poorly designed. You couldn't get lineup times if you didn't get into the app, and it crashed pretty regularly too.Zedd at OMF."

Is ...","Nov 12, 2018,01:47pm EST","A matrix showing the domain of true high-trust, low-friction structures.","Many would argue that the enthusiasm for blockchain and cryptocurrency is waning. Indeed, according to Gartner’s hype cycle, blockchain is tumbling into the trough of disillusionment where the fleet of Lamborghini’s belonging to early crypto speculators have all but run out of fuel as cryptocurrency prices stabilize and regulators tighten their scrutiny of security-issues masking as initial coin offerings (ICOs) or newfangled ways of getting rich quick. If peak crypto is behind us and the blockchain bubble has burst, where does the promise of this world-changing technology go from here? Time to pack it up or time to reformulate how we think about this technology and the implied digital transformation it necessitates? Will blockchain go the way of early electric car prototypes only to lay dormant for 40 years before a Tesla comes along? Will cloud-based spreadsheets masquerading as blockchains temper enthusiasm for the value of technology investments? Many questions remain, but one thing is certain, fully harnessing blockchain has less to do with technology and more to do with advances in management thought and the art of the possible.The argument that the blockchain bubble has burst made vociferously by the likes of Nouriel Roubini in a Senate hearing, misses a couple of key points. The first and foremost being that the technology has only come out of beta in 2017, despite bitcoin and its underlying public blockchain turning 10 this year. Since, in addition to the pilot projects being carried out by the 50 largest companies in the world (with some industries opting for “coopetition”), there is a growing cadre of blockchain-based projects gaining serious global recognition for their potential to change the fundamental nature for how economies and essential services are organized. Unlike the internet, which is a disruptive technology borrowing from Clayton Christensen’s thinking on disruptive innovation, blockchain is very much an augmenting technology. For this power to be unlocked, however, companies, entrepreneurs, technologists and policymakers need to do the unthinkable – relinquish control. This much is demanded by the market and the constituent parts of the global economy that have been telling us one thing in increasingly louder voices, they do not trust status quo or the traditional centralized structures that gain the most from it.Implied in decentralized and distributed systems, where each node or participant operates pari passu or on equal footing, is that no one counterparty has control or more authority than another. This is a difficult and perhaps impossible level of abstraction in our current economic order, where an embarrassment of riches and power has been amassed by centralized structures, technologies and control. Indeed, the reason the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, is favorable toward bitcoin is precisely because of its decentralization. Is there a realm in which firms deploying blockchain can create a new category of service or solution where control, trust and value become evenly distributed? Why not! In order to get there, however, the change is not singularly about digital transformation for which blockchain cannot operate in a vacuum of other frontier technologies, it has more to do with the evolution of management thinking and organizational design. The matrix below provides a useful guide for how this transformational journey begins and where it should end in a proverbial blockchain “magic quadrant,” provided project sponsors wish to fully leverage a high-trust, low-friction platform.A matrix showing the domain of true high-trust, low-friction structures.Against this methodology, it is difficult to identify another true blockchain project other than bitcoin, that category defying digital asset, that meets these criteria in balance. Even the crypto wunderkind Vitalik Buterin’s cryptocurrency, ether, began life as a semi-centralized instrument. What does this say about the current state of play and the projects, ICOs and other supposedly world-changing applications of this technology, from digital identity, payments, supply chain provenance, even e-voting, are they blockchains at all? Or is the rate of innovation and tinkering taking place with this new technology just now getting serious, hence the accelerated appearance and demise of projects? Blockchain, like the early days of the internet, is in its thousand flowers blooming phase. The market picks winners, technologists are merely the gardeners. Some may be disappointed to learn that the path to becoming a blockchain billionaire may be harder than the one charted by the internet tech titans before them, in no small measure because of the span of control issues posed by true blockchain projects.Much like the advent of cloud computing or the flight of imagination needed for an untethered internet, the shift to digital transformation using blockchain is more about management culture and leadership than it is about technology or informational architecture. In many ways, the technology is the easy part. The hard part is the suspension of disbelief and long-held norms about organizational approaches to trust, transparency, intermediation, control and value capture, which all conspire to form the high-friction market we currently operate in. The outcomes in this low-trust, high-friction analog world leave a lot to be expected. Billions of people are left on the sidelines without a universally portable and secure personal identity.  Millions of votes are uncast, uncounted or disputed because there is no scalable high-fidelity way of addressing micro-counting and election security. Trillions in stranded assets and complex global threats are on the margins of being economically viable because current distribution, pricing and service structures make market entry unpalatable and uncompetitive. Blockchain as a technology can abundantly address these gaps. The scarcest resource appears to be the lack of imagination and will from entrenched power structures that gain the most from status quo.Progress with blockchain, even for large incumbent companies or power structures, need not be a zero-sum proposition. Indeed, blockchain is an augmenting technology precisely because it does not have to disrupt the type of value derived from existing systems, rather it can help create entirely new service, product and relationship models with and between markets or constituents. As an example, imagine the evolution of insurance distribution from the agent and broker-based distribution model that was borne from the analog days, to the advent of models like Geico direct courtesy of the internet, to something more akin to a customer mutual where dividends, losses and trust are managed in lockstep for a market or risk-sharing pool. Similarly, in California’s move to solar-enable its housing stock by 2020, the advent of blockchain-based microgrids can ensure that older homes can buy excess energy in economical ways producing a more resilient energy matrix. Absent blockchain and management acceptance of distributed systems, which can record trust with the fidelity and permanence as an atomic clock records time, this new class of market offering would not be possible, and the assets stranded on the sidelines of the market by stubborn friction and sclerotic structures would not be activated. The question is not whether to blockchain or not to blockchain, the real question is how."

And, the Mediterranean island has already attracted the two largest crypto exchanges, Binance and OKEx, and most recently ZBX, now opening offices in the rising crypto hub.In July this year that the Maltese Parliament passed law setting the framework blockchain (distributed ledger technology (DLT), cryptocurrency and digital assets.And, the following month, Silvio Schembri, Malta’s Junior Minister for Financial Services, Digital Economy and Innovation (responsible for implementing Malta’s Blockchain Strategy, was quoted on Forbes explaining how Malta has become the world’s blockchain island.Clearly, the politicians here have big aspirations. This is after all one of the world’s smallest countries (122 per square miles/316 km2) as well as most densely populated (c.475,000).
Of course various countries would always want to claim that have first mover advantage, be the first to do X or Y in a certain industry space and vie for pre-eminence over other jurisdictions. It's a bit a akin to claims about which trading house has the fastest roundtrip trading execution capability.For the record, back in December 2017 Gibraltar announced they would be launching the world’s first bespoke license for “fintech” firms using blockchain distributed ledger technology under the auspices of The Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC). At the time Reuters reported that move would happen during 2018 and was: “The first of its kind and would formally recognize the use of blockchain records as an accepted mechanism for transmitting payments, paving the way for broader adoption...”The massive scale of the Malta Blockchain Summit, which takes place this coming week (November 1-2), reflects this new-found momentum. The summit, which has been in the planning since last December and will see banks and some big names in venture capital (VC) space attending, is set to take place at the InterContinental Hotel at St Julian’s on the island. The event consists of four conferences over the two days, namely:These proceedings are set around an already sold-out exhibition floor. Added to that there is a two-day Hackathon with around 300 blockchain developers taking part, with a €50,000 (c.$57,000) prize up for grabs to the winners.Rounding things off, there is an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) pitch battle between what are described as thirty of the “hottest” start-ups in the crypto sphere. Each entity, who will be competing for $100,000, will have 10 minutes to make a pitch to a panel of judges.It all comes on the heels of another blockbuster blockchain event on the island, the Delta Summit, which was convened at the start of October, which was attended by a little over 4,000 attendees from far and wide. But the Malta Blockchain Summit is on course to top that number according to the organizers.Melanie Mohr, CEO and founder of WOM protocol, which is building a blockchain-based protocol that allows brands, content creators, publishers and social networks to monetize “word of mouth” (i.e. WOM) recommendations on any app or platform, chose Malta as a jurisdiction because the organization believes it is at the “forefront from a regulatory standpoint” in the blockchain and DLT space.“A significant number of very knowledgeable people from the global blockchain community have worked diligently together with the government [here] to develop a legal framework, which regulates wisely and supports the further development of blockchain and DLT,” said the Berlin-based entrepreneur who is working at the forefront of the global digital revolution.WOM indicated that they had also found a “great level of support” on the island.Having founded video m-commerce platform YEAY in 2016 with the aim of providing GenZ with a bespoke space to share and shop, Mohr added: “The recent Delta Summit [October 3-5] showed how well Malta has positioned itself already. It delivered great content from top-notch speakers and attracted the global community to join. It was packed and for me THE blockchain event of the year to date.”As such the German entrepreneur is “more than convinced” that the upcoming Malta Blockchain Summit will show that the island is “really in the spotlight of the global blockchain development” with thousands of attendees from around the world. “And, it can proudly call itself Blockchain Island,” she asserted.Melanie Mohr, CEO and founder of WOM, at the Delta Summit, a blockchain and crypto event that took...

(Source: WOM Protocol).Crypto Exchanges & Malta ExchangeIn the case of Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed last month (September 11) with MSX Plc, the fintech and digital asset subsidiary of the Malta Stock Exchange.This initiative was to launch a new digital exchange for security token trading, with the new trading platform poised to leverage Malta Stock Exchange’s 26-year track record of operating as a regulated stock exchange.The MoU follows a decision by Binance to extend its business to Malta, in recognition of the country’s crypto regulatory climate. Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, CEO of Binance, commenting at the time said: “Malta has become a global hub for blockchain technology through active and transparent crypto regulations.” (Note: Zhao’s net worth was put at north of $1.1 billion by Forbes in February 2018).And, when I visited the exchange in Valletta this July for a tour, one could see that space was being set aside for innovative fintech start-ups in incubator hubs in the building.Apart from admission and trading, the exchange that resides in the Garrison Chapel looking out over the harbour offers a comprehensive range of back-office services.This includes maintenance of share and bond registers, clearing and settlement and custody services via its Central Securities Depository (CSD), which is situated in-house. It also has a link with Clearstream Banking in Frankfurt (part of Deutsche Boerse), and in Luxembourg that facilitates international access.As explained by Simon Zammit, CEO of the Malta Stock Exchange during my visit, the exchange announced in May 2107 that it was to continue its use of Deutsche Boerse trading technology, extending an agreement from 1 January 2017, for another five years from that point - until 31 December 2021.They also extended the exchange’s trading hours from 9.00 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. Zammit pointed out of that time that Deutsche Boerse’s technology was “extremely reliable” and highly performant. The partnership has been in place since 2012.The Malta Stock Exchange located in the building of Garrison Chapel, which is situated in Castille...

And, right now it clearly looks to be here [Malta]. We will see whether that lasts. I think it has a good chance of lasting here. But my motto is: Jurisdictional Diversification.”Proactive ApproachIt is the Maltese government’s forward-thinking approach to blockchain regulation, their low corporate-tax, being part of the European Union (EU)-zone and the warm climate that allures the vast number of various blockchain related companies to escape to Malta and the migration trend is incremental.Indeed, when I was last in Malta this June for the CoinAgenda 2018 event during which Joseph Muscat, the Prime Minister of Malta, gave a Keynote address, you could be forgiven for thinking one was in paradise.Siim Õunap, the COO for Celerexx, a new exchange launching in 2019, commenting on the jurisdictional landscape said: “The Maltese government has been seeking to get crypto-related companies to boost their economy for quite some time and they been successful in their approach.”The Estonian added: “While their governmental services and legal procedures are behind e-countries such as Estonia or Lithuania, special regulations allow Celerexx to offer lower prices and better services to our customers, which makes [for us] the move to Malta worthwhile.”It is not just the exchanges that choose a more contributing environment in Malta for their operations. Coinvest, the crypto investment trading firm, announced a new collaboration with the Maltese government to establish a blockchain council. In addition, the new regulatory framework also supports ICO companies in their financial products, attracting many new and innovative projects to set up their base camp on Blockchain Island.Malta Blockchain Summit & New BillsDuring the Malta Blockchain Summit, three new decentralized ledger technology bills will come into force: (1) The Malta Digital Innovation Authority Act; (2) The Innovative Technological Arrangement and Service Act; and, (3) The Virtual Financial Asset Act.Together these will provide what are being described as a “clear and navigable” framework for innovative technology businesses in a way that rules and governance are not the roadblocks to innovation. Blockchain and crypto pundits out there contends that the current indecisiveness and half-hearted regulation of most of the national regulatory bodies are just as inhibiting and near-sighted - as is the outright prohibition of innovative solutions.The Malta Digital Innovation Authority Act establishes the governance body to regulate the Distributed Ledger Technology, or DLT, industry with its principal goals to ensure businesses accepted as Technology Service Providers and the services they provide are in accordance with the principle of being honest and transparent to protect the consumers and financial markets.The Innovative Technological Arrangement and Service Act is created as the futureproof regime for the registration and certification of Technology Service Providers and Technology Arrangements as it envisages the possibility of unforeseen technology developments.The Virtual Assets Act is a framework within there is Financial Instruments Test that provides clear indication whether cryptocurrency or token issued in an ICO would qualify as a financial instrument that needs to be regulated as a security or virtual token that falls outside of the scope of regulation.If the asset cannot be classified as either, it will be considered as a Virtual Financial Asset and regulated by the new law once it has enforced. ICOs and crypto exchanges can now breathe easy knowing that they are in compliance with the authorities and do not have to worry about being shut down.Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, who will inaugurate the regulatory conference, in giving a keynote speech on July 16 at the CoinAgenda Europe (2018) event at the Westin Hotel, St Julian, described the enactment of the three new laws as a “sweeping round” of legislation (i.e. covering the blockchain, crypto and digital asset space), saying: “This is not the end but just the start and the Maltese Government had to be innovative.”One of the most keenly anticipated speakers at the conference is Dr W. Scott Stornetta who co-authored a paper that described for the first time a digital hierarchy system that utilized digital time-stamps for ordering transactions, the solution that entity called Satoshi Nakamoto later used in his Bitcoin protocol. This has earned Dr Stornetta the recognition as the founding father of blockchain technology.The Winklevoss twins are attending as VIP investors and John McAfee, the famous British-American programmer and businessman, who I bumped into on a Blockchain cruise from Barcelona to Monte Carlo  this September organized by Coinsbank, is now confirmed as a speaker for the developer’s conference of the summit.In 1987, he founded McAfee Antivirus, and under his leadership the company executed a meteoric rise to the top of the computer security industry. If his keynote to delegates on the Royal Caribbean cruise ship is anything to go by delegates at the Malta Blockchain Summit are unlikely to feel short changed.And not to be outdone by her human counterparts, Sophia, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) humanoid robot has been confirmed as a speaker at the upcoming Summit. The Saudi Arabian citizen will join her creator in a fireside chat during proceedings. It all brings back memories of IPsoft’s Amelia, a digital personal assistant, who I saw in action earlier this summer in New York’s financial district at Cipriani.The Hanson Robotics’ creation has become something of a media darling, appearing on popular late-night talk shows, gracing magazine covers, and taking up sought-after seats on plum panels and high-level conferences. Her status as a cultural icon has allowed her to ignite advanced conversations on how robotics and artificial intelligence will permeate people’s lives.The event has already attracted hordes of investors to witness an ICO battle that provides a highly valuable opportunity for thirty blockchain-based companies to get support for the next step in their roadmap.One of those ICOs to pitch at the Malta Blockchain Summit is Zelectrix, a team of talented specialists that will change the way electric vehicles (EVs) and their own EV rental fleet are powered with improved chargers utilizing renewable energy and underpinned by the state-of-the-art Thought AI blockchain.Raido Lensment, CEO of Zelectrix, commenting said: “As part of the service to our customers using our chargers and renewable energy grid, we are looking at creating financial products as part of Zelectrix payment scheme.”He added: “Our research is showing that Malta may be the right choice for our company and the opportunity to pitch our project at the Malta Blockchain Summit is greatly anticipated by our team. We just hope the Winklevoss brothers will be listening.”The Malta Blockchain Summit, is already on its way to becoming an annual landmark event in the global blockchain calendar. And, when I spoke to one of the organizers, Dennis Avorin, a Swedish national, at the start of October it was pretty certain that the event will see a repeat in 2019.The organizers are also inviting “C-level” executives and investors from within the sphere to exclusive invite-only dinners throughout the year under the Maltese-themed title ‘Knights of Blockchain’.Eman Pulis, Founder of the Malta Blockchain Summit, said: “I wish to welcome every blockchain enthusiast to the Malta Blockchain Summit, a melting pot for global influencers in technology, civil society, democracy promotion and innovation.”Pulis amongst others said that we can “expect riveting discussion” about the world-changing potential applications of blockchain across multiple verticals. “But also, some good, old fashion networking under the sun of the Blockchain Island,” he added. And, given the scale of the event, if they had motto it would be that “Business is not made between companies - it is made between people.” Time will tell."

At the end of 2017, the Gartner Hype Cycle For Emerging Technology placed Bitcoin at the “Peak of Inflated Hype Cycle” as cryptocurrency prices soared and “blockchain” became the tech buzzword of the year. Despite the seemingly unrealistic hype, there has been an unparalleled demand for blockchain developers as legacy enterprisesa nd crypto-focused startups look to build upon on the early-stage technology. IBM and Mastercard have already filed more than 80 patents each for blockchain-related technology, and companies are struggling to find sufficient talent to develop their initiatives. The demand for blockchain developers was initially hindered by a lack of understanding about the technology and minimal available resources for professionals -- particularly developers -- to learn more about it. However, that has changed over the last couple of years with online programs, university courses, and workshops popping up at an impressive rate. Simply put, the demand for blockchain developers is enormous. ComputerWorld highlighted the extent of this demand in May earlier this year citing a Q1 2018 Upwork report that detailed how blockchain developer freelancing grew at a year-over-year rate of 6,000 percent. Further, a study by SAP in March determined that 92 percent of business leaders surveyed viewed blockchain as an opportunity, with Supply Chain & IoT one of the leading practical applications. As demand for blockchain developers surges, the available talent lags behind. This has not only led to frustration on the part of companies looking to integrate blockchain-focused solutions but also increasingly high rates to acquire blockchain developers. According to Paysa, the average blockchain developer salary in the U.S. is $95,545 with top earners receiving an average salary of roughly $140,000. This places blockchain developers among some of the highest paid developers out of any professional field. While the opportunity for developers to make a significant salary is there, the gap between talent demand and supply is still substantial. Many companies with extensive resources and technical talent -- such as IBM -- are turning to in-house education of blockchain skills as well as outsourcing to a millennial generation that has shown a predilection for blockchain tech and cryptocurrencies. The amount and quality of resources on cryptocurrencies and blockchains -- both from a development and general knowledge perspective -- have come along way since only a couple of years ago. Online programs like Udacity’s Nanodegree for Blockchain Developers and Coursera’s suite of blockchain courses are excellent tools for self-motivated developers looking to transfer their skills to an up and coming field. Developer tools such as Truffle Suite and CryptoZombies have also progressed into invaluable resources for learning to code smart contracts, build dapps, and understand how blockchains function at the protocol level.  More formal educational material and services have also emerged among some of the top universities including Stanford’s Center for Blockchain Research, Blockchain at Berkeley, and Kingsland University Blockchain Programming curriculum. These educational initiatives provide developers, and even non-developers, the opportunity to take comprehensive courses on the complicated concepts of the underlying technology as well as how to become professional developers in the field. A Stevie-award winner, Kingsland University receives curriculum advice and material from industry experts such as Riccardo Spagni (Monero) and Steven Dakh (Ethereum). Kingsland has also recently partnered with the Tezos Foundation as part of an initiative to support the training of 1,000 Tezos-focused developers as well as integrate Tezos educational material into their curriculum offering.This is a considerable move for the industry as the Tezos Foundation will be creating a talent pool for driving innovation and growth on their platform. Education is a vital aspect of onboarding new users and developers, and the Tezos Foundation is providing a career-building opportunity for students facing daunting student loan burdens or limited traditional job prospects. Bridging the educational gap for both developers and non-developers is vital to overcoming the current shortage of blockchain development in the market. While education is often enough to get professionals started, connecting them to adequate resources and opportunities is also a significant part of meeting the demand for blockchain developers. Programs such as Howard University’s Blockchain Lab -- in partnership with Consensys -- afford students the opportunity to connect with professionals and drive awareness of the growing field. Kingsland University also offers incubators, accelerators, a career center, and collaborative partnerships for companies to tap into their certified developer pools. There have been significant advances on the educational front of blockchain and cryptocurrency technology. The demand for blockchain developers is proliferating, and the opportunity for established developers in other fields to transition into a burgeoning field has never been greater. "

(Photo by Getty),"“Don’t cross the streams. It would be bad.” –Dr. Egon Spengler, Ghostbusters Crypto/legacy hybrid financial instruments—specifically, those that mix cryptocurrencies with legacy financial products—are the latest trend at the intersection of blockchain and Wall Street. Regulated versions of these hybrid products are quickly coming to market, including stablecoins and bitcoin-backed ETFs, futures, swaps and depositary receipts. There’s much excitement surrounding this trend—with good reason, in one case—but everyone should be warned that there are also unknown and potentially big risks to “crossing the streams” between the settlement systems of legacy and crypto.Mismatches are inevitable. Accidents will happen. No one should be surprised when they do.Even so, demand for these hybrids is likely to be significant.In Part 1 of this two-part series, I’ll lay out the differences between the legacy and crypto settlement systems and explain why the category of “crypto wrapped around legacy” hybrids involves fewer operational risks than the category of “legacy wrapped around crypto” hybrids. In Part 2, I’ll explain what these settlement system differences mean for owners of hybrid products.Definitions“Crypto wrapped around legacy” hybrids include stablecoins and tokenized gold bars. In this category of hybrids, the owner buys a cryptoasset designed to track the legacy asset’s price by holding the actual legacy asset in a ring-fenced account. In other words, legacy assets (such as dollars, securities, commodities or real estate) collateralize the cryptoasset. These hybrids are issued, traded and settled on a blockchain, but the underlying assets (e.g., cash, gold) that back this category of hybrid are issued, traded and settled in the legacy financial system.“Legacy wrapped around crypto” hybrids include bitcoin-settled ETFs, futures, swaps, depositary receipts and any other derivative backed by any cryptoasset. In this category of hybrids, the owner buys a traditional financial instrument designed to track the cryptoasset’s price by holding the actual cryptoasset in a ring-fenced account. In other words, cryptoassets collateralize the traditional financial instrument. These hybrids are issued, traded and settled in the legacy system, but the underlying cryptoassets (e.g., bitcoin, ether) that back this category of hybrid are issued, traded and settled on a blockchain.An Important DistinctionNeither security tokens nor cash-settled bitcoin derivatives (e.g., ETFs or futures) are crypto/legacy hybrids as defined here. Why? Because they settle entirely within their own settlement system (crypto and legacy, respectively) and don’t cross streams with the other system.I draw a critical distinction between security tokens and tokenized securities. A security token is native to a blockchain—it’s issued, traded and settled on a blockchain, and is not a hybrid. A tokenized security is a hybrid that fits into the “crypto wrapped around legacy” category—it’s a cryptoasset backed by a share of Apple stock, for example, for which the cryptoasset settles on a blockchain but the Apple share settles in the legacy settlement system.Cash-settled crypto derivatives settle entirely in cash within the legacy system, and never touch the underlying cryptoasset. Consequently, they do not introduce the risks of crossing streams between settlement systems. They certainly involve price risk, but they do not entail the exogenous settlement risks that their “physical” settled brethren do.How the Legacy and Crypto Settlement Systems DifferWhy do these distinctions matter? Because the crypto and legacy settlement systems differ at basic, fundamental levels. In my experience, few Wall Street professionals even understand the spaghetti labyrinth of the legacy settlement system—most finish their long careers without ever needing to interact extensively with it since the culture encourages deep specialization and it’s difficult to move out of narrow swim lanes. When problems arise there’s always someone else in the “back office” who will sort it out. It wasn’t until I was forced to dig deeply into the settlement system, while structuring pension transfers from corporations to insurance companies, that I had to learn it—because every transaction involved significant and unique settlement complexity both for the assets and liabilities. We had to choreograph and practice the procedures down to the minute, literally, because the costs of any little settlement failure would have been major. That experience made me realize that the cryptoasset settlement system (on a blockchain) is far superior to the legacy settlement system. Here’s why.Cryptoassets are digital bearer instruments that are designed to settle peer-to-peer, on a gross basis, in near-real-time and in “physical” form (i.e., in the actual cryptoasset). When cryptoassets trade, the buyer and seller simultaneously exchange value for value (“gross” settlement).By contrast, the legacy financial system uses a delayed-net-settlement system involving layers of intermediaries. The key words are delayed, net and intermediaries.Delays are purposeful in the legacy system—usually measured in days—and they enable financial intermediaries to settle with each other on a net basis. Netting is a practice that favors the intermediaries at the expense of customers, since netting minimizes the liquidity and capital intermediaries need to hold. Netting means buyer and seller do not simultaneously exchange value for value in every trade—rather, their intermediaries don’t settle and simply accumulate unsettled debits and credits for a defined time, and then settle by exchanging only the difference at the appointed time. Netting is why the securities industry commingles “street name” securities in omnibus accounts rather than segregates them for each individual customer. For example, brokers only exchange the net of all their customers’ buy and sell orders for Apple shares each day. They don’t send every Apple share back and forth to each other. Instead they settle up on a net basis—usually once a day after markets close.The combination of netting, delays and layers of intermediaries—the practice of allowing unsettled trades—mean (1) counterparty risk and (2) inaccurate ownership ledgers are simply facts of life in the legacy financial system. Counterparty risk is the risk your broker will default after taking your money but before delivering you the Apple shares, in the above example. Imprecise ownership records enable situations such as Dole Food to arise (where Wall Street’s accounting systems created 33% more valid claims to Dole Food shares than there were Dole Food shares) and proxy voting inaccuracies are inevitable (a prominent Delaware attorney declared that it’s not possible to verify the true winner of a proxy contest closer than 55-45%). The legacy settlement system, in my experience, is why the financial system is unstable and unfair to regular investors.In the crypto system, by contrast, counterparty risk doesn’t inherently exist—because it’s a peer-to-peer system that simultaneously delivers the asset and the payment to buyer and seller, respectively. It’s inherently a delivery-versus-payment system. As a settlement system, it’s inherently stable and fair to all users. These are huge differences—one system embraces unsettled trades and considers counterparty risk and imprecise ledgers to be normal, while the other doesn’t.There are other major differences too, and they’re summarized here:I'll preview Part 2 by sharing the punch line. Here’s how I would generically rank settlement risk by category. Again, this is not investment advice and every instrument will have unique risks! But since crypto systems objectively have lower settlement risk than legacy systems, we can make the following generalization about settlement risk by category:Lowest to Highest Settlement Risk:      Lowest Settlement Risk:  (1) Cryptoassets (assets natively issued, traded & settled on a blockchain)Next Lowest Risk:  (2) Crypto wrapped around legacy hybrids (e.g., stablecoins)Next Lowest Risk:  (3) Legacy assets (e.g., the status quo—assets are issued, traded & settled in legacy systems)Highest Risk:  (4) Legacy wrapped around crypto hybrids—most “accident prone” operationally because they “cross the streams.” Worst of both worlds.In Part 2 I’ll explore what these major differences in settlement systems mean for buyers of crypto/legacy hybrids.Note: this post is not investment advice and is for educational purposes only.

[+] Staver/Bloomberg,"If blockchain was and continues to drive a Beatles-like mania trend at such prestigious events as the Cannes Lions Festival then this emerging technology sector is now officially starring in its own version of Let It Be.  Trust Machine: The Story of Blockchain is a compelling new documentary about blockchain and cryptocurrency that is dramatic, poignant, and engaging no matter whether you are working deep in the tech space, a business executive trying to grasp such disruptive changes or the everyday person intrigued about digital privacy, activism and power. Indeed, this film is about everything you wanted to know about blockchain and cryptocurrency (and some things you didn’t) but were afraid to ask.Trust Machine is unique for many reasons but first, because it is truly a disruptive, blockchain, tech-infused project through and through from its very developmental foundation. The film is entertainment studio SingularDTV's (Kim Jackson, producer) first feature-length documentary. This company, one of the first in its class to help filmmakers fundraise, develop and distribute their content, is powered by blockchain technology and built on the Ethereum platform. The film is co-produced by Futurism Studios, led by President Geoff Clark, whose mission is to stories that showcase people, companies, and technologies that are culturally transformative. And Trust Machine boasts Zach LeBeau, Arie Levy-Cohen, Alex Klokus and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin as executive producers.The result is very solid work by Alex Winter's award-winning Trouper Productions. The film, narrated in a near pitch-perfect style by actress Rosario Dawson is, at its core, a smart look at how the particular tech sector of blockchain and cryptocurrency is changing the world and the trends to track around it.Filmmaker Alex WinterThe difficulty in taking a subject that is actually engineering and developer-based and deciphering it for the masses is no easy feat, but somehow Trust Machine takes what could be a cold, geeky mess and turns it an emotionally captivating documentary  by touching various levels of sentiment precisely by connecting the plight of humanity to such technology and vice versa. This is about a very precise yet wide look at the passion, work, controversy, nonsense, frenzy, brilliance, regulation and potential future around what is considered to be one of the greatest leaps of technology in our time.Whether examining this technology's impact on the refugee crisis and world hunger or catching JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon in mid-rant about the dangers of crypto or what can only be seen as true flubs around the discussion of the technology at times on CNBC, Trust Machine  somehow puts the viewer on the edge of one's seat because it's just so darn rare that we have a chance to watch ourselves as human drama unfold in nearly real-time history-in-the-making on a big screen.It doesn't hurt that engaging interview subjects are tapped for commentary from notable venture capitalists such as Tim Draper and Bil Tai to recording artist Imogen Heap to quantum physics guru Spiros Michalakis to even Forbes' own Laura Shin (go, Laura). But perhaps where the film hits one of its highest notes is the peppered-in chronicling of the British activist and computer scientist Lauri Love who was charged with stealing data from United States Government computers including the Missile Defense Agency. Love kicks off the film with a number of telling observations including the fact that he believes that this technology is ""going to scare the sh*t out of some very powerful people.""Activist, Lauri Love in a scene from ""Trust Machine""Mark Moss, a cryptocurrency analyst for Market Disruptors and one tracking the film concurs and adds, ""Since the dollar was removed from the gold standard in 1971 the United States and the rest of the world have moved to a debt based system and have created trillions and trillions of dollars of debt. This entire system works as long as people continue to have faith and trust in the system, but with cryptocurrency giving people a better option and blockchain, overall, driving greater decentralization, banks and any organization that holds power via a centralized action see this new era as a massive threat."" Moss believes that most people are completely blind to what money, the banking system is really about but that the advent of such developments as Bitcoin is creating mass interest around the subject that is unprecedented. ""Even if Bitcoin fails,"" he says,  ""people are now awake and aware, and the revolution will still continue to grow.""Dr. Spiros Michalakis in a scene from ""Trust Machine""Perhaps it is such sentiment and more that inspired Winter to zero in on this controversial area. In a previous statement, the filmmaker said, ""Bitcoin matters, but blockchain is really where the changes are going to come.  The implications are huge if you think about it. There are huge changes happening in our culture right now. Never has something like this happened before, ever. And it is fascinating to me. That’s why I really wanted to make this documentary.""He later told me via email, ""I've been involved in this world for a long time and was looking to tell a story that added to my prior two documentaries about the information age,  Downloaded and Deep Web.   Given the sudden popularity and curiosity about cryptocurrency and blockchain, it felt like the right time to capture this mad-moment on film. ""Winter says that there is a huge opportunity with blockchain, to help solve a lot of problems in many disparate areas, but that such achievement will require the new actors to learn from the mistakes of not only the legacy companies and institutions but their more immediate tech-predecessors on all levels.  ""My interest is always the people at the heart of such stories, and communicating the bigger themes and sociopolitical implications, and not in attempting to explain the 'math' of it all,"" explains Winter.DJ Gramatik, who uses blockchain to collaborate on a business level directly with fans via... [+] blockchain, in a scene from ""Trust Machine.""If this work is lacking anything it may be the fact that the only people of color (read: African-Americans, Latinos) on-screen seem to either be nearly non-existent, linked with disheveled, up-by-the-bootstraps crypto miners in Kenya or linked with a crypto scam (see: Floyd Mayweather). A missed opportunity for such a ""revolutionary"" movement. It would be refreshing to see the inclusion of various types of brilliant TED Talk minds or engineering personalities whose opinion and experience is deemed just as valid as those already busily carving out their positions within the new-establishment club. We can only hope that as our minds expand to embrace additional freedoms via blockchain that that same spirit is applied to a consistently wider inclusion of voice as well.On another level, the film also gives one pause after it reveals various new applications around blockchain.  Something about the segments around Eye Pay and tracking refugees via tokens is both beautiful and uplifting and yet terrifying (if in the wrong hands and applied to any number of scenarios or imposed) all at the same time.This encompassing, dynamic look in tech is currently as almost as ephemeral as an IG post, however. Initially, you can catch the film on October 26, 2018, in New York for a week-long run at the Cinema Village and on November 16th in Los Angeles at the Laemmle Monica. Don't forget the popcorn. "

[+] database, believes PoS founder Sunny King.","The creator of Proof-of-Stake, Sunny King, has been working on a blockchain database cloud that has been dubbed the “supernode proof-of-stake” or SPoS. The project is designed to work in conjunction with a Hong Kong-based project, Virtual Economy Era (VEE), and is determined to crack the European blockchain market.King said of the launch:VEE takes a good look at the barriers of building blockchain applications and tries to streamline the process and expand the ecosystem, so at some point we can say using blockchain technology is as easy as using a database.""As part of VEE’s plans to expand into Europe, they are set to install elements of their infrastructure in the region. VEE’s launch comes just at the time that Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin announces more information about Casper, Ethereum’s proof-of-stake concept. Buterin has been vocal about King’s influence on him as a developer and early work on Primecoin.Driving change in the blockchainIt’s a tall order, but the vision conveyed by the project’s architects is one of change. In light of the struggles faced by the blockchain industry in 2018, such as the market cap drastically falling by $200bn, there is constant speculation that the bottom is about to drop out of coin-based platforms.With spikes of coins occurring due to greater publicity in the general domain, VEE capitulates on the idea that affordable and commercially viable projects perform better. The developers’ vision for VEE is of it being the future of blockchain, and for it to open access to a new economic era globally.VEE’s co-creator, Sunny King, is a cryptocurrency pioneer. He is credited with the creation of PeerCoin, the first proof-of-stake cryptocurrency launched in 2012 and PrimeCoin, a cryptocurrency that achieves its security by searching for prime numbers. Both ranked as top ten currencies before 2014. Together with Satoshi, the godfather of Bitcoin, they opened the floodgates for alternative cryptocurrencies to enter the market.As King is known for finding innovative solutions in technology if his latest project follows in the path as those previously, VEE could be the start of a viable virtual economy. Perhaps it could be the breakthrough the blockchain market has been craving in recent times.How does it work?VEE aims to create a secure underlying infrastructure platform for blockchain database through innovations of consensus mechanism and blockchain platform functions so that companies using the VEE blockchain platform can focus on their own business instead of delving into coding issues. In this way, the VEE blockchain platform can support the operation of trillions of blocks effectively in the future and build a new world of blockchain.By creating modular pieces of software that can make blockchain ""as easy as using a database,"" King believes it should make the technology more accessible to more people.It’s called ""supernode proof-of-stake,"" or SPoS, which requires specialized hardware to operate.Now the Vee Explorer is launching with a system response that is not only fast but also much more predictable and stable (it generates a block every 4 seconds which contains 36 V coins).Why change the system?The costs of blockchain can be restrictive, not only does it use a lot of processing power but there are challenges across systems.VEE works on the model that the cost associated with the migration of data is much lower than when using other older systems, making it easier for eco-developers to proceed to distribution quickly.It boasts improved data stability and the entire database is supported on the blockchain. It can safely store a multitude of digital identifiers including addresses, keys, digital assets and shares among others.There is also innovation in King’s proof-of-stake system with the introduction of the Supernode proof-of-state. The new mechanism has 15 supernodes, but VEE is set to add a further 15 - 45 as the network grows. Some of which are now planned to be based in Europe. Each of these nodes is a high-performing computer which enables the system to have excellent operational efficiency. It is designed for high-performance blockchain and has been created to withstand the expected growth within the sector.The developers said,The design of the economic system encourages the continuous investment of the ecosystem in the upgrading of supernodes, which ensures that the operation efficiency of the system will be continuously improved.”Vee wants to transform the blockchainSpreading the technology to EuropeAfter launching the platform in September, now King has announced that they are looking to break into the European market and employ staff in the region.So far the main category of user benefitting from VEE’s innovation are gaming applications, but currency and identity management providers are also using the technology, amongst others.With King’s previous projects well-respected, VEE is certainly standing out from the crowd. With the developers aim to create an entire virtual economy, cracking the European market will be crucial to the innovation becoming mainstream in the mid to long-term.The company is planning to install some blockchain nodes in Europe to allow for enhanced responsiveness of the network in the region. This paired with the company’s potential hiring of developers in Europe could help them to establish themselves as a significant player in the market quickly."

I was wrong!”She first dismissed it as a gimmick, but after digging into the underlying technology, Thomason quickly realized its potential impact on the so-called “bottom billion,” the portion of the global population considered to be living in extreme poverty - many of whom survive on less than $1 per day. Having spent much of her career at the forefront of technology as a facilitator of economic and social development, it didn't take longer for her to see blockchain and crypto as the next logical iteration of the internet as a powerful development tool.“I realized that blockchain, if deployed and scaled, could solve some of the global problems of our time like climate change and poverty,” she explained, prompting her to devote the past three years to demystifying the technology and encouraging its broader use. Global AmbassadorWhile advising several digital identity projects like Shyft and IDBox that have strong relevance in the developing world, Thomason devotes most of her time to elevating blockchain's profile in front of national governments, international development agencies like USAID and international institutions like the World Bank and United Nations.Admittedly, such a task has not exactly been a walk in the park, she explained:“I have faced a lot of skepticism over the past two years talking to international agencies. There is a lack of knowledge, a deep suspicion of blockchain due to crypto currencies and often an unwillingness to engage. Although, that is changing now.""Most recently, she was a participant at a blockchain summit convened in early September in Paris by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of wealthy countries.Prior to that, she was in Toky0 for an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum roundtable that brought together representatives from the International Monetary Fund and Asia's largest central bank to discuss the use of new technologies to spur financial inclusion and women's economic empowerment in the region.While the response from these important global institutions has gradually warmed as crypto and blockchain have gone more mainstream, there remains a large degree of uncertainty surrounding price volatility, the veracity of initial coin offerings and questions of privacy.She stressed that distinguishing cryptocurrencies from blockchain at this stage remains necessary, as does simply encouraging these bodies to be closely involved in any fast-moving technology that has disruptive power as far reaching as blockchain:""My big pitch is getting donors to move the dial and help countries prepare for being digitally prepared and building 'digital' as an economic sector. While donors and international agencies have been slow to get moving, I see a lot more interest this year.""Public Sector is KeyWhile it might come as anathema to those firmly entrenched in the crypto echo chamber, Thomason reckons that what blockchain deployment in her space requires is more education around the technology and more support from governments:""In order to diffuse, blockchain technology needs to be socialized, and the use cases implemented to show how it applies to real world problems in emerging economies.""Governmental financing support, such as pooled finance facilities, will also be required to help kickstart projects with sizable upfront costs in regions and sectors that have minimal access to traditional finance and banking services, particularly now that alternative global self-financing mechanisms such as ICOs have found themselves in the regulatory doghouse.""Public intervention will be needed to develop the cost model for 'last mile' users and to overcome impediments of scale so that private investments can be fully mobilized,"" she said, adding that this could prove to be a painful process as existing financial actors and corrupt government officials fight to protect their turf. Also required is a greater channeling of blockchain talent and resources - developers, platforms, venture capital, impact investors - from advanced economies to emerging economies where immediate use cases are more ample and the needs are more immediate.Hyper Co-Collaboration To help reach blockchain's potential in the international development ecosystem, Thomason is pushing a new paradigm to help entrepreneurs, activists and bureaucrats alike re-think their old ways of doing business.To create a digital future that lifts people out of poverty while creating positive social externalities, she argues, new levels of collaboration are required. Not just collaboration; not just hyper collaboration; but rather ""Hyper Co-Collaboration"" or HC2.She explained:""My logic is that social impact and global commons issues require a greater level of cooperation and shared interest than industry collaboration. These will be new collaborations for ecosystems that don’t normally collaborate or converge.""For example, both vertical and horizontal collaboration will be required across public, private and non-governmental sectors - with buy-in from technologists, researchers, financiers and other stakeholders - to thoroughly address issues such as gender equity, financial inclusion and sustainable energy.Thomason concluded that she sees this ""co-collaboration"" as particularly critical across five separate areas: shaping the technology's development, engaging and educating governments, building a talent pool to support the future digital economy and developing a new open global economic system to address global commons issues as they arise."

No need for reconciliations, with simultaneous settlements immediately available to all participants, and instant visibility into accounts receivable, the supply chain and virtually all relevant transactions.","Formally, blockchain is a digital ledger technology (DLT), which focuses on recording and storing transactions of any type in a shared platform.Indeed, what if there was just one, unimpeachable version of the truth? That is the promise of blockchain technology.While blockchain is often mentioned in conjunction with cyptocurrency platforms like Bitcoin, the underlying technology goes way beyond those nascent digital currencies. Formally, blockchain is a digital ledger technology (DLT), which focuses on recording and storing transactions of any type in a shared platform.What Is a Blockchain?As the word suggests, a blockchain is a series of connected blocks, or boxes. Each block contains data involved in a specific transaction. As each transaction occurs, it is stored in a block and added to the chain. Together, the blocks form a distributed database that can hold a growing number of records—a blockchain.But unlike a traditional database, in which information resides in unique repositories across multiple partners and must ultimately be reconciled, the distributed blockchain database creates a single, shared digital ledger.To protect the integrity of data, each block must be validated by every participant and secured using electronic cryptography. Changes cannot be made without the approval of participants. Think of it as having a notary there to verify every transaction. This chronological chain of transactions thus provides a single source of secured, up-to-date information that all authorized parties can share.For a quick explanation of how blockchain works, read Blockchain and the Future of Finance.A Finance WindfallThe potential benefits for CFOs and their finance teams are compelling: New levels of data transparency, faster access to information and features like “smart contracts” will bring significant changes to financial operations.

While crypto trading on the more mainstream exchanges is fueling the market, it’s also bringing greater scrutiny from regulators, as shown by the recent report by the New York State Attorney General’s office (OAG) on crypto exchange abuse, The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) announcements about upcoming crypto standards, and warnings to investors. And as guidance emerges and enforcement actions increase, crypto exchanges will, slowly but surely, start to look a lot more like other regulated financial markets.  Just last month, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) announced that it now receives over 1,500 suspicious activity reports (SARS) on crypto a month now.In the early years, crypto-trading occurred through a fragmented network of exchanges around the world, largely between anonymous parties. But it was the 2016-17 boom in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin that really brought crypto trading to the attention of regulators.As it stands, the current shifting regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. is still very confusing. State and federal regulators are struggling to keep pace with the innovations in cryptocurrencies, and the speed to which trading has taken off.An administrator or exchanger of cryptocurrency is a money services business (MSB).  MSBs are considered financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act. This, in turn, means that they fall under the FinCEN’s oversight. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) considers some cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) as securities, and therefore subject to securities regulations. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission also views virtual currencies as commodities.  At the same time, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)just recently filed its first enforcement action against an individual for marketing an unregistered cryptocurrency security.  And those are just the federal agencies—the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS), by way of example, regulates virtual currency activities through its BitLicenses and trust company charters.  If that all sounds complicated, that’s because it is.Shifting regulatory landscapeSo, how should crypto exchanges navigate such a complex and shifting regulatory landscape?Global crypto exchanges must develop and implement robust compliance programs covering a wide range of topics.  And yet, for just about any crypto exchange overseeing billions in assets, maintaining exhaustive compliance programs is both time-consuming and expensive.  Risk-based choices that must be made can be chancy in the absence of clear guidance and without a long history of regulatory interpretations and legal precedent.Nonetheless, certain basic actions are clear.  This begins with creating and implementing basic Know-Your-Customer requirements. But exchanges also need to implement robust anti-money laundering (AML), fraud prevention, and sanctions screening controls. Crypto exchanges whose compliance programs fail to meet regulators’ expectations will face the risk of costly enforcement actions. Just last year, FinCEN announced a significant fine against the BTC-e exchange and the owner of the BTC-e for violating AML laws, while the U.S. Department of Justice later filed criminal charges against BTC-e’s owner.In developing their financial crime program, exchanges should think creatively about how to effectively incorporate tools into compliance and operations. As business grows and the volume of transactions increases, it will be increasingly difficult to keep up with any alerts relating to customer transactions and performing sufficient checks with respect to onboarding new customers and monitoring existing customers.Another key area that must be a focus is market manipulation.  Exchanges must create and implement a robust policy and corresponding framework designed to combat market manipulation.  Market manipulation can take many forms, including trader and bot activity to artificially inflate prices (as indicated by price momentum and volume), and the failure by some trade engines who do not properly control the placement of matching orders opposite buy/sell orders.Cybersecurity is also an ongoing, and ever-changing challenge, in which failures can take a heavy toll. Just take a look at Mt. Gox, which now faces claims of over $1 billion in lost cryptocurrency, after its own bankruptcy. Crypto exchanges are still a high priority target for hackers. Hackers put a premium on personally identifiable information (PII), such as social security numbers, making the safeguarding of customer and transactional data pivotal. Assembling a cybersecurity team is an important factor in keeping your exchange compliant.  In addition to mitigating risk, a robust cybersecurity program may even be required by relevant regulations depending on where the exchange operations.  The NYS DFS has issued specific cybersecurity requirements for all entities it regulates—some of those requirements include risk assessments, designating a chief information security officer (CISO), and incident management plans.Where we go from hereIt can seem like government regulations move at a snail's pace compared to the speed of innovation in cryptocurrencies. While regulators continue to work through existing and future regulations, and we await new global FATF standards, exchanges can consider participating in a self-regulatory organization (SRO), such as the newly formed Virtual Commodity Association.  There are many unanswered questions as exchanges grow, and the potential of SROs to help address issues and provide guidance is significant.  We have one such example already—in June of this year, the CFTC announced that it is simplifying certain obligations imposed on an SRO when carrying out financial surveillance program for futures commission merchants.To grow business and be competitive, exchanges will have to put in place compliance programs that are not only compliant with applicable regulations but will also protect them from financial crimes that can cause irreparable reputational damage.  These compliance programs must be reliable and flexible, and constantly updated to meet the evolving requirements by federal agencies. Using robust, sophisticated tools that can automate transaction monitoring, customer screening, and certain facets of onboarding and transactions, along with setting up appropriate interfacing, will allow exchanges to devote appropriate compliance personnel and resources to the riskiest facets of the exchange and its customers.  Such programs will go a long way in reassuring both regulators and verified investors that crypto trading is a legitimate financial market and that their under-regulated days are in fact a thing of the past."

[+] companies.","Its founders make an unlikely pair. But in the fast moving-intersection of capital and cryptocurrency, a new $100 million fund is looking to turn that into a big advantage.Called Dragonfly Capital Partners, the fund is the result of a partnership between one of Silicon Valley’s young crypto investor enthusiasts and one of China’s most experienced investors. Founders Alexander Pack and Bo Feng will look to invest in a mix of crypto-first funds, protocols and applications, as well as tech startups building infrastructure for crypto-driven economies.“Crypto is a new asset class, and it made sense to have a new firm to support it,” says Pack. “We thought older ones would have a disadvantage.”Dragonfly’s founders are banking on Asia continuing to be one of the most, if not the single most, important markets for crypto use cases, especially in financial applications. They structured the fund to operate “unconstrained,” says Pack, without the kinds of restrictions on what types of companies or coins to back that can limit larger, more established firms.The fund has already deployed $20 million into more than 20 startups and funds, including price-stable currency Basis, and protocols, including Spacemesh and Oasis Labs, as well as funds like MetaStable Capital, in which Dragonfly invested and alongside of which it has already co-invested in several deals. “Despite crypto being a global and 24/7 market, it can often feel like two separate ecosystems between Asia and the West,” says MetaStable general partner Haseeb Qureshi. “Having a fund that can toe the line between the two hemispheres is a powerful advantage in being able to identify future trends and preempt where crypto is moving.”Though Dragonfly is new, Pack’s and Feng’s reputations in the emerging category are not. Pack was working with Arbor Ventures and serving in a Princeton in Asia teaching fellowship program in Hong Kong in 2014 when he realized there were more crypto opportunities in the area than startups. Joining AngelList in San Francisco the following year, he built a crypto micro-fund and led investments in Polychain Capital and Numerai—though he passed on Ethereum—before moving on to Bain Capital Ventures to lead its “network investing” in crypto funds and other nontraditional VC opportunities, backing 16 funds and 11 startups. He met Feng as the 20-year-plus veteran founder of Ceyuan Ventures co-invested with him in several deals including Basis and cryptocurrency exchange OKEx.Dragonfly cofounder Bo Feng brings more than 20 years of VC experience in Asia.When the two struck out on their own, they did so with a who’s who of Silicon Valley and China tech support. Pack’s old boss, Forbes Midas List member Salil Deshpande of Bain Capital Ventures, invested, as did Andreessen Horowitz cofounder Marc Andreessen and its crypto fund co-leader Chris Dixon, as well as Founders Fund’s Cyan Banister and Polychain’s Olaf Carlson-Wee. In Asia, the founders of Baidu, Meituan-Danping, Meitu and China Renaissance Bank invested alongside Midas List VCs Neil Shen of Sequoia China and Bob Xiaoping Xu of Zhenfund, among others. Strategic investors like OKEx and Bitmain also joined.Dragonfly will need to carve out a niche in a highly competitive and fast-growing market offering capital to promising crypto projects—efforts that are also well-versed in alternatives to venture capital altogether. The founders’ credibility and their cross-Pacific pitch has resonated so far, at least with founders like Basis CEO Nader Al-Naji. Pack met Basis while at Bain Capital Ventures and helped lead it to invest in a seed funding round with Andreessen Horowitz and a group of crypto funds, while Feng invested from Dragonfly’s fund. Pack was instrumental in helping Basis navigate a private pre-sale, Al-Naji says, as well as in bringing on recent Federal Reserve chairman candidate and Stanford economist John Taylor as an adviser.In an interview, Al-Naji tells Forbes he values Dragonfly as an investor not just for its Asian expertise but also for efforts that goes beyond what its total dollars invested would dictate. “I think VC firms can sometimes be hands-off when they’re not lead investors, but they’ve been the complete opposite,” he says. “They reach out frequently for advice and support.”That’s the reputation that could help Dragonfly find a seat at the table even in a complex funding environment where many crypto funds compete in one moment and invest in each other in the next. Pack says the hype—and deflation of hype—of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin hasn’t lowered the quality of projects for investors to support, just their prices. “We try to take a very long-term perspective,” Pack says. “Crypto has the power to transform things at a deeper layer. Not just money—transforming what we think of as property.”"

From the 2017 surge to the 2018 crash, entire industries surrounding the space have risen and contracted in a matter of months. Despite the increased attention on and investment in the crypto space, there are unresolved issues plaguing the industry and hampering its potential impact on a macro scale. Is the stablecoin--a new form of digital currency whose price is linked to another asset--the solution to the crypto industry’s problems, particularly within developing markets? And if so, which applications of digital currency can stablecoins enable?Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin can build in conjunction with rather than in place of traditional... [+] assets like gold GETTYRise Of The StablecoinThe stablecoin--a new form of cryptocurrency pegged to another asset such as fiat currency (the U.S. dollar, euro etc.), precious metal, or another cryptocurrency--theoretically represents the crypto industry’s response to the core issues of trust in and durability of cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins can be thought of as the (unproven) low risk and reliable crypto option. Their value lies in their ability to store and efficiently transfer rather than grow wealth, and they bridge the gap between physical and digital currency.There are two broad types of stablecoins: collateralized and uncollateralized/algorithmic. Collateralized stablecoins are reserve-backed by real-world assets (fiat or commodities) or backed by other cryptocurrencies, while uncollateralized stablecoins are pegged algorithmically.The different types of stablecoinsFor each real-world asset backed coin, an equivalent value in U.S. dollars or gold as an example is set aside in a bank. Trust is built and maintained in partnership with a centralized financial institution. This means real-world asset backed coins should be fully and easily redeemable for their associated assets, and that coins should not be created and circulated except when this holds true. The most popular real-world backed (and overall) stablecoin, Tether, maintains an overwhelming percentage of the total stablecoin market capitalization, although this share has declined significantly--around 10 percentage points--in October 2018. Other notable real-world backed stablecoins include TrueUSD, USD Coin, Paxos Standard, and Gemini Dollar.Crypto-collateralized coins are backed by other cryptocurrencies. Because cryptocurrencies are less stable than real-world assets, crypto-collateralized coins are over-collateralized. Whereas a U.S. dollar pegged stable coin would be pegged 1:1 (US$1 for 1 stablecoin), an ethereum backed stablecoin might be pegged 2:1 (US$2 worth of ethereum for US$1 worth of the stablecoin) to ensure stability even with large fluctuation. The primary crypto-collateralized stablecoin, Maker Dai, is pegged to the U.S. dollar, but backed by ethereum.The final type of stablecoin, uncollateralized or algorithmic stablecoin, is fully decentralized and is stabilized by algorithms dictating its value. These algorithms maintain value and stability by controlling the supply of the uncollateralized stablecoin--shrinking and growing it as needed. Basecoin is an example of an uncollateralized stablecoin: when the coin value dips below US$1, coin supply contracts (coin holders buy bonds using their coins, after which the used coins are destroyed) to increase the price, and the reverse holds true when the value exceeds US$1.How Stable Are Stablecoins?Stablecoins have already had their share of controversy and growing pains in their short lifespan, and the jury is out on whether these struggles should be attributed to the coins’ immaturity or to fundamental flaws in their construction.Real-world collateralized coins, in theory the most proven stablecoin model given their centralized store of value, have not yet proven themselves to be reliable. Tether specifically has come under attack because of questions surrounding its accounting and the process through which each of its coins is backed by U.S. dollars 1:1. The company has consistently been reluctant to provide audits of its reserves, and stands accused of manipulating the value of other cryptocurrencies because of a suspect relationship between it and the Bitfinex exchange (the two companies share executive leadership).On October 15th, Tether broke its 1:1 link with the U.S. dollar, with one USDT token falling below US$1, jeopardizing its stability. Additionally, this past week, news broke that Tether had destroyed 500 million USDT tokens, a tactic many believe is the company’s way of intentionally contracting supply. The USDT token has recovered since its fall, but questions remain and its share of the total stablecoin market cap took a substantial hit. Apart from Tether, other real-world collateralized stablecoins have and continue to fluctuate slightly above or below US$1, enough to question whether a true 1:1 peg is possible. Even if real-world collateralized coins are able to eventually stabilize, crypto purists argue that the fact that real-world collateralized coins require a central third party clashes with the very premise of cryptocurrency.The market cap and price of Tether's USDT took a big hit in October 2018As far as the other types of stablecoins, one might argue the inverse of the above point: that crypto-collateralized stablecoins undermine the very premise of the stablecoin. While they offer more decentralization than real-world collateralized stablecoins, because these coins peg one historically volatile cryptocurrency to another, what’s to say that the coin serving as backer could not fluctuate enough to irreparably undermine the stability of the backed coin? Following this line of thinking, algorithmically-based coins are even further removed from a real and proven model of backing, and are far more complex than real-world collateralized stablecoins. Holders of uncollateralized tokens lack a claim on any underlying assets in the event of token collapse.Despite these issues and outstanding questions, the number of new projects and investment has only grown in 2018. Stablecoin projects, of which there are around 50 either live or in development, have raised a combined US$350 million in investment capital, attracting attention from financial institutions within and outside of the crypto world. Major exchanges have begun to embrace stablecoins, and Tether ranks 8th in total market cap among all cryptocurrencies at the time of writing despite its recent woes. This is a testament to the wide-ranging potential of the stablecoin. If true stability (or truer stability than existing alternatives) is achieved, stablecoins could serve to unlock the potential of cryptocurrency and expand its application and impact in the developing world.Stablecoin Use Cases For Developing MarketsThe primary use case for stablecoin in its current conception is a tool to bypass restrictions arising from the clash between traditional financial institutions and crypto institutions. Many crypto exchanges can’t deal directly in fiat currency, so stablecoins act as a valuable substitute: a medium of exchange and a store of value. They allow investors to have more control over their funds--effectively both moving between cash and crypto and storing their funds in reserve without undermining their value, especially in periods of volatility. Stablecoins also offer exchanges access to the much needed liquidity they can’t access through banks using traditional means.This use case scratches the surface of what a truly stable coin can enable: the next generation of financial products and services built on the blockchain and transacted leveraging the benefits of digital currency. This includes insurance-related products, better and more equitable credit networks and loans for the many unbanked or underbanked populations in the developing world, smart contract dividend payments, and more. These products might not currently be viable on a large scale because of the volatility associated with standard cryptocurrencies, however stablecoins could change that, lending credibility to existing products and catalyzing the research and development of new products.On an even broader macro level, the achievement of a stable coin could help citizens in developing countries gain reliable access to price-stable cryptocurrency assets. Throughout history, currency devaluation has caused havoc in unstable economies. Recent examples include the economies of Argentina and Turkey. For those citizens holding a collapsing currency (or even one experiencing high inflation rates), the idea of transferring wealth into a stable cryptocurrency is an appealing proposition, essentially replacing a volatile currency with the substitute for a more stable currency.A Novel ApproachThe potential impact of stablecoins is too great to ignore, however they currently fall short of this promise. How can stablecoins evolve? How can they boost their stability and subsequent adoption? One solution being pursued by a select few stablecoin companies is creating hybrid models of stablecoins combining multiple types of backing.Vault, a Canadian-Swiss company backed by a consortium of precious metal focused private equity funds, is taking such an approach, and is planning to launch its USDVault stablecoin by the end of 2018. There are other stablecoins using multiple concurrent mechanisms reinforcing stabilization such as multiple fiat currencies, but The USDVault token is unique in that it is the only U.S. dollar pegged and gold backed stablecoin--a formidable combination. Furthermore, the tokens are fully redeemable for either U.S. dollars or gold.USDVault's value propositionAs Vault Co-Founder and CEO Ranjeet Sodhi explains: “LBMA gold bullion (physical gold) is purchased only when a customer buys the USDVault token by sending their funds to our fiduciary partner. The funds are sent to a trust via our fiduciary partners and this trust then purchases an equivalent amount of gold bullion (which is stored in fully insured Swiss vaults). The trust also executes a gold hedge, and in parallel instructs Vault to issue the USDVault token to the customer’s wallet.” This process ensures not only increased stability, but also increased transparency as all transactions are overseen by third party fiduciary partners, avoiding the issues presently casting a shadow over Tether.The USDVault token will be targeted toward institutional investors at first, with individual investors soon to follow. Tokens will be available both directly via Vault, and also via partner exchanges. The company plans to charge small issuance, redemption, and vaulting fees to generate revenue.Time will tell whether the dollar pegged, gold backed model can achieve what other stablecoin models haven’t been able to, but the launch of multi-backed coins like USDVault is a step in the right direction. As more and better stablecoin projects launch, each will be able to learn from its predecessors and competitors, and to incorporate best practices to minimize risk and maximize stability.The Future of StablecoinsStablecoins have already accomplished a crucial goal for the crypto industry: highlighting the need to identify ways to better build trust into crypto. As stablecoin projects strive to generate trust, patience and support is required both from the crypto industry and from the centralized banking industry. This comes in the form of financial backing to ensure liquidity, regulatory backing with an understanding that stablecoins are the closest things to real-world assets that exist in the crypto world, and the backing of crypto exchanges in promoting stablecoins on their platforms.If these conditions are met,  it’s entirely possible that down the road, the currency solution of the future will be equal parts cash and crypto, centralization and decentralization, speed and security.

Bloomberg Finance LP. In the latest escalation of an ongoing war of ...","Sep 18, 2018,04:05pm EDT",Kraken Bitcoin Exchange Chief Executive Officer Jesse Powell,"In the latest escalation of an ongoing war of words, the New York State attorney general warned that the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange might be breaking the law.In a lengthy report on the “integrity” of global cryptocurrency exchanges, newly appointed attorney general Barbara Underwood listed San Francisco-based Kraken among multiple exchanges that might be operating “unlawfully.”However, following an impassioned and very public refusal by Kraken’s CEO to participate in the report, the warning appears to be based as much on lack of access as any legitimate concern.From the report:“Customers should be aware that the platforms that refused to participate in the OAG’s Initiative (Binance, Gate.io, Huobi, and Kraken) may not disclose all order types offered to certain traders, some of which could preference those traders at the expense of others, and that the trading performance of other customers on those venues could be negatively affected as a result.”In the report the New York attorney said the office has referred three of these platforms—Binance, Gate.io, and Kraken—to the New York State Department of Financial Services ""for potential violation of New York’s virtual currency regulations.""While Kraken is probably the best known of the exchanges to U.S. users, with $133 million in daily volume, Binance is the largest exchange in the world, with $1 billion daily volume, and Huobi has $670 million in volume, according to CoinMarketCap data. The report, formally titled the Virtual Markets Integrity Initiative report, included findings from nine other exchanges, including Bitfinex (operated by iFinex Inc.), bitFlyer USA, Inc., Bitstamp, Ltd., Bittrex, Inc., Coinbase, Inc., Gemini Trust Company, itBit (operated by Paxos Trust Company), and Poloniex (owned by Circle Internet Financial Limited).The report targeted five areas: where the exchanges do business, their trading policies, how they manage conflicts of interest, security, and how they access consumer funds. After each section, the attorney general provided a warning that the above exchanges were not considered in the findings.In the case of Kraken, which is among the oldest exchanges on the list, the reason for its refusal to participate has been made very clear. In August 2015 Kraken formally left the New York jurisdiction, citing concerns about the cost and reach of the state’s burgeoning BitLicense, which many argued was more onerous that even traditional financial regulation.“It is a creature so foul, so cruel that not even Kraken possesses the courage or strength to face its nasty, big, pointy teeth,” Kraken wrote at the time.Then, in April 2018, Kraken founder Jesse Powell publicly refused to answer questions from the New York attorney general. “Having the requested information 'on-hand' is not the same as having the resources to compile it neatly to fit the framework of the request, within 2 weeks,” he tweeted.In spite of Kraken's refusal to participate, or perhaps because of it, the report concluded: “Whether and where customers should trade virtual currencies depends upon the needs and experience of the individual customer. As a general matter, though, customers would do well to avoid platforms that cannot satisfactorily answer the questions posed in this Report.”Editor's note: The article has been updated to clarify that according to the report the attorney general office referred Binance, Gate.io, and Kraken to the NYDFS for potential regulatory violations.

Save money concepts.","The surge of cryptocurrencies and “hodling” investment strategies of 2017 precipitated a flood of crypto asset-backed lending platforms coming to market.The idea is a simple - take the concepts and models of traditional asset-backed lending and implement them with new “crypto assets” like Bitcoin and Ether. So if cryptocurrency miners or hodlers need short term access to fiat currency to pay expenses but don’t want to liquidate their positions, they can take out loans against the value of their crypto assets. As such, platforms like ETHLend, SALT Lending, Nuo Lend and a plethora of others provide an alternative vehicle for investors who want to simultaneously hold and use their cryptocurrency. Similarly, institutional traders looking to take out short term crypto-denominated loans for use in margin trading and taking short positions can also have their cake and eat it too. But crypto asset-backed lending isn’t quite the same as taking out a second mortgage on your house. Crypto markets are notorious for their volatility, and the two largest assets - Bitcoin and Ether - have experienced dramatic price downturns since the beginning of the year, though these have stabilized as of late. This can make the process of issuing and receiving crypto loans a precarious one. “The volatility of the cryptocurrency market represents a challenge when using these assets as collateral for loans,” said Stani Kulechov, CEO of Aave - the parent company of the decentralized peer-to-peer lender ETHLend:“Cryptocurrency lending platforms need to make sure the value of the loan doesn’t surpass the value of the collateralized assets, causing borrowers to default, leaving them in a bind.”   Still Going StrongA plunge in the value of the collateralized assets below the value of the loan effectively forces a margin call where the borrower must deposit additional assets or cash to cover possible losses. While surely inconvenient, this hasn't in an of itself been a dealbreaker for the nascent sector. “Our clients are very responsive to market prices and margin call scenarios, meaning they tend to act quickly to deposit more collateral or pay off a portion of their loan,” said Joseph Kelly, CEO of crypto-backed loan provider Unchained Capital.Kelly continued:“The real test for platforms like ours was the price drop in January and February when Bitcoin retreated 70 percent from $19,000 to $6,000 over the course of a few weeks. During that period 90 percent of our loans were margin called and 80 percent of clients responded within eight hours.”While heavy downturns can potentially be disastrous for lenders if borrowers aren’t able or are unwilling to top up their loans, Kulechov argues that the value of crypto lending platforms is more demonstrable in these slumping conditions. “It is a concept that is even more appealing during market downturns, as it’s not ideal for investors to close their positions in a bear market,” he explained. “Lending platforms solve their crypto liquidity problem, while holding onto those assets until the exchange rate normalizes or rises.Lending platforms are seeing respectable user growth amid the challenging conditions. According to Dapp.com, ETHLend and Nuo Lend have processed upwards of 4,500 and 1,800 transactions, respectively, since launching in May 2018. “These are very good numbers for their first five months in business,” said Kyle Lu, CEO of Dapp.com, adding:“Demand is still emerging. True mass adoption is still around the corner. Right now it's mostly miners (especially for Bitcoins) who have the urgency to lend cash and sometimes the holders of some ERC-20 tokens who are interested."" Doing The HomeworkExtrapolating proven risk management and modeling techniques from traditional asset-backed lending to the crypto space appears to be - if done correctly - an effective means for these platforms to protect from excessive market swings. Zac Prince, CEO of BlockFi - another crypto loan provider, said that his firm offers a loan-to-value ratio of 35 percent, meaning that a borrower can take out $35 in loans for every $100 worth of collateral deposited. “We've found that our 35 percent loan-to-value has made our loans especially resistant to the current market fluctuations,” he said:“In the nine months we've been lending, we haven't had a single customer default on a loan.”ETHLend offers a more generous loan-to-value of between 50 and 55 percent, with Kulechov explaining that: “We protect lenders by allowing collateral calling, which means if the collateral value drops to a certain threshold such as 100 percent of the loan amount, the lender can call the collateral.""Kelly explained that Unchained Capital will issue a formal margin call if the asset incurs a 25 percent drop from the price of origination and will liquidate a client’s collateral at a 45 percent price drop assuming no additional collateral was deposited.Institutionals First?While the consumer-focused versions of of crypto asset-backed lending platforms are getting some play, others argue that these models are overly fraught with risk and technical hurdles to be scalable and sustainable in the near term.""There are still several infrastructure problems. How do you source prices? How do you hedge against counterparty risk? How do you deal with hacks and custody issues?"" explained Lucas Nuzzi, director of technology research at Digital Asset Research, adding that it's only a matter of time before these issues are dealt with constructively:""While it goes against the general ethos of Bitcoin in general as a provably scarce asset, I do think it’s going to happen in one way or another.""However, Nuzzi sees this development happening initially in the institutional space rather than the consumer realm, particularly for activities like margin trading - as is being currently explored by platforms like dYdX and Dharma.For example, Genesis Global Trading, the over the counter crypto platform, reported in mid-October that it had lent more than half a billion dollars since March to institutional borrowers looking to take short positions and hedge investments.""Thinking about all the oracle requirements of consumer platforms versus just doing margin trading, it’s much easier to gauge counterparty risk,"" said Nuzzi:""As of right now I really can’t see these consumer lending platforms really getting much traction just because we just don’t have the basic tools to guarantee that counterparty risk is covered."" "

","Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase. In late October, Brian Armstrong, the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange operator Coinbase, oversaw a financing round in which the company he cofounded raised $300 million at a valuation of $8 billion. At that valuation, Armstrong’s stake in Coinbase is worth an estimated $1.3 billion, after applying a customary discount for privately held companies. In January, Forbes had estimated that Armstrong’s net worth was between $900 million and $1 billion.  It is possible that Armstrong’s personal cryptocurrency holdings have taken a financial hit due to the plunging value of bitcoin, ether and other cryptocurrencies over the last several months. Armstrong cofounded Coinbase in 2012, and the company was so intertwined with the cryptocurrency mania that followed that it even paid many of its employees in bitcoin. Armstrong, 35, did not respond to requests for comment for this article. But Coinbase, which is based in San Francisco, has continued to solidify its position as the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S. and post eye-popping financial results. It has more than 20 million users, is extremely profitable and will likely generate $1.3 billion of revenue this year. With those kind of numbers, Coinbase was able to attract Tiger Global Management to lead its recent investment round, and other big names like Wellington Management and Andreesen Horowitz also participated. To get a sense of what has gone on at Coinbase in the last year, its last investment round, which took place in August 2017, valued the firm at $1.6 billion. In the last year, Coinbase has been at the center of both the boom and bust in cryptocurrencies. After Coinbase became the most downloaded iPhone app for a short period in late 2017, its shares traded on the secondary market at a valuation of $4.5 billion. It runs a brokerage business, where retail customers can buy cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or ether using a bank account, and an exchange, where traders can make bids and offers on cryptocurrencies. Coinbase mostly makes money on fees it charges its customers, so it has continued to do well as the prices of cryptocurrencies plunged. But Coinbase is ultimately tied to the future performance of cryptocurrencies. Coinbase claims it will use the $300 million it recently raised to expand global links between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, and to add more cryptocurrencies to its exchange. Coinbase is also working to attract more financial institutions to cryptocurrency trading.  "

they likely can't use it to pay manufacturers or other supply chain ...","Sep 28, 2018,11:18am EDT",Getty,"Blockchain technology first gained notoriety because of the use of cryptocurrencies, an application which typically only involved the flow of money. Most of the currency being transferred back and forth was essentially detached from the flow of goods. For a while, many people simply held onto their crypto and treated it as an investment. Now that companies are using blockchain to work in different areas, like supply chains, there’s both a flow of money going in one direction and a flow of goods in the other. And linking the flow of goods and money becomes extremely important, because once it's been done, companies can to do things like automate payments or confirm transactions. In fact, it’s a natural progression for supply chain participants to adopt blockchain payment processors. What results is a system that increases efficiency, automation, and liquidity in the supply chain. Here’s why it will be so important going forward:A crypto payment system introduces greater liquidity into markets.Connecting a supply chain or retail platform to a payment processor provides a different means of transacting and making payments—opening up new sources of liquidity for the businesses involved.Even if a company is cash-forward, they can use other assets or currencies to transact between supply chain participants. For example, a business may occasionally pay contractors with bitcoin, but they likely can’t use it to pay manufacturers or other supply chain participants. A blockchain-run payment processor would provide companies with nearly instant, diverse ways to use their cryptocurrency assets, allowing for improved liquidity and decreased liability.Streamlined payment improves efficiency and automation.Supply chains already have individual payment processing systems, but they’re disjointed. They don’t really work in a seamless, elegant way. And that inefficiency has consequences for the businesses using them. For example, even our team at Chronicled, which specializes in supply chains, isn’t immune to the delays or hassles of working with an outdated system.The cryptographic seals we use look fairly simple, but they require a number of different parts. One company creates the antenna, and another builds the chip that turns it into the NFC inlay. A third vendor places all of it in a tamper-proof sticker. Now, our team isn't ordering vast quantities, and none of these vendors are located exceptionally far from each other. But the task of filling out orders and completing them is incredibly time-consuming. Processes like this can take months depending on what type of product the company is working on.While many of these systems could become more efficient by digitizing and automating the flow of data and information, it's not enough. Digital documents aren’t valuable if they’re being sent to someone with a blockchain-based payment processor. And as more companies adopt crypto and blockchain technology, exchanging that value is going to become much more important. A point-to-point transaction can reduce costs for companies. There’s been a lot of news recently about all the things individuals can now buy with cryptocurrency. And while it may be cool to pay for a pizza with bitcoin, payment processor systems on blockchain are best for when you’re dealing with a large amount of data and transaction volumes. You want to start in areas where there are extreme inefficiencies, which usually means large industries and enterprises. That’s where there’s more room to innovate and improve the existing structures. Right now, those existing structures are often specific to one industry or company—and costly to build. A blockchain payment processor takes the burden off individual companies by providing a single solution for everyone in a supply chain or industry. In fact, we’re seeing it happen right now with companies like CoinPayments, BitPesa, Coinbase, and Aliant who are all attempting to grow adoption of their own payment processing systems. Allowing companies to process transactions automatically and avoid or significantly lower transfer fees is a huge leap forward in efficiency and cost savings. It may not be as flashy as buying Starbucks with bitcoin, but it’s where we’ll see real, measurable improvement in industries going forward."

Ethereum (learning from Bitcoin), or to change to Proof of Stake.","Sep 14, 2018,09:24am EDT","
","Ethereum and its community has a problem on top of a problem. The first problem is that, by the end of the year, it’ll need to find a solution to the so-called Difficulty Bomb: the level of difficulty of the puzzles miners have to solve in order to be rewarded for mining ether on the Ethereum blockchain is increasing. As the puzzles become more complicated, with miners finding it more difficult to earn ether, a lag grows between the production of blocks on the blockchain. This may prompt the scenario that, in early 2019, mining becomes unprofitable. And this means there are two choices: either to improve Proof of Work for Ethereum (learning from Bitcoin), or to change to Proof of Stake.The problem on top of this is that there is no guaranteed way forward when it comes to solving the Difficulty Bomb. There are several possible routes and, by the end of this year, some of them will have been implemented. But we won’t know which one is the winning strategy, and that brings instability to the entire Ethereum project. That’s a big deal. The market value of the protocol is $20 billion. Ethereum is the bastion of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), which raised over $7 billion in the first half of 2018 alone. There is a lot of cash, and people tied to that cash, in the Ethereum ecosystem. Let’s look at the options. Proof of Stake is the most talked-about. It is important to remember that this is a first-layer solution, meaning it’s built on the main chain of Ethereum, rather than being built on top of it (“off-chain”), which is known as a second-layer solution. Proof of Stake (scheduled to come into full effect this year) would see Ethereum move from Proof of Work - where miners earn ether by competing against each other to solve puzzles – to a system which distributes rewards based on existing ether ownership. This is the preferred course of action for the individuals who run Ethereum, because it would introduce scarcity into the system, pushing up the price of ether and, therefore, their holdings. Alternatively, things will be tried that aim to improve Proof of Work. There are several second-layer solutions, like Plasma, which will use smart contracts to process transactions made on child blockchains (Ethereum being the parent blockchain), which means that very large volumes of transactions, on different chains can be computed at once. This should make it easier to scale the network but, because activity shifts off-chain, could push down the value of ether. Moreover, it will likely create an enormous data storage problem, with the size of ethereum blockchain is growing exponentially. The solution for this problem is so-called “sharding”, which offers a route to scalability while maintaining security. Currently, every transaction that takes place on Ethereum has to be routed through every node in the network. Sharding splits the entire network, at a given point in time, into partitions called shards – a fixed snapshot, if you like. Then, certain nodes process transactions within certain shards, enabling higher transaction throughput across the network. A caveat is that, if you want to have “full” node yourself, you will need to have very sophisticated, enterprise-like hardware – i.e. the role of individuals in a supposedly decentralised system is diminished.The point of all this is that the essence of Ethereum is going to change, and whichever of these possible ways forward wins out will determine just how drastic a change that is. On the one hand, we could see a protocol controlled by a federation – an elite, likely led by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin probably – of Proof-of-Stake-driven miners. The more ether you earn, the more influence you will have in the network. And as demand increases for the thing you control, the price will likely go up. On the other hand, however, we could see decentralization enduring, with child blockchains reproducing and taking much of the work and throughput from the mainchain. The network-based, state-free vision that brought and brings people to the crypto world would remain more intact, but ether could wane in value as new projects and tokens continue to rely on it less. Buterin has pointed out that, if the Difficulty Bomb is not solved, the value of the Ethereum protocol may fall to zero. We don’t yet know which solution will work, but we do know that as many as possible need to be tried – although the reason for this is not to maintain value in ether or Ethereum. Most people looking at the next wave of the internet – Web 3.0 – agree that there’s a reasonable likelihood that we will see fatter protocols and thinner application layers emerging – the reverse of what has gone before. Whether it’s Proof of Stake or a framework like Plasma that engenders the next wave of innovation on Ethereum, we could well see the reincarnation of ever-more powerful protocols. Investors will put money not into Ethereum via ether but, via numerous tokens, into the layers of infrastructure that enable the next chapter of the digital age to be written. We are in for exciting times.I would like to say a brief but big thank you to my team at Coinfirm. They are over 100 people who are really enthusiastic about blockchain in all forms, without whose expertise and assistance writing this would not have been possible. "

Where in the first world, people are worried about where their coffee beans come from in their Starbucks order, those coffee bean farmers are worried about how they will get money to their family back home, across different borders.While blockchain is aimed at disrupting and providing solutions for a multitude of life’s issues, from major to minor, there are areas where the technology should be intently focused. It can indeed help with first world issues and increase efficiency and productivity, for example, but it should be driven in the third world where it can change lives for the better.Remittance payments is one area that is a lifeline for millions of people across the globe, especially in rural areas. People are finding work outside of their homelands and are needing to send money home to friends and family to support them. However, the remittance system as its stands is incredibly capitalist in that it is a huge business that takes away from the people that need it most.It is an age old adage with regards to the power of blockchain. The decentralized and transparent nature, in a financial sense, can help alleviate the need for middle men and thus make payments - especially cross-border ones - cheaper, more efficient, and far less unnecessarily regulated.It hands power back to the individuals - the individuals that need it most. People who are using remittance payments are scraping together every penny in order to survive and help their family survive, but they are being stymied by massive fees and long turn around times.Blockchain’s cross-border potentialThere is still a huge debate as to what will be the ‘killer app’ for blockchain. Some believe that cryptocurrencies in general are the way forward for this technology in terms of adoption and use, but that is a large sector. Thus, some feel that this global, digital currency that is borderless, can be the way to enact a blockchain adoption and there it will find its best use case.It is a useful tool, to have a currency that can cross borders at a fraction of the cost of a bank and without all the red tape. Not to mention the added proficiency, efficiency and speed. Thus, when delving even deeper into it, it makes sense that blockchain, and cryptocurrencies, be directed to disrupt the current remittance system which is hugely unfair and inefficient.Current state of remittance paymentsThose who live by remittance payments have true insight into how difficult and harsh the system is, but, Lorien Gamaroff, who is the CEO of a blockchain wallet company called Centbee focusing in on Africa, explains the current state of affairs, and why something needs to be done.“Millions of Africans leave their countries and work elsewhere. Every month and year they send money home to their families,” Gamaroff explains. “Existing remittance providers charge between 10% and 20% to remit money. Often the processes are onerous, requiring forms to be filled in, or inconvenient as well as expensive.“Some cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin Cash, have very low transaction costs, around 1 US cent for any amount. This is a very appealing idea for those people who earn very little and are looking to preserve as much value as they can in the transfer.”It is not only an African problem, there is a huge portion of the global population that is under the breadline and requires remittance payments to help keep themselves, and their families, afloat.“The major problem lies in its cross-border nature, which significantly complicates the passage of cash flows and adds costs,” explains Clarke Robertson, director of Noahcoin, another company looking to aid in cross-border payments and remittance systems, explains, this time in an Asian setting. “Using banking services or payment systems the workers have to pay huge fees: up to 9.82% in Japan, about 6%-10% in the Philippines.”A simple upgrade for allThe notion is a simple one. The current state of remittance payments is not only undercutting the people who need the money most, but it is also leading to these people looking to get money across the borders by unregulated means.So, while the upgrade from traditional remittance to a blockchain-based system clearly show advantages in removing an expensive intermediary, which is also ineffective and slow, it also has benefits for governments who want to keep track of the movements of money across borders.Gamaroff goes on to explain how cryptocurrencies need not be fully anonymous and they can be used in accordance with KYC and AML rules, thus, for regulators, there is a way to keep record and taxation on this movement of money while still keeping fees manageable for the individuals.“Regulatory obstacles are being eroded away as regulators become more educated around the mechanics of cryptocurrencies. They are beginning to realise that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin Cash are not anonymous and easy to enforce existing KYC and AML rules upon. The nature of the transparent ledger means that regulators and tax authorities can have more visibility around transactions than traditional payment methods,” Gamaroff says.“More than half of the money that moves cross border in Africa goes through informal channels. These are typically taxis that transport suitcases of money and other by other similar means. We are wanting to allow consumers to easily send something like Bitcoin Cash to a number of countries and then converts it to mobile money like EcoCash or MPesa.”The transparency that Gamaroff mentions is echoed by Robertson, but in regard to security for the senders and receivers using Blockchain remittance.“With Blockchain, both a sender and a recipient would be able to track the money flow and know exactly whether the funds have reached their destination or not. There is no risk of losing money somewhere between the parties and their wallets,” adds Robertson.More effort requiredThere are many instances, especially in areas like Africa and rural Asia where blockchain technology can literally transform the lives of millions of people who need it most. It is a sad state of affairs where people in the most dire of situations are still being taken advantage of by centralized companies who offer life-saving services.The need for remittance payments is only growing, and as such it is big business and is attracting more and more who want to take advantage of their intermediary cut.“Labor migration is one of the main demographic trends of the last decades and the Asian countries are not an exclusion,” Robertson spells out what is happening in Asia. “What's more, in this region remittance payments quite often make up the bulk of the budget on which the families of overseas workers live at home and contribute a lot to the overall GDP. For example, in the Philippines, over 10% of the GDP (which is about $30 billion) comes from remittances.”Blockchain technology is still finding its feet, and is being tested across a range of sectors, but really, it's direction should be heavily directed to where it can do the most good. Decentralized at its core, and not greedy in nature, blockchain technology should be shaped as the tool of the underpowered, but it needs a big push to get there."

The SEC rejected nine filings for bitcoin ETFs last month, and despite some high-profile projects and partnerships, like the Intercontinental Exchange's Bakkt, Northern Trust's recent blockchain expansion, and Citigroup's exploration of crypto custody solutions, institutional participation in cryptocurrency remains relatively low.The report identifies two major areas under development that could help make cryptocurrency more accessible to banks, asset managers, hedge funds, and other large organizations: financialization, which involves the development of products like futures and ETFs that allow institutions to gain more exposure to cryptocurrencies, and custody, which has to do with how cryptocurrency is stored by its owner.Johnson acknowledges these setbacks, but says his survey indicates sustained optimism in the space. He cited the two stablecoins from Gemini and Paxos that were approved this week by the New York Department of Financial Services as evidence of institutional progress in cryptocurrency. ""We’ve had a terrible market for crypto this year, but people are still coming out with a lot of great innovation and a lot of great ideas,"" he says. Be among the first to get important crypto and blockchain news and information with Forbes Crypto Confidential.

[+] 11, 2018, in New York. (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP","People keep asking me, what’s the deal with stablecoins? With two prominent regulatory approvals to issue the blockchain-based tokens, many have heralded them as the next evolution of cryptocurrency, while others say they’re perfect evidence of why no one ever needed cryptocurrency in the first place.On a basic level, a stablecoin is a token that has a mechanism in place to minimize its price fluctuations. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether, which are directly tied to their wildly fluctuating demand, a stablecoin can rely on four methods to constrain its fluctuations.The first and by far most popular way to achieve this stability is to peg the price of the token to a more stable asset like the U.S. dollar. This is what both the Gemini and Paxos cryptocurrency exchanges received permission to do from the New York Department of Financial Services last week. Unlike bitcoin and ethereum, which are created through a mining process that also ensures the blockchain’s accuracy, these stablecoins are only created when someone buys them with U.S. dollars.Gemini and Paxos have both established relationships with traditional banks to hold the U.S. dollars, while the exchanges, which have been granted licenses to function as trusts, are responsible for the tokens themselves. Instead of using computing power to audit the blockchain through the mining process, third-party auditors are employed to help ensure exactly as many tokens exist as there are dollars on account.The benefit of these tokens is that while bitcoin’s price has fluctuated wildly (it's been as high as $20,000 and is currently at $6,480), making it almost impossible to spend, the U.S. dollar decreases in value on average at a rate of 2% a year, making it a much more reliable unit of exchange. On the flip side, while dollars may be stable, they’re notoriously slow for businesses to move in large amounts, especially given the relative ease with which an e-mail (or a bitcoin) can be sent.From an investment perspective, the important part here is that the U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins are only as scarce as the dollar itself. As a result, getting your hands on one of these tokens won’t likely ever be a better investment than the U.S. dollar, and some have argued it may even be worse. The reasons U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins are being created aren’t to invest in but to enable off-hours trading and to jump-start transaction volumes on the underlying ethereum blockchain. But there are other, largely theoretical, ways to achieve price stability. The most popular of these is by coding some of the theories applied by central banks into the DNA of the blockchain. The most heavily funded of these blockchains that control price using an algorithm is Basis, which has raised $133 million from mainstream investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, to build a central bank for issuing cryptocurrency. In this case, when the price of the cryptocurrency starts to increase, the blockchain will automatically increase the rate at which it creates new coins, flooding the market and reducing the price. When the price starts to decrease, the Basis blockchain would buy back its own tokens, reducing supply and driving up price. Think of this alternative as an automated Federal Open Market Committee, where the 12 members are replaced by an algorithm. If this product launches as planned it would merge the speed and borderlessness of cryptocurrency with the stability of a well-managed fiat currency, but with only mathematics and electricity behind it. While development on the project is in its early stages, another math-heavy solution being considered as a way to stabilize cryptocurrency is what is called a “futures-backed token.” Explored in great depth by researcher James Zdralek of German software firm SAP, futures-backed cryptocurrencies would actually be three separate tokens that move as one. Importantly, as Zdralek conceives these tokens, they would actually appreciate in value.To accomplish this, Zdralek envisions futures-backed cryptocurrencies as being supported by a traditional cryptocurrency that is in turn backed by the output of a nation's industries. The first token in this scheme would be backed by securitized shares representing the ownership of a factory. The second token would be backed by the inventory of a company, and would give owners a stake in the inventory. The third token in Zdralek's concept contract aggregates the other tokens. Given its complexity, one can't help but be reminded of derivatives and the dangers they can pose.Alas, there is another way to achieve cryptocurrency stability. Call it, the old-fashioned way: spend it. The Catch-22 of investing in cryptocurrency is that the original promise of the asset was a faster, borderless currency beyond the reach of central bank monetary supply controls and bank bail-outs. But by hoarding the crypto asset you undermine those original, core benefits.In the words of U2 frontman Bono: “You can hold onto something so tight, you’ve already lost it.”"

â€œIt's amazing that the Dutch government created a special blockchain ...","Oct 13, 2018,03:06am EDT",Getty,"The world is abuzz about blockchain, but not all are equally up to speed when it comes to their embrace and support of this important emerging technology. Some have focused on cracking down on potentially predatory behaviors, even at the cost of thwarting enterprises that could massively improve quality of life throughout society. But some countries have made it a point to dive head first into blockchain and show federal support and encouragement for blockchain innovation.The Netherlands has emerged as such a leader. In fact, it launched government-supported blockchain pilot projects, and pushes for new prototypes, project implementation, and international partnerships. Partners so far include the World Bank, the United Nations, and the EU Forum. The Netherlands also announced in May that the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy created a special blockchain unit with a research agenda mainly focused on establishing if the trustless nature of blockchain is reliable, determining if blockchain is sustainable from the perspective of energy consumption, and discovering the best ways in which blockchain endeavors can be managed and governed. “The Netherlands hosts one of the most passionate blockchain scenes in the world,” said Emanuele Francioni, Tech Lead of Dusk Foundation, a Dutch non-profit creating a blockchain-based secure communication system, to protect the freedom of speech. “Events are organized in multiple cities in the country and the turnout is great. Amsterdam, Berlin, and London form a strong co-located blockchain scene. We are seeing more homegrown projects in the Dutch space, and events are becoming more and more professional.”“Most of the early experimentation by the government was done with multinationals through consortia, often in the permissioned [private] space,” Francioni continued. “We are starting to see the first permissionless [public] initiatives getting more public traction, which is a very exciting area that should get a lot more attention.”Dutch ventures are also making strides when it comes to crypto exchanges. If you want to acquire cryptocurrency tokens, you need to exchange fiat currencies (like dollars or euros) for your token of choice on a crypto exchange. Trading for and between cryptocurrencies is one of the industry's most emerging markets, but many of the exchange options out there are very problematic: they’re slow, charge high fees, upset currency pricing, and are vulnerable to hacks. Founded in 2014 by John Jansen, Dutch firm Deribit is a cryptocurrency exchange on which it’s possible to trade futures, options and other derivative products. The exchange keeps 95% of its bitcoin held in cold storage at all times.“It’s amazing that the Dutch government created a special blockchain unit with the goal of not just regulating the new technology but actively looking for opportunities,” said Jansen, who comes from a background in options trading in the Amsterdam Options Exchange. “This shows a positive attitude toward this technological development which benefits the blockchain ecosystem in the Netherlands.”“Furthermore, crypto is catching on with the Dutch people as well,” Jansen continued. “It was recently reported that in October of 2017, an estimated 135,000 Dutch people had invested in cryptocurrencies. But by February of this year, that number rose to 580,000… that’s 430% growth in five months. We have every reason to expect that number to continue to rise.”And not just the common folk, either. “Even our royals get involved” said Plamen Nedyalkov, CEO of Zoom. “Prince Constantijn van Oranje has been attending blockchain conferences and hackathons across The Netherlands and is the chairman of StartUpFest Europe, which also works with Blockchain startups.”Zoom is a blockchain-based hiring and work management system that shows companies’ and freelancers’ accurate work history, avoiding fraud through decentralized data hosting. It was founded in Amsterdam in 2017 by Nedyalkov. The inspiration came from the Nedyalkov family construction business, which for over 20 years built residences, hospitals and hotels, but always struggled to secure flexible, global outsourcing.There’s no doubt that the country's support has led to intense innovation in this burgeoning sphere already. From the looks of things, there’s a lot more where that came from. Can Dutch regulation legislation keep up with the boom? Can crypto prices stabilize and continue to encourage growth and development? We’ll have to wait and see how these conditions turn out."

Photographer: Adam Glanzman/Bloomberg"," Ripe.io wants to use blockchain technology to transform the food industry, and it just received a major influx of cash to do it. The agritech startup just secured $2.4 million in financing from investors like Maersk Growth, the capital venture arm of the Danish shipping container conglomerate Maersk, and Relish Works, a Chicago-based food innovation hub.Cofounder and president of Ripe.io Phil Harris has high hopes for this newly secured round of financing: “[it] takes a little company and enables [us to realize all of] our big ambitions.”Both Harris and his cofounder and CEO Raja Ramachandran came to the food industry from the financial world — Harris from Nasdaq and Ramachandram from an industry consortium called R3CEV — before coming together to form Ripe Technology, Inc. or, as it’s come to be known, Ripe.io.“One of the things we saw early on was that blockchain could [be applied] beyond [the] financial [industry],” says Ramachandran of the company’s early beginnings.The two decided on food because they saw an industry plagued by a number of problems, including “food fraud, food safety, [how to determine] what constitutes quality, and even things like spoilage management.” Plus, food, of course, is personal. Explains Ramachandran, “[it gave us the opportunity] to look at something that affects us daily, not only ourselves, [but] our families [and] our communities.”Blockchain technology isn’t new. Created in 2008 by the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, blockchain technology served (and still serves) as an immutable digital ledger for the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. It works by verifying transactions through a consensus of computer systems. Blockchain is the underlying technology that makes Bitcoin a “trustless” and transparent cryptocurrency network.Savvy observers soon realized that blockchain could be used in all sorts of different industries, including finance, real estate and, it turns out, the food industry. One of Ripe.io’s first forays into food was with the Internet of Tomatoes, a collaborative project of Analog Devices and the fast-casual salad franchise Sweetgreen.With the Internet of Tomatoes, Ripe.io set out to use blockchain technology to compile a wealth of data from the farm and apply it to growing a better tomato. Using farmers and sensor machines, the project collected information on everything from temperature to humidity, down to the chemistry reading of a tomato.It turns out what consumers might think of as a relatively simple food, the tomato, can generate a whole lot of information, with what Ramachandran describes as “hundreds and hundreds of data elements that comprise why a tomato turns out the way it does.”A sensor stands in a tomato field at Wards Berry Farm in Sharon, Massachusetts, U.S., on Tuesday,... [+] Oct. 24, 2017. An ex-banker at Wells Fargo & Co. and a former executive at Nasdaq Inc. decided to leave finance to start Ripe.io, which uses blockchain in agriculture, and has big aspirations to weave it through the food supply chain. CREDIT: Photographer: Adam Glanzman/BloombergIt’s not just the data, of course. In the food industry, many food suppliers and producers have internal mechanisms to verify quality, taste and food safety, but what they don’t necessarily have is a way to share that information with the rest of their supply chain. As Harris explains:You have the labs, the distributors, the certification, the food safety, the restaurants...our observation was that they weren’t really connected in any meaningful way [because] the data wasn’t being shared [and there was] very little collaboration.According to Harris, the food industry hasn't gone through a meaningful “digitization event, ” the kind of technological development that entirely transforms an industry. Take, for example, the shift that ultimately enabled consumers to be able to buy a piece of stock in seconds on their smartphone. Harris says you can see it in a number of industries:[It’s] what the internet has done around information-sharing — what we’ve seen companies like Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Spotify and Pandora do for music, books and television. [Digitization takes] interaction with consumers to another level.Blockchain technology could potentially be used to create a whole new level of transparency in the food system. “The data [that’s now] stuck in all the different silos throughout the [food] supply chain [can be brought] together into this magical object that we’ve designed called a food bundle,” explains Harris.That “food bundle” — or bundle of food-related data — can then be shared with all of the participants in the blockchain, which could be a cattle rancher in Texas or a beef buyer for Walmart. “If you’re able to get participation and collaboration from all the farmers, distributors, the people who play a part in all this,” Ramachandran explains, “[you’ll] have better ways to showcase that food.”With partners like Maersk now on board, Ripe.io is looking to take their “blockchain of food” global. Unlike financial services, says Harris, “food doesn’t have a center of gravity.” Ripe.io hopes blockchain can serve companies throughout the food system. “We’ve designed...Ripe.io and its platform, the “blockchain of food,” to serve the entire food industry, says Harris. “From farm to fork, to the ingredients companies [like] meat, fish, dairy, pork, fruits and vegetables.”The potential within the food system seems limitless. In this Millennial-obsessed marketing age, the most obvious application is increased transparency for consumers, of course, as blockchain offers food producers a way to go beyond food labels like “sustainable” or “natural” and provide a whole new level of detail about the food they’re about to purchase.But the technology can be used to increase collaboration within the food system itself, too. Explains Ramachandran,“a lot of the information[-sharing takes place] within the walls of trucks, warehouses [and] refrigeration units.” And Ramachandran was surprised by how eager food producers were to share information. “These companies [you might think] would want to keep those doors sort of closed, it’s actually quite the opposite.”"

However, we often hear stories about young people who struggle to save, are stuck in their parents’ home because they can’t afford a down payment for a property, and don’t have a retirement plan set up. This can lead many people to put off major life decisions, such as starting a family or buying a home. ","Nine members of Forbes Finance Council shared their best financial tips for young people who are just starting to manage their finances so they don’t have to delay major life events. Here’s what they had to say: Nine finance experts give their best advice for managing your finances.1. Plan Ahead You cannot generate funds out of thin air and debt, unless you go bankrupt, will not disappear. The first advice would be to plan ahead wisely in order to avoid running into problems. For example, find accurate information about which academic majors and universities will provide higher returns on investment, and carefully take this data into account when deciding where and what to study. - Gabriele Grego, Quintessential Capital2. Know What You're Getting Into The most important things students should look at are the average salary and benefits that their career choice will bring in. Knowing this will enable them to manage how much debt they can withstand in the first place. If the student can budget so that their total student and credit card debt won’t be more than their first year’s salary, they should be in good shape to save for other life events. - Jared Weitz, United Capital Source Inc.3. Just Say ""No"" There are credit card companies and retailers who often market credit cards to students. Just say ""no"" to them, and don't fill out the application. It's easy to say ""yes"" to friends when they want to take off for the weekend or the summer on a trip. However, if you don't have the money you need to do so, just say ""no."" Spending money is a choice. Taking on debt is a choice. Focus on putting money aside. - David Gass, Anderson Business Advisors, LLC4. Pay Down High-Interest Debt While it can be beneficial to get into the habit of saving for a down payment on a home or putting money aside for retirement, neither should be done at the expense of paying down high-interest debt. Credit card debt in particular can be crippling. Consider utilizing low-interest balance transfer offers to accelerate paying down debt. Just make sure to read the fine print and adhere to the offer terms. - Ismael Wrixen, FE International 5. Be Careful About How You Use Your Credit Card Credit card debt needs to be looked at closely. Credit cards are modern-day necessities but can cause financial ruin if they're not utilized properly. Outside of true unexpected emergencies, credit cards should be paid in full every month. If debt already exists, the only focus should be paying down that balance. The interest rates can be outrageous. - Francesca Federico, Twelve Points 6.Stick To Your Budget Build a budget and stick to it. Don't try to achieve your parents' lifestyle 30 years earlier than they did. Our parents likely reached their goals by living below their means and saving at a young age. You will get there; however, it will not be overnight. Be patient, and know that your dreams are achievable if you chip away at them a little every day. - Justin Goodbread, Heritage Investors 7. Focus On Incremental Change It is easy to get wrapped up in the total amount of debt you have to pay off, and this can be defeating. If you focus on incremental change versus paying off the whole debt, you will be happier and make more progress. Consider how much you can budget without sacrificing all fun, investing and savings, program that into your budget, and set your autopay. As your income rises, incrementally adjust the amounts. - Scott Karstens, NFG Brokerage 8. Think In The Long And Short Term It’s important to think both in the long term and the short term. With expensive debts like student loans, a short-term savings plan is critical for any emergencies or changes to your income. Longer-term retirement vehicles can help you maximize tax advantages and build a nest egg for your future. Either way, start and stay consistent. - Chris Kline, Bitcoin IRA9. Gain Insight Into Your Spending Habits The first step is getting your finances in order by gaining insight into your spending habits. Break down how much you’re spending and on what to better identify changes you need to make to your spending. By looking at a more holistic picture, you can make minor tweaks that will pay off in the long run. - Adam Dell, Clarity Money"

[+] during the forum Digitalization and the New Gilded Age at the World Bank/IMF spring meetings on Wednesday, April 18, 2018, in Washington. ( AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)","Blockchain, the decentralized, secure information technology, is most often associated with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. But almost from the outset, encouraging and entertaining uses have been under consideration and development.But in education, uses for blockchain have been slow to develop, even conceptualize. That may be because education leaders and institutions have developed a reputation as slow adapters to technology, a reputation that’s probably earned in some cases. It may also be because, even though teaching may be becoming less human, learning still entirely is. Another explanation may be that education is about liberally sharing information. For the most part, knowledge is not something we safeguard.Nonetheless, blockchain is probably coming to campus. More accurately, it’s coming after campus.While the Groningen Declaration sounds like something economists throw jello over at the Nobel Prize cafeteria, or maybe the next Bourne sequel, it’s actually an agreement to work toward creating easily accessible, highly transportable and secure education credentials.The idea rests on four pillars.The first is that accessing transcripts, the existing records of academic achievement, is labor intensive and takes time. The second is that a transcript has limited information, usually only a course title and a grade. Third, with personal and population mobility, accessing academic records with common standards, any time and in any place will be essential. And finally, there’s an assumption that, going forward, learning won’t end when you graduate high school or college, it will be a life-long endeavor of upgrading job skills and staying current with evolving technology.For that last purpose, ongoing education is likely to cross institutions, geography and significant amounts of time. If, for example, three years ago you paid for, went to, and completed a program in computer coding at Dev Bootcamp, which closed in 2017, showing that accomplishment to an employer or future education provider could be a challenge.So, the theory is, future education credentials will need to hold more information, be accessible by many people while being both secure and verifiable – things that seem well suited for a blockchain-type solution.So far, nearly 100 schools and education organizations around the world, including about 40 in the United States, have signed on to Groningen. American signers include Duke, Johns Hopkins, Stanford and the University of Texas, Austin.Earlier this year, the Groningen conference in Paris featured multiple presentations specifically on blockchain. One presentation was by “Blockchain in Education” – a group assembled at the University of Groningen to run an ongoing pilot with 20 international college students using blockchain to access and verify their credentials. MIT (MIT Media Lab) has already developed mobile credential storage app called Blockcerts and used it, in 2017, to issue blockchain-secure digital diplomas to graduates of some of their programs. And one college, the University of Nicosia (UNIC) in Cyprus, is already offering full blockchain credentials for all their programs.But progress, while ongoing, is likely to remain slow and patchy because creating a global, blockchain-based academic and educational credential system is not easy. Political considerations and credential standardization concerns are real.  There are technical impediments too.In just one example, according to recent analysis by Merija Jirgensons and Janis Kapenieks of Riga Technical University in Latvia, different places can’t agree on the particular type of blockchain technology to use. “The Europeans, especially in the UK, have preferred Ethereum; while the Americans have opted for the bitcoin blockchain,” the report found. “Most states in the EU are planning blockchain strategies to fit national agendas, and most employ the Ethereum blockchain.” The MIT Blockcerts application, for example, “…  is currently unavailable for Ethereum,” the technology most under government development in Europe. (Post-publication note: Blockcerts does now support Ethereum blockchain.).If global standardization is a goal, that level of discontent with between cultures with similar education structures and standards is a really bad sign.Add to those complications, the reality that blockchain itself is not yet consumer-ready in most cases. Consider this description of the MIT Blockcerts process from the Riga Technical University report,After the wallet has been downloaded, algorithms automatically generate the public / private key combinations which are a series of digital codes. The private key is used to generate the user’s cryptographic signature (really a digital ID) needed to verify each transaction. Now the Blockcerts wallet is available on Apple’s iTunes and Google Play, but not the Blockcert itself that is issued by the university. Next, the student sends the public key to MIT that makes a digital record of it and returns a hash string of numbers to the student as verification of the authenticity of the diploma. The diploma itself is sent later by e-mail as a JSON file (JavaScript Object Notation file) on which the student’s public key information is inscribed. The private key in the student’s possession verifies the authenticity of the diploma. However, an employer or another university may seek to further verify the authenticity of the diploma by checking the MIT verification portal …”Frankly, that doesn’t sound all that much better than simply using a “verification portal” to request a paper copy of your transcript or diploma.Still, the promise for blockchain in academic and education credentials is real, it has momentum and it’s almost certainly going to happen. The only open questions are when and how universal it will be."

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer, digital cash system that was built on blockchain technology. However, blockchain can keep track of much more than just money. Point number two is that blockchain is a new way for people to make all kinds of deals, not just financial ones. Media websites, including Forbes, are using it to distribute content.  Players in sectors as far ranging as digital rights management, financial services, global supply chain, government, and healthcare are among those already developing products and services using blockchain. The business value-added of blockchain will grow to slightly more than $176 billion by 2025 and will exceed $3.1 trillion by 2030, according to Gartner, a research and advisory firm. (The methodology used to forecast business value quantifies the value of technology innovation rather than the dollars spent on it.)  The potential impact of blockchain has been compared to that of the internet. “Blockchain has the ability to create new models and to transform existing business,” said Nicole Hamilton, managing director, TechHub at Springboard Enterprises. She is organizing its latest accelerator program, the ""Business of Blockchain"" Commercialization Lab. The third point made by Zomorodi is that blockchain requires a collective spirit — lots of people and computers working together. No one controls the network. Yet, it’s a faster, safer way to verify information and establish trust. “Selecting the appropriate consensus protocol is vital to enabling distributed trust within a decentralized business network,” said Sharon LaDay, blockchain ecosystem leader at IBM and a member of Springboard’s Business of Blockchain executive committee. “Blockchain is one of the key pieces of infrastructure,” explained Lance Koonce, a partner at the Davis Wright Tremaine, a law firm. He leads its cross-disciplinary blockchain practice and is also on Springboard’s Business of Blockchain executive committee. “As such, we need voices with a wide range of perspectives helping make the big decisions about how to frame out this brave new world.” Diversity breeds innovation. Creativity doesn’t just happen. It is the result of making unexpected connections based on things we already know. That’s why life experiences are so important. Without diversity of experience, knowledge and thinking brought to solving a problem, solutions are limited. Female founders are critical to ensuring that products and services built using blockchain are as disruptive and transformative as the hype promises. “There will be hiccups along the way as this technology rolls out,” said Jalak Jobanputra in The Observer. She heads Springboard’s Business of Blockchain executive committee. She is also a founding partner of FuturePerfect Ventures, an early stage venture capital fund in NYC that focuses on next-generation technology, such as blockchain and machine learning. For example, key to success are expert guides who can help founders navigate the evolving regulatory landscape of cryptocurrency, digital assets and distributed ledger technology around the world. The Business of Blockchain helps women-led, seed-to-Series-A stage companies avoid hiccups as they build businesses using blockchain as a core technology. In 2000, Springboard became the first accelerator program to support high-potential women entrepreneurs. Since then, its 730 portfolio companies have raised $8.6 billion, completed 186 successful exits — including 17 IPOs — and 82% are still in business. Springboard’s secret sauce is its 5,000-person network that educates, coaches, showcases and supports high-growth women entrepreneurs seeking equity capital for expansion. The Business of Blockchain was designed by blockchain entrepreneurs who wanted a way to flatten the learning curve for next generation of founders and provide access to industry experts and funders, explained Hamilton. How will you educate yourself about the ways blockchain can transform your business model?"

There are currently more than 50 projects being managed by ConsenSys, many of which are in the financial sector.Lubin says he met DrumG co-founder Tim Grant when he was still the CEO of R3’s Lab and Research Center, helping build out business use cases for the nascent distributed ledger consortium. Over the years the two frequented many of the same events, and about nine months ago the potential that they might work together first came to be seriously discussed. Then, on August 27, 2017, DrumG was formally incorporated in Bermuda, and the conversations started to get increasingly serious. As of today, DrumG—named after the street Grant grew up on in West Central Scotland—has 20 employees in London, New York, Singapore and Bermuda and will use today's investment to complete and expand multiple ongoing tools.As a result of the close ties to ethereum and R3's Corda distributed ledger, DrumG will initially focus on the two platforms, with as many as 10 blockchains to be added soon. To help enterprises better understand how such a wide range of blockchains might help them create the most efficient system in any industry, DrumG has built a database of what Grant calls 50 blockchain “dimensions."" The metrics of those dimension are then used to generate benchmarks that compare the potential value added or saved by different platforms.DrumG also has a provisional U.S. patent on technology designed to standardize the way its clients talk about business workflows, turning those standardized processes into what Grant called “business protocols"" that can then be sold at what he hopes will be a fraction of the total that middlemen currently charge. DrumG isn't currently generating revenue, and will also use the investment to finalize two projects nearing completing.Specifically, DrumG is preparing to launch the Titanium Network, a decentralized and cryptographically secured database for information about over the counter (OTC) investment bank trading and valuations. Currently such OTC data-sharing requires that firms give their information to trusted third parties that then compare it with competing firms and generate insights based on the aggregated data. Those third-party firms then sell the consensus insights back to very same companies that created the data.Instead, the Titanium Network cuts out those middleman by moving anonymized transaction data to a permissioned version of the etherum blockchain and generating the same insights using automated processes. Built in partnership with Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, the platform will be demoed at this year's Sibos conference in Australia and is expected to go live in Q2 of next year.Grant says DrumG is also building a second unnamed platform for clients including large hedge funds, prime brokers and fund administrators looking to replace the complicated post-trade services they currently use to reconcile their portfolios. Instead, the DrumG solution will rely on R3's Corda distributed ledger to nearly instantly record stock trades and more.But either one of these project alone is only half a solution, according to Grant. “The real goal for us, is that somewhere down the line those networks should be able to interoperate. They should be able to work together.”Breaking down the borders within the super-competitive blockchain landscape won’t be easy. Gone are the early days of blockchain idealism, when competitors lived by the mantra ""All ships rise"" and focused almost exclusively on the current broken financial system as the biggest competitor.As Grant puts it, the current system, dominated by financial middlemen and centralized authorities, is “duct-taped together,” and if blockchain builders don't figure out how to work together, they run the risk of creating entirely new infrastructures with entirely different inefficiencies.With traditional financial centers like the United States showing a reluctance to create new regulatory paradigms for the technology, Grant says he sought advice from global accounting giant EY before finally settling in Bermuda. To help blockchain innovators work in multiple competing jurisdictions, the tiny British territory in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean earlier this year enacted the Digital Asset Business Act to explicitly frame regulatory requirements for a wide range of blockchain use cases. DrumG co-founder Tim Grant moderating a panel with Bermuda Premier David Burt and ConsenSys CEO Joe ... [+] Lubin. (October 1, 2018)Then, today, Bermuda premier and minister of finance David Burt joined Grant and Lubin on stage at the Hamilton Princess’s Harbourview Ballroom in Bermuda to formally announce the partnership and discuss its potential impact on the global and local economies. A recent report by the Bermuda Business Development Agency estimated that $286,000 in value will be generated on the island by every blockchain job created.Excerpt from the Bermuda Fintech Strategy report by the Bermuda Monetary Authority.“Bermuda is setting the standards for fintech businesses and offers a sophisticated, modern and well-regulated jurisdiction where innovators can bring their ideas to life,” said Premier Burt, in a statement sent to Forbes. “We look forward to following DrumG Technologies as it leads the way.”While DrumG has certainly emerged from stealth in style with its Series A investment from a widely respected blockchain leader, and two live projects approaching completion, it has some serious competition. Earlier this year former Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas left Ripple to found Coil, another distributed ledger production house aimed at helping companies build using the Interledger blockchain interoperability tool and the XRP crytpocurrency.Also this year, venture capital firm Boldstart Ventures helped launch mState to invest in enterprise blockchain projects. MState’s first investment, in New York-based Blockdaemon, is designed to give its clients point-and-click deployment of applications powered by Bitcoin, Ethereum, Stellar, Aion, Corda, Hyperledger Fabric, Multichain and Quorum.Not only does Grant say he’s not worried about such competition, he says it’s a crucial aspect of replatforming the world’s financial infrastructure on a web of blockchain solutions. If the ""All ships rise"" mentality is left to the dustbins of blockchain history, Grant hopes a new one will emerge, ""convergence.""“Ultimately, this is all going to converge,” said Grant. “The tribalism will dissipate, the walled gardens will come down and a big question is who is going to remain and in what state? Now, nobody knows the answer to that, but we know that if you don’t look forward and start to prepare for it in some meaningful way, the chances are you’ll be left behind.”"

[+] in Washington last week, saying that blockchain has years to go before it has significant benefits for consumers and investors. Photo credit Michael Nagle/Bloomberg","Blockchain and other fintech innovations probably won't have big, everyday impacts on consumers for at least a handful of years, financial leaders were told in Washington last week.At conferences for SIFMA, the securities industry trade group, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, speakers were pretty much in agreement that fintech’s promises will take years to become everyday realities.“[Blockchain/distributed ledger technology] is not as impactful as the hype,” asserted Bank of America Chief Operations and Technology Officer Cathy Bessant at the SIFMA annual conference.She pointed to DLT as a promising technology waiting for proven benefits for consumers, businesses and regulators to cash in.She noted it’s still pretty much in the labs.“There’s nothing at scale now. It’s untested and untried,” said Bessant, who is widely regarded as one of the most powerful women in business.She also addressed the discussion surrounding artificial intelligence.“Nothing makes me crazier than when someone says AI is better than human intelligence. It is a subset of human intelligence,” complained the high-level Bank of America executive.Robo advice is another fintech innovation that hasn’t blossomed, JPMorgan Asset Management Chief Executive Officer of Asset Management Christopher Willcox said during the week in Washington.“Robo advisor technology has a long way to go,” argued Wilcox.He compared the current limitations of robo advice to Amazon at in its early stages where the only thing the technology could help a consumer to do was to get a book.During the SIFMA and CFTC meetings, fintech was often called so nebulous it can get in the way of discussions about the impact technology can and could have on finance.CFTC Chief Innovation Officer and LabCFTC Director Daniel Gorfine said the trend is to drop the soup-to-nuts term “fintech” and speak about the specifics.But even a concept more specific like a “sandbox” to let fintech entrepreneurs experiment without initial stringent regulatory oversight.If a sandbox is a system that lets fintech creators have an open door to discuss their plans with regulators, then Securities and Exchange Commission  Senior Advisor for Digital Assets and Innovation, Valerie Szczepanik said the SEC has a sandbox.Businesses will have to grapple with in bringing fintech to its full potential is integrating it with their long established and relied upon systems, said Fidelity technology executive Sanjiv Mirchandani.“Technology layers on top of each other. The old never goes away,” said Mirchandani.One factor propelling fintech is pressure from the financial crisis for financial companies to reduce costs, World Bank Group innovation executive Sharmista Appaya said during the week’s events.CFTC Commissioner Rostin Behnam said two hurdles fintech faces are the status quo generally works pretty well and businesses have a considerable amount of money and employee training invested in the current infrastructure.Another hurdle pointed out CFTC LabCFTC Attorney Brian Trackman is people are much more forgiving when a human makes a mistake than when a machine or AI does.With all of the advertised promises of fintech, there is an undercurrent of unease by the public about the flood of new and potentially privacy invasive technology, Citi Global Head of Fintech Policy for Global Consumer Banking Andres Wolberg-Stok acknowledged.“The problem is not doing so much behind the scenes it looks creepy to consumers,” he said.Likewise, new CFTC Commissioner Dan Berkovitz said he is finding technology difficult to fathom as a consumer as well as a regulator.Back at the agency since leaving five years ago as general counsel, Berkovitz finds he now has to contend with his three new phone numbers and five new passwords.“I’m having trouble with that,” he admitted.Taking an overview on fintech, both CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo and Comptroller of the Currency Chief Innovation Officer Beth Knickerbocker said reaching consensus among regulators is key to boosting blockchain, cryptocurrency, AI and other emerging financial technologies.But while consensus building is underway, they acknowledged the destination has yet to be reached.Within the SEC, Szczepanik said consensus on fintech oversight among the agency’s divisions will be as important as coordination with other regulators."

following the inception of Bitcoin, banks had little to say about them.","Oct 5, 2018,11:44am EDT",Should Banks Be More Open To Cryptocurrencies?,"The jury is still out on cryptocurrency. In the first several years following the inception of Bitcoin, banks had little to say about them. More recently, however, as cryptocurrencies have come to regularly dominate the news agenda and have become of interest to a much wider consumer audience, banks have had to decide where they stand.The risks associated with cryptocurrencies have been well documented. Their dramatic volatility is what sets cryptocurrencies apart from any other currency or asset as an investment. As volatility is one of the primary risks for banks, it’s understandable why many aren’t allowing their customers to use credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies in the hope their investment would appreciate in value. The risk for the banks is that if their customers were to see a drop in value of their currency, they could be unable to pay the bank back for the credit or for outstanding loans.Banks are also citing security as another reason for their reluctance to embrace cryptocurrencies. Since cryptocurrencies have gone mainstream, there has been a string of high-profile cases in which customers have lost their currency in widespread hacking attacks. Other allegations have claimed that the anonymity that cryptocurrencies afford the user is facilitating their involvement in money laundering and fraudulent schemes.
It is easy to see why banks are reluctant to embrace cryptocurrencies with such a high number of potential challenges but there is a prospective solution to these types of problems: regulation. Last month the UK’s Treasury Committee described the crypto-landscape as a ‘Wild West’ in desperate need of regulation, but also suggested that such regulations could position the UK as a hub for cryptocurrency trading and development. Regulation would remedy many of the issues that banks are currently facing, encouraging safe development of the crypto-space to the mutual benefit of consumers and institutions.Cyber-attacks where users have lost currency have occurred when funds are held by centralized exchanges, not by the individual owners themselves. The imposition of legislation around cryptocurrency storage is likely to encourage education among crypto-owners about the safest and more secure way to store digital assets.In fact, the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies, blockchain, is extremely valuable to banks in its immutable and interoperable nature. It is one of the most secure technologies that has ever been developed which means it can be profoundly useful in preventing money laundering and fraud. Every instance of transferred funds is recorded on the blockchain, meaning that, essentially, a flow of money can be tracked at any stage, making it extremely difficult for criminals to use cryptocurrencies as a means of laundering dirty money. With supporting legislation and regulation to ensure that cryptocurrency owners are being monitored in the same way as regular asset owners, blockchain-based currencies could eventually have a profound impact in reducing the success of organized fraud.There is no straightforward answer to whether banks should be more embracive towards cryptocurrencies. There are potential risks just as there are potential benefits, and the truth is they just haven’t been around long enough for us to understand them fully. As a sector dominated by old and traditional institutions, the finance sector would be wrong to stifle innovation by rejecting cryptocurrencies, but it will need safeguards in place. The future of finance should certainly involve cryptocurrencies, but for them to be genuinely valuable they will need to be regulated like any other kind of asset."

Some states even declare their intention to introduce a cryptocurrency, such as the Venezuelan Petro[1] based on that nation's oil reserves. However, Blockchain, the key technology behind  Bitcoin and other similar cryptocurrencies, gets noticeably less attention, which is an oversight: after all, it has countless practical applications that are just as important as cryptocurrencies.Safety and ResiliencePrior to the Blockchain era, information was digitally stored either in some scattered files or in centralized databases (DB). The former is cheap and simple, but it is the latter approach that makes it easier to find the required information within a mass of data.Traditionally, all sorts of sensitive data, first and foremost corporate and banking data, was accumulated and used as part of a database, since centralization makes it much easier to monitor and manage information. But there is a problem: it makes it easier to hack and compromise data.On multiple occasions in recent years, we have learned about the leaks of a wide variety of information: medical (from the servers of hospitals and insurance companies), financial (from banks and stock exchanges), and simply private (from cloud storage and from the private pages of social networks). By intercepting control over the centralized databases, intruders can exploit our data for financial gain [2].At the same time, any rank and file citizen who simply wants to open a bank account, in order to have legitimate access to part of the bank's DB relating to their transactions, is obliged to undergo a number of peremptory checks and in addition make a deposit into this account. While the world economy remained essentially centralized, this did not bother anyone. However, today, in a post-industrial society with distributed patterns of employment and income, the attitude toward classical databases has completely changed.And here, Blockchain could not have come at a better time. A distributed, cryptographically-secure transaction ledger is resistant to falsification attempts: it is impossible to replace any entries in it without gaining control over 50% +1 of miners, or the people with computers that validate transactions. The blockchain is widely accessible to general users; it has an extremely gentle learning curve: all one has to do is download and install its client.  Finally, the Blockchain's decentralized nature guarantees the accessibility of information stored in it in case of an emergency or deliberate shutdown of a significant part of the computers, on which this distributed ledger is deployed.The principle of “security through obscurity” is customary for those operating in financial and banking spheres. The less outsiders know about the status of a given account or about the transactions it is engaged in, the more peace of mind its owner has. However, there is no such thing as absolute security through obscurity. With the Internet now all pervasive in every aspect of private, public and business life, the very idea that some data can even theoretically be hidden from an immodest eye has faded.But if data leaks cannot be prevented, could it be easier, instead, to conduct business as openly as possible, verifying one's transactions with the help of Blockchain? Here one's privacy is protected by the distributed ledger customer anonymity, whereas all transactions between the customers are absolutely open and verified by a chain of transactions that are protected from tampering and falsification.Openness is the Best DefenseIt is this feature of the Blockchain that renders unnecessary a large layer of intermediaries who not only confirm and record money transfers from one account to another today but are de facto controllers of financial flows. A bank or a stock exchange can be forced, for instance, to execute some sanctions announced by one state to another. A distributed ledger, on the other hand, cannot be forced to do so, unless you completely block access to the Internet for the country under sanctions.One hundred percent credibility of the voting process is one of democracy’s cornerstones. The count and verification of the voting results take a long time, while the reliability of this process often gives rise to criticism, especially when voting is conducted through digital tools rather than voting papers. While guaranteeing the preservation of each voter’s anonymity, the Blockchain simultaneously generates a transparent register of votes, extremely resistant to falsification attempts and easily verifiable. Many experts suggest this particular method for organizing the forthcoming midterm elections to the US Congress in November[3].‘Smart’ contracts are one of the most significant areas of Blockchain applications. The distributed ledger has the capacity to store objective records on the history of interaction between suppliers of goods and services and their customers. Cryptographically-signed reviews of a particular company, which are immune to subsequent falsification, will force businesses to provide communications in a completely different way.According to the World Bank statistics[4], 2 billion adult residents around the world are unbanked, which means they do not have access to traditional financial services. This is because the provision of such services is based on traditional technologies and requires a potential client to have at least an identity card and the opportunity to reach a bank branch. The blockchain is an excellent means of combating both banking inequality, and the inability to effectively help the less fortunate through regular money transfers. Funds sent by philanthropists to countries wracked by poverty, wars, or natural disasters often get stolen or spent without proper supervision. To counter this, a large UK bank, Barclays, has made a decision to use Bitcoin as an alternative payment solution for charity.Real World ExamplesIn 2017 fintech startup Humaniq joined Rised, created by Barclays. The Humaniq platform intends to provide financial and educational services to these unbanked people around the world and Africa in particular: the continent suffering most from wars and natural disasters. Support for the economic activities of the residents of remote and poverty-stricken areas will be ensured by providing them access to a peer-to-peer financial platform implementing the Ethereum Blockchain for payments and smart contracts, as well as biometric technologies for paperless participant identification[5].The unbanked around the world will be able to connect to this platform using the Humaniq. The Humaniq smartphone App application that is already available in 22 African countries and has more than 450 000 users. Based on the Hybrid Blockchain, this application allows one to not only exchange cryptocurrency payments and certify smart contracts directly from one's mobile, but also to communicate in chats and verify the identities of project participants using features available on any Android phone.In other developments, IBM, along with some major food producers and retail networks launched[6] the development of a Blockchain solution that would make it possible to monitor farm produce all the way from production to the counter. By scanning the QR code on a package through a special application, consumers will be able to see the conditions in which a product was made, when and how it was processed, in what way and in what conditions it was delivered to the store. The latter is especially important for chilled fish, for example, a distributed ledger with check marks from suppliers and receivers will help make sure that at no stage of delivery it was frozen.Bright Future?Rather yes than no. The future of the Blockchain as a basis of a new distributed economy is not expected to be entirely trouble-free, of course. For example, to reliably exclude the very possibility of an attack on the distributed ledger, its wide distribution is essential, and when the network is in its infancy, it is vulnerable to attacks aiming at the interception of control (those 50% +1 clients mentioned earlier).However, while traditional financial instruments will clearly continue to coexist with cryptocurrencies for a long time, a reasonable alternative to Blockchain simply does not exist[7]. Too many things around us are becoming ‘smart’ and communications are getting too decentralized to justify data storage in classic DB management systems any longer. Which means that those who will introduce first and master Blockchain-based solutions in the most diverse areas of the economy, finance and life, in general, will have a huge advantage.References[1] This Is Why The Venezuela Cryptocurrency Matters — https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmarkman/2018/03/20/this-is-why-the-venezuela-cryptocurrency-matters/[2] Your PayPal account can be hacked more quickly than you think — https://bgr.com/2016/01/04/paypal-account-security-hackers/[3] Is Blockchain Technology the Future of Voting? https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-10/is-blockchain-technology-the-future-of-voting[4] 2 Billion: Number of Adults Worldwide Without Access to Formal Financial Services http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/video/2016/03/10/2-billion-number-of-adults-worldwide-without-access-to-formal-financial-services[5] Financial-Inclusion Startup Humaniq Joins the Rise Community After Raising $3.9M ICO https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/financial-inclusion-startup-humaniq-joins-the-rise-community-after-raising-39m-ico-619879493.html[6] IBM Forges Blockchain Collaboration With Nestlé & Walmart In Global Food Safety https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogeraitken/2017/08/22/ibm-forges-blockchain-collaboration-with-nestle-walmart-for-global-food-safety/[7] How blockchains could change the world https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/how-blockchains-could-change-the-world"

(Source:... [+] Czech Philharmonic).","“Software is eating the world,” as Marc Andreessen, co-founder of one of the top venture capital firms in Silicon Valley, once stated in 2011. Though talking then about a bubble in the stock market, today a new bubble - around cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum over recent years - it is hard not to imagine that if such growth is to continue it will probably need the blockchain to eat the software that ate the world. Well, that is one thought.But the gap between the exuberance of blockchain’s potential and the arrival of a decentralized world economy is still a pretty wide one. And, one that requires breakthroughs in the foundational layer of the technology - including new consensus algorithms, on-chain scalability and transactional privacy guarantees to name a few. Still, most mortals would probably view this all as akin to a minority sport - and who would blame them.Digital applications and services though have nevertheless become integral to everyone’s day-to-day activities. Just take the average person who accesses around nine different applications and spends around 10 hours in front of screens each and every day. Industries and businesses have also been increasing their adoption of various cloud-based applications. Challenging to handle or what?
The upshot is that it all adds to the number of interfaces users have to work with and this negatively impacts their user experiences.Indeed, proving a point about the tsunami of data confronting workers according to a recent study by the OTRS Group, over 80% of employees look for information for half an hour a day and almost a third (32%) say they need an average of one hour a day just to sort their emails.And, having to work across several applications fragments the user experience and impedes workflow. Constantly having to switch contexts can hamper productivity. Now while it is supposedly possible to link and integrate apps, not all services allow this - especially if they are produced by rival application developers.In addition, not everyone has the capacity and resources to get “feature-rich” and streamlined enterprise systems. Even managing different subscriptions and accounts could already be quite an undertaking. It is enough to make one positively dizzy.Decentralized Applications - DAppsAcross the globe a new breed of applications are now being discussed, which are types of applications that are not owned by anyone. These new types of applications are referred to as Decentralized Applications or DApps for short. The technology underpinning them is the blockchain, also known distributed ledger technology (DLT).And, with something like software orchestration, a term ordinary fold might well find challenging, the main issue is clearly people getting their heads around the model. Indeed, as Dr John Bates, a recognized fintech pioneer and CEO of testing automation firm Eggplant that has some 600 clients around the globe, says: “It is clear that we definitely need frameworks to make this as easy to access and consume as the current centralized Internet.”Bates, who holds a PhD from Cambridge University and is a serial entrepreneur under companies like SAP and Software AG, commenting on the landscape said: “Clearly DApps address something that many libertarian-minded folks regard as a shortcoming of the current Internet: the need for centralized services. Social media and news managed centrally can be censored and controlled. A peer-to-peer system based on DApps cannot be censored.""He further ventured: “Centralized services, like eBay or Uber, can lead to monopolies. DApps could perhaps mean e-commerce goes back to a local barter system - where I can run my own Uber with my car for my local area or perhaps sell my goods locally through a network of trusted nodes. And, DApps fits as a model for autonomous connected vehicles, devices and robots in the new Internet of Things (IoT) era.”Fortunately, it is now possible to create application hybrids using application programming interfaces (APIs). Services like IFTTT, the free way to get all your apps and devices talking to each other, already allows users to automate tasks and creates a smoother experience across popular apps.Given though that not everything on the Internet plays nice, IFTTT posit that they are on a “mission to build a more connected world.”Eleanor Matthews, co-Founder and MD of Work Futures and a graduate of Oxford University’s Blockchain Strategy Programme, commenting said: “Addressing this interoperability issue is crucial for driving adoption of DApps. It makes sense that an orchestration platform should offer that integration - in the same way that IFTTT does for non-blockchain based apps.”The DAO was a huge hack, which cost around $70 million. It was based on a bug in a decentralized application. “Because these apps are self-executing,"" noted Matthews. ""There is a major risk in the case of an inherent, invisible bug. Introducing an IFTTT-style integration layer, that allows even more autonomy in the way that the apps are initiated, increases this risk.”The more transactions are being executed on the blockchain, the more it will slow down. Speed on Ethereum is currently fifteen transactions per second. There are new protocols such as EOS, which also includes smart contract functionality and could be used to develop DApps, and which is claiming 5,000 transactions per second (TPS). But this is disputed by some in certain quarters.Blockchain & Decentralized AppsIn the case of blockchain services and decentralized applications (DApps), however, similar integrations are currently limited. Interoperability among DApps is often constrained to those built on the same blockchain network. And, new ways of orchestration are also needed.While full “cross-chain” interoperability is currently a work in progress, there may be some light at the end of the tunnel.  Blockchain framework Ark, for example, has been advancing in making interoperability available to developers. Elsewhere, a decentralized application framework like Cardstack that raised $35 million in its ICO earlier this year in June, describes itself as the “experience layer” of the decentralized Internet, and allows users to create their own Dapp-driven workflows.Ark, which raised just shy of $1 million via an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of Ark tokens back in 2016 that comprised 1,279.67 Bitcoin (BTC), was labelled a Lisk-forked cryptocurrency intended for “broad consumer adoption.” Its roadmap at the time of their ICO included the ability to transact across blockchains, a smartcard as a means of payment and IPFS integration.As an open-source framework and consensus protocol, Cardstack claims to make blockchains usable and scalable for the mass market, and posited in a whitepaper that it believes that “orchestrating cohesive user experiences across blockchain and the cloud is essential to bringing decentralization to the mass market.”They are proposing a new economic model for funding and sustaining the software that runs the world, which distributes rewards fairly among the creators of the software and the open-source communities supporting them. So, in such a decentralized software market, a buyer of applications enters into a direct deal via smart contracts, which coordinate a diverse network of software development teams, cloud hosting providers as well as app coin-backed protocols.Decentralization Is In...The decentralization movement is gaining traction due to concerns arising from the way centralized services handle their business. Companies like Facebook and Google simply have too much control and users little choice concerning the terms imposed by these services.Google has faced criticism given how one-sided its advertising and monetization terms can be. This matter is also further complicated by issues like breaches and data misuse. We only have to look to the scandal involving Facebook over Cambridge Analytica for that. And, when these situations occur, users are often the ones left at a disadvantage.It is argued too that thanks to the blockchain/DLT boom, users have now started to turn towards DApps as alternatives to these services. Decentralized services promise to give control back to users through transparent rules, data ownership and anonymity. Token economies that govern these DApps also provide equitable fee and rewards structures that can foster harmony across users.Many DApps, however, have yet to successfully launch or at least gain significant adoption. Clearly something must be done to further drive their adoption, if progress is to be made....And A Need For Interoperability This sluggishness in adoption has been partly due to the lack of interoperability across DApps. Most blockchain services and DApps are built to focus on a specific purpose or be oriented at serving a particular vertical. The reality, especially for ordinary users, is that computing needs are varied. Users may need to use several DApps in order to cover their needed functionalities.Unlike conventional apps, which now have support for integration with other apps, blockchain interoperability is still lacking. For instance, a DApps built on Ethereum will not be able to readily interact with a DApps say running on NEO.Fortunately though the community has acknowledged this need for interoperability, since part of what has made conventional apps successful is interoperability. And, DApps must have it too.For its part, Ark has been cited as being one of the major efforts working on letting other projects function across chains. Conceptually it can be thought of as a “blockchain for blockchains.”Through Ark’s SmartBridge technology, developers will be able to build applications, which could listen to and be triggered by external events and exchange data with other DApps built on different blockchains.Ark is also built to be decentralized. The project is further envisioned to support a wider set of programming languages, which allows developers to be readily functional in working with the framework.With the release of its V2 Core, the project also implemented what it has claimed are “dynamic fee structures” to keep the platform accessible amidst the crypto market’s volatility. It is suggested that these should only encourage more developers to consider building interoperable DApps using Ark.Focus On ExperienceOrdinary users, however, are not expected to fiddle about with highly technical frameworks in order to be able to maximize the various functionalities that DApps can offer. Easy-to-use orchestration, where users can effortlessly customize how DApps interact with each other, must be made available if more progress is to be made.Chris Tse, the Founder of Cardstack, a decentralized application (DApp) framework like Cardstack... [+] allows users to create their own DApp-driven workflows. (Source: Cardstack).Chris Tse, founder of Cardstack, shared recently that the DApp space must be able to: “Establish a flexible design paradigm that is able to orchestrate all the moving parts in the blockchain world. Parity with traditional, single-function apps is not enough. The new crypto-economy is going to demand complex interactions between user-initiated messages, value barring tokens, and interlinked smart contracts, as well as integration with existing systems.”He added: “We need a cohesive user experience (UX) with the fluidity of a consumer social network, while facilitating structured transactions like a line-of-business system.”As such, orchestration framework Cardstack seeks to bring about wider adoption of DApps and decentralization by focusing on user experience. It allows users to create personalized workflows by “chaining” the functionalities provided by various services. It can draw information from various data sources, listen to changes, and send commands to these services.Cohesive User ExperiencesGiven that their model is based on blockchain technology, we can break down the silos of apps defining the tech world today, in order to produce a so-called Cohesive User Experience (CUE), which establishes a flexible design paradigm that can orchestrate all the moving parts in the user’s digital life.“With the fluidity of token-backed applications, we can move beyond the one-icon-per-app business arrangement of the current mobile and cloud world,” they state in their whitepaper. “Yet, for blockchain-backed applications to gain mass market adoption, we need to bridge the gap between the power of blockchains and the convenience of the cloud.”The platform is also facilitated by a token economy. Users can spend CARD tokens to add DApps and services into their workflows. These integrations are governed by smart contracts, which take care of subscriptions or utility token use. Users may also be rewarded with CARD tokens for contributions to the platform.Essentially, Cardstack touts that it will enable the creation of “super” DApps by acting as a hub for interoperability across APIs and blockchains.And, eventually part of the goal is to have these various functionalities being deployed using open-source standards - meaning that users will be able to change, customize, as well as adopt these various powerful functionalities and accommodate them to their workflows. This community-driven progression could truly promote decentralization, it is proclaimed by industry protagonists in the space.Collective StrengthDApps do not have to exist in isolation. The value each DApp brings to users can increase as it works alongside other DApps to help solve more complex problems. Efforts like Ark and Cardstack could help showcase DApps’ usefulness at a practical level. And, as more users start adopting these interoperable DApps, the more decentralization can be brought towards relevance. Well, that is the theory.The benefits of interoperability and automation go beyond productivity and usability. Users get to participate in a tech landscape where decentralization reigns. Control is given back to users, challenging the current approaches that are built to push the corporate agenda. Through such mechanisms, it would then be potentially possible for users to enjoy computing that is not constrained by the monopolies of centralized services. It's a brave new world out there. Carpe diem."

Network, people who own vehicles or the charging stations on the ...","Oct 30, 2018,12:00pm EDT",Autonomous vehicles,"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are on the verge of completely revolutionizing the way we think about the transportation of both goods and people. In order to help usher in this new way of doing things, the DAV foundation has built a network which can not only connect cars to cars or drones to drones, but can link together any and all autonomous vehicles including cars, trucks, rovers, and drones, along with the vital infrastructure needed to make them work. This includes mapping software and services such as charging outlets.I spoke to John Frazer, an Ethereum Foundation veteran who is now involved as CCO of the Decentralized Autonomous Vehicles Foundation on the topic and he provided a brief overview of this interesting project:“We acknowledge that reaching full machine autonomy for vehicles will take time. The DAV network also supports discovery, communications, and transactions involving manned vehicles. We recognized at the outset that there will always be a slice of the market that would insist on human supervision and intervention, whether that involved drones, or rovers, or road vehicles or marine vehicles”, Frazer explained.DAV logoThrough the DAV Network, people who own vehicles or the charging stations on the network are paid for the services that they can provide their peers. By leveraging this peer-to-peer system, users on the network have access to an expansive system of AVs and infrastructure which can take them anywhere or bring them anything. DAV is laying the foundation for a decentralized transportation infrastructure that will have built-in incentives for all the different participants: consumers, businesses, software developers, hardware makers, maintenance providers, insurers, and arbitrators.The introduction of blockchain technology across a wide array of industries has altered the way many key decision makers approach recognizing and exchanging value. Industry-specific applications built on top of blockchain technology have the capacity to create new ecosystems where value can be exchanged in a secure and immutable manner. DAV is taking this one step further by applying the principle of a peer-to-peer value exchange to the transfer of physical things connected to the transportation sector, leveraging both the blockchain and emerging technology of smart contracts to allow secure interactions where no parties need to worry about trust.A system of this nature is important to ensure that the larger industry players like Tesla, Uber, or Alphabet do not end up with a virtual monopoly over the growing Internet of Transportation. Vertical integration of all vehicles and infrastructure under one company does not currently look like a viable outcome as the industry is already too large. A decentralized network, or a commons, will allow innovators and companies to integrate their solutions into a greater whole, without the level of investment that the tech giants have access to,Encouraging experimentation and innovation in emerging sectors is a vital component for their success, and increasing the number of companies making viable contributions to the space maximizes the potential avenues for where the next big breakthrough in mapping, fuelling, or safety will come from. A decentralized network with multiple players developing the best possible solutions for every aspect around mobility gives them the best solutions the chance to rise to prominence without these companies needing to develop parallel infrastructures individually. Blockchain technology is vital to this kind of arrangement, as it registers and secures the wealth of data that the interactions between disparate moving parts inevitably creates.A decentralized network can be used as an ecosystem of connected component parts. By removing gatekeepers like administrators approving transactions, it becomes necessary for vehicles themselves to interact with charging stations and other vital infrastructure. One such application of this would be if several organizations have their own separate fleets of ride-hailing vehicles. Despite this being a traditionally “siloed” system, they can use the infrastructure that the network provides without interfering with each other. This is beneficial for the vehicle providers, as they no longer need to develop their own infrastructure for the fleet. By joining the network and using the services that already exist within it, they can reach the wider market more easily and focus more resources on their core products.“The DAV protocol refers to a set of interconnected systems that create an open-source transportation infrastructure. The entire network is predicated on these protocols, making it highly scalable and ensuring it has no single point of failure. By decentralizing protocols around communication and transactions and open sourcing its technology stack, DAV fosters cooperation in an otherwise severely fragmented industry. Access to the DAV Network is permissionless; new players can enter the market and quickly scale up their participation in the transportation economy”, Frazer added.Frazer explained that open-sourcing DAV’s network technology helps to eliminate barriers preventing companies from positively interacting with each other and utilizing the wealth of innovative solutions that are otherwise siloed away. In the AV sector, even the greatest successes are restricted by either company or geography, limiting the wider applications of the technologies in the real world. Enabling different entities from different manufacturers to communicate with each other, for example, vehicles and charging stations is in an important part of spreading the success of this industry as far and wide as possible.By employing an open-source model DAV is able to push innovation to the edge, giving more participants control over the pace and direction of innovation, and fuelling creativity. Each participant, (be it customer to vehicle) on the network has a unique ID, which allows the system to track the transactions and create smart contracts that stay on that ID’s history. All members of the network communicate in a decentralized manner in two different ways: on-blockchain or off-blockchain.On-blockchain communication is where all smart contracts are signed, and where all payments and other transactions happen, taking advantage of the blockchain’s strengths when it comes to exchanging, securing and confirming information. Off-blockchain communication is where vehicles, infrastructure, and service providers communicate. For example, an AV would be subscribed to a certain amount of service providers or infrastructure providers would be subscribed to a certain number of vehicles. An AV could send a message that it is looking for a charging station, parking space or service station and the relevant stations nearby would respond back with bids. The vehicle would then proceed to choose the best bid and drive to get the service required.Anyone can join the network, as it is meant to be a public commons for Transport, much as the World Wide Web is a commons for content. Generally, participants will be providers or consumers (or both), with the latter being the ones who use the services and infrastructure on the network. Consumers can actually refer to both people and vehicles themselves when using things like charging services or mapping technology, Frazer added.Providers can split into several categories. For instance, vehicle providers are the companies that provide vehicles for on-demand services, infrastructure providers supply the network with charging station, docking, and parking. Service providers offer the maintenance necessary to the infrastructure and vehicles underpinning much of the wider network.Additionally, arbitrators and Insurance providers are the third parties of the system. They are essential for providing on-demand insurance contracts on the blockchain, and for providing independent dispute resolution. Perhaps most fundamental to the network itself are the final category of DAV members, the software and hardware providers who develop the open-source platform of custom services that are accessible to everyone on the network. The DAV Network can be accessed by all these participants using a DAV Token. These tokens are used to purely grant access to the network, and cannot be used in any other way."

DHVC, which is an investor in numerous blockchain projects including Dirt Protocol and Messari, led the round with Wu Capital. Cobo plans to use the funds to expand the app globally and launch a new hardware wallet, Cobo Vault. DHVC Managing Director Judy Yan said that she sees an opportunity in the market for a wallet that can take advantage of PoS mining rewards, and thinks Cobo could become a front runner in that area. ""That's my vision for Cobo,"" she told Forbes. Bitcoin, ethereum, monero, litecoin, and many other cryptocurrencies currently use Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithms. Under these systems, miners compete with each other to carry out complex computations in order to create and validate new blocks on the blockchain. With PoS consensus, on the other hand, users ""stake"" their existing coins on the network in order to create and validate new blocks. Those with older coins that have been staked for longer are more likely to be chosen as validators and receive a reward for a new block. Dash, zcoin, and tron are among the coins that currently use PoS consensus. Notably, the Ethereum Foundation is working on a type of PoS consensus for the ethereum blockchain; those protocols are slated to launch later this year. Cobo co-founder and CTO Changhao Jiang says that a wallet with PoS staking tools built into the software means that users can earn rewards on assets that would otherwise be sitting unused. ""While I’m excited to see that crypto investment and enthusiasm is on the rise globally, a majority of crypto assets remain dormant in an exchange or wallet for extended periods of time, which creates many lost opportunities,” he said in a statement. Cobo currently has roughly 500,000 users, mostly in China, and supports over 30 cryptocurrencies, including those that use PoS, PoW, and DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake), as well as 500 tokens. Jiang says that Cobo is targeting emerging markets as well as US and European users as it expands, and that the wallet's target users are retail investors and hobbyists who wouldn't otherwise take advantage of PoS rewards. “Cobo really speaks to the normal user,” he said.

Photo: Getty","High personal debt could endanger the standard of  future retirees, a new report warns.This warning comes as retiring Baby Boomers confront greater financial retirement challenges than their parents and grandparents did when they left the workforce in a study from the Stanford Center on Longevity.The tottering retirement security for many Boomers has profound implications for the overall well-being of individuals, families, and society today and for generations cautioned the authors.They added the worsening financial preparation could plague the nation for decades as Millennials and Generation Xers lag behind their savings goals more than older generations.The report noted Millennials and genXers areonly saving 7 to 10 percent of income toward retirement, down from the 9 to 10 percent of Boomers.The trend by younger Americans to eschew homeownership in greater numbers than their parents and grandparents did leaves them out of an opportunity to increase wealth which could hurt their financial security down the road, the study warned.On average, mid-boomers between 55 and 60 have saved less than the moms and dads and grandmas and grandpas,The problem is exacerbated because the Boomers have to stretch that money years longer.“People can realistically expect to enjoy 100 year lives,” the Stanford think tank predicted.The smaller nest eggs show up in a variety of places: home equity, total household wealth and retirement savings.With the shrunken savings, Boomers have to contend with higher debt.About two-thirds of Baby Boomers had debt in 2014, compared to only 20 percent born before 1930 and 40 percent of those born between 1931 and 1941, according to the authors.For mid-Boomers who owed, average debt in 2014 was $120,000.“Given the current level of assets and debt among boomers, it’s highly likely that they will either need to reduce their spending in retirement, work into their late 60s and 70s, or do some combination of the two,” the study forecasted.To see the full study, click on https://stanford.io/2ScKb9t"

with Bitcoin, which finds itself under financial and political siege.","Oct 2, 2018,02:08pm EDT","
","What is blockchain? First, imagine a spreadsheet that’s reproduced thousands of times across a network of computers. Then imagine that this network is designed to regularly update this spreadsheet and its shared and continually reconciled database.Now you have pretty good idea of how blockchain works –but also why blockchain constitutes a revolution on how information is shared and secured on the ‘net.Since the blockchain database isn’t stored in any single location, it means its records are easily verifiable. No centralized version of this information exists for a hacker to corrupt—and since the data is hosted by millions of computers simultaneously, it’s accessible to anyone on the internet. But it’s also protected because after every transaction within the shared ledger; and once all the ledgers match for every computer in the network; the transaction is encrypted with the rest in what’s known as a block.  The new block is then added to existing previous blocks to form a chain of blocks—hence blockchain.Now, it’s true that blockchain gets a bad press because of its association with Bitcoin, which finds itself under financial and political siege. Cryptocurrencies like blockchain because it allows all parties to track, verify and agree upon transactions, even when the individual participants remain anonymous. But that’s just one of the uses of blockchain. Besides Blockchain itself a growing number of companies like Ethereum and Blockstack offer the same decentralized architecture to protect and authenticate all kinds of data. Microsoft, Walmart and JPMorgan are already starting to deploy their own private blockchain networks in which only partners, suppliers or customers allowed to participate while delivering thousands of transactions per second.Experts predict blockchain-based technology will soon revolutionize the health care industry as well as the financial industry, by protecting patients’ and clients’ records through a constantly updated but decentralized accounting system.  Blockchain is being touted as the solution to the Pentagon’s vast logistics challenges—and in December, President Trump signed a bill calling for the rest of the federal government to look into the potential benefits of blockchain.In his new book, Life After Google, George Gilder goes even further. As blockchain technology proliferates and replaces older clumsier centralized systems for sharing and securing data, he predicts the result will be what he calls the Great Unbundling, as information and transactions on the Internet become reconnected without Google and other middlemen, “radically lowering transaction costs, turning [independent] firms into networks, distributing economic power, and enabling both wealth creation and a more prosperous future.”Gilder may well be right. Before we get too excited, however, it’s important to note there’s a cloud looming on the blockchain horizon. It’s called quantum technology.As we’ve noted in this space many times, tomorrow’s quantum computers will be more far powerful than today’s digital classical computers. Quantum technology will be poised to decrypt the complex algorithms that asymmetric encryption systems use to secure almost all electronic data, including blockchain.Because in the end blockchain technology still uses the same cryptographic building blocks that are at risk to quantum computer assault. More specifically, blockchains rely on ECC – Elliptic Curve Cryptography – for authentication which can be broken by future quantum computers. So instead of the answer to all our cybersecurity vulnerabilities, blockchains could become just as vulnerable as web browsers, VPN’s, and other systems.Fortunately, the problem---quantum technology--is also the solution. Banks, governments, and private cloud carriers are already employing quantum random-number generators (QRNG’s) that protect point-to-point communications as efficiently as a spy’s one-time pad.Even more important is developing and deploying quantum-resistant algorithms that can bolster blockchain's encryption defenses. Just as asymmetric encryption uses difficult math problems to stump classical computers, quantum-resistant algorithms will use still more difficult math problems to stump a quantum computer. Today the National Institute of Standards and Technology is looking to set the national standard for these next-generation algorithms. Many private companies are already developing those algorithms: and some are even taking up the challenge of making quantum-resistant blockchain technology.U.K.-based Quantum Resistant Ledger, for example, is experimenting with ways to create a quantum resistant cryptocurrency, with the “understanding that popular existing cryptographic signature schemes (such as ECDSA [i.e. a variant of ECC]) in the cryptocurrency space are vulnerable to a sufficiently powerful quantum computer…” Another British company, Ubiquicoin, has announced its goal to “become the first blockchain resistant to quantum computing cyberattacks.”Ultimately adding actual quantum keys to blockchain software, and all encrypted data, will provide the next layer of security against both classical computers and a quantum computers. But even quantum keys are not the silver bullet for ending all future cyber threats, any more than blockchain—and retrofitting a classically-based blockchain to make it quantum-resistant will take tremendous time and money. Governments and companies need to start realizing now, that no one wants a blockchain-based product that will be vulnerable to attack tomorrow, no matter how safe it may appear today."

wave of adoption for blockchain technology, but mostly for cryptocurrencies.","Oct 25, 2018,04:39am EDT","Gamers in military clothing play the PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) game during SK Telecom... [+] Co.'s 5GX Game Festival in Goyang, South Korea, on Friday, Aug. 10, 2018. Professional video gaming began in South Korea more than a decade ago, and has given rise to leagues that now pack stadiums and draw hundreds of thousands of eyeballs to Twitch livestreams for tournaments. Photographer: Jean Chung/Bloomberg","Undoubtedly, blockchain is still on the hunt for its ‘killer app’, it's perfect use-case that can send it on its way to being a usable and functional tool that lives up to the latent potential. Many think that finance, and being a digital form of currency, is that killer app, but the rise in adoption there has stuttered, as it bashes against barriers like regulators and institutionalised ways of doing things.The blockchain is such a broad piece of technology that it is being aimed at a litany of different areas and sectors. Intermediary-based operations, such as supply-chain management, even elections and other important parts of our society, are in the line of sight for blockchain.However, none of these sectors have come to the fore as a leading example of how blockchain can be implemented totally, with full buy in and mass adoption as a new and more efficient alternative. There needs to be both issues for blockchain to solve, as well as acceptance and understanding of the new system.That is where gaming shows potential as a real adoption point for blockchain. Gaming, as a global phenomenon has similar traits to blockchain technology in that it is a new space that is just starting to explode, and also offers more potential in the future. It is also a sector that is run by people who are technologically inclined, and predominantly younger.As much as the mainstream world does not really understand the gaming economy, with E-Sport's huge viewership and interest, the same can be said about the approach and understanding of blockchain.So, perhaps it is gaming that can become blockchains initial killer app, a sector that can embrace all that the technology can offer to fix issues that have already started to arise in the burgeoning gaming ecosystem.Picking up from finance’s failingsIn the cryptocurrency space we have seen one massive wave of adoption, and that came off the back of Bitcoin and its incredible rise to near-on $20,000. Bitcoin was always seen as a financial tool, and this rally was touted as a potential financial revolution. In the end, it was not to be.As a currency, Bitcoin essentially shot itself in the foot by leading this wave of adoption for blockchain technology, but mostly for cryptocurrencies. As interest grew in the digital currency, it started its shift towards being a digital gold instead.The potential for digital currency to be blockchain’s killer app was scuppered by greed. Adoption was driven by uninformed investors hoping to get rich quick, and when the market took a turn, they soon fled leaving Bitcoin reeling, and behind on adoption.While there is still a massive chance that cryptocurrencies can be blockchain’s killer app, especially with a new, slower more measured, growth happening, it is more likely a problem with the environment rather than the application.If we look into the potential of the gaming environment to be an adoption point for blockchain technology - more removed from cryptocurrencies - there is already a better target audience, and a far more receptive space to technological change.The gaming ecosystem contains the right people, and the right environment for a disruptive technological upgrade, and there is enough need for this disruption to take place. And it is beginning to take hold with its path is still yet to be seen.The beginning of a blockchain gaming revolutionWith many things in the blockchain space, potential is never a problem, it is about implementation and the possibility of reaching critical mass. There are a number of blockchain operations that are focusing in on this fast-moving and progressive space, but they admit to being only a drop in the an ocean.Andrew Colosimo of Xaya, a blockchain platform trying to bring forward the potential of blockchain in gaming, believes that the space is one that can aid in adoption of blockchain“I think gaming definitely has the potential for being a catalyst for bringing more of the masses to blockchain,” Colosimo explained to Forbes. “Gamers, particular PC gamers are normally somewhat technical and typically enthusiasts who like new technology, and blockchain does need that bit of expertise at the moment. From our point of view - we know there is going to be a market for blockchain gaming but it needs to be approached carefully.”Colosimo is not deluded about the space though, knowing that it has a long way to go and a lot of work to do in order to get a paradigm shift going.“It's still early days at the moment and although there is a lot of money being pumped into blockchain gaming there is actually very little gamers playing,” he said forthrightly. “I think the top blockchain games have in the 10s of daily active users. It's really a niche at the moment.”“There are numerous barriers to overcome such as the complexity and user experience to play blockchain games, it's not easy for those that are not already in the crypto scene. Games are generally slow and uncomplex, or if they are not then they are using blockchain in a way that makes little sense other than using blockchain as a buzzword only.”It may sound like a real mountain to climb for blockchain gaming, but as the blockchain’s scope is so broad, and gaming is expanding into different areas, so there are ways in which the technology can be used and appreciated alongside normal gaming interactions.“Blockchain from our point of view is not going to take over the gaming industry completely but open new opportunities and a new genre of games,” Colosimo adds. “That being said, as the technology matures it could be that in five, 10 or 20 years, every multiplayer game, payment systems and assets are stored and run on the blockchain, but certainly not in the near future.”This is really the key of the blockchain-gaming crossover. The technology is always touted as having the ability to totally take over different sectors - such as become a new currency standard and to do away with fiat - but this is just not feasible.In gaming, it is unlikely that the entire ecosystem will suddenly be built and run on blockchain, but certain aspects of it can move quite seamlessly to the immutable ledger.Colosimo adds certain areas where blockchain can improve the gaming space, such as: “Fraud proof payments - it's estimated that for every one legit purchase there are seven fraudulent ones. Lower commission fees for in app purchasing. Play to earn gaming experiences. True item ownership with freedom to trade at will. New gaming genres that run unstoppable without servers and a lot more.”Blockchain has what it takes to make these improvements to the gaming sector, and it has in that sector an environment that would welcome and embrace it. This is how gaming can become the first real adoption point for blockchain, and how this sort of integration can lead the way for other changes and efficiency improvements."

Freeman of AnyPay","A New Hampshire car dealership has seen its first car being sold entirely in dash, signaling a change to the way business managers think of cryptocurrencies as a form of payment.The days of paying with fiat are slowly changing. As the crypto market steadily gains mainstream attention, paying for day-to-day items with it is becoming the norm. With more places accepting crypto, it's no longer a question of 'what can I buy with it?'. Now, items being paid for are becoming more serious, more tangible.Take the purchase of a 2012 Ford Fusion at the AutoFair dealership in Merrimack, New Hampshire, U.S. As the 13th most valuable cryptocurrency, dash is helping to lead the way with digital payments. Through the use of AnyPay, a cryptocurrency point-of-sale app, the transaction was processed at a cost of $8,316, amounting to a payment of 40.68405 dash, paid in full and up front.Since 2015, dash has seen over 1,000% year-over-year growth in both value and trading volume. As an e-commerce and payments-focused cryptocurrency, dash is aiming to offer a form of money that is portable, inexpensive and fast.For Derrick J. Freeman of AnyPay, the car's buyer who also helped set up AutoFair to accept dash, the payment process was simple and streamlined.""Had I walked into the dealership with a stack of twenties, it would have been way more difficult,"" Freeman said. ""It just seemed right. Modern, efficient. It was also playful and fun whereas paper cash is way less fun. Tedious.""With over 300 cars for sale at the Merrimack lot for purchase with dash, AutoFair is running a joint promotion with AnyPay in order to sell more vehicles. Four cars that are sold for dash will receive 10% dash-back, which will be split evenly between the dealership and the customer. This accounts for a 5% discount for the buyer and a 5% bonus for the dealership. The amount will be capped at a $1,000 total value per purchase.Using cryptocurrencies for the better part of the last 10 years, Freeman said that it's normal to use bitcoin or dash to pay for things, particularly in New Hampshire. Last year, Chris Sununu, the Governor of New Hampshire, signed into law a bill that protects cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin or dash, from regulation, making it the first state to do so.Since then dash has become a widely accepted form of payment in the state among a variety of merchants. According to DiscoverDash, a dash merchant listing site, it lists nearly 80 companies in New Hampshire as accepting the cryptocurrency. Some of these include the Free State Bitcoin Shoppe, Branch and Blade Brewing, Thirsty Owl Bar and Grill, Wilder Automotive, Cycles Etc, White Mountains Helicopter and Portsmouth School of Ballet.Worldwide, there are over 3,500 businesses that accept dash.Freeman points out three reasons why there's value in using dash for daily purchases: it's a private digital cash that is backed up and secure, it respects the business owner and it gives the user dash-back every time they spend.""Spend $10 on a sandwich at Fezziwigs? Boom, $1 dash comes right back into my wallet as an instant rebate,"" Freeman said. ""It is automatic. Nothing to sign up for or do. You just use it, and it works. Magic.""With the last major bull run bringing legitimacy to the cryptocurrency market, merchants are beginning to see the value they have, said Steven Zeiler, CEO of AnyPay.""Buying a vehicle with dash signifies the next phase of digital currency adoption as we transition to a world where permanent, durable, expensive capital goods can be purchased with private digital cash,"" Zeiler said."

Getty Royalty Free,"If the world crypto and blockchain ever needed a reputation boost in the nation’s capital, the fall of 2018 might just be that time. Cryptocurrency markets are in the doldrums - a trend that many predict to continue. The initial coin offering boom of 2017 has delivered little aside from unfulfilled expectations and disgruntled investors, with many of these tokens now safely classified as poorly conceived ideas or outright scams. January’s mainstream media features of self-made crypto-millionaires have given way to depressing profiles of late entrants losing everything due to FOMO hysteria. Meanwhile, political and regulatory pressure in the U.S. continues to mount as Congress and executive branch agencies further probe these new technologies and incumbents posture themselves to protect their turf. Put it all together, and it’s not a stretch to say that the future of the nascent ‘crypto industry’ in the U.S. may be defined by what happens in Washington over the next one to two years. This has necessitated more crypto boots on the ground in Washington to boost the industry’s image, and an influx of new groups are springing up to meet that need alongside incumbents such like the Chamber of Digital Commerce - the industry trade group that recently commemorated its fourth anniversary - and Coin Center, a 501c4 “social welfare” group, as defined by the Internal Revenue Service, that engages in issue advocacy and lobbying. New Kids on the BlockThe first of these, the Blockchain Association, is backed by several industry heavy hitters and made a splash on the D.C. circuit with its official launch earlier this month. The group has been in the formative stages for roughly half a year, dating back to the beginning of the so-called ‘crypto winter’ when regulatory pressures began to get serious. Kristin Smith, the group’s sole staffer at the moment and former lobbyist on behalf of Overstock.com and Medici Ventures, said that the conversation around the need for such a group began to heat up at the Coin Center annual dinner in New York in May, during the week of Consensus 2018. The group’s mission is to serve as a voice of the public, open blockchain industry, and it will broadly focus on issues such as taxation, money transmission licensing, anti-money laundering and know your customer rules and defining utility and security tokens. Their approach will not only involve old-school shoe leather lobbying work, but also new-school influence tactics like coordinating campaigns and building cross-sector coalitions around key issues. Several large exchanges - Circle and Coinbase, investment groups Digital Currency Group and Polychain Capital and Protocol Labs, the startup behind Filecoin - which raised a then-record $257M in its initial coin offering in 2017 - are among its inaugural members. Zcash and Blockstack have reportedly joined, with several others following suit.“We’re in the double digits now,” Smith told Forbes, noting that she’s received a steady flow of membership inquiries coming in since the group’s official launch:“We want to get as many of the credible, thoughtful and compliant players in the space as possible to be our members.”Other companies are still weighing their options. “We’re considering it seriously, though we haven’t decided to join or not join at this point.” said Steve Hopkins, COO and general counsel of Medici Ventures, the blockchain-focused subsidiary of Overstock.com. “Within our portfolio, the right entity to consider it is tZero and I think they are looking at it closely.”Another group that has made a noteworthy splash is the Virtual Commodity Association, a group of exchanges assembled by the twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. First announced in August, the group aspires to be the foundation of what will eventually be a self-regulatory organization for the industry. It currently counts exchanges Gemini, Bittrex, Bitstamp and bitFlyer among its member ranks. Independent sources identified that the VCA has retained a prominent lobby firm to create and grow a footprint in Washington, though the group did not respond to emailed questions asking for confirmation by press time. Still in the pipeline is another formative trade group being set up by a pair of Republican lobbyists and ex-Capitol Hill staffers, Beau Rothschild and Brian Darling, who collectively bring decades of Washington influence and dealmaking to the table. The association, tentatively named the Digital Currency Association, will be formally announced in October at Money 20/20 in Las Vegas.More traditional business advocacy groups are also staking a claim in crypto-advocacy. For example, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce - the largest business group in the world and most powerful lobby group in Washington - issued a policy position calling for greater regulatory clarity for initial coin offerings earlier this summer and has become increasingly involved in dialogues around crypto-regulation topics.While the focus of these groups is on the Washington political and regulatory apparatus, others are sprouting up to hone in on thorny state-level issues like money transmission licensing, as well as to support local pro-innovation laws with regards to token classifications and regulatory sandboxes. The Digital Trade Asset Trade Association, one such group, set up shop in March 2018 and has played an going role in states such as Wyoming- which passed a slate of crypto-friendly laws last spring and is currently weighing the creation of a special purpose bank that can accommodate companies exposed to cryptocurrency that have traditionally had difficulty securing traditional banking services. The group is also currently involved with legislative efforts in Colorado, Virginia, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico and elsewhere.""We really believe that the real change comes about from grassroots level organizations working with individual legislatures,"" Steven Lupien, DATA's executive director, told Forbes. ""That’s how we achieved the success in Wyoming.""Growing PainsWhile a stronger Washington presence is necessary for any emergent industry that must protect itself from the whims of government overreach, for some, it raises fears of regulatory capture of a space that has been incubated in libertarian ideals.Further, the intense factionalization and ideological schisms that have emerged as crypto’s appeal has broadened have made rounding up the community to agree on any particular issue an extraordinarily difficult proposition. Still, most in the crypto community will happily welcome any group looking to educate policymakers and push the IRS to update cryptocurrency taxation rules. But the concern among some is that such groups will be top-heavy and driven by well-heeled incumbents that have sizable warchests, who will then simply push to codify laws and regulations with which they are already compliant, thereby kicking away the ladder for smaller startups and innovators. “If the association becomes a typical K-Street lobbying shop, advocating for institutional interest, and their agenda runs counter to the open-source community’s current trend of increasing individual privacy, they will just help prolong the pain as we transition to an open-finance world,” said one industry insider who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to speak on the record. Such concerns are germane to every sector, not just crypto, but the emergent groups stress that they are fully-aware of these dynamics and are working to minimize them while acknowledging the reality that the industry can no longer simply fly below the political radar. Rothschild and Darling, for example, stress that their group’s value proposition will be intensive shoe leather work in the halls of Congress on behalf of smaller, underrepresented startups and innovators in the space. While the Blockchain Association’s founding members are big hitters in the crypto space, Smith emphasized that the group is consciously aiming to incorporate into its equation startups and smaller members who may not be able to shell out top-dollar membership fees:“We’ve structured it in a way that allows access for startup companies in the space that want to be informed and participate.”Recasting the NarrativeWhile lobby groups play an important role in influencing legislation and regulations, public policy battles are increasingly fought in the public sphere through issue advocacy coalitions and campaigns. Thus, shaping a favorable public narrative is just as critical as interfacing with members of Congress and their staffs. Jason Brett, who served as a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulator during the 2008 Financial Crisis before stints at the Chamber of Digital Commerce and ConsenSys, argues that much of the current confusion in Washington stems from the fact that the community simply hasn’t done a good enough job of presenting the technology in language that policymakers can easily understand:“The internet was an easy concept to explain, but blockchain is very difficult. It creates huge challenges for ecosystem.”Brett’s proposed solution is to reframe and reclassify crypto, blockchain, distributed ledger technology, etc. under the umbrella of “value technology,” much as the internet has become known as information technology. He argues that this terminology would not only help novices better grasp the technology's value proposition, it would help to unify the industry around a common definitional framework with which even those in competing or non-aligned factions of blockchain could still identify:“Bitcoin maximalists, distributed ledger people, EOS people, Ethereum people - everybody is in a different camp,"" he explained, stressing the need for a higher-level definition set. Brett plans to go live in the coming months with a new think tank, the Value Technology Association, to help build and project this cross-industry narrative into public sphere - both in Washington and beyond. Big TentPutting it all together, the emergence of cryptocurrency and blockchain as more than just a fringe realm of the internet has necessitated the need for more voices to promote these ideas in the nation’s capital - irrespective of whether or not that dynamic aligns with the original decentralizing and disintermediating vision behind bitcoin.Whether or not there is enough room on K Street for all of these influencers to co-exist effectively remains to be seen, but the hastened emergence of the advocacy arm of this emergent industry is an indication that the most critical battles in this space in the coming years - at least in the U.S. - will not be over block sizes or scaling solutions, but rather creating political and regulatory frameworks that support continued innovation.This article has been updated to include additional information about the Digital Asset Trade Association"

The company was famously an early adopter of Bitcoin payments on their site, as well as strong investor in the digital currency as a money-making asset.Now, through their blockchain accelerator and subsidiary Medici Ventures, Byrne is looking to invest further in the underlying technology and see what it can do in terms of streamlining wine futures trading while reducing fraud through secure supply-chain tracking from product provenance.Medici Ventures has announced a strategic investment in a blockchain company called VinX which plans to create a token-based digital wine futures platform based on the Bordeaux futures model. This will allow for the selling and trading of wine futures on a transparent and secure blockchain. The spin off of this is that the supply-chain tracking on said blockchain will also aid in reducing fraud in high-end wines.It is estimated that 20 percent of all wine in the world has counterfeit labeling, so what a consumer believes is a high-end bottle of wine could have a decidedly more local origin.“Like any economy, the wine industry has difficulty scaling its middlemen-heavy systems in parallel with the growing demands of an increasing global market,” said Byrne. “VinX’s steps in tokenizing wine futures while allowing wine enthusiasts to know without a doubt that the bottles they purchase are filled with authentic wines will position the entire industry as a model of a new global economy that replaces old boys’ networks with frictionless trust through technology.”A classic disruption modelOn the face of it, especially when it comes to intermediary-heavy industries, there is a lot of potential for blockchain disruption. The wine distribution network is just another such industry that is starting to embrace the potential of blockchain’s transparent and immutable nature. This distributed ledger technology is thus an ideal ledger for such supply-chain information to be stored on - especially where fraud and corruption is evident.To this end, VinX’s mandate, as described by their co-founder and CEO, Jacob Ner-David, is to ‘democratize the capital structure of the wine industry.“We are democratizing the capital structure of the wine industry by bringing consumers in direct contact with producers early in the wine-making cycle. We are riding the wave of direct-to-consumer, which Overstock has been a leader of for almost 20 years,” Ner-David said.“In addition, because we are registering all wine futures as tokens on a blockchain, we are bringing a powerful validating force that will go a long way toward reducing fraud.”Bullish on blockchainWhile Overstock.com’s own bitcoin investments may have waned, or at least shrunk, in the 2018 bear market, there is no doubting the progress that blockchain is feeling this year. Medici Ventures, headed up by president Jonathan Johnson, explains that this blockchain accelerator and subsidiary of Overstock.com has been ‘bullish on blockchain’ for over four years now.“Medici Ventures has been focused on advancing blockchain technology for nearly four years. We have more than 15 portfolio companies that are doing that. This investment is not a comment on the cryptocurrency market at all; it reflects our continued bullishness on the disruptive and revolutionary impact we expect from blockchain technology,” Johnson said.""Our goal is to change the world by advancing blockchain technology. We believe that by advancing blockchain technology we can bring the people of the world closer together. By eliminating the need for trust institutions to stand between us, blockchain offers humanity the chance to re-engage and connect once again as people,"" the president said in explaining Medici Ventures' goals.Johnson also explained not only the importance of disrupting the wine market, but also how VinX proved themselves to be a worthy strategic investment partner in an ecosystem that has many projects that are all bark and no bite.“It is often difficult for even the most seasoned collector to identify fake wine,” Johnson explained. “Consider the experiences explained in the documentary Sour Grapes. To combat this growing concern, VinX plans to use blockchain to connect wine lovers directly with wineries, eliminating fraudulent middlemen within the industry and providing customers with a direct line to the source of the products.“Medici Ventures has been looking for a good supply chain investment in the blockchain space. With the VinX team’s industry experience in the wine industry and in software development, we’ve found an opportunity we really like.”"

design is becoming increasingly centralized, is not a security.","Nov 13, 2018,06:03pm EST","While no one can be certain how the market will shake out, it does appear that blockchain technology--and the myriad cryptocurrencies that have developed concomitantly--are likely to endure. ","Their advent has the potential of reducing the cost of undertaking various financial transactions, which would be a boon for investors as well as the U.S. economy, as its financial markets would become more competitive against overseas competitors. At the same time it is worth noting that the current environment, with its lack of regulatory certainty, also present risks to its users: for instance, no one can be certain which of the myriad currencies will survive a potential market shakedown, which could render their crypto investments worthless. Cryptocurrencies also pose potential problems for the government: it would not only like to take steps to protect investors from putting their money into dubious assets but it would also want to ensure that crypto transactions not be used for illegal activities. To accomplish this the government must not only decide how to regulate these assets but also which government entity will take the lead in doing so. The latter may seem of interest only to those who revel in the arcana of bureaucracy but it is actually the key determinant for the ultimate shape of a future regulatory framework. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission recently announced that it would soon provide more guidance on when it considers an initial coin offering a securities offering, as well as some indication as to how it would treat secondary market offerings. The SEC’s director of Corporation Finance, William Hinman, opined that existing securities law suggests that a cryptocurrency can be defined as a security if its ledger is “centralized.”  However, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has declared that Bitcoin, which by its design is becoming increasingly centralized, is not a security.Others in the regulatory space--most notably former CFTC Chair Gary Gensler--have opined that XRP, a digital tool for business applications used by companies like Ripple, could be a security, despite the fact that its ledger is increasingly more decentralized. This incongruity could be a portent of future regulatory incoherence.There is simply too wide a diversity among the more than 2,000 different cryptoassets in use to invite regulators to make far reaching conclusions without a framework that fits the realities of a very new technology, and we are not there yet.While potential investors would undoubtedly welcome greater clarity with regards to future regulatory oversight of the cryptocurrency market, it is worth asking whether such guidance should come from the SEC or from Congress or the Administration. A wise senator for whom I once worked once explained to me that no one wins elections by solving a problem before voters realize that a problem exists that needs to be solved, so it may be fanciful to assume that Congress has an appetite to provide clarity to this market. However, the Treasury department recently indicated that it is intently studying the issue and that it intends to soon propose some sort of guidance that would lead to the creation of a single regulatory framework for cryptocurrency. Ideally, this would include input from the Financial Services Oversight Committee, which Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin chairs. Federal Reserve Chair Donald Powell, SEC chair Jay Clayton, the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the others also participate in the FSOC. What we do not want is a turf battle between Treasury, the SEC, and other possible bureaucratic entities that potentially results in redundant or excessive regulations and slows down the growth in blockchain and cryptocurrency development. It would be equally regrettable if such a development were to delay the development of thoughtful government regulatory actions, because without more certainty in this realm new investors are going to be wary of making excessive commitments in this market. I would like to suggest a possible regulatory route: In a paper I wrote earlier this year with Robert Jennings and Julie Chon we suggested that the United Kingdom consider pursuing some sort of financial regulatory coherence with the United States as it exits the EU and contemplates its own financial regulatory environment. While the UK has had to do little to regulate its financial markets since the emergence of the EU, of late it has been very active in its regulatory oversight of cryptocurrency and the use of blockchain. One potential path for the U.S. would be for it to pursue a similar cryptocurrency/blockchain regulatory structure, starting with the UK’s current regulations.In this scenario the U.S. government--presumably led by the Treasury--would coordinate input from other agencies and stakeholders and use it to work with HM Treasury to arrive at a framework both countries would find acceptable. This would in turn create a vast, global financial market encompassing two entire financial capitals, and its standards--for cryptocurrency regulation and much else--could potentially serve as the basis for regulatory standards for other markets as well. Regardless of how it chooses to proceed, it behooves the government to create some sort of regulatory clarity in the cryptocurrency and blockchain environment, and in so doing be amenable to getting input from the leaders in this technology. And the logical way to proceed would be for the Treasury to determine a path forward and for the SEC--and other government agencies--to follow its lead. abstract concept bitcoin electronic circuit bord gold background"

[+] in Tokyo, Japan, in January. The world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange keeps getting bigger. Binance.com is adding “a couple of million” registered users every week according to Zhao. Photographer: Akio Kon/Bloomberg","Cryptocurrency exchanges have become key points of access to the entire ecosystem. They are the initial point of entry for most investors and users of these digital assets, and as such, they are big business, and also fiercely competitive.Since the boom of Bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies, the likes of Coinbase in the US, OKEx and Bitfinex in Hong Kong, Huobi in Singapore, and others, have all become household names and important players in the growth and evolution of the cryptocurrency space.However, there is one name that sits a top all of these - Binance. Binance is still not two years old and yet it has launched itself quickly to the top of the cryptocurrency exchange tree with some innovative decisions, as well as a native utility token that hits a lot of the right notes for its users.The Binance Coin (BNB) has been a major part as to why Binance has succeeded as much as it has in such a short time. The token was introduced for a small, but significant reason, and from there, its utility and worth has exploded almost as much as the exchange itself.The question that needs to be asked about this case study of a cryptocurrency exchange is: Does Binance’s growth emanate from that utility token, or, is the token a by product of a successful company? And, should this be a model going forward for cryptocurrency exchanges?A precedent has been set by Binance, and in this highly competitive market, it remains to be seen if they can stave off challengers, and whether those challengers will innovate, or imitate.Unprecedented growthThe cryptocurrency space is renowned for insane growth, and Binance is just another example of that. Founded in early 2017 by Changpeng Zhao, Binance held an ICO in July of that year for its BNB token. This saw them raise $15 million in funding in which was a shrewd and timeous decision taking into account the excitement around ICOs at that time.Then, just 143 days after launching, Binance was ranked as one of top three crypto exchanges globally; it was already making news in its first six months of existence. The first six months of 2018 also saw some incredible growth as the exchange went from boasting two million users to having over 10 million, and with that growth, they are predicting to make $1 billion profit.Reasons for the rise?Clearly, Bianace got off to a good start with a successful ICO on its BNB token, but it also has done a few innovative and important things as a major exchange that has helped its growth exceed expectations.On a technical side, Binance has the ability to handle 1.4 million orders per second, combined with its ability to host 20 million users, and multilingual support, the exchange has huge capacity when it comes to taking on more users without slowing or stalling.It has also moved its base of operations to the cryptocurrency friendly island of Malta in order to benefit from beneficial regulations and laws for the nascent blockchain technology.Binance has also become renowned for accepting and onboarding new cryptocurrencies at a rapid rate. This has however also caused controversy as it was speculated that new blockchain products were paying upwards of 400 BTC to be listed on the exchange.However, this was rebutted by Zhao in a tweet as well, indicating that Binance does not list s**t coins regardless of any fee they may offer to pay.Still, the fact that the exchange is happy to accept new coins at a much quicker rate than an exchange that trades fiat pairs with strict KYC/AML regulations means that Binance can also rapidly grow its offerings of coins and attract more business.Then of course there is the BNB token, which could well be the secret to all of this success. BNB was introduced as a utility token with the benefit being that users could reduce the trading fees on the platform by 50% when using it, and it also offered liquidity to these customers.Built on the BNBThe Ethereum-based token has had an interdependent relationship with the growth of the exchange as, with more users coming to Binance, there has been more growth of the token, and that in turn has spread the word about the reduced fees, and further helped grow the entire operation exponentially.""BNB is the fuel in Binance's engine,” He-Yi, Binance co-founder explained to Forbes. “It is well known that our users can reduce trading fees by using BNB. But it was during our token sale that we acquired our earliest batch of Binance users, and these BNB community members have greatly contributed to our growth.”“Because we have a strong vision for the industry and clear values at Binance, as a company, we're capable of success with or without the token. But it's only through BNB that we've built such a strong community, and this is the secret of Binance's growth.”The ever increasing price of BNB can linked to ever increasing daily trade volumes, which subsequently can be tied to new listings on the exchange platform. So more users means more tokens, and more liquidity, helping the business expand.Then, with this growth has come more utility for the token. Now, not only does it help reduce the trade fees, it also being used as a voting token for what has been dubbed 'Community Coin of The Month', an idea came about from the suggestion of a Binance community member in the official Slack channel, and is a voting system using the BNB for new coins to be listed.Finally, the token is also used for Binance’s 'LaunchPad', another product aimed at helping startups raise capital on their platform. But all of these utilities again boost the benefit of BNB, and essentially, make it much more of a valuable and useful coin than a discount coupon.The evolution of BNB’s use is also starting to go beyond a native exchange token. The token has cracked number 14 in terms of market cap, and it has the 19th biggest volume traded on a 24 hour basis.“As we've grown the Binance and blockchain ecosystem, we've also seen more recognition of BNB's utility by the community and increasingly more use case adoption,” He-Yi added. “BNB is accepted as payment at various merchants through POS systems (eg. Pundi X, TravelbyBit), and for goods and services through Crypto.com – to name a few. The development of BNB isn't limited to just Binance; it's embraced by the wider community.""Other uses are also linking broader blockchain businesses to Binance as their goalposts shift to be more community-oriented.Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of NEXO, whose company shares a relationship with Biannce, and Zhao, explains why they decided to accept BNB as collateral on crypto-backed loans.“Binance is an efficient platform which we love and use both as individuals and Nexo as an institution. They are one of the few companies that conducted an ICO and actually delivered on their promises,” Trenchev told Fobes. “The reason we like the BNB Coin is multifaceted. It is a great coin that is as close to a safe haven in the crypto space as it gets. Look at it performance since January it has outperformed even Bitcoin. That is because a real company with a real life product is providing it.”Trenchev raises an interesting point. Bitcoin’s adoption into business and everyday use has been slow and cumbersome, for a number of reasons, but of those reasons not many would have put down its decentralized nature as a crutch, that is meant to be a benefit. But, Trenchev inadvertently indicates that a well run blockchain company could be the future for cryptocurrency adoption.A new precedent?Cryptocurrency exchanges will continue to be important junctures between users and the broader blockchain ecosystem when it comes to accessing and utilizing digital currencies. As like any part of this nascent space, there needs to be time to grow, innovate, and establish.Binance has set a new precedent for doing things, and is continuing to innovate with news of their decentralized exchange coming soon. It is a model that has worked to elevate them quickly to the top of a space that has very little history or way of doing things, and because of this, it could be setting new precedents.However, in a space where companies, ICOs, and businesses who have tested the blockchain waters have quickly come and gone, Binance needs to prove its model will last not the next five years, but rather the next thirty, if it is to be considered a true success story."

Photographer: Michael Nagle/BloombergIn a blog post, Faisal Khan, a banking and payments consultant, wrote:“In the US, one of the biggest challenges faced by startups in the fintech space, is that of money transmitter licensing. Obtaining money transmitter licenses is no easy feat. It involves a large amount of paperwork, money and time. It can take up to two years to amass all 50 state licenses…for those who do touch money as part of their business model, getting money transmitter licenses from the states in which their clients are based is important.”Jim McKelvey, a co-founder of Square, said it took three weeks to build the hardware and software for Square and 18 months to get all the necessary licenses. Karkal said Sila will provide that payments connectivity so fintech developers can use its API to launch a product in weeks. The system should not require each fintech firm to have a money transfer license.He explains the mechanics in detail in a blog on Medium.The basics are simple — ID verification and account linking. Sila uses a crypto currency token pegged to the U.S. dollar  and 100% backed by USD securities to exchange value through the user’s Ethereum address. Sila will transfer value by moving tokens from the user’s Ethereum address to the target user’s Ethereum address, using Ethereum’s smart contract functions.The details are not so simple.In an email response to a request for clarification, Sila executives wrote:“Sila is not a crypto currency in the traditional sense (if there is actually a traditional sense when it comes to cryptocurrencies.  Specifically, the way we have designed and think of Sila as a de-materialized representation of an underlying financial instrument in a token form that has the ability to be used on distributed ledger networks.  The regulation with respect to the transmission of crypto currencies in the United States and in majority of other jurisdictions is not settled yet, however there are clear indications from the US Federal level, e.g. FinCen, and the state level, e.g. NY few other states, that take the position that the transmission of cryptocurrencies is subject to current money transmission laws all the way to the other end of the spectrum with Wyoming which specifically excludes tokens from money transmission.”How many states regulate crypto currencies?“There are two levels of potential regulation on the state level - one is whether the state money transmission laws are sufficiently broad to include the use of crypto-currency and other similar stored value under the money transmission regulation, and the other is whether the issuance of a crypto-currency/token can potentially trigger the money transmission. With respect to the issuance of crypto-currency/tokens, our view is that the issuance of a token requires BitLicense in NY and state money transmission license in Alabama, Connecticut, Hawaii, New Mexico, North Carolina, Vermont and Washington.”The outcome is “an API platform and suite of developer tools supported by a new regulatory-compliant, fiat-backed tokenized means of exchange — the Sila Token — that allows developers to rapidly build fintech applications and bring them to market,” he wrote on his blog.“The benefit for developers is raw speed to market,” Karkal said. “You could create a savings pool for an individual that others could contribute to. Today you need to quit your job, raise at least half a million dollars and get a deal with Wells or Bancorp for access to ACH, work through money transmitter licenses and 12-18 months from now you will actually have a functioning app.  The biggest problem in fintech is getting access to the markets. With Sila, you can build your app and ship it.”The issue of regulation is still a bit in flux, the company said in an email:“The regulatory approach for Sila is in the process of being vetted by both our third party providers internal as well as external counsel prior to seeking the official views of the regulators.  As you can appreciate there is still a lot of regulatory uncertainty.  However, we are encouraged with how the regulators are thinking and developing their positions.  Specifically, the positive signals sent by the banking regulators in their approval of the Gemini and Paxos tokens as representations of deposit in a FDIC insured institution and its ability to be used on the distributed ledger networks.”Fintech apps solve real-world problems, Karkal said.“There’s a huge potential for improvement in finance, so many problems everywhere. If you can unleash the creativity of the developer community you will see a lot more fintechs and a lot more successful fintechs.”The two most promising new platforms are robot savings, like Acorns, which builds on the idea that people need help saving, something Simple pioneered in a banking app years ago. That requires signing up users, linking their bank accounts, taking their money, saving it and then returning it when they need it.Sila will charge 20 basis points for all transactions — redeem Sila, purchase Sila and transfer Sila.“Initially, we will likely transfer some cost of transactions (including ACH costs for pulling or pushing funds, KYC requirements costs, and verification costs for blockchain) to the end customers until we have substantial revenue.  Eventually, transaction costs will be pushed as close to zero as possible, and the additional fee will cancelled,” the company explained in an email.A second area where he expects growth is in smart contracts that are simple enough for people who aren’t bitcoin experts to use in areas like payments for smart contracts.“So much is going on in the crypto world around smart contracts. Ethereum is the biggest platform for that type of development, but the user experience sucks. Ninety-nine percent of people want a simple way to use money. Now there is no easy way to get dollars in and dollar out of crypto currencies. They are highly volatile. I think those will be our early markets.”"

[+] viewpoint in beautiful post sunset twilight during blue hour at dusk in summer. (Photo Credit: Getty Images),"The best and competitive job opportunities in Silicon Valley?Some may look at FAANG - that is, the five major tech companies including Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google.While securing an engineer job at places like Facebook and Google is still the dream for many, more and more engineers are turning down the offers from the big names for what they deem a revolution happening in another world: the world of blockchain.An Atypical EngineerMaximilian Wang, or Max, turned 28 in August.If asked to name one major life change in the past year, this former Facebook engineer would probably recount quitting his job as a software engineer at Facebook and explain how he became the CEO of a blockchain project.Spoke on the phone from Palo Alto, California, Wang came across like any typical engineer in Silicon Valley. He talked so fast that you had to ask him to pause from time to time in order to keep up. His manner of speaking was straightforward and blunt – so much so at times you felt the urge to ask him if he was being serious.Referring to engineers who don’t believe and understand blockchain as “muggles” – a term used to describe people lacking magical ability that originated from the best-selling series of books, Harry Potter – Wang admitted that he too was once only human.“You know engineers are very simple: you give us a task, and we find the solution to it,” the 28-year-old man explained about his past life, “[And] we spend all of our time on that. It’s hard to see what the world outside looks like and how that world functions and is making money.”In early 2017, Wang first found out about blockchain technology and was immediately fascinated by its potential.Naturally, he began devoting more of his time in deep exploration of the technology. During the day, Wang was the hardworking coder at Facebook who - using his own words - “can read a single pixel mistake from meters away.” At night, he was a diligent academic reading tons of white papers on blockchain projects.Few people at work understood his fascination at the time.During a happy hour on 2017’s Halloween at Facebook, as Wang recalled, he did a talk about blockchain technology but it was received with little enthusiasm from his co-workers.“Everyone thought it was a scam,” Wang said. “Nobody believed me.”But of course that all changed after Thanksgiving in 2017 when prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies began to surge.At another similar work happy hour around New Year’s Day in 2018, all of a sudden, Wang said he noticed people were actually listening and talking about the fast-growing blockchain sector.Quarter-life CrisisAt the height of bitcoin's boom, Wang posits that he saw returns on his cryptocurrency investment portfolio increase by roughly the same amount as his total annual salary at Facebook. This, however, didn't satisfy Wang. In fact, Wang recounts that in the midst of the market frenzy, he hit his “quarter-life crisis.”“The hardest part was not when you saw an opportunity to make money and you needed to figure out how to get that opportunity,” Wang said. “What made it hard was that after seeing everything happened in the world outside, at the end of the day, you still had to come back to reality and try your best to focus on your work [at Facebook].”It became even more challenging to focus on work when some of his colleagues already started to quit their jobs and launch their own blockchain projects - especially after an occasion where one of his friends ”showed off” his crypto wallet with about $1.2 billion in it, a successful outcome of this friend’s investment in a blockchain project.The money looked too hard to say no, especially for a then 27-year-old young man. But still, Wang remained at his job at Facebook.He gave himself a list of reasons why he needed to stay at Facebook and that list included the connections he could make through Facebook and resources offered at Facebook… And among them, most importantly, he said that even after reading countless white papers of projects, he was still waiting for that one blockchain project that would persuade him.Ambition: the Bank of FutureBeing the person who started the crypto syndicate at Facebook, when the social media giant had thoughts on expanding its business to the crypto space, Wang was also reached out to by his team leaders.“I told Facebook if you really want to do business in crypto, just buy Coinbase,” Wang said, half jokingly, half seriously.He was joking because he didn’t believe Facebook would buy Coinbase, a San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange; he was also serious because he said that he believed that crypto exchanges eventually would become the banks in future.And that’s exactly why Bgogo, a blockchain project that claims to be the first digital asset exchange with supernode listing authority, stood out and led to his final decision to leave Facebook.In the blockchain lingo, “a node” is essentially the foundation of blockchain technology. It contains the transaction history of the blockchain. On Bgogo, the community gives the full power to the “supernodes” to list “the most high quality and promising digital assets.”At the same time, Bgogo makes the names of all supernodes and the tokens they nominated available on their website for Bogogo’s community to supervise. Once a supernode is found to be violating any regulations or laws, Bgogo’s team has the right to delist its cryptocurrency and disqualify the supernode.Compared to more traditional cryptocurrency exchanges, Bgogo, aims to solve at least four major problems in the existing crypto exchange ecosystem, including a ridiculously high token listing fee, low qualities of listed tokens, vulnerability to attacks and hacks, and terrible user experience, according to Wang.Wang’s ambition with Bgogo is big: he want it to be the JP Morgan Chase in the future, the top “bank” in the blockchain space.Not A Unique PhenomenonAnd Wang is not alone on the path to a future empowered by blockchain.Qi Zhou, who worked at both Facebook and Google, is another example of such engineers.Asked on how experience at Facebook and Google has helped him with his blockchain project, QuarkChain, a high-capacity peer-to-peer transactional system, Zhou’s answer is, besides social connections he made thanks to his former employers, the core technologies he had learned at these tech giants were the essence of the ideas he is trying to bring to the blockchain space.Zhou, who worked closely with high capacity and scalability, said it was Google’s Bigtable, a “compressed, high performance, and proprietary data storage system,” that has inspired his very own QuarkChain.“When I see an opportunity there, why can’t I go after it?” He asked himself after he saw that sharding, the technology underlying Google’s Bigtable, can also be applied to blockchain.A Win-win SituationIn fact, the trend of former big tech companies’ employees leaving their previous occupations for blockchain projects may also be a result of a mutual feeling: not only these engineers are seeing a better future with blockchain technology, the projects underlying this relatively new technology are, at the same time, constantly seeking those associated with big names, an effort to boost their projects and brands.Yang Liu, a partner and the chief technologist of Spark Digital Capital, a New York-based family office, said that the “big names” matter to investors.Liu’s company has been focusing on investing in blockchain projects in Silicon Valley since launched in 2017. When he and his team look at what blockchain projects to invest, Liu said that the leadership team is one of the priorities to be taken into consideration.“You can have a billion-dollar worth of idea [with blockchain technology],” Liu said. “But if you can’t make it work, it’s worth nothing.”If the core leadership members of a project are from companies with big names, it adds some amount of credibility to the project itself.“It’s hard to get into these big companies,” Liu said. “[Therefore,] they(people coming from big tech companies) must be very good engineers.”Also coming from an tech background, Liu said that engineers at tech companies, on average, are very young still, which makes it easier for them to accept new ideas such as blockchain.Why Not Blockchain At Facebook?For people like Wang and Zhou, who believe in blockchain, the problem for this technology to develop at places like Facebook, essentially, is a paradox how do you adapt a technology that has its core at a decentralized concept, to a well-established company that operates heavily in a centralized business model?Zhou said that even though Facebook has already launched its own blockchain research team, it is hard for blockchain developers like him to really make a change.“It [Facebook] is a very well-developed company,” he said. “ Compared to [startups], it has more restrictions.”He then further explained with an example of so-called initial coin offerings (ICOs):“It would be very sensitive If Facebook ever wanted to issue its own tokens. [...] It is responsible to its shareholders, so it has to explain very well on why it had to issue the token under the context that the company is relying on an existing business model which has been working well.”“One day in crypto, one year on earth,” both former Facebook employees used a phrase popular in China to give a big picture of how the fast growing blockchain and cryptocurrency sector is today compared to other traditional business sectors.As it seems like timing plays a key role in the blockchain space, for people like Wang and Zhou, places like Facebook, which is known for its innovation and rapid growth, are already too slow."

Some people consider cryptos to be a replacement of fiat currencies, ...","Oct 25, 2018,08:45am EDT",Getty,"Blockchain has captured the imagination of many technologists and businesspeople alike. Its potential could be far-reaching, yet it is also unclear how exactly it will be implemented. Since the concept of blockchains is relatively new, many people still have questions. Truth be told, I had the same questions myself when I initially started to explore this technology. Today, I'm able to help others answer some of those questions while speaking on technology panels or consulting with clients. This Q&A was borne out of questions I often get.What Exactly Is Blockchain?At its core, blockchain is a framework for creating business-to-business workflows. From a technical perspective, it’s essentially a decentralized database. This database automatically synchronizes data among various systems in which each system receives a copy of the data. The advantage of this distributed model is that if one node fails, the remainder of the blockchain ecosystem still works. Blockchain can also provide transparency. It stores an immutable log of transactions that cannot be changed after the fact. The system is powered by cryptography and includes consensus mechanisms that minimize fraud.What Could This New Technology Mean To Me?Blockchain has the potential to create a single source of truth among organizations that typically exchange massive amounts of data (e.g., logistics information, invoices, etc.). It can integrate previously siloed organizations or enable simpler integration. For instance, it can be used in supply chains to track materials from suppliers in a seamless fashion. And blockchains have the potential to keep records of financial transactions that automatically enforce contracts among parties.What Are Some Real-World Examples Of Blockchains?Walmart recently announced a requirement for their suppliers to leverage blockchain. Anyone who remembers the 2006 E. coli outbreak in the United States may know that it took the industry some time to track the source of the bacteria found in spinach to a specific farm. The lack of spinach sales in the 26 states affected by the outbreak represented a loss of revenue and trust. With the use of blockchain, Walmart can now trace the source of food in seconds as opposed to a week.What Are Some Other Examples Of Blockchain Use Cases?Blockchain use cases are found in just about every industry. For instance:Do I Need Cryptos For Blockchain? Not at all. Cryptocurrencies and blockchains are related, but they are not the same thing. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are a mechanism to store and exchange value. Some people consider cryptos to be a replacement of fiat currencies, while others view them as a store and exchange of value. Blockchain is what powers cryptocurrencies. For instance, Bitcoin's underlining protocol is a blockchain. However, blockchains don’t have to be leveraged only with cryptocurrencies.What Are Some Legal Challenges Blockchain Presents?In the United States, the SEC typically treats cryptocurrencies as securities. If you create a blockchain solution that issues cryptos, you may need to evaluate the implications when it comes to SEC registrations. On the other hand, the IRS treats cryptocurrencies as property. If you trade cryptos, you will have to pay income tax on any appreciation of these assets. Lastly, if you’re creating a consortium blockchain (where competitors participate), make sure you are not creating an environment of collusion and price fixing.What Are Some Of The Different Types Of Blockchains?At a high level, there are public blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as permissioned blockchains, including Hyperledger, Corda and many others. While anyone can participate on public blockchains, permissioned blockchains are intended for a limited number of parties typically found in enterprise settings.What Are Some Pitfalls Of Blockchains?First, this technology is very young and evolving very fast. As of 2018, Bitcoin, the original blockchain implementation, is only about 10 years old, while Hyperledger and Ethereum have been around for only three years. In my opinion, the current state of blockchains roughly compares to the state of the internet in around 1994. It’s a very promising technology, but in order to be universally useful, it will need to evolve.How Do You Control A Blockchain Database, And Who Can See What? Much of that depends on the type of blockchain that is being used. For instance, Ethereum is a public blockchain, which means that everyone on the network can see all of the transactions. For most enterprise use cases, this is probably not an appropriate implementation. Other frameworks such as Hyperledger Fabric are permissioned and allow a much more fine-grained level of authorization. For instance, Fabric creates a notion of channels. Each channel allows only certain organizations to access data within the channel. Channels also include notions of private data collections that enable only some organizations within a channel to commit and query private data.SummaryIt is my hope that this article shed at least some light on what blockchain is and how it could be implemented. As one can see, the technology has a potential to positively impact not only businesses but the world at large. However, we are still in the early phase of its adoption, so only time will tell what becomes of blockchain technology."

The second being the broad misunderstanding that paying a cyber ransom or extortion fee may itself be illicit, which it is not.While the stigma of a ransomware attack (and the cleansing or decryption process) only adds insult to injury, the world of ransomware, like other questionable activities on the web, plays to the psychology between the keyboard and the chair. A confession that a firm, employee, computer endpoint, database or network may have been compromised by ransomware begs many questions about cyber hygiene and online conduct in the first place. Add in the trepidation and complexity of paying a ransomware attack, which sadly is often the first-time people directly interact with bitcoin, the favored thrift of cyber ne'er-do-wells, and the recovery process cannot only paralyze decision making, it can grind operations to a halt. This is where second order costs begin to mount, and the real business continuity threat rears its ugly face. Cyber attackers know this harsh reality and they play to the psychology of fear and the almost certain risk of bankruptcy if a small firm does not comply with payment or restore systems on their own.As with any chain of resilience, an economy is as strong as its weakest link. When it comes to cyber risk, small to mid-sized enterprises are not only massive points of vulnerability, they are often facing the crippling effects of cyber-attacks, for which they are easy prey. This exposure in turn can have a knock-on effect even on larger companies that rely on smaller players in their supply chains. The backdoor into Target’s system, for example, was via a connected heating and cooling vendor that had access to their networks. According to Coveware’s new report, the average cost of ransomware incidents they have responded to and surveyed comes out to $36,586. To large firms, this figure may be a mere rounding error that can either be absorbed by their balance sheets or a cyber insurance policy, which enjoys wider adoption up market. However, to small and mid-sized enterprises parting ways with $36,586 may not only be the cost of a full-time employee, it may be the sum of financial reserves on hand. This, following the payment of cyber ransom and extortion costs, which averages around $5,000, payable in bitcoin in 98% of the cases Coveware surveyed.What is more damaging than the increasingly efficient ransomware and cyber extortion market, is the operating reality that this threat is deliberately designed to wreak maximum havoc on affected computer systems and data. Herein lies the leverage that cyber attackers exploit, which is pay up or risk shuttering your business, which is a stark choice victims are growing all too familiar with. Interestingly, suggesting that ransomware attackers and cyber extortionists are really in the pursuit of quick money, Coveware is reporting 100% success rate in instances were ransoms are paid. Indeed, the market has become so efficient, and attackers have become so “customer” friendly, that automated payment and service websites are being set up to ease the payment process, commerce, and the exchange of money for decryption tools. It would appear these attackers are aiming to stay below a certain criminal radar by not only targeting a wide surface area of small enterprises, but by exacting costs around $5,000 dollars, which while damaging to some, may be of nuisance value to law enforcement.For far too many people and organizations that are falling prey to these types of cyber-attacks, it is also their first introduction to the world of cryptocurrencies, and bitcoin in particular. Erroneously, ransomware attacks that rely on bitcoin as a means of payment, are exposing cyber criminals to an increasingly efficient forensics and criminal dragnet. This is emblematic of the relatively small financial haul of the WannaCry ransomware attack of 2017, which despite the fact that it spread to more than 150 countries affecting thousands of organizations around the world, only managed to retrieve $64,000 in bitcoin payments. While these first order costs are only one part of the economic harm caused by the ransomware scourge, the real issues posed are business continuity risks and data integrity risks. For this, groups that rely on information and data access as the lifeblood of their operations, where in some cases lives are literally at stake such as hospitals, ransomware poses a much bigger risk than the noisome $36,586 average costs. Attackers exploit this psychology and as we saw with the shift in physical kidnap and ransom events, which went down market when desirable targets hardened their security. This in turn lead to the spread of express kidnappings. Cyber ransom and extortion attacks targeting small firms are mirroring this market dynamic. The more efficient the dragnet and the speedier the payment, firms are let go, but with some virtual bumps and bruises, much like an express kidnapping.Similar market dynamics are taking place in the fact that small to midsize enterprises are increasingly the targets of choice for “express” cyber extortion. This suggests that large enterprises have not only successfully hardened their perimeter to these risks, pushing the risk downstream, they have also made their payments and the public discovery process of any paid ransom something that is not widely disclosed. As with shifts in physical kidnapping and ransom threats, another likely development that should worry national security and cyber security leaders is the growing specter of cyber and ransomware attacks with political, military, or terrorist motives. This much is outlined in the book Virtual Terror, which chronicles the rise of cyber terrorism for which there is no economic remedy save for prevention, good cyber hygiene and data recovery plans.Offsetting this increasing measurable risk through insurance markets or other hedging mechanisms is not readily adopted by small to midsize firms. Many wrongly believe that they do not face a cyber risk like large firms in part because they may not store private information. Therefore, the perception that they have a lower compliance obligation to their customers or stakeholders. Nothing could be further from the truth and all firms should view cyber threats as a business continuity risk. Additionally, small firms may not buy stand-alone cyber insurance because of the phenomenon of “Frankenstein” insurance policies that create the placebo of safety but may in fact offer a very thin layer of coverage with many holes in it. The more market insights that become available about the threat landscape and economic impacts of ransomware attacks, the more insurers and risk-transfer providers can evolve their solutions, while firms review their cyber hygiene and defensive posture."

blockchain is part of a family of technologies that I like to call ""deep 
tech"" ...","Sep 24, 2018,08:16am EDT",3d hologram concept of a smart city (Getty Images),"Don’t you hate when people from a sector use shop talk and expect everybody else to understand what they’re saying? I’ve never before had the opportunity to discuss proptech outside the real estate and construction space, and even within the industry, there is quite a bit of confusion on the topic.  In a bid to diffuse (some of) that confusion, here are the answers to seven questions on proptech that you can use in conversation and sound like an expert!What is proptech?Proptech is the acronym used to describe any technology for the real estate space. This can span software (property portals like Rightmove and Zoopla are considered proptech software!), hardware (for example, sensors), materials (for example, there was a recent news item on how special bricks are being developed to act as batteries for solar panels) or manufacturing (3D printing, offsite manufacturing) .
In day to day conversation, the term is often used to refer to startups in the space, though I tend to use it to describe the technologies themselves. Click here for the broadly accepted definitions of real estate technology and proptech by James Dearsley and Professor Andrew Baum.Why is proptech a hot topic in 2018?Proptech is starting to get noticed because it is no longer a niche phenomenon. Though still dwarfed by its older cousin Fintech, investment in proptech has soared sky high: from 186 million USD globally in 2011, to 2.67 billion USD in 2016. Data for 2017 shows that Venture Capital investments topped 12 BILLION USD last year!Several other factors such as M&A, cross Atlantic investment between the UK and the US and traditional firms investing into proptech also firmly point to the fact that it is here to stay.Why does my landlord care about proptech?Investors care about proptech because they see an enormous and as of now a mostly untapped market opportunity. But the reason this opportunity exists is that operators can extract top line and bottom line gains by implementing proptech. In the residential space, for example, topline gains include revenue maximization (either through price discrimination or greater tenant retention levels). Bottom line gains encompass all the savings (from better space utilization, through lower marketing costs, to lower energy bills and more) that proptech can deliver to a portfolio.Top line and bottom line gains from proptech implementationI hear a lot about Bitcoin, is that proptech?Well, no. But blockchain, the infrastructure which hosts bitcoin, can be! The blockchain is part of a family of technologies that I like to call ""deep tech"" – which is nothing more than technologies that are based on substantial engineering innovation. These are:BlockchainArtificial intelligence (AI)Intelligence Augmentation (IA)Machine Learning (ML)Deep Learning (DL)Big Data AnalyticsComputer VisionThe Internet of things (IoT)You can think of blockchain as an alternative (and safe) infrastructure for things such as transactions (payments) agreements (smart contracts for everything from engaging a contractor to executing a property sale) and data exchange (know your customer checks, credit checks, etc). This is not just safe, but FAST, as in theory, everything could happen in real time. Real estate people are very excited about the savings and efficiency this could bring to a very slow and bureaucratic market, though we are still a long way away from everyday use.Is Alexa proptech?Yes, she is! Alexa and other digital home assistants are an example of the foray into IOT, the Internet of Things. IOT is one of the most promising innovations in the real estate space. It is broadly defined as ‘a giant network of connected ""things"" (which also includes people). The relationship will be between people-people, people-things, and things-things'. Sensors are the glue that keeps these relationships together. According to the World Economic Forum ""Technological Tipping Points"" report, by 2022, there will be over 1 trillion sensors connected to the internet. As we become more connected, we produce more data, which can then be used for the planning and consumption of urban spaces and real estate.Which type of proptech will make my life better?That's a tough call. In the ""deep tech"" field especially, the technologies don't work in isolation from one another. IoT sensors will gather data, for example, that will be processed using big data analytics and made sense of and used to add value with AI. In this case, remove one of the three and the other two will be rendered useless to you as the user. However, from an end-user perspective, it is definitely the AI that you will notice the most, as it is what will provide the analysis (or the interaction!) that will make your life exponentially better.Should I be worried about my privacy?There are heated debates on the invasion of privacy that comes with an ever more interconnected world. There have been cases of Alexa sending information that it was not supposed to, for example, or blockchain tampering that raises questions on the security of that infrastructure and the data that will be stored on it. Privacy is a growing concern and we need to work had to stay ahead of those that would breach it. Though privacy does remain a concern, in the residential space there are many checks and balances being put into place to ensure that the data collected is put to use for the residents' benefit, as opposed to being harvested for financial gain."

Increasingly ill-gotten frequent flyer miles are in demand.","That’s according to Comparitech, the U.K. based researcher that reviews consumers products. In August it sifted through half a dozen illegal marketplaces online to get a sense of how much frequent flyer miles are worth. Their findings: there is a robust black market for the rewards, commanding in some case around $1,000 or more.Airlines miles from international programs tend to fetch higher prices based on Comparitech’s... [+] research compared to domestic programs. (AP Photo/Frank Augstein, FILE)Delta, British Airlines Points Commonly ListedComparitech pointed to one dark marketplace On Dream Market as an example. There you can purchase rewards points from more than a dozen different airline rewards programs such as Emirates Skywards, SkyMiles and Asia Miles. One person was selling 100,000 miles from a slew of different rewards programs starting at $884. Comparitech figured it was originally priced at $1,000 but with declines in the value of bitcoin in August, it’s under that. “It's fairly easy to get away with, ” said Paul Bischoff, editor of Comparitech in an email interview. “In many cases, the theft will go unnoticed for months since most of us don't check our frequent flyer accounts that often. “According to Bischoff, across all of the marketplaces Comparitech studied, Delta SkyMiles and British Airways Miles were the most commonly listed. Purchasing 100,000 British Airways Executive Club miles will set you back $884 but 200,000 regular British Airways Miles only costs $45. For 45,000 Delta SkyMiles, it cost $884 on the dark web while 2,000 miles were going for $31. “Both of these companies suffered data breaches in 2018, so it was easy for hackers to target customers with phishing emails and other sorts of attacks in order to steal their account passwords,” he said.Airlines miles from international programs tend to fetch higher prices based on Comparitech’s research compared to domestic programs. That may be because U.S. based airlines have stronger anti-fraud systems in place compared to their overseas counterparts. It could also be because the primary market for stolen points is international. Still, Bischoff said prices for the miles seem to be based on seller preference more than supply and demand. Buyers purchase in bitcoin or Monero, two popular cryptocurrencies, so the actual price could fluctuate. Comparitech noted that one airline point is equal to between one and two cents. That means 100,000 miles is worth $1,500. “Across the board points sold for roughly half of their real-world value on the black market,” said Bischoff.Hackers Cash Them In For Gift CardsStealing airline miles may not seem like it makes sense. After all, you need proof of ID to cash them in for travel. But what the bad guys are doing is redeeming them for gift cards that can be used at a slew of different retailers, said Comparitech. There are no ID or PIN requirements when spending the points and retailers don’t ask for IDs either. That makes it easy for criminals to steal and use the points. Last year Air Miles, the Canadian rewards program warned members that thieves stole cash miles and used them to purchase products in stores. Air Miles, at the time, halted the ability to cash in miles for gift cards as it investigated the issue.In addition to redeeming miles for gift cards, there is a grey market in which brokers will purchase unused airline miles with an aim of getting business and first class upgrades, noted Comparitech. Bad actors are getting ahold of the miles by hacking into the personal accounts of reward program members. That can be achieved via a data breach of a server or a phishing scam in which the individual unwittingly hands over the digital keys to his or her castle. For the victims, there is little recourse. Once the miles are stolen they are gone unless the airline or reward programs choose to refund stolen points.For frequent travelers who rack up miles and don’t want them falling into the wrong hands, Comparitech said there are a number of things they can do to protect themselves. For starters, shred your boarding pass after a flight and never post a photo of your boarding pass online. Sure, your legions of followers want to know you are traveling but they don’t need to see the proof on social media. Boarding passes often have frequent flyer numbers printed on them making it too easy for the hackers. Comparitech also urged consumers to use strong passwords for their frequent flyer account and monitor it for anything suspicious. If you are accessing your account, avoid doing so on a public WiFi, a haven for hackers. As to whether or not airline rewards thefts increase in frequency in the future, Bischoff said the answer lies in the hands of the companies. “ It's up to them to better secure their systems and detect fraud,” he said."

Buzz aside, to the true believers, there’s nothing blockchain can’t do.  Blockchain technology is now being used to track produce from farm-to-store, fund journalism, cast absentee ballots in elections and more. Blockchain enthusiasts believe it holds the answer to practically everything: poverty, cancer, copyright management, protecting consumer information, storing scholarly articles, etc. Governments and corporations alike are intrigued by its potential.With blockchain in demand, so too are college courses teaching the topic.Inside Higher Ed reported that both Columbia University and Stanford University opened blockchain research centers this summer, following the lead of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Those schools have joined other institutions of higher learning that have begun teaching courses on the technology, including Miami University in Ohio, Montclair State University and the University of Pennsylvania, among others.“There is rapidly growing student interest,” University of Pennsylvania legal studies and business ethics professor Kevin Werbach told CNBC. “They're seeing opportunities with companies that want students to work in this area, which include both blockchain focused startups as well as major companies. Wharton [School of the University of Pennsylvania] sends people to all the Fortune 500 companies, and investment banks and technology firms. A very high percentage of those leading firms now have blockchain or distributed ledger projects, and they're looking for expertise in that area.”As companies delve into blockchain, talent will be needed to lead the way. Already Glassdoor.com lists more than 2,700 jobs blockchain-related jobs. But even for colleges, teaching blockchain can be a challenge.Around since 2008, blockchain is probably best known for being the driving technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. As such, the decade-old technology has only begun to catch on as an in-demand course in recent years. As blockchain emerges, universities have introduced it into computer science programs, but challenges remain in teaching a technology that has only been embraced by academics in recent years.“Blockchain as a technology requires that you understand a bunch of other things first: cryptography, distributed systems, operating systems,” Andrew Myers, a computer science professor at Cornell University, told The Hechinger Report. “Before you know it, you’ve got a pretty long prerequisite chain. To really teach a full-blown blockchain course, you need textbooks, and a lot of that knowledge just hasn’t been distilled into a form that lets you really teach a good undergraduate-level course yet.”As blockchain enters computer science programs and seeps into the broader academic world, as a solution to all that ails higher education, educators are both hailing its potential and casting skepticism upon it.“If your university is not equipped to introduce courses and concepts rooted in the application and potential of blockchain, now is the time to start. Your students will expect it. Blockchain presents a rare opportunity for differentiation, more than the latest fad,” Daniel Pianko, managing director of higher education investment firm University Ventures, wrote for Inside Higher Ed. He added that beyond driving job growth blockchain has the potential to create research opportunities, improve accountability measures, and revolutionize record keeping, as the “death knell for the embossed transcript.”In a rebuttal published in Inside Higher Ed, Jonathan A. Poritz, a mathematics and physics professor and interim director and data analyst at the Center for Teaching and Learning at Colorado State University-Pueblo, urged patience on blockchain tech, cautioning universities not to rush toward building a workforce for a technology that still has many questions surrounding it as it marches toward an unknown future.“There are indeed many job openings for employees with blockchain skills, as Pianko pointed out. But it would be a mistake to conclude that we in higher education should build programs to satisfy the need for these workers. If investment firms in the Netherlands in the early 1630s had put pressure on the University of Leiden (founded about 50 years before) to produce more skilled tulip agronomists, it would have been a great mistake to accede to that pressure. Yes, there was a lot of financial churn going on in tulip markets, but it would have been foolish for an institution with long-term intentions to get caught in that mess,” Portiz wrote.While the job market is likely to continue to grow, which colleges will need to fill, even those already invested in blockchain caution against counting on the technology as a solution to practically everything.""Blockchain is not this magical thing where you sprinkle blockchain dust over a problem,"" Jimmy Song, a partner at Blockchain Capital, said at a cryptocurrency conference this summer as reported by WIRED."

But the term “project” gets used by people in the industry because of the decentralized ethos of the space. A company is an inherently centralized organization. Calling something a “project” lends it a more ethereal air. No one can really pin down what's going on. And maybe that’s the correct way of thinking about work in crypto and blockchain. A lot of efforts are so early-stage, they are really just like a project. On the other hand, calling an organization a project also makes it seem that the work being done isn’t serious. It has the potential to trivialize the industry and some of the amazing things happening right now in the space. In reality, the debate over what the myriad of blockchain and crypto organizations really are is far from settled.I’ve even seen someone on Twitter posit that independent freelancers in the industry are part of a massive decentralized organization, that people are nodes working towards the success of upholding the network.All of this begs the question: is the work being done a project, a company, or a truly massive global computer system?Here’s what the industry has to consider:A project has a very specific connotation in the tech world.Engineers and technologists often think in terms of projects. A project is something they work on at their job or in their free time. And they’re probably contributing to several different ones at any given time.“Project” is actually the terminology used for open-source work like JavaScript or Ruby on Rails.The idea behind these projects is that people will collaborate on a peer-to-peer network. It’s about openness and allowing people to contribute as much or as little as they want while maintaining a vibrant ecosystem for people to opt into. Most blockchain-based “projects” don’t line up with that ideal because they operate as centralized companies. But the term has become so common in the space that people feel comfortable using it—and misusing it—for just about anything. Defining your work as a company goes against the nature of the blockchain.Companies have owners, org charts, and structure. They’re inherently centralized.Most overarching goals within these organizations don’t align with those of the blockchain traditionalists. Companies want to own their ecosystems and the market verticals built on top of those ecosystems. They want a level of control. This makes sense, but it’s tough to find a way to combine that idea with the decentralized ideal of the blockchain. Bitcoin maximalists—people who want to maximize effort on one coin—argue it’s better to keep calling organizations working within the crypto and blockchain space projects, rather than companies. You do have to consider what’s really going on within these projects, though. Is it really a decentralized group of people working together on a project? Or is it the creation, marketing, and selling of a product or service that involves the blockchain? Because if it’s the former, then yes, it may be better to call it a project. But if it’s the latter, then it’s a company—no matter what you feel like calling it. The industry will determine how a decentralized organization will be legally labeled in the future. There is a wide range of organizations out there trying different structures, including Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. But after the DAO hack, most are leaning toward a more conservative approach by operating as a traditional company. Yet, the way in which these companies will ultimately be structured and labeled is far from being understood.The definition of a company or corporation is tied up in the legal structure. In the case of a C corp, shares are issued and people can hold stock. An LLC uses membership units. But the crypto and blockchain industry hasn’t quite made it that far into the legal system.Ideally, an organization would create a network of people who contribute to the overall goal or add value to the network—and who are compensated for it. This is essentially the way that open source projects already work, minus the compensation. If it’s a blockchain-based organization, people could be compensated for their involvement in cryptocurrency or tokens. There wouldn’t be a leader or an executive team directing everyone. But yet, it would need governance and legal status. Would a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) then be known as a D Corp, a decentralized corporation? Will we see hybrids of Organization and Projects that remove the “autonomous” from the DAO concept? Could these organizations gain their own legal status as the industry matures?It’s possible, and this actually does work to some extent when looking at bitcoin. Different factions have arisen, and there are now several different types of bitcoin out there. That’s what happens when you leave things fully decentralized. Even without leadership, there’s still been a tremendous amount of growth.On the other hand, Ethereum is less decentralized. It does have leaders facilitating the path forward in a more traditional way. I think the future lies in a hybrid of these different methods. Decentralization and open source projects certainly seem to be the dream, but it’s unlikely the blockchain and crypto space will end up operating in a fully decentralized manner.For now, the ambiguity surrounding this issue is what makes it so interesting to see how regulations will evolve, as states like Wyoming and Delaware are working on regulations, as well as countries like Malta. What comes of these efforts may be an alternative organizational structure that fits within the confines of what has already been defined—or an entirely new legal structure."

But, from each experience, domestically and abroad, there are lessons to be taken away.Abroad, we have countries like Malta (“Blockchain Island”), that are at the forefront of adopting and welcoming both blockchain technology and cryptocurrency startups to its tropical abode, and the Marshall Islands, which has issued its own cryptocurrency (crypto) as an official national currency. Yet, domestically, the U.S. dollar (USD) is still accepted. The Marshall Islands is a United Nations member and sovereign state, which creates a larger impact for banks globally because they will be forced to accept crypto. In February of this year, Venezuela launched its own oil-backed crypto called the ""petro"", but it hasn't completely removed the fiat bolivar from circulation. Despite Venezuelan excitement, it wasn't well-received abroad. Currently, Venezuela is under U.S. sanctions, with U.S. President, Donald Trump's recently issued executive order, barring anyone in the U.S. or a U.S. territory from investing in its currency. But, as we know, the emergence and utilization of digital currency has become ideal for the purpose of decentralizing our financial transactions. Still, the adoption and conversion rate are still low from a general consensus, as not everyone is convinced or fully educated on how the technology behind it works.Early Birds, Get the WormWhile still in its initial stages of development, there are still benefits for early adoption. Understanding what a digital asset is and what crypto can do for a consumer and businesses is the first step.For a B2B or B2C model, accepting crypto as a form of payment could provide a huge advantage as compared to other competitors within a given industry.I spoke with Ripple’s Senior Vice-President of Marketing and Communications, Monica Long, about the benefits they have seen businesses reap from this technology.#1 –Improving the Speed of Financial Transactions, One Country at a TimeAccording to Long, the waiting period associated with moving funds from one country to another can take an extremely long time to process. “Moving money from one country to another can be extremely costly and time-consuming; your money can be in limbo for up to five days, which is absurd when a business could be putting that capital to work,” she explained.“This friction in cross-border payments has driven enterprises to be some of the biggest champions of blockchain technology and digital assets. For example, these individuals are asking their banks to look into this realm as a solution to their problems. This is beneficial for smaller businesses who pay suppliers in other countries and have tight margins. By utilizing this technology, these mom and pop stores can help to reduce their costs and speed up the time it takes to move money.”#2 –Reducing ExpensesBy now, we all know that this technology can help reduce expenses, but what does this mean specifically for businesses?Tailoring technology to the business structure itself, regardless of its size, can help retain customers, or drive them away.On-boarded or not, businesses would do well to absorb stronger business analytics reflecting what competitors are/are not doing with their businesses.While there are many examples of major companies accepting crypto, such as Bitcoin, it’s still not a universally accepted behavior. Capitalizing off this, becoming a thought leader in this space is extremely profitable. By educating consumers and the general public on the power of this technology, could make the difference in engaging a new market. At one point, there will be a customer coming to a business' door, asking whether or not they accept crypto or not; and it needs to be ready to respond. Education, regardless of its form, is vital for a business to continue thriving in our digital age.One of the biggest marketing benefits is appealing to the dedicated fan bases of cryptocurrency. There are business communities that support economic empowerment through digital currencies and community building. For example, Bitcoin rewards only the miners and not the other actors that play an active role in maintaining, developing and promoting the project. SmartCash, on the other hand, is a community-centric cryptocurrency where community and development comes first, with the platform allocating 70% of a block reward to fund community proposals. “While only 8% of Americans are currently invested in cryptocurrencies, that percentage cares deeply about the cause. Accepting crypto at the expense of another competitor, drives the consumer market, inspiring returning customers. Not just because crypto-enthusiasts want the more convenient option, but because they’ll go out of their way to support businesses advancing the cause.”This is a very powerful community and there is a powerful message to share to the world—consumers want a change when it comes to transacting, whether it’s for personal reasons or business.#4 –What Should CMO’s Do Right Now?While there is a lot of promise with blockchain technology, there is, unfortunately, according to Long, a lot of ""hype.""We are also seeing observing many companies attempt to force these new technologies, specifically the Blockchain, into their business model. The problem? It doesn't always fit or make sense.However, understanding why a business may not necessarily require the technology, is vital to surviving in an “eat or be eaten” world.“It’s important to remember, that you don’t need the Blockchain for everything,” Long emphasized. “While some may be tempted to jump in for the buzz, building a long-term and trusted brand, means focusing on solving real world problems for customers; not jumping on the latest bandwagon.”So, what should CMO’s be looking at in determining whether or not this technology could prove useful to their consumer base?#1 - Know Your Target DemographicFirst, recognize that not all businesses will see the same benefits in adopting crypto. If your target market struggles with new technology and/or prefers traditional methods of doing things, adding crypto as an accepted method of payment may only serve to confuse them. Identify whether it's a better business decision to leave it out of the core model, or simply educate customers.Second, creating subscriber lists for your crypto users is a good way to monitor those customers who utilize crypto as a payment method. Take note of those customers who would appreciate such an option, and those who wouldn't. If possible, add those interested to a subscriber's list, separate from the rest of your customer base. This could serve as a source of announcing crypto-specific promotions and/or new developments by the company in this realm, without flooding other customers. #2 - Scour the Crypto CommunityAppoint a handful of dedicated representatives to become actively involved in crypto-community forums like CryptoCompare or Bitcoin Talk. By having dedicated representatives responsible for learning about the space, you as a business will ultimately learn more in terms of use effectiveness and how to apply these mechanisms, if at all. But, more importantly, you'll gain an understanding of what the community wants. As long as you're not overly promotional, you can even use the opportunity to mention your business and show off your latest offers.Payments are a clear and proven use case for blockchain technology, so today, CMO's should identify the source of their biggest ""pain point"" for payments. For example, is it supplier payments? Or, is it paying employees in remote locations?Once that pain point is identified, business owners can begin exploring how to utilize the Blockchain or digital assets to then remedy it.#3 - ExecutionIf you’re inclined to agree that crypto is the future, start accepting the currency. Depending on which form of crypto you plan to accept, there are various ways to dive in. Choosing an appropriate cryptocurrency exchange is vital. More importantly, run a few test transactions before making it publicly available to your market.Once you have chosen an appropriate exchange and run tests, it’s time to announce it to your market. But, when announcing it, make sure it’s more than simply placing a small icon or thumbnail on your site. In becoming a thought leader for the space, educating (accurately) the community in how the company plans to enter the space, and utilize crypto as a form of payment, will help establish trust between the thought leader and the community. If it’s anything the community enjoys, it’s understanding why people are getting involved to begin with, more than just the hype. In other words, transparency.But, it's important to remember that not all businesses can or will benefit equally by accepting crypto as a form of payment, but it does allow for a head start over the competition by accepting it early. Crypto still has many years of growth ahead of it before it becomes a national standard, but the eagerness of the crypto-community has the power to give businesses a substantial boost in the meantime."

Fortunately, more internet tools and services - created by builders who are conscious of these breaches of trust - are becoming available to everyday users. These creators are using new technological backstops to dramatically lessen the vulnerabilities we experience when surfing the web today.Many people don’t realise that the internet was never meant to be controlled by a few central authorities managing the traffic and data. Tim Berners-Lee and Web 1.0’s original architects imagined a distributed system of computers communicating with each other directly, with each user owning a bit of responsibility for maintaining their contribution to the network.Today’s Web 2.0 has cast off these original ideals and relies on large corporations to store and distribute information. Over time, these giants have amassed huge stores of data on each and every one of us, down to the individual level. This is information that can predict our probability to purchase an item or take an action – like voting for one political candidate over another. But this data also suggests ways we can be manipulated to take actions that might go against our better judgement (ever had a product you want but don’t really need follow you around the web for a few weeks?). These concentrated forces have turned the user into the product to drive revenue by either selling our data or offering advertising that is micro-targeted to influence our thoughts and decisions.A new wave of networking technologies, also known as Web 3.0, promises to return the internet to the hands of users. This movement utilises advances in peer-to-peer (p2p) technology like blockchains to build services that protect users over profits. Its decentralised, peer-to-peer nature provides a hard technological cap to the possible accumulation of power and data in the hands of monopolists. This movement isn’t just about blockchains (not everything needs a blockchain!)—it is about architecting a web that protects individual property and privacy through a range of p2p technologies.Just a few years ago, the idea that we could unseat the Web 2.0 powers that be was all but implausible. But the advent of distributed consensus protocols has enabled trustless peer-to-peer transactions in places we have previously had to rely on central authorities to hold or transmit data or value. Bitcoin and Ethereum proved the concept and ignited a belief in many of us that we now have the tools to create digital banking, court systems, and other institutions without having to trust that our data won’t be hacked or misused.And the innovation shows no signs of stopping there. Just as Web 2.0 became an integral part of society, new Web 3.0 platforms that trustlessly transmit data and value could deliver the freedom and privacy Web 1.0 was originally designed to provide."

And Litecoin Soar—Here's Why ...","Nov 5, 2018,12:04pm EST","Antique photograph: Bank of England, London","In the fast-moving world of crypto, there is always the latest thing. Over the past 18 months, we have seen the proliferation of stablecoins: tokens that are pegged to and backed by assets, like a fiat currency, gold, or other types including those where an algorithm regulates the supply of the token based on demand. There are over 50 projects in late development or live, with many more on their way, and you may have heard of some of the most prominent of those; the likes of Tether, the Winklevoss twins’ Gemini dollar, MakerDAO, and Circle’s USD Coin.Let’s just recap the fundamental question around Stablecoins: why are they useful? Stablecoins are a reaction to the fluctuations and volatility we see in cryptocurrencies with the benefits of cryptocurrency and blockchain. They offer investors – and users – the prospect of a safe haven when markets are volatile. I.e. if someone does not want to hold their wealth in fiat currency, and wants to stay within the crypto ecosystem, but needs more price stability, a stablecoin can be useful. They also offer a quick way to enter or exit highly volatile assets. Crucially, these tokens offer access to the crypto ecosystem built on the stability and endurance of the existing financial system. And often, to help guarantee stability, Stablecoins really are collateralised by another asset or coin. I.e., as an investor, you might get $100 of a stablecoin in return for $200 of ether (or just $200). The idea here is to mimic full-reserve banking, where an institution holds the equivalent to what it lends, meaning you could never have a run on a bank, because those depositing their money could withdraw at any time.But here, we are using words not usually associated with currencies, but with financial instruments – ‘tracked’, ‘collateralised’. What is a stablecoin, really, and why could they be valuable? The intention is for them to be currencies, yet, to date, they have been conceived of, built and used like financial instruments. It is vital that we find an answer to this question, because as long as it is unanswered, stablecoins cannot be effectively regulated. And, if they are not appropriately regulated, investors, the wider crypto community and the traditional banking sector are either going to steer clear, or fall foul. When talking about stablecoins, it is worth recalling the hype around Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) last year. The crypto world needs to be very careful around over-egging products and services, because doing so usually results in damage to the consumer (last year, $6bn was lost to failed ICOs). And it is not difficult to imagine the scope for bad actors: using stablecoins like a deposit-taking mechanism, or even in a ponzi scheme fashion.Instead, we must return to the same questions we apply across the financial system: who is the operator, and how do they operate? While the community, and world more widely, thrashes out an answer to what constitutes a stablecoin, I would like to suggest a framework investors and users could follow when approaching this unregulated space. First, have a look at the team behind the project. Who are they? What experience do they bring to the table? Big names and financial institutions are green flags. Second, what country are they operating from, are they registered, and are they operating under a licence? Is that licence connected to them, or are they working through a third party? Third parties should not automatically set off alarm bells, but make sure you’ve bottomed out the chain of responsibility.Third, how does the project talk about regulation and responsibility? Do they adhere to certain frameworks and standards of their own volition? What industry bodies are they part of? Fourth, what does their literature say around the offering itself? If the project is promising 1:1 parity, how is that being achieved? Can you ensure it’s true? What customer protections do they offer? Fifth, who do they work with? What payment processors do they use, for example? Digging into their banking relationships is crucial: how does custody work, and are they insured? Finally, are there signs that anti-money laundering checks and other compliance measures are in place? These checks should be required alongside a licence, so make sure they are mentioned.There are standard-setters in this emerging market. The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, the banking arm of MUFG, is reportedly looking to trial its in-house cryptocurrency next year. This is a project the bank has been working on for years. They have taken their time to create a token that will allow their 100,000 retail banking customers to do things like make payments at restaurants and shops in MUFG coins, where each coin will be equivalent to and redeemable for one yen. Well-executed and delivered stablecoins will make a huge difference to consumers. Cross-border transactions, P2P and micro-payments will suddenly be far easier, and cheaper. But while we should expect regulators and governments to continue looking closely at stablecoins and, in time, for a smart regulatory regime to hopefully emerge, in the meantime, the onus falls on individuals to make smart decisions around which stablecoins to invest in, and then use. I expect that the winners in the market will be large financial incumbents who take time self-regulating and putting the consumer front and centre. These organisations must now put their efforts into building and using the right infrastructure, and developing robust levels of trust across the board, from their banking relationships to their compliance. This will determine how well they maintain their peg amid economic difficulty – as well as the ability to explore further use cases, specific areas of utility, and broader adoption. Moreover, it is these emerging examples that will pave the way to regulation that can capture the mercurial nature of these tokens. To my mind, we will likely see different rules for different stablecoins. A stablecoin pegged to the Nasdaq should be treated like a tracker fund; one that is backed by local community assets could come under social enterprise or localism legislation. If a company is issuing a stablecoin and deposit-taking in order to back that coin, it needs to be treated like a bank. While many of us are excited to see how things play out, we know that hype and over-excitement does not pan out well in this space. Time and care need to be taken, for the sake of the consumer, and the sake of the future of the crypto space. "

[+] the pockets of investors,"Stock exchange reforms are needd to save investors money, Securities and Exchange Commissioner Robert Jackson Jr. said today.In the decade exchanges have become for-profits, the SEC has treated their efforts to make as much money as possible with kid gloves, claimed Jackson.But he said that could be changing.Jackson complained the exchanges have morphed into monopolies—with monopoly profits to match.Of the 13 stock exchanges, 12 are owned by three corporations: the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Cboe.Since it went public in 2006, the NYSE’s parent, the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) has had total annual returns of 24.1%.Its 54.3% net profit margin last year was the fourth highest of any company in the S&P 500.To reign in the exchanges and put more money in the hands of investors, the Commissioner said these reforms should be made:“When a broker places an order on behalf of a customer, we expect the broker to send the order to the exchange that is likely to get the best price for their customers.  But to nobody’s surprise, research shows that brokers very often send their orders to the exchange that gives the broker the biggest rebate,” complained the Commissioner.2. Raise the limit the exchanges can be sued for.“Ordinarily for-profit businesses in America can be sued when they are found responsible for causing harm. Yet when they are sued, stock exchanges assert that they are immune from liability on the theory that they are acting as regulators rather than profit-makers,” pointed out Jackson.He noted many exchanges require traders to agree to suing them for $6 million or less for claims each year.3. Look at the prices the exchanges charge for connections.“In a world where the costs of electronic connections are constantly falling, exchanges have asked us to raise these prices over and over again during the past three years,” the Commissioner said.Jackson said he is concerned exchanges are charging investors too much to connect, secure in the knowledge SEC rules, not market dynamics or the quality of their product, will keep prices high.In an aside, Jackson, a Democrat, asserted pushing for stock exchange reforms may be the biggest impact he can have as an SEC Commissioner from the minority party.""(SEC Chair) Jay Clayton agrees with me. This is a bipartisan issue. If I can help investors, I am going to take it,” said Jackson.His remarks came during and after a presentation he gave to a forum on market structure in suburban Washington, D.C. sponsored by the George Mason University Law School and the Healthy Markets Association."

blockchain
.On the front cover of the regulation, it reads: “The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the most important change in data privacy regulation in 20 years. The regulation will fundamentally reshape the way in which data is handled across every sector, from healthcare to banking and beyond.""It is a highfalutin gambit that hints at forward-thinking and potentially revolutionary data protection for citizens who, in the past decade or so, become freely and openly pillaged of information and data from major corporations on the internet.The GDPR has been in the building stages for some time now, and was supposed to be a bridging piece of legislation that would help with the expansion of technology from the 1990s to 2018, and to keep it in check the changing landscape.That changing landscape has moved far quicker than the European Legislators have been able to keep up with and now their forward-thinking regulation is already behind new technology in the form of blockchain.In an almost direct clash of intentions, the GDPR has effectively banned the use of blockchain technology in Europe because of its immutable nature. The GDPR offers the power back to the individual to edit and delete data which falls into the hands of centralized authorities, but when there is no centralized authority, there is no need for data to be moved around. This is the crux of the GDPR’s clash with blockchain. So, what happens to Europe and the next technological wave?A functional clash, but an ideological common groundThe GDPR is legislation that mandates individuals have access and control over the use and maintenance of their data in certain circumstances, under threat of heavy fine - €20 million, or 4% of global revenues. The blockchain on the other hand is built on a foundation of immutability, securing data on a distributed ledger.It is a direct clash of function, but, on ideological grounds, the aim of both the GDPR and blockchain is the protection of data. Both are seeking increased security in regards to data as controllers, processors and sub-processors of data under the GDPR are held to high standards and with blockchain, the encryption and decentralized structure makes the network highly tamper-resistant.Luigi Di Maio, Deputy Prime Minister of Italy and Minister of Economic Development, Labour and... [+] Social Policies, left, shakes hands with European Commissioner for Digital Economy Mariya Gabriel after a signature of 'Cooperation on a European Blockchain Partnership' during a meeting in Brussels, Thursday, Sept. 27, 2018. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo)User’s control and visibility of their data is at the forefront of the GDPR, and similarly with the blockchain, its transparent nature offers clear and direct access to data. Additionally, the reason for the GDPR coming into existence was a loss of trust in major corporations when it came to accessing individuals data, and with the blockchain, its decentralized nature totally removes controll of such data anyway.If the intentions are the same, but the functions are in conflict, there must surely be a way for Europe to embrace blockchain technology and not get left in its wake while still appreciating the work that the GDPR does with regards to centralized data control.A new standard and a respectful labelOn the face of it, blockchain and GDPR’s relationship can work - because its end goal is similar, but it is how companies enacting blockchain technology go about complying, and how the GDPR is interpreted.Thomas Power, on the board of directors at Blockchain Industry Compliance and Regulation Association (BICRA), and respected blockchain voice with a special focus on GDPR, looks at the blockchain as something that is forging ahead, but still has a long way to go.“Blockchain is a new forthcoming standard binding everything - document and/or transaction - and everyone - person our data - together almost like Internet 2.0. GDPR is merely a label on the blockchain that people will choose to observe, respect and recognise. It's a good label,"" he told Forbes“However, blockchain requires 15 to 18 years to hit mainstream based on bitcoin blockchain 2008 I see mainstream Blockchain in the 2023-2026 timeframe, post the 2020-2022 economic crash, much like 2007-2009.”To this end, Power notes that there is indeed a level of compliance and flexible interpretation that is taking place, which is helping blockchain remain relevant in Europe, while still respecting the GDPR.Blockchain and the GDPR may look like enemies, but really, they are more like frenemies.“[Compliance and interpretation] will keep happening more and more once the first Blockchain - Bitcoin - is recognised by The SEC, likely 2019,” Power added. “This event is the catalyst to recognise crypto assets as an asset class here to stay, albeit in embryo.“First they [GDPR and blockchain] will battle and challenge, then they will harmonise because they are not enemies, rather Frenemies. What I like about GDPR is it forces the highest data standards to citizens who choose to publish, store, or record their documents and transactions on the blockchain. It also places that same discipline on companies, governments and institutions both public and private.”“Blockchain is a 30 year movement all of this will seem like trivia in 2038 and personally I am a fan of GDPR ...and of course Blockchain. I like the highest data standards for citizens and companies.”Will the GDPR take stock of its position?With legal interpretation, there often follows amendments to regulations and law, so as these two entities feel each other out and blockchain becomes more recognized and legitimised, while the GDPR finds its feet, there are bound to be changes in the law down the line.“Data is a moving feast, privacy is a moving feast and tracking products from mines to shelves requires a record of every document and transaction held on a blockchain. Yes massive changes will be required once people understand what a blockchain is and what recording and tracking all documents and transactions requires. We may finally see the paperless office in 2038 and we were promised this in the 1980s yet we print more now than then…” Power concluded."

During their previous day jobs with the Illinois state government, the duo began to explore how decentralized technology like that which powers bitcoin could help make that possible. Morris, Illinois’ former director of blockchain strategy, and O’Rourke, the state’s former deputy director of entrepreneurship, worked together on five early-stage blockchain efforts for Illinois, including the potential use of blockchain as a more transparent way to issue deeds for state property and a way to increase state citizens’ access of and control over their own healthcare records.But time and again, one thing got in the way of modernizing the way the state deals with industries far beyond just real estate and healthcare: how the state’s citizens prove who they are at every step of the way, from basic logins using Facebook to more sophisticated forms of identity, including driver’s licenses, social security cards and more. Who owned the data, how it was controlled, and whether it was honored across borders proved almost insurmountable obstacles.So, in March 2018, Morris, 27, and O’Rourke, 37, left their government positions to build a private solution called Attest, which they hope will serve not only Illinois citizens and U.S. citizens but also citizens around the world. Now, after eight months of quietly toiling away, Attest has announced its first major partnership, with Deloitte, and a potential integration into one of the Big Four accounting firm’s existing end-to-end solutions.“I wouldn’t say it’s a replacement but a truly digital version of your social security card, your driver’s license, your health records,” says Morris, who is the chief executive officer of Attest. “But one that allows you to cryptographically authenticate to a variety of different service providers in a way that you would typically with Facebook Connect or Google Sign-in.”Based in Chicago, Attest has so far been bootstrapped by Morris and O’Rourke. After incubating the company within a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) working group, the pair formed a technical partnership with web 3.0 solutions platform Digital Bazaar to build out the government identity solution. Attest is currently working to build two products. The first product is cryptographically secured identity storage that is similar to the wallets bitcoin owners use to store cryptocurrency. But instead of storing cryptocurrency, the Attest wallet will let users store digital versions of a wide range of government and corporate IDs in a single place. Unlike current government IDs, which show a citizen’s address even when it is being used only as a proof of age, Attest wallets are being designed to let users control who sees what and how the information is monetized, if at all.The current ways of proving identity via a central authority have a number of weaknesses. Driver’s licenses and social security cards rely on paper and plastic solutions that are easier to forge than cryptographic signatures. Corporate solutions like Facebook are increasingly being questioned for the way they monetize their users' data, and credit agencies like Equifax create what some call a “honey pot” of data that has already lured successful hackers.By moving identity data to individual wallets tracked on a distributed ledger, those honey pots could be decentralized, which would force a hacker to break into each wallet individually. “In some sense the economics of cyber risk start to shift a little bit because with blockchain,” says Morris, “it’s a bit more distributed, and it’s encrypted on a per-user basis.”A second product, called Attest Enterprise, will consist of two application programming interfaces (APIs) that give users the ability to authenticate who they are, authorize third parties and provide consent to others to manage their identities on their behalf, if they so choose. “We are trying to provide consumers with as many tools to manage that on their own as possible,” says Morris. “But also understand that there are certain portions of the population that are not going to be able manage that key as easily.”While Morris and O'Rourke, who serves as the company’s president, provide insider expertise on the bureaucratic and logistical hurdles involved in building a decentralized identity, they’re relying largely on Digital Bazaar’s technical work to integrate two main open standards into Attest’s identity solution. Only part of the final product is expected to employ blockchain technology, and which blockchain platform Attest will use has yet to be determined.Specifically, Attest and Digital Bazaar’s team of eight employees are building the identity platform to let governments certify driver’s licenses, social security cards, etc., using a verifiable credentials specification developed in a W3C working group. Also crucial for getting blockchain identity right, O’Rourke says, are the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s federal information processing (FIPS) standards, first developed as a Federal standard for information storage and now widely used by the private sector as well.The two Attest tools are being designed to let a citizen moving to a new state or country for a job simultaneously update his or her deed to property and the health insurance coverage provided by his or her new employer at a single place, for example. “Being able to have one standardized data set that can interoperate between these two very different departments and two very different use cases would be incredibly valuable,” says O’Rourke.Morris and O’Rourke will be working with blockchain leader Wendy Henry, Deloitte’s managing director of government services, to build government-compliant identifiers that can be used by the Big Four accounting firm’s clients. But Attest will face stiff competition.In addition to Deloitte’s launch of its own Smart Identity proof of concept in 2016, a number of other blockchain identity solutions are being developed, including by enterprises like IBM and venture-backed startups like Civic. In September, Deloitte published a report assessing blockchain initiatives that are being explored by the public sector, including applications involving intragovernmental transactions, voting, land registrations, supply chain, healthcare and taxation.But Deloitte’s Henry calls blockchain identity the “holy grail” her firm and others have been chasing “for a while and not quite getting there.” If Attest succeeds in its goal, Deloitte is ready and waiting, says Henry: “We are looking to integrate them into an end-to-end solution where they’ll help provide some of the digital identity credentials that I can’t divulge.”"

The Chain and Lightyear brands will both be retired as a result of the deal. At launch, Interstellar will employ 60 people, with headquarters in San Francisco and offices in New York City.Ludwin says the acquisition was for “significantly more than $40 million” the investors put into Chain, adding that the company “has had millions in revenue and millions of dollars in the bank,” though he declined to share further details. “Chain did not need to sell the company,” he said. “This needed to be a great strategic move and a great return and it was both.” In addition to Ludwin's taking over as CEO of the new Interstellar company, Stellar creator Jed McCaleb will take over as chief technical officer. McCaleb, who is also a co-founder of Stellar competitor Ripple and founder of the closed Mt Gox cryptocurrency exchange, will continue his duties at the foundation, which facilitates development on the open source Stellar code.The lumens cryptocurrency is valued at $0.2 each, with a total market value of $3.9 billion.As part of the deal, Chain’s existing enterprise customers using its Chain Core software for permissioned blockchain—including Visa, Nasdaq and Citigroup—will now be served by Interstellar. Fintech customers Cloudwalk and LPS, a French insurance company, which use Chain's Sequence cloud storage services, will also move to Interstellar.  Ludwin compares the permissioned blockchain environments running to Chain’s existing clients as a layer that will sit on top of the public blockchain platform created by Stellar and powered by the lumen cryptocurrency. A trading service expected to launch soon, called StellarX, for crypto-assets created on the Stellar blockchain, will also move under the Interstellar umbrella.Last year Visa announced it had launched the first phase of a B2B payments network powered by Chain, and Nasdaq and Citi revealed a separate joint project for cross-border payments using Chain. While Ludwin later said he had six similar networks in various stages of development, he has now described a number of obstacles preventing further growth.Specifically, he says Chain was unable to bring new customers together without a public network, and his company briefly considered launching its own public blockchain. But when McCaleb last year launched Lightyear as a way to lure partners to build on Stellar, Ludwin said, the pair reevaluated their trajectories. “Chain and Stellar had equal and opposite problems,” said Ludwin. Problems they now believe can best be solved together.The merger points to the larger concern in the blockchain space of how permissioned networks can interoperate with other platforms. While the U.S. Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation built its soon-to-be launched blockchain platform to interoperate with the public ethereum blockchain, the Chain merger shows another possible path forward.“Chain’s team has led the market for enterprise adoption of blockchain technology,” said McCaleb in a statement. “Which is a critical component of building a future where money and digital assets move over open protocols.”"

These companies, many of which focus their efforts on devising solutions for the 50% of the population lacking a bank account, are accomplishing what the government and traditional banks have failed to achieve: offering real and impactful solutions to put Argentina's 45 million people in control of their finances.The dilemma among the startups is how best to enact change and address the dysfunction--fixing the cracks and working from within or dismantling the system and starting over. This article elaborates on Argentina’s financial access issues, and highlights 3 distinct approaches companies are taking to facilitate greater inclusion and control: creating a new financial system, re-designing the existing system, and working within the existing system. Each approach is represented by a leading local Fintech startup.The Access IssueI arrived in Argentina in June 2018, in the midst of the national economic crisis. In the month I spent in the country, inflation rose to 30% and the Argentine peso fell 20% relative to the U.S. dollar. This dire situation has continued over the past several months, with Argentine President Mauricio Macri controversially seeking and receiving a US$57 billion bailout courtesy of the IMF.Economic instability in Argentina is nothing new; a history of economic crises has made the population highly suspicious of traditional banking. Suspicion is one of the many factors leading to low financial inclusion and access to financial services in the country--people simply don’t trust banks. Along with distrust, a desire to avoid taxation, a lack of funds or documentation, and the high cost of services all contribute to the low level of access to financial services, according to Global Findex data. Many Argentines work in the informal sector, and receive their wages in cash. They don’t meet the requirements issued by traditional banks.The lack of access to financial services makes it virtually impossible for Argentina’s unbanked to secure a loan, and hinders their ability to save for the future and grow their funds. It also means they must rely on creative, yet time consuming solutions to shop online or pay bills and rent. As Martin Frankel, Founder of AreaTres, the preeminent co-working space and entrepreneurial hub in Buenos Aires, noted: “everything in Argentina is a workaround because bureaucratic systems from banking to the electrical grid can’t be relied on.” These workarounds are effective stopgaps, but they also perpetuate non-transparency and inefficiency.The issue of access extends even to those with bank accounts and participants in the formal economy. In this case, the issue is not as much access to services, but access to capital. Given the extreme economic volatility and inflation, banked individuals and businesses are not able to consistently, transparently, and promptly control their finances. A common sight in Buenos Aires is passing by a bank with long lines of people waiting to withdraw their funds shortly after they are deposited.Customers wait on line outside a bank in Buenos Aires to withdraw fundsWhat’s needed now more than ever in Argentina are bold technology solutions that promote financial accessibility and control, rather than merely making inaccessibility bearable. Apart from Argentina’s notoriety owing to its financial woes, the country is also known as the home of four of the seven largest technology unicorns in Latin America during the 2000s, including regional powers Mercado Libre (an e-commerce marketplace), OLX (a regional take on Craigslist), Despegar (an online travel booking site), and Globant (a software development company). In a country characterized by booms and busts, technology companies have become adept at anticipating and addressing instability. Here are three approaches Fintech startups are taking to drive greater financial access and control, whether by bypassing or mending the traditional system in place.Creating A New System With Blockchain Technology: RipioRipio logoRipio is a digital payments startup aiming to strengthen financial access in Argentina and the rest of Latin America through blockchain technology. Originally launched as the first bitcoin payment processor in Latin America in 2013, the company subsequently pivoted to a B2C model that now includes a digital wallet, exchange, and credit services. Today, its average annual revenue tops US$15 million.Ripio’s decentralized services in many ways replace the consumer need for the centralized banks of today. Its digital wallet trades between bitcoin and pesos as well as between ethereum and pesos, and also allows users to send and receive money. Ripio has made the fiat-cryptocurrency transfer process as easy as possible for its 220,000 cash-heavy users, even partnering with Mercado Libre to allow users to transfer money between their wallets and Mercado Pago, Mercado Libre’s in-store and online payment system. Apart from its wallet, Ripio enables users to exchange several cryptocurrencies. Across these services, company revenue comes from the spread when trades are executed.Ripio allows you to buy, send, and receive bitcoinsWhat differentiates Ripio is that it has begun to build additional blockchain-backed financial services on top of its more common crypto services. In 2017, the company raised US$37 million through an ICO to launch the Ripio Credit Network (RCN), a peer-to-peer global credit network using the RCN token and its associated smart contracts to secure loans. As Co-Founder and CEO Sebastian Serrano described, users can request credit through their digital wallet, which then creates a smart contract enabling people from around the world to finance the loan request. The company charges a small fee for each loan.This breakthrough network, launched to all Ripio users last month, represents a rare example of an ICO resulting in a functional product experiencing large-scale growth. It is not constrained by Argentina or any other country’s borders in the same way that traditional credit systems are. In fact, most of the loans secured so far on the RCN are funded by Asian lenders and subsequently dispensed in local currencies. Foreign lenders are interested in loaning, as Argentine interest rates are superior to the interest rates in more stable economies. RCN also represents a significantly more cost effective lending solution: the total cost of creating a loan and going through the full loan lifecycle is less than US$1 for Ripio.Ripio has experienced impressive growth so far because of how well suited its value proposition is to Argentina’s system. Argentina is one of the few countries where blockchain-backed currencies are used by regular consumers for real retail transactions. To give a sense of the rate of adoption of bitcoin/cryptocurrency in Argentina, Serrano noted: “Unocoin, the biggest crypto platform in India, has 1.2 million users while India has a population of over 1 billion people. Ripio already has 200,000 users in a country with a population of 45 million.” In addition to enabling easy movement between fiat and cryptocurrency, crypto platforms like Ripio help Argentines bypass strict government restrictions surrounding foreign currency exchange. They also have the potential to offer protection from high annual inflation rates and the highly unstable Argentine peso.It should be noted that currently many cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin in particular, are highly volatile in their own right, with bitcoin’s value declining by more than half so far in 2018. Serrano acknowledges this fluctuation, but believes that in the long-term, crypto will grow at a greater rate than the peso, which is at constant risk of significant devaluation and highly susceptible to even minor instabilities in more mature global markets.Looking ahead, Ripio’s plans include investing in new educational channels featuring exclusive content to spread the word about crypto and the power of blockchain. It also plans to continue building financial services using blockchain, for current markets Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico, and additional markets such as Colombia, Chile, and Uruguay.Re-Designing The System With A Digital-Only Bank: UaláUalá logoWhile Ripio and others are concentrating their efforts on building blockchain-backed technology to overtake Argentina’s financial system, mobile banking startup Ualá is focused on redesigning what a bank looks like and how it functions. Ualá launched its mobile banking app in October 2017, and has already attracted major attention from both users and investors. The company issued over 400,000 cards in Argentina in the past year--well beyond its original projections of 100,000 cards issued in 2018--and last week closed a US$34 million Series B round including investments from Goldman Sachs, George Soros’ family office, Ribbit Capital, and more.Ualá is the brainchild of Pierpaolo Barbieri, an economist and economic historian by training. Before founding the company, Barbieri worked at a macroeconomic hedge fund and oversaw its investment in Argentina around the political transition in 2015. Barbieri’s involvement led him to become a sizable shareholder in some of the country’s large private banks. In this capacity, he received an insider view of how the banks operate and their profitability despite half the population not having access to the financial system and its services.Following this experience, Barbieri started thinking about how to use technology to tackle the issue of financial access, equipped with his deep knowledge of the banking system. After working on the product throughout 2016, he launched it a year later.The beauty of the Ualá product lies in its simple design and services, across its mobile app and associated prepaid Mastercard. Unlike most bank mobile apps which are replications of bank websites, the Ualá app cannot afford to be complex given that many of its users have never had a card before or used a banking app. Additionally, in contrast to traditional banking fees, there are no opening, closing, maintenance or renewal fees when using Ualá.Ualá's mobile app and prepaid MastercardUalá’s app offers a host of unique services for its customers: free peer-to-peer transfers, real-time tracking and control of expenditures, transfers via QR (and thus WhatsApp), and instant bank transfers to top up mobile phone credit. Future plans include widespread bill payment and credit lending. Along with the app, a prepaid international Mastercard is provided that users can use to purchase in-store or online, enroll in digitally native services like Netflix or Spotify, and withdraw funds from ATMs worldwide. Ualá makes money from the interchange fees paid by Mastercard as part of each transaction, and does not take a cut from merchants or customers.These services represent a massive simplification of the cash-payment workarounds listed earlier, and have been embraced in Argentina, where smartphone usage is expected to increase from 40% of the population to 70% by 2020, according to research conducted by GSMA. In particular, Ualá has struck a chord with Argentina’s younger generation: as of July 2018, 72% of users were below the age of 30. These tech savvy core users are also highly loyal--over 50% of Ualá’s users come from word of mouth referrals.The rise of digital-only banks like Ualá, otherwise known as neobanks, is not unique to Argentina. Notable neobanks include the U.K.’s Revolut, Germany’s N26, and the U.S.’s Chime. The Brazilian neobank Nubank is another prominent example, as it has experienced massive growth in Latin America and has exploded to a greater than US$4 billion valuation. However, the Nubank model is different from that of Ualá, as Nubank provides a credit card and acts as a credit card operator in contrast to Ualá and its prepaid card offering.What differentiates Ualá from most other neobanks is the level of need it is addressing, and the urgency with which it is addressing this need. It offers services that were previously unavailable in Argentina, and more than that, it is educating a new segment of the population not previously addressed by traditional banks. When asked about growth prospects, Barbieri is quick to point out that the lack of financial penetration and access is an issue throughout Latin America. He and his team are looking at additional markets with similar sizes and with close proximity to Argentina.Both Ripio and Ualá are providing radical solutions to shake up the traditional banking world. As Barbieri proclaimed: “my commitment is that by the middle of 2019, having a regular bank will be superfluous. You’ll be able to conduct your whole financial life directly on Ualá.” That said, Barbieri and Ualá hope to apply pressure on traditional banks to ‘Ualá-fy’ their services. Barbieri also noted: “If we fail but we push the system to improve for the user, then we will have succeeded. We see a lot of similar products coming from the ‘digital’ side of the banks, but the normal channels still charge fees to open accounts, maintain accounts, close accounts and more. I would love to see one of the traditional banks drop their fees to compete against us.”Working In The System With Data Processing & Visualization Tools: IncreaseIncrease logoThe final company profiled offering a divergent approach to promoting financial access and control is B2B startup Increase. Increase was co-founded by CEO Sebastian Cadenas in early 2014, and enables businesses to regain control of their income. Its IncreaseCard platform is a digital dashboard displaying an overview of a business’ cash flow and aggregating credit card transaction/source of income information. It presents the amount of money to be deposited in a business’ bank account each day, and accounts for coupons, settlements, taxes and withholdings.The IncreaseCard dashboardSince winning Google’s Demo Day competition in March, the company has continued to scale and now counts over 25,000 business clients in Argentina, including both small businesses representing 70% of the client base, and large businesses such as Shell, Latam, and Despegar. It has been cash positive since the beginning of 2017, reinvesting capital into the business since then. The reason behind Increase’s success: it works with banks and credit card companies to offer a simple solution to a dire need for businesses in Argentina and Latin America. In Latin America, companies receive their income from several sources, with different payment schedules and fees. In Argentina for instance, each credit card company from Visa to Mastercard to American Express pays at different times and presents information in a different way, making control of payments difficult.The result of this fragmentation is a lack of visibility and transparency into company sales. In the words as Cadenas, “business owners don’t know what they’re receiving, when they’re receiving it, and how much to pay back.” Moreover, in Argentina among other countries, it can take up to a month for business owners to be paid in full due to constant inflation. Customers pay their statements a month after their purchases, making it difficult for a credit card company to pay merchants in the interim knowing that when the customer eventually pays, the value of the payment will be less owing to inflation.The IncreaseCard platform receives transactional information from the acquiring banks as soon as batches of transactions are processed, and presents this information immediately to its clients. It integrates directly with merchant point of sale terminals, charging merchants per points of sale connected, and as of June 2018, the equivalent of over 1% of the national GDP flowed through Increase’s system over a one month period.Before Increase came along, business owners were running their businesses without any control, leading them to waste both time and money. There are companies across Latin America that cover some of the services offered by Increase--for example in Brazil, a single company oversees reconciliation--but no other company offers the breadth of services offered by Increase.Next up for Increase is regional expansion to Ecuador and Uruguay by the end of the year, followed by the Dominican Republic and Peru in Q1 2019. This expansion will be supported by a recently closed US$3 million Series A round, including investments from Agrega Partners, Revolution's Rise of the Rest Seed Fund, and Mercado Libre Fund among others. Increase will continue to work to integrate with credit card companies like Visa and acquiring banks in each country to open the flow of merchant transactional information. In Ecuador alone, partnering with the country’s largest bank, Banco Pichincha, is expected to net Increase another 50,000 merchants making use of its platform.The company is also working on launching a new product--a credit scoring product that lets merchants present their credit card information to different bank institutions Increase works with in order to offer loans to the merchants. This will provide merchants cash in advance instead of them waiting 15-20 days to receive their receivables from the credit card companies. It is yet another example of the ways in which Increase has successfully worked within the current financial system leveraging technology to create value for businesses in Argentina, and soon, throughout the region.The Right DirectionThe above companies each is employing a different strategy in addressing issues related to financial access, transparency, and control in Argentina and more broadly in Latin America. What they have in common is a sense of purpose to make life easier for individuals and businesses. As Sebastian Serrano said: “here [in Argentina] we can actually change how people live and give access to something that was blocked before.”But which of these approaches is the correct one? I’d like to suggest the answer is all of the above. In the short term, crypto platforms solely providing trading services between cryptocurrencies and local currency are a risky proposition given cryptocurrency issues with instability and fluctuation. Regulation as well as education is needed to build trust among users. And yet, there is potential surrounding blockchain-based financial services applications more broadly: for example, blockchain can be used by banks to make payment transfers faster and cheaper and to power easier and more efficient loans. In fact, according to a Ripio survey that polled 890 Argentina-based users of Ripio, nearly 40% of respondents said blockchain will take over the financial system in the next five to ten years.Neobanks are a solid middle ground solution, although it will take time before digital banks can offer the full range of services currently offered by traditional banks, and for the unbanked and underbanked to understand and fully take advantage of these services (or perhaps not if Pierpaolo Barbieri’s goal of Ualá as an end-to-end bank by mid-2019 is achieved). Until then, companies like Increase have proven it’s possible to create real and lasting impact while working within the current system.This is not to say attention and investment should not continue to be devoted to visionary projects like those mentioned above. On the contrary, progress in these directions should be encouraged to make them more viable, scalable, and sustainable. That way, traditional financial institutions will be driven to incorporate these new ideas into their own operations, whether that means fundamentally changing payment transfers and lending, or eliminating banking fees. Entrepreneurs and investors should view traditional financial institutions as technology adopters as opposed to technology innovators and take an ‘if you build it, they will come’ stance. For if traditional institutions don’t adopt aspects of these new technologies, it’s only a matter of time before they are left behind and excluded from the financial system of the future."

More to the point, they could sell it themselves.That is the goal of one new start-up, CyberVein, who want to guarantee the integrity of data but using a faster proof of work concept most commonly used in digital currency.With its blockchain-based system guaranteeing this link of shared data, CyberVein believes organizations that have so far been reluctant to share information can now be more confident in doing so.Controlled sharingThrough a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture - touted as Blockchain 3.0 - CyberVein has two functions, to protect and transfer user data while opening up a new platform for its potential sale. For instance, it cites pharmaceutical companies and researchers into machine learning as just two examples of users who could benefit by sharing their data with others but who are also worried about potentially losing control over it.In its White Paper, CyberVein believes that by using its system universities and research organizations would be “incentivized to perform collaborative research, maintain their heavy-duty datasets, and to make them publicly available”, while governments could be more transparent with the information they collect.“Maintaining databases with qualities that are normally attributed to blockchains – meaning immutability, security, and transparency – makes enormous sense in a variety of industry, research and governance use cases,” says Arthur Yu, CyberVein founder who previously worked with J.P. Morgan in London and holds finance and computer science degrees from Imperial College there.“Players in the global market often need to share information and rely on data they pool and maintain collectively. Supply chain management is one obvious scenario, but there are many more. This can be very problematic if these players have good reasons not to trust each other. Immutable, decentralized databases solve this gracefully,” he says.CyberVein makes this possible by employing blockchain technology. The basic principle resembles that used to secure digital currencies such as Bitcoin: multiple records are kept of all data, stored on a distributed network. Only if all those copies of the records agree that a certain data item is valid will it be accepted as correct.This means there’s no single “master record” that can be hacked – an unauthorized change to one copy of the data will easily be detected and rejected because the others won’t match up.In the case of Bitcoin, the data items might be financial transactions. With CyberVein, they can be any kind of information.Not just replicating existing blockchain techBut for the Shenzhen-based CyberVein team, which started work last October and hopes to have a system up and running by the end of this year, it wasn’t merely a matter of replicating existing blockchain tech. The databases that it envisages handling will be far bigger than the relatively limited amount of financial data currently protected by blockchain.“Traditional blockchains are not designed to store vast amounts of structured data, especially if this data is being constantly processed by many participants in parallel. In order to build a network of decentralized databases, CyberVein has reinvented fundamental blockchain principles,” says the company.Following this rethink, it’s confident that its design can process thousands of transactions per second – whereas the heavy demands that security measures make on Bitcoin’s technology, for example, mean it can only handle seven.CyberVein is not staying completely out of the financial world. Its system also supports the selling of data: owners can set a price and collect payment either through CyberVein’s own DAG-based cryptocurrency, CyberVein Tokens, or via other routes.Observes Yu: “Datasets could be valued and shopped around to interested buyers or licensees. It might be most instructive to think of CyberVein as standardizing data in such a way that it can be attached monetary value – due to the fact that the new tech allows it to be stored and transferred securely and very quickly – and then traded in the free market. In theory, this has boundless potential for making data ‘valuable’ in any field.”Even individuals could “take tiny, cumulative payments for data they generate day-to-day”, such as that generated by car sensors or a grocery store receipt, Yu predicts.That could give a whole new meaning to crowdsourcing.Still, for CyberVein – which is backed by private funders including Trend Capital, Kernas Capital and Ant Blockchain Alliance – the major opportunity is likely to be with organizations producing a lot more information.Those could include big data providers, and authorities in smart cities that generate millions of data points every day about activity in their community.For them, CyberVein – allowing data to be open, but not too open – could prove the best of both worlds."

[+] Photo/Richard Drew)","Reports of the downfall of social media giant and pioneer, Snap are coming at a rapid pace, with the company’s stock price declining by over 25% in less than one month. The recently admirable company continues to falter in growing its product offerings for users, causing its user base to drop from 192 million to 188 million. Snap is losing talent throughout its business, and faces increasing competition from other social media and technology giants. While all social media giants such as Facebook and Twitter are experiencing growth difficulties, Snap's year has been a very unexpected one. Questions about their investor structure and concerns raised about changing revenue plans point directly to blockchain technology as a possible point of disruption.The United States is currently in a battle over censorship, one in which social media giants such as Facebook and Twitter are censoring users and posts as they see fit. This came to a head as radio host Alex Jones was recently censored on most major social media outlets for what they claim is a violation of their hate speech and bullying policies.Other types of censorship which are blatant in the industry involve de-monetizing users, a practice especially prevalent on content-based platforms such as YouTube. This demonetization occurs when a social media company takes away the ability for a content creator to monetize from their content via ads, generally because the material is deemed too controversial or explicit. Snap itself is in the middle of a censorship dilemma after it blocked the Al-Jazeera account in multiple Gulf nations. This seems to be an odd scenario, given that Snap is a US-based company. Yaser Bishr, Al-Jazeera's executive director of digital, noted, ""The fundamental question is, how could a U.S. company which is publicly traded and stands for freedom of speech where access to social media is a constitutional right, deny these rights to others?""Censorship of this variety is putting into question the ability for social media companies to control free speech and open markets in ways which are unconstitutional. While there are many different opinions on this topic, one thing is clear, these social media giants have obtained so much power they are able to take control over their users in ways which are troubling. The newest evolution of blockchain-based social networks operates under a decentralized governance model which provides adequate incentive to users to align them with other business stakeholders in a way which could disrupt the entire industry.This ideology has birthed a new organization type known as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) in which no centralized party controls the company, and decisions are left to be made by the entire network. This takes away power and control from central entities.Alessio Quaglini, Managing Partner of HEX Capital Group, notes, “Blockchain and other decentralized technologies give users a final say, stabilize the system, reduce structural asymmetries and provide economic incentives to users. From proof-of-work (Bitcoin) to proof of stake (Ethereum) to third generation protocols like EOS using delegated proof of stake, the industry is constantly testing, improving and iterating to find the most effective governance methods for each type of decentralized organization.”The government has a number of roles to the public; as a record keeper, as a facilitator, and as a legal mediator. If the government records have a vulnerability, are kept in outdated and unreliable systems and cannot be reproducible, the public has a lot at stake. Blockchain is one of the few technologies that can be applied to replace outdated and unreliable systems with new levels of security and encryption providing value and benefit to the government institutions but also the general main street. Public institutions and processes can be resistant to change for a number of reasons like lack of funding to implement systems, reliance on legacy systems and overall fear. However, government processes need to be reliable, robust and secure, for the aforementioned reasons.  “It is very important to launch several successful projects that use blockchain technology in the public sector,"" says Sasha Ivanov, Founder and CEO of Waves Platform and Vostok project. “The most obvious application of blockchain technology is public registries, such as real estate, intellectual property rights, and other types of contracts.“Implementation of blockchain technology in public services would be a decisive step towards blockchain's mass adoption and provide unsurmountable value to the general public through government,"" believes Ivanov.This decentralized model provides an economic reward for users of a social media platform which large corporations such as Snap and its social media counterparts can’t contest with. Users are paid in cryptocurrency for using a social media platform, and therefore have much more of an incentive to attract the rest of their network to the platform and support its continued growth. When faced with using a social network in which there is economic incentive vs. a network which collects and sells user data, users will likely look to utilize the platforms which provide the most benefit to themselves. One of the scariest things for consumers and a barrier to growth for social media companies have been security concerns surrounding digital identity. The creation of decentralized networks for identity attestation in conjunction with biometric verification is proving to be a more promising solution than current options for consumers and businesses alike. One example of this technology is Metadium, a blockchain-based company creating a decentralized identity protocol to give individuals complete control of their digital identity. Because Metadium only stores the root hash of a merkle tree on its blockchain, users can disclose information to third-parties via the root hash whenever desired, all without putting personal data at risk of being compromised. At the same time, the blockchain stores retrieval requests of personal information, making it easy to determine exactly when and who is attempting to steal or manipulate data. Such solutions provide users with more assurance their identity is safe online and creates social networks in which user identities are not in question. “The potential for a cryptocurrency inside a widely adopted messaging app or social app is enormous,” says Sarah Austin, a blockchain influencer (Forbes under30) and CMO at SONchain, “Adopting a cryptocurrency could give Snapchat independence from banks, investors, and even talent who hold the company accountable to revenue benchmarks dependent on advertisers. Crypto features give apps freedom from advertisers.”While it is still early in the evolution of blockchain-based social networks, there are several projects already in existence which are attracting users. Mithril incentivizes all content creators through a process it calls “social mining”, which rewards users across a decentralized network, and can expand to incorporate new social media platforms. Sphere is another decentralized social network which mimics much of the functionality of Facebook, but without the security and identity concerns, users now have after the company’s Cambridge Analytica scandal. Diaspora allows users to choose where their personal data is stored in what it calls “pods”, where each pod is managed and operated in different physical locations and by different stakeholders. This gives users even more control over their data and personal information than ever before. It is clear Snap is struggling to continue growing its business in a technological climate which is moving away from centralized corporate entities and toward their decentralized counterparts. This shift is not only technological in nature but psychological and ethical as well, with decentralized entities mitigating the risks of censorship and identity security across their platforms. The stronghold Snap and its corporate brethren seem to have on the social media industry look to be slipping with each passing day. "

I’ve been investing in technology stocks since 1987. That’s when I invested $30,000 of my life savings into Microsoft. Being an engineer, I felt that I understood technology. I grew the Microsoft investment to over $1 million, then diversified. It was worth $7 million by the dot com bubble. I then lost 80% of that money in the dot com bust. I learned about diversification the hard way.Which asset has had the biggest returns over time? Why?Technology stocks have been unbelievable. My investments in Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple have all been growing by double digits.
How involved are you in selecting your assets?I’m very involved. I do have some advisers and discretionary managers that help, but I generally make all the final decisions myself.Do you enjoy picking investments?I really do. It’s kind of like a hobby for me. I do a lot of reading, like the Wall Street Journal. It’s one thing that I do for fun.When did you start investing?In 1986, when Microsoft went public, I was allocated just 100 shares in the IPO. My broker said, “Hey you got a profit all ready” and tried to convince me to sell it. I didn’t. Way before that, I asked my dad – he was a stock investor – in high school about investing. He started me on phantom stock investments in high school.What kind of stocks do you buy?Mostly tech, some non-tech. My advisers are pushing me to invest elsewhere but technology stocks make up 25% of my portfolio. It’s what I understand and am comfortable with. Bonds are about half my portfolio. Alternatives (hedge funds, private equity, lending funds) make up the rest.How do you decide what stocks to buy?  Price/earnings to growth for technology stocks. I look for stocks that are growing fast, have profits, a low PEG ratio (under 2).Do you buy and hold most of these stocks or sell them when you make a profit?I’m looking to buy and hold stocks, not trade. I’ve held Apple stock for over a decade, Microsoft for 20 to 30 years. I like stocks I can buy and forget about. The hardest thing is knowing when to sell…I actually bought more Facebook stock during the Cambridge Analytica scandal.What kinds of bonds do you invest in?Bonds with 2-year maturity. The municipal bonds are managed by an outside firm. My bond portfolio is very diversified, mostly short-term maturities.Why do you invest in private equity and hedge funds? Being diversified is the best risk mitigator. Private equity provides compensation for being illiquid. I’m committed for 7 to 10 years or so. Private equity track records are attractive to me. I expect to get a 15% to 20% return on private equity. Meanwhile, I’m reducing my investments in hedge funds [because of] poor returns.  They are fantastic for hedge fund managers, but bad for investors.What are your views on crypto-currencies?I think they’re interesting. I’ve bought some, just a little bit to get experience and learn about them. I made some money in crypto – I sold my bitcoin before it went down. I haven’t decided whether it’s going to be a big thing long-term or a fad yet. Some might do well but I don’t know enough to say for sure.Are there other new technologies that you are following?I’ve been following electric vertical take-off and landing stuff, going to NASA meetings. I’m looking into opportunities to invest in startups in this area. There’s a California company that made public its aircraft recently – the Opener Blackfly. I’m hoping to invest in this one in particular. I was recently talking to the owner and founder Marcus Leng about a possible investment but it’s backed by Larry Page of Google so they’re not looking hard for other investors. I’ve been talking to others in the space, going to conferences.I was invested in Tesla, but I sold it in July. Its valuation was too high in my opinion – great company though. I want to buy a Tesla roadster when it comes out in 2022. If the valuation goes down, I may buy more.What's the best investment advice you ever got. The best investment advice I’ve received is to be diversified.  I like stocks, bonds, real estate and lending funds.What other advice do you have? I would also advise others wanting to get started investing to begin with broad market ETF’s initially but do it slowly over time.  It can discouraging if you put it all to work at once just before a market turndown."

In one, Millennials are job-hopping crypto-crazed maniacs who would rather buy bitcoin than bonds. In the other, they’re a generation so scarred by the Great Recession that they cling to any chance for job security and keep their money (what little they have left after student loan payments) in cash.Of course, with so many Millennials around (they’ll displace the Baby Boomers next year as America’s largest living adult generation), you can find examples to fit any stereotype. But a decade after the financial crisis, there’s evidence that as a whole, the generation and its attitudes toward work and money have indeed been influenced by the Great Recession. Stefan Nagel, a finance professor at the the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, says he’s seen this phenomenon with Depression-era babies. In a 2009 study, he found that people who experienced low stock-market returns throughout their lives (such as those who came of age in the 1960s) report lower willingness to take financial risk and are less likely to participate in the stock market. And if they do participate, they invest a lower fraction of their liquid assets in stocks. This is true for today’s Millennials, who may have a more pessimistic attitude toward traditional investing, he says. In fact, 30% of Millennials say cash is their long-term investment of choice, while previous generations lean toward stocks, according to a recent Bankrate survey.Ironically, wariness of stocks and traditional investments may explain some of the interest in bitcoin, too—an outlet for those who might, in a different era, have been day-trading stocks. (It’s probably no coincidence that Robinhood, the free stock trading app designed for Millennials, really took off after it began offering free crypto trading.)What about the career side? Graduating into a deep recession has forced Millennials to take more risks professionally, but that hardly makes them flighty. In fact, there’s some evidence that they are actually switching jobs less frequently than previous generations did at the same age. “They are taking unconventional paths. It started out of necessity really. They were forced to think creatively,” says Kate Wauck, head of communications at robo-advisor Wealthfront. In a recent survey of 1,000 of their Millennial clients, one third said the financial crisis changed their career path and slowed their professional growth. But 77% believe their current career is setting them up for long-term success.“We were a little bit stunted when graduating. We really had to figure out how to make this situation work for us,” Wauck says. “I’m so inspired by our clients because you see the creativity that came from it. I think people were willing to take riskier moves than if they graduated with that corporate job.” Today they’re more cautious, as Millennials fear another economic recession in the coming years. Eighty-one percent of those Wealthfront surveyed save money in an emergency fund and 71% don’t spend above their means. Here are a few true stories of Millennial setbacks and recovery. (To share yours, email me at kstoller@forbes.com.)The career changeJoyce LeeAs an education major at the College of New Jersey, Joyce Lee felt “protected” from the financial devastation around her.  “I was on an education track, and there was nothing more guaranteed than education because you will always need teachers,” she says. “That’s the thought that I had.”Then, in 2008, Lee’s father got laid off from his job as a high-end jeweler— inopportune timing for a man with a son at New York University and a daughter in her junior year at TCNJ. Lee says she and her brother quickly got part-time jobs to help pay for their college expenses, but she still graduated in 2009 with about $80,000 in student loan debt. Like many in her generation, she moved back in with her parents. Then she saw her “guaranteed” job slip away, too, after newly elected Governor Chris Christie’s attack on the teacher’s union. “My very guaranteed job evaporated because teachers weren’t retiring,” Lee, 31, says.She decided to apply for a call center job and, during the interview, she was asked to describe her hobbies. When she described her love of “tinkering with computers,” she was immediately hired in tech support—a career she’s stayed with today. Three years into living at her parent’s house, she says she was able to pay off her debts, and two years after that, she moved out.Her biggest lesson? Build an emergency fund. Currently, Lee and her husband have a fund that would sustain them for eight months if they completely lost their jobs. “The thing I wish our generation was better at was starting to be more open about talking with money,” she says. “I don’t understand because I don’t know my reality. I wish people would talk about it more so it removes some of the shame. Everyone has a story and we can all help each other out.”The finance bloggerCourtesy of Jason ButlerFor Jason Butler, 2008 was a “tale of two years.” The then-24-year-old graduated from Savannah State University in Georgia in May with a degree in marketing. After traveling for a few months, he buckled down on his job search at the end of the summer. Then the recession hit. For months, Butler says, he searched unsuccessfully for jobs, and instead fell back on his college part-time job: working at the Paula Deen Retail Store in downtown Savannah. What had been good money in college was barely enough for to cover his rent, especially when he was facing about $28,000 in student loan debt. “That was a time when my loans were close to 103 days past due,” Butler, now 34, says. “I had to make a decision: pay those loans or pay my rent and my cell phone.”Butler considered going back to college just for the convenience of getting his loans deferred. About a year later, in November 2009, he was able to get his first job as a bank teller at Wells Fargo. Disillusioned with the banking industry, he quit two years later and joined Clayton State University as a financial aid representative. But managing his own finances wasn’t any easier.“It was like I had a bull’s-eye on my back or something. That was a tough time for me. My credit score had dropped to the 500s in 2011 and 2012,” he says. “I think it was a result of crash. Part of the reason my score was so low was because of late payments.”Today Butler works as a senior financial aid counselor at Georgia State University during the day. At night he runs his financial advice blog, My Money Chronicles, and manages his two side hustles: making and selling T-shirts and managing his eBay store, which he started right after the financial crash. Typically, Butler says he pockets about $300 to $400 a month from eBay, but a good month can bring in $500 in sales. But he’s still working on paying off his student debt (it’s up to $50,000 after he attempted to get another degree in 2012 but dropped out a year later). This, he says, is a direct result of the recession, which stunted his financial and professional growth. “[The crash] pretty much gave us a swift kick in the you-know-what,” he says. “A lot of companies were not hiring at all. It took me a year and a half to get that first full-time job. If I was able to get hired in August or September of 2008, who knows what would have been.” The lucky breakJenn TickesAs a 2007 San Diego State graduate with a degree in event planning, Jenn Tickes was nervous. She knew event planning was one of the first roles to be cut when a company faces hard times. And in the year after her graduation, a lot of companies did.With $100,000 in student loan debt, Tickes started looking for jobs in San Francisco with little success.  “I didn’t really know what to do,” she says. “I ended up bartending for a few months while couch surfing and living out of my car. So I posted my résumé on Craigslist.” Soon after, an agency reached out to her about a sales position at a small, unknown 50-person startup in San Francisco, California. She started at Yelp in February 2008 making $30,000 a year. When the company went public four years later, Tickes says she was able to sell a lot of her options to pay off her debts.Now a senior sales development manager at Hired, she’s just starting to invest in her future and pour money into her 401(k).“I think that in starting work, I was so far behind financially that unless I had really rich parents, there was no way I could have lived in the Bay Area or bought a house,” Tickes, 34, says. “Now I’m in my mid-30s, and I don’t ponder the question of ‘Do I want a family or not?’ because, finally, I’m doing okay. But in planning for my future, I’m so far behind.”The graduate studentKristen TyrrellLooking at her impending college graduation in 2010, Kristen Tyrrell saw two choices: enter the job market fighting over shifts at Starbucks, or wait.Tyrrell was a junior majoring in economics at Pepperdine University when the crash came. “At the career fair my junior year, there weren’t companies there,” she recalls. “They just weren’t sending people.”Instead of gambling on the job market, she decided to take on $50,000 in student loan debt and enroll at the Hult International Business School in London. When she graduated in 2011, she had only one job offer: a part-time internship at a Boston consulting firm for $2,000 a month. The salary didn’t go very far—Tyrrell says her rent was $1,100 a month and her student loan payment was $500 a month. Luckily, after three months, she was brought on full-time.Now 30, Tyrrell remains, as she puts it, “particularly bitter” toward Baby Boomers, who she believes set up her generation for financial failure, forcing them to play “catch up for the rest of our lives.” Like many other Millennials, she has left the consulting world and jumped into a startup as COO. Her new company, Catch, offers a portable personal benefits platform for freelancers.“I think that when I was younger, I’d always assumed I’d be at a big company,” Tyrrell says. “Watching the recession and watching people’s wealth just disappear made it clear to me that I needed to spend my day working on something I just care about.” "

of cryptocurrency entrepreneurs – chatbots were supposed to be the ...","Oct 10, 2018,09:00pm EDT",Intercom CEO Eoghan McCabe is doubling down on chatbots.," In the fall of 2016 – before startups started adding artificial intelligence to every pitch, and before Bitcoin triggered a speculative frenzy and inspired a host of cryptocurrency entrepreneurs – chatbots were supposed to be the next big thing.Facebook had just announced Messenger, its chat platform that was supposed to transform how we worked and shopped. Need a flight? Share your details with a chatbot. Need to make a dinner reservation? There’d be a chatbot for that, too.The chatbot revolution fizzled. Google’s M challenger came and quietly went. Startups moved on to other projects, such as building for voice-based offerings like Amazon Alexa and Google Home. Facebook, the harbinger of the rise of the chatbots, gave up the game by early 2018 (and later launched its own video-chat device). That January, Wired declared the death of chatbots.
But at one cloud-computing unicorn in Dublin and San Francisco, the promise of chatbots still lives. Intercom CEO Eoghan McCabe still believes in the now out-of-favor tool. And he’s bet months of the focus of his company, which until now has provided software for human customers to better communicate with and then keep track of their customers, on the notion that chatbots can still prove transformative – if they're properly hooked up to that other buzzword, AI. “This is the vision that defines our second chapter,” says McCabe. “We put seven years into building tools to let humans work together. This next chapter is of us building a whole new layer of tech.”With Intercom’s new product unveiled on Wednesday, Answer Bot, customers can now get their hands on Intercom’s smart chatbot to find out if they agree with McCabe’s unpopular opinion. Answer Bot uses machine-learning algorithms developed by Intercom to study a company’s most common questions and answers to eventually suggest common responses on its own. In testing Answer Bot, Intercom claims that 29 percent of customers’ most common questions were resolved without a human, while customer response time improved by 44 percent.Intercom points to financial services startup Cleo, which says that 19 percent of its inbound conversations are now resolved without human involvement. The key difference, says McCabe, is that companies using Intercom’s bot don’t need to program anything themselves, like they would with off-the-shelf AI tools from Amazon or Google. “When people think of chatbots, they think of little programmable bots that do one thing,” says McCabe. “Answer Bot isn’t programmable. It learns.”In McCabe’s vision of an ideal workflow, employees would be able to ask for internal forms or customers check a status order or update billing information all within a chatbot. “The bot will respect you as an individual, and treat your time with respect, too,” he says.A demo of how Answer Bot works.Where other chatbots failed, Intercom believes, is that they functioned as text-based phone trees – channeling a customer to a specific route or dumping them to a phone number or email address. McCabe argues that other tools in the market – notably, fast-growing challenger Drift has its own tool called LeadBot – focus only on making it easier for salespeople to convert customers coming through a site, ignoring more complicated questions or types of customer support. “Point solutions make sense,” McCabe says of the competition. “They’re the easiest place to get purchase in the market.”How much McCabe’s message can resonate with a market that appears largely turned off by chatbots remains to be seen. Intercom has made plenty of announcements in the past, including its own more limited, programmable bots, and then this summer, an app store. With more than paying 30,000 customers, Intercom has a large base with whom to evangelize its chatbot future. But the market is seemingly a long way off from realizing a Gartner prediction from back in 2011 that Intercom still touts as support: that by 2020, 85 percent of customers could manage their relationships with vendors without a human.For Intercom, No. 20 on the 2018 Forbes Cloud 100 list, Answer Bot is arguably its biggest launch since taking $125 million in investment from Kleiner Perkins in March. The Irish-founded and now dual-office company doubled its research and development team over the past year to build the solution, McCabe says.The CEO says the lack of buzz around chatbots is normal. “I don’t think there’s ever been a new technology that hasn’t followed that cycle,” says McCabe. “We insiders who get so excited about the future will always jump on the hype and excitement ahead of its practical reality. Virtual reality, self-driving cars, both of those technologies will get less sexy before they get real.”Talking to a business through its corporate website is unlikely to ever feel sexy. But Intercom’s cofounder gets excited when he imagines the time an AI-powered chatbot could save. “So much of what happens on websites will happen in this little messenger channel,” he says."

transactions without paying a third party for those transactions.","Oct 22, 2018,05:39am EDT",ICO vs IPO . Initial coin offering vs Initial Public Offering (Getty Images),"Companies need money to support their operations, expand and grow. Some turn to private investors, but the big bucks arrive when they turn to the public. Traditionally, companies set up an Initial Public Offering or IPO that allows millions of people to purchase the company’s shares, resulting in huge sums raised in a relatively short time.Preparing for IPOs requires “government verification,” which essentially means that the government validates that a company is safe to invest in. Companies often need to prepare a year in advance for this: the CFO must coordinate with the SEC, prepare for rigorous financial reporting, address tax concerns and go through several forms to fill out. This is also a costly process, according to a survey by PwC which reveals that the costs for going public were more than $1 million for 83% of the surveyed companies.With the rise of blockchain projects, we faced a new form of public fundraising: Initial Coin Offerings, or ICOs. In an ICO, the company sells their “coins” (in most cases, with a discount). These coins function much like stocks, but on the other hand, they also work as real coins in the ecosystem of that project. One example is Bitcoin, which allows for peer-to-peer financial online transactions without paying a third party for those transactions.Compared to IPOs, ICOs offer hassle-free and very fast ways to raise huge amounts of money. They also let startups bypass the venture-capital process, and the investors don’t need to wait years to cash in as long as they can find a buyer for their coins. The preparations are much faster than IPOs (maybe a few months), the costs are much lower and the incomes are gigantic.  In recent years, companies have raised billions of dollars through ICOs, most notably Telegram and EOS, which raised $4bn even without having a live product.The fast money did not come without cost. Blockchain was a new technology few understood, and the news surrounding the new Bitcoin millionaires created a get-rich-fast mentality that would overlook not only scammers but even plain bad ideas. Not all of the “zombie-chains” were scams; some of them did either not receive enough support or had not foreseen all the problems they would run into.Of course, this problem is not unique to ICOs as other crowdfunding projects have also seen scammers with their nasty tricks, but blockchain’s case was unique because it landed in a nascent, unregulated territory. Furthermore, the very nature of blockchain is to remove middlemen – the same people we would rely on as impartial third parties who we could turn to in case of disputes, or to get refunds in case of fraud. Blockchain not only removes these guarantees but also makes the money untraceable, which unfortunately created the ideal tool for criminals and hackers.The latter group has the potential to take down even legitimate projects – yet another threat, unique to the blockchain. According to Stas Oskin from Wings, who specializes in blockchain security: “Often the founders and companies in rush to successfully get funded, or to scale and overpass the competition, are cutting corners ignoring security principles, and not allocating the necessary resources for security departments. This tends to become a habit, until the eventual hack occurs, causing them to lose most of the credibility and business momentum they worked so hard to establish. Due to [the] irreversible nature of blockchain, a major security event can potentially lead to project shut down, and even to founders’ personal liability before their investors and users.”For these reasons, some countries cracked down on cryptocurrencies altogether and declared ICOs illegal.As regulation is kicking in and the hype is fading, the real use cases of blockchain are starting to emerge. Some projects have officially listed their tokens as securities with the SEC, but by launching ICOs they are still able to benefit from the speed and flexibility it brings.Furthermore, the “shares” in ICOs are digital assets that can be programmed to autonomously execute instructions. These instructions are transparent agreements that are hardcoded in the coins and are not affected by human bias or influence. As a result, the ICOs can form true community owned, managed and governed businesses.According to Jeremy Epstein, CEO of Never Stop Marketing, “The reason we have had centralized entities is because, for a long time, there has not been an effective way to have decentralized governance at scale. That's changing.” He continues: “With blockchain systems, we have the potential for the coordination of large groups without compromising the agility and resiliency of decentralized communities.”Blockchain offers an almost unhackable system, where ownership is guaranteed, the rules are transparent and no central authority can override the will of the masses. Depending on the smart contracts, the token owners can have their fair share of voting power and decide where the project should be heading.For this reason, ICOs have proven to be a valuable asset. But their use is not limited to startups. Existing companies and enterprises may also raise funds and decentralize their governance by participating in ICOs. Since these are established entities, their valuations are easier and more transparent as they already have an existing track record. This process is often referred to as a “reverse ICO.”Of course, it's important that the ICO is implemented in a way to honor this spirit. Some projects (like Telegram) kept most of their coins with private investors, which limits the power of the community.ICOs have proven their potential to raise large sums and make room for innovations and breakthroughs, but their use-case extends to creating true, decentralized governance. However, abuse has left it with a bad reputation. By misusing ICOs, the malicious actors have dealt the biggest blow to the trustless system, which was supposed to remove the need for trusting in the first place."

All were united by the shared belief that blockchain has transformative potential for health and healthcare, with changes already underway.","Blockchain is more than a technology that has enabled the much-hyped Bitcoin. It is a transactional ledger that records the movement of anything of value—currency, records, contracts, supplies—between parties. It is unique because it is a distributed ledger, which means multiple parties can hold copies of the ledger that are continuously synched, taking out inefficiencies in the transaction process. And, most importantly, it is highly secure and generally cannot be changed without the agreement of all parties to the ledger. The Economist magazine has called blockchain “a machine for creating trust,” allowing “people who have no particular confidence in each other [to] collaborate without having to go through a neutral central authority.” I am particularly excited about the potential that blockchain has for the healthcare industry. It will give us a fresh approach to sharing data, including breaking down silos with electronic medical records, simplifying revenue cycle reconciliation and pharmaceutical supply chains, aiding researchers in drug development by making patient data more accessible and secure, synching data from health trackers and wearables into a consumer’s health record, and much more.Distributed Health event in Nashville.This year’s Distributed Health event was the third focused on blockchain and it’s clear the industry has evolved quickly. “If you think about 2016, it was all about community building,” John Bass, CEO of Nashville-based blockchain solutions firm Hashed Health said. “2017 was a lot of enterprise work, a lot of conversations with big insurance companies, big pharma companies … about how enterprises could get involved. Now, in 2018, we’ve seen this shift. … The shift that I’ve noticed is that the conversations are much more mature, the audience is much more mature, the level of thought, the practicality … is much more advanced and much more mature than what we’ve seen in the past.”I was looking for real world evidence of a maturing industry—and I found it. It was evident from payer participation and an overall focus on practical solutions and collaboration between industry players, and further emphasized by the innovative private sector startups putting blockchain to use.""Healthcare is ready to adopt blockchain [technology] if you can demonstrate clear ROI,"" said Solve.Care CEO Pradeep Goel. ""This is not an issue of when blockchain will start working in healthcare. It is starting to work. … Once you have the right framework in place, then the use cases will flood in and that is what we are experiencing.""We saw and heard many examples of projects in the works:This list really only scratches the surface.  Blockchain is definitely and rapidly moving toward production in real-world healthcare settings. In fact, it’s projected to be a $2 trillion industry.But the road there still isn’t perfectly clear.“I think the 3-5 year question is impossible to answer when it comes to this,” Kristen Johns, a transactional patent attorney said during a panel. “If you asked most of us three years ago what blockchain was, we would have looked at you like you were crazy.”But that doesn’t mean anyone is holding back in charting that path. Technology is going to change care as we know it: moving the locus of care into the community, into the home-setting, meeting the patient where they are. I left the event even more excited about how blockchain and other innovative technologies can do that."

It enabled investors who registered for its service to make 10 trades per month at no cost.This all might be described as akin to first mover advantage, with confirmed reports and rumors in the market earlier this year that other equity trading platform operators will follow suit in the U.K. One such party in this fray includes Revolut, British digital-only bank. It revealed this June according a Thomson Reuters report that it was building a commission-free trading platform on its app.The push was to  undercut traditional financial services.

Today the company has around 50,000 active clients in Europe and is growing fast.With the average commission charged by five of the largest online share-dealing platforms running at £8.31 (c.$11) per trade according to DJB Research, and leading brokers such as Hargreaves Lansdown and Interactive Investor charging £11.95 (c.$15.77) and £10 (c.$13.20) respectively, and levying additional fees for ISA wrappers, Trading 212’s new unlimited offer is set to further disrupt a market that sees retail investors’ returns decimated by high transaction costs. The impact can be dramatic for those investing small amounts.In addition to shares and ETFs, Trading 212 has also removed all commission from trading cryptocurrencies and Contracts for Difference (CFDs). On the cryptocurrency front the broker offers trading in the top 10 most popular currencies - including bitcoin and ethereum.Impact Of Fees On Trading EquitiesTo illustrate the current landscape, an investor who is looking to build a share portfolio over a five-year period by investing £300 (c.$ 396) month placing three equity trades using Hargreaves Lansdown (excludes regular monthly savings commission rate) will pay £2,151 (c.$2,840) in commission and platform charges. That equates to 11.95% of their investment, which is a pretty big hit.So let's look at the numbers. Now assuming a market neutral environment and ignoring stamp duty, a Trading 212 investor using the above scenario above would see their portfolio grow to £18,000 (c.$23,760). By contrast, if they were to choose Hargreaves Lansdown for executing trades it would be worth £15,849 (c.$ 20,920). (Note: These figures were based on research conducted by DJB Research Ltd in September 2018. The Sterling exchange rate to U.S. dollar used was 1.32 as of September 19).Crypto Trading Volatility & MillennialsAccording to Trading 212, the recent boom in trading volatile cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin has been particularly popular among millennials - also known as 'Generation Y' (typically with starting birth years from the early 1980s and the mid-1990s). But by making saving and investing in shares and ETFs free of charge and removing the hassle, the firm is seeking to encourage more of this generation to diversify into this less volatile asset class.Its research, which was based online research carried out by Consumer Intelligence among just over 1,000 investors this August, revealed that over the last 12 months millennials have carried nearly a fifth (18%) more crypto trades than older generations. And, 13% more millennials plan to put more money into shares than older investors over the next year, these findings suggest.An Appetite For Change?The zero-commission initiative comes at a time when investors are showing a growing appetite for change. DJB Research also reveals that the majority (59%) of U.K.-based equity traders are “considering switching” to a new trading platform over the next 12 months, with 28% of them claiming it is because they want to ""reduce the cost of their trading.""Among cryptocurrency and CFD traders, the percentage of these participants considering switching platforms is put as 78% and 82%, respectively.Ivan Ashminov, co-Founder of Trading 212, commenting said: “Being the first company to offer U.K. investors a commission-free trading environment speaks to our long-held belief that this charging practice can no longer be justified. It will add further pressure on the established players who have been allowed to fleece investors for too long.”The 39-year old Bulgarian added: “Our cutting-edge technology means that the actual cost of executing a retail trade is negligible, but the impact of commission and platform charges on the customers’ returns can be huge.” But it does beg the question how they will make money from the move. Clearly, it will come from the spreads on equity/ETF transactions and interest on margin for CFD traded products.Ivan Ashminov, co-founder of Trading 212.New Generation of Crypto TradersWhen I met Mr Ashminov, who studied computer science and maths at the University of Sofia, in London's financial district this week just prior to the announcement on zero trading, he acknowledged that the crypto boom during 2017 had ""kind of stalled the show” with regards to their launch of 10 free equity trades per month in June 2017. That said, he stressed that last year's launch had been met positively.He added: ""So, it did not make sense for us to keep talking about equity investing when everybody [last year] - including the media - had their spotlight on the crypto space. Now we are back on track with our strategy.""In offering access to a universe of some 1,800 stocks that can be traded on the major indices in the U.S, U.K. and Germany (plus ETFs), the co-founder pointed out that unlike other brokers who have a low cost trading model, Trading 212 has ""no internalization"" of client orders (i.e. mixing/selling the retail flow to institutional/high frequency trading funds). ""The orders of our clients are directly routed to the market,"" he explained.On the general thrust of their new offering and shaking up the market, he wanted to ""emphasize that this exercise has nothing to do with CFDs with instruments...it's about real equity investing and a longer-term perspective."" He was also not too phased about the new service coming with markets being at pretty much their highs of late.Ashminov, who founded a “start-up in a garage” in his twenties that eventually mushroomed into what later became Trading 212, said: “Crypto trading has attracted a new generation of young people who do not see the need to pay for basic services such as trade execution. They are also looking to broaden their exposure away from cryptos towards shares and ETFs. And, removing commission will only increase their appetite.”He added: “In contrast to other fintech companies who are focusing on the highly volatile crypto market, we want to democratize the ownership of shares and ETFs, so investors can enjoy their long-term benefits.  It’s only a matter of time before the established players will have to get rid of commission altogether.”David Black, an independent retail investment analyst, commenting on the present landscape said: “The trading platform market has never been more exciting in terms of innovation and service.  More providers are coming into the market and are constantly pushing back the boundaries, and Trading 212’s announcement today is the strongest example yet of what to expect.”The market is certainly a crowded one, with figures showing that currently there are 339 broking entities who are listed as member firms with the London Stock Exchange Group in the U.K.The TechnologyThe Trading 212 app is underpinned by proprietary market-leading technology, which enables customers to enjoy what is described as ""a fast and frictionless"" investing experience.  It offers free access to advanced features such as technical analysis and various integrated social media features, such as video tutorials and a live chat room, to encourage greater engagement and education around trading in shares.Roger Lawson, ex-chairman of the U.K. Individual Shareholder Society (ShareSoc) with several thousand members and an active stock market investor, canvassed over Trading 212's move to disrupts the market, said: “While on the surface this might look good for investors, in essence this appears very much like marketing ramp. Anybody can launch a business by promising to offer something for free. It's been a well-known practice in the software industry over the years.""He added: ""One basically offers something that is free...on the basis that thereafter you are going to make money [from other services]. Furthermore, the initial ""free"" service can be turned off as quickly as it was turned on."" Lawson pointed here to IG Index having at one time offered free trading on the basis that they ""would capture"" additional clients and generate more business.""On the service level front, Trading 212 offers a live chat functionality and claims a response time of ""47 seconds."" But clients can also speak over the phone to customer representatives. Lawson pointed out: ""What you can find is that brokers offering a very low cost service [or this case zero cost], everything is fine if no problems arise. However, if there any tricky transactions or things go wrong in any way then the service be less than robust.""Future MovesAshminov revealed during our conversation in The City that in the next few month the firm he founded will launch additional services, assuming all goes well. ""The main one will be robo investing, so that those investors who want to manage their portfolios will be able to avail themselves of this service for a fee.""In terms of the current ownership structure, Ashminov owns the company on a 50-50 basis with his business partner. He revealed: ""Until now we have never taken any outside capital on board. Now [though] we are considering potential external investors and also thinking about potential IPO in the future.""However, he added a caveat: ""We will only do that if [such an injection of capital] will help us accelerate the growth of the company."" And, for the last 12 months the company made profit of around £25 million (c.$33 million).Life looks like it is certainly getting cheaper when it comes to trading equities in the U.K. for retail investors. And, no doubt others will follow in Trading 212's footsteps.The big question remains whether it will all stack up - even if the technology behind their platform is held up as being ""immensely scalable"" and the customer service levels and user experience are not negatively impacted if growth for the firm dramatically increases going forward.And, while a universe of around 1,800 stocks being offered is pretty considerable for most, whether the platform will bring its full weight to bear in the small cap segment and the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the London Stock Exchange, where there can be less liquidity on particular stocks, might be another matter.Individuals wishing to open an account with Trading 212 can do so with as little as £100 (c.$130). Trading 212 customers are provided with full regulatory protection as Trading 212 UK Limited, is authorized and regulated by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, and registered in England and Wales."

internet currencies like Bitcoin. But blockchain can be used to track ...","Oct 7, 2018,02:32pm EDT",Blockchain Technology Makes it Possible to Connect Entire Supply Chains and Create Transparency,"Blockchain technology is coming to the jewelry industry, and it’s coming fast. Ultimately, this means absolute trace-ability of every element in the jewelry supply chain; from the mine, to the refinery, to the alloy manufacturer, to the production company, the retailer, and on to the consumer. But we’re still years from that level of supply chain cooperation. You may have heard of blockchain technology as the technology behind internet currencies like Bitcoin. But blockchain can be used to track any virtual or physical good from one place to another, as long as all the participants in the chain-of-custody have access to a blockchain platform, and reliably enter their transactions into it. This type of supply chain transparency will go a long way to reassuring consumers concerned about the jewelry industry's impact on the world, and will be a huge relief to jewelry businesses everywhere that are struggling to buy and manufacture responsibly. So how does it work? If you’ve ever watched a police procedural television show, you’ve seen how evidence is passed from hand-to-hand, carefully recording each person who touches it along the way. Evidence is bagged, tagged, and signed off on at each step, to preserve the integrity of the evidence from collection to trial.That’s what blockchain does. It tracks raw materials – like gold or diamonds — from the mine, to the refiner (for metals) or gem cutter, through distributors and manufacturers, to the retailer, and on to the consumer. Only, instead of keeping a paper log, the raw material is assigned a serial number, and data is entered into the supply log, or digital ledger, as it moves from place to place, throughout the material’s transformation. Blockchain systems cannot be edited and they are extremely secure, so the data that is entered for each step of the process is permanent.Having a hard time picturing this? Let's walk through one possible scenario. Imagine a bucket filled with lumps of gold, freshly dug out of the ground. The family* that works this piece of ground has been certified; they’re not using child labor, and they are fully trained in and practicing safe and environmentally sound practices. *(Tens of millions of artisanal miners make up most mining operations around the world.)That bucket of gold is bagged, sealed, and assigned a serial number. The person managing this process signs into a blockchain application on her smartphone, and logs the batch. After this step, the raw gold moves on to the next stage in the supply chain.Things get a little more challenging at the next step. The gold moves along to a refinery, which typically refines huge lots of gold from dozens of sources in each batch. Now, the serialized raw gold must be refined as an isolated batch, to maintain visibility to its point of origin. The refiner logs into his company computer system, which communicates with the blockchain platform, and identifies the batch before and after refining. The refined metal is repackaged, along with the original serial number. Then it moves on to a production facility.Let’s say that production facility is making wire. The refined gold stays together as a serialized batch. When the production manager takes possession of the refined gold, he uses his tablet to enter the batch information into his company computer system — which communicates with the blockchain platform. Now imagine the end of this process: Large coils of shiny gold wire sitting on a pallet. Each coil’s tag includes a bar code that reaches back to the original serial number, and the computer system communicates with the blockchain app that the refined gold has been transformed into wire.The wire coils are shipped off to manufacturers and distributors, who enter the serial numbers into their computer systems as part of the inventory receiving process. Many distributors don’t sell entire coils of wire – they sell the wire in varying lengths to smaller producers. Each order of wire they ship is accompanied by the serial number of the batch – which was stored in their ERP system and automatically communicated with the blockchain platform. The bar code that prints on the product tag, invoice, and packing slip contains the digital links to the original raw gold.Jewelry manufacturers enter the serial number of each length of wire into their own inventory receiving systems – which transmit logs to the blockchain platform. They transform the wire into finished jewelry. Once they produce each final jewelry item, they log the serial number of the gold that went into it – along with the serial numbers of any other metals or gemstones that were used.  The consumer who buys the piece can be assured about the provenance of the materials that were tracked through the blockchain, and can even learn about the origins of each element.Blockchain technology is fully developed and is in use — this is not science fiction. The challenge will be enlisting supply chain operations – many of which are still very manual. Supply chain partners must have the will to standardize processes and to write procedures for their computer systems to transmit relevant data to the blockchain platforms.Two significant blockchain initiatives are taking on these challenges for the jewelry industry. De Beers announced in May of 2018, “An immutable and secure digital trail was created for a selection of rough diamonds mined by De Beers as they moved from the mine to cutter and polisher, then through to a jeweler.” The blockchain platform De Beers has committed to is Tracr, which De Beers developed with Boston Consulting Group’s Digital Ventures, using the Ethereum blockchain framework. Their initial test was on 100 larger diamonds (most diamonds traded in the world are melee, which are diamonds between .001 to .15 carats and between .6mm to 3.5mm in diameter). De Beers owns or controls most of its supply chain, making compliance in this early test relatively easy to achieve. Expanding the initiative to smaller diamonds and other supply partners will be a bigger challenge. De Beers has reported that their platform will be made available to the rest of the diamond industry by the end of 2018.Another jewelry blockchain initiative, led by Richline Group, Inc., is using IBM’s TrustChain platform (which is built on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain framework). Walmart partnered with IBM in 2016 to use TrustChain to protect the security and safety of food supplies, making it possible for them to quickly trace the origin of food products when food safety issues arise. Berkshire Hathaway’s food distribution organization, McLane Company, was one of the partners involved in the Walmart effort. When Richline, the jewelry manufacturing and distribution company owned by Berkshire Hathaway, entered the blockchain arena, they also chose IBM’s TrustChain.According to the Trustchain website, “this is a unique collaboration that leverages IBM’s technology and the UL, independent third-party verification, together with five diamond and jewelry companies that represent the entire supply chain: Rio Tinto Diamonds (diamond supplier for Proof of Concept only), Leach Garner (precious metals supplier), Asahi Refinery (precious metal refinery), Helzberg (US jewelry retailer) and the Richline Group (global jewelry manufacturer).” The TrustChain initiative is intended to include the full range of jewelry materials, from gemstones to metals.An interesting aspect of the TrustChain initiative is the inclusion of Underwriter Labs (UL). UL has a long history as an independent (3rd party) verifier of supply chains. This adds another layer of confidence to the TrustChain platform. Like the Tracr initiative, the TrustChain initiative plans to welcome “all responsible jewelry firms, suppliers, and retailers” in 2019.Both the Tracr and TrustChain initiatives are being developed by their sponsoring companies on behalf of the jewelry industry. There will be no charges to join either system, though all blockchains require minimal transaction fees for the networks to function. Individual companies will be responsible for updating their processes and writing their system integrations to the blockchain platform. Both platforms can readily communicate with modern ERP and stock-tracing systems, and will likely introduce integration “layers” for jewelry supply chain partners to tap into.Both Tracr and TrustChain have also put privacy controls in place throughout their platforms. This means that companies can participate in the platform without exposing sensitive data like pricing. Traceability, and not full transparency, is the goal of these systems.As De Beers and Richline Group have surely discovered by now, blockchain technology is only part of the traceability battle. In order for supply chains to share traceable data, each company along the chain must have developed repeatable, uniform processes and must manage those processes with discipline and consistency. This type of process control is the exception, not the rule, and is the reason that major corporations like Walmart and McDonalds own significant percentages of their supply chains — right down to the farm. It is easier to wrangle a wholly-owned vertical supply chain into compliance than to get small, less sophisticated businesses to practice the disciplines necessary for traceability. Blockchain Technology is Just a Start - Industries Must Also Develop Consistent ProcessesThe worldwide jewelry industry has far more cottage businesses than sophisticated corporate players. But as consumers demonstrate growing concern for the origins of all things – from apples to diamonds – the industry must be prepared to offer traceability as an option. And companies that tap into consumer demand for product confidence will discover a wealth of differentiation opportunity as a reward for their efforts."

get enough computing power to solve complex mathematical problems ...","Oct 28, 2018,09:39am EDT",Getty Images,"The last few decades have witnessed innovations in modern medicine, science and technology at a much faster rate than at any time before in history. A large portion of the credit goes to computers, for helping us solve problems more efficiently and therefore at a faster pace.Most recently, this has included the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning as well as neural networks that can simulate human thought patterns. They can then apply their more efficient brains to issues that desperately require resolution, many of which are in STEM fields like medicine or cryptography.STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics, but a far wider range of academic disciplines fall under this description. Courses one could study range from aerospace engineering and astronomy to civil engineering and statistics.
Following on from various buzzwords like Big Data, Cloud (computing) and Omni-channel in the technology landscape, more recently we have seen the Internet of Things (IoT) and AI surface.Last year research firm Forrester expected investment in AI to triple in 2017. And, according to Gartner by around 2020, 85% of customer interactions will be managed by AI. Highlighting the value of AI, market intelligence firm Tractica has projected the sector to worth a not inconsiderable $36.8 billion globally by 2025.The pace of discovery and progress in the genomics field, which focuses on the eradication of cancer and other genetic-level human defects, is now using AI to record how differences in human DNA might manifest in unique corresponding traits. AI thrives in environments where it can scan billions of genes and learn to identify and correctly interpret emergent patterns.If a connection is made, targeted drugs can be synthesized as a treatment. AI is also making an impact in cancer research where researchers have already created a convolutional neural network capable of distinguishing between dangerous skin marks and harmless ones. When tested against an international panel of expert dermatologists, it accurately detected skin cancer from imagery at a 95% rate compared to the experts’ 87%.AI is capable of quickly sifting through hundreds of datasets and is many orders of magnitude more efficient than a human brain at doing so. However, it is also more resource-intensive.But researchers cannot afford to be liberal with their use of computers due to the nearly prohibitive costs of maintaining a centralized source of processing power for the amount of time it takes to map a human genome. Even at roughly one hour. And, for some perspective, just two years ago it took 26 hours - with the cost of outsourcing this power bill being substantial.The power demand of AI is also too large to be feasible for our current, regardless of its potential applications. And, in a broader sense, this inefficiency puts a ceiling on innovation.It is also worth bearing in mind that by 2025 the global data sphere has been projected to grow to 163 zettabytes. And, the current computational paradigm is not scalable or intelligent enough to handle this massive influx of information. The zettabyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information, equivalent to one sextillion (one long scale trilliard) bytes, so hardly inconsiderable.Fortunately, blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) are touted and looking to offer a solution with more effective resource-consolidation and dissemination, which can help AI do more by being a reliable source of power to draw from.Putting some context on matters, Siim Õunap, COO of blockchain and crypto digital marketing agency Savii Digital, said: “One of the little-known reasons behind the creation of the Bitcoin protocol was to get enough computing power to solve complex mathematical problems that no one computer could by itself. As the process went on, it evolved and virtual currency was born.”The Estonian, who divides his time between London and Tallinn, added: “Even though computing power was used for something else, it created an ideal solution to combine hardware efforts to power among other things, AI and IoT. Now, almost a decade since it first started, it can be seen being used widely by many companies and I believe that this is just the beginning.”Raw Compute Power is the ‘New Oil’Just as the industrial revolution was driven by factory machines and oil, the next revolution will come on the backs of AI and vast sums of hardware and computational power. These last two factors directly influence the intelligence of computers, so it becomes more important to give the world’s growing artificial intelligences a more efficient source.Processing power - or compute power - could include parallel distributed CPU and GPU processing.Even purpose-built centralized processing infrastructure like data centers are not efficient enough to meet AI’s growing compiling, rendering, and predictive analytics needs in a cost-effective manner.Professor Andrew J. Hacker, Harrisburg University, and founder of Thought AI, which earlier this year launched a public mineable blockchain backed by Harrisburg University in Pennsylvania for what was dubbed the “AI Superhighway”, commenting here said: “Just as important as compute power is to AI, so too is both the data we feed it and how we use the results. Ultimately the input of AI is data that through complex algorithms provide connections, patterns and insight that, we hope, provide valuable output.”But as Professor Hacker pointed out “not all data and insight is created equal”, adding that: “Blockchain technologies hold the promise of adding structure and accountability to AI algorithms and the quality and usefulness of the intelligence they produce.”Professor Andrew Hacker, CEO and founder of Thought. (Source: Thought AI).Now, for the first time in history, the human species are faced with dealing with a technology as powerful (and growing more powerful every second) as global supercomputing and AI that affect our lives and the world around us in profound ways.“Security, privacy and quality of the data collected to feed more and more sophisticated algorithms and the transparency and safety of how the results they produce are utilized is paramount,” added Hacker.In the case of Thought AI, it leverages hybrid data/algorithm superstructures and blockchain to create an intelligence layer on the Internet. As Hacker explained: “Thought uses a 3-layer model to efficiently utilize compute power to create and commoditize transparent, responsive and valuable intelligence algorithms while preserving data privacy and increasing quality.”Given this reality, several companies have decided that blockchain is the ticket to a new status quo in computational capacity and data processes, and preliminary successes have highlighted what some have described as the startling potential in such an idea.For a geneticist who needs to map a client’s genome or a 3D animator who needs to render a movie, the only current alternative is to outsource the task to centralized processing farms like Amazon, for instance. These companies use their existing data centers and return a finished product at a high price.As such, the process is too expensive and too slow to do often, which keeps the technology from being truly feasible currently.Now, the same geneticist or artist can complete their project less expensively by uploading it to a service like Tatau, a decentralized marketplace of idle GPU power. Tatau matches a project’s estimated processing needs with its connected members who are willing to let the system borrow that much power (and at that price) from their own machines.The blockchain is responsible for organizing the system of authority that acts as a substitute for the structure of a centralized system.Andrew Fraser, co-Founder and CEO of TATAU.io, commenting on the landscape said: “Demand for AI computation is doubling every 3.5 months with costs increasing proportionately. Traditional suppliers, such as Amazon and Microsoft, use price as a lever to control usage - this restricts innovation.”Having completed the concept development last December year, Tatau finalized a $1.5 million seed round of investment this April before completing a proof-of-computation in May. According to its roadmap, it aims to release an AI beta version of the product in January 2019 and start beta processing of commercial AI contracts the following month. Ultimately the goal is to launch the Tatau platform in around June 2019.Fraser, based in Auckland, New Zealand, added: “We want to unleash AI innovation by dramatically reducing the cost of computing by harnessing the globally distributed GPUs used by crypto miners and making them available for compute by AI companies via our platform.”Andrew Fraser, CEO and co-founder of Tatau, a decentralized marketplace of so-called idle GPU power.... [+] (Source: Tatau).Golem Network, a Polish-based peer-to-peer (P2P) network with no central server, is another decentralized power platform that calls itself the “Airbnb for Computers”, though it has different rules that govern its processing co-op. It allows both application owners and individual users (requestors) to rent the resources of other users’ (providers) machines, and be paid in cryptocurrency.The company, which raised more than $8.6 million back in just a matter of half an hour back in November 2016 via an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), also leverages users’ available processing power into a massive pool that any user can tap into for a variety of projects.Both Golem and Tatau are based on a token ecosystem. But while Golem uses CPUs, Tatau draws power from GPUs instead for what is held up as “more agile” processing capabilities.Blockchain Comes Just In TimeJust over the horizon is a time when raw processing power is commoditized, thanks to blockchain. This should lead to a liquid market for this power, which will have dynamics much more favorable to an AI project than today’s centralized market model according to industry protagonists in the space.These new ideas therefore come at an opportune moment, with humanity right now facing questions about sustainable existence relevant to medicine, technology, mathematics and other relevant disciplines.These are arenas in which AI is better prepared to fight. Platforms like Tatau, Golem and others for now satisfy the demand for a more economical computational power deal. That said, it remains to be seen if or how the idea will go mainstream.The other concern is whether it will be enough. This borrows from an idea called Jevon’s Paradox, which states that as it becomes more efficient to use any resource, demand for and consumption of that resource will rise more as a result.And, if blockchain successfully frees the power trapped in retail-level machines will it simply drive demand up beyond what the blockchain is prepared to produce?Finally, hardware is a relevant consideration. Blockchain may be efficient at collecting and distributing power. But at some point, new power must come from somewhere. These are questions for tomorrow. However, for now, nothing can distract from the stellar progress coming from blockchain’s ability to boost AI scalability. Carpe diem."

There have been several impressive technological advancements in the past that have led to significant changes in this business sphere; however, they pale in comparison to recent ones.Many of these technologies aren’t directly related to project management as an industry but are primed to have an effect on it regardless. Here are three major advancements that are worth keeping an eye on if you’re a project manager or are trying to become one.Artificial IntelligenceAI’s ability to change entire industries and careers is a topic that has been thoroughly discussed. Just about everyone with even a passing familiarity understands that it is primed to cause drastic change, and it’s been a hot topic in entertainment, journalism and tech.We’ve already seen the effect that AI has on our day-to-day lives: email spam filters, estimated arrival times for deliveries and virtual assistants like Alexa and Siri. However, it’s the latter facet of AI that is primed to cause significant change. Right now, these virtual assistants are mostly novelties that can only perform rudimentary tasks like writing reminders and building music playlists. However, their capabilities are only growing as their infrastructure improves.You can see this in effect with Google’s recently announced Duplex system. First revealed in 2018, this artificial assistant can interact with real people so naturally that it comes across as human, even passing the Turing Test in the domain of making appointments. The secret to its success, as outlined on the Google AI blog, is a complex recurrent neural network (RNN) that mimics the human brain.But what does this have to do with project management?Think about all the calls and messages you need to make on a daily basis as a project manager. Sure, some of these calls can be handled by a personal assistant, but could he or she make five calls at the same time? A fully realized virtual assistant like Duplex could do the work of several personal assistants in a fraction of the time, freeing up a substantial amount of time and energy to focus on more important tasks.Internet Of Things (IoT)This concept has gained considerable popularity in recent years, especially among IT professionals and tech enthusiasts. Referred to as IoT for short, this is essentially a new way of describing the sea of smart devices on the market that connect with each other through the internet: smart cars, smart watches, smart printers, etc.However, the internet of things also includes much larger systems and objects. For example, many cities have started adopting an IoT approach to configuring their power grids. According to the ZOHO Corporation, a smart power grid can improve functionality, provide more accurate alerts and reduce costs when compared to a traditional setup.But what does this have to do with project management?The most significant way IoT affects project management concerns IT and conducting tests on software. According to one journal published in 2018 discussing this very subject, “Testing methods used in the telecommunication industry are hardly able to handle distributed IoT systems and lack the flexibility to manage a variety of IoT devices.”As a result of this, any projects involving IoT devices or systems will need to set aside more time and money to properly test any software development. This can stretch out a project’s timeline much further than a project manager might anticipate. The good news is that this is a temporary issue. As more and more IT professionals adopt testing techniques geared toward the internet of things, this growing pain will resolve itself and we can all reap the benefits of improved device interconnectivity.BlockchainI’ve written at length about how blockchain has affected accounting, another industry that I have considerable experience in. However, this fascinating new information framework has much more far-reaching implications.Blockchain’s roots lie in the publishing of a white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. The way he described the data behind the cryptocurrency Bitcoin was a series of “block[s] in the chain” that can be verified by anyone, anywhere, at any time. Hence, the term “blockchain” was born to describe similarly structured data sets.Although the most popular forms of blockchain technology are cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, there are many other uses being explored and implemented. (Full disclosure: The author holds personal investments in Bitcoin and Ethereum.) Much like how the internet of things has grown to incorporate power grids, the blockchain has been implemented in a variety of industries and services. One of the largest examples of this is the push by the government of Dubai to be the world’s first blockchain-powered government by 2020.But what does this have to do with project management?You may already use many services with proto-blockchain technologies as a framework. Some of the most popular project management software, such as Google Drive and Trello, is cloud-based, and blockchain can be seen as the next evolution of cloud technology. What this means is that far more tools can be structured in this way through blockchain technology while also being much more efficient.It will take some time for project managers and their teams to adjust to this new way of verifying and transferring data. Most individuals will need additional education to properly wrap their heads around it. Several established jobs in a project team will be fundamentally transformed if not eliminated entirely. However, this entire tumultuous transition will be worthwhile due to the major increase in productivity that follows.I’m not the only one who has noticed the ramifications of these technological advancements on project management as an industry. A survey conducted by the Project Management Institute found that AI, IoT and the blockchain offer major competitive advantages to a significant percentage of project managers that adopt them. If you haven’t started paying attention to these technological advancements, now is the time; otherwise, you might find yourself left in the dust."

Opportunity abounds for those who are bringing quantitative skills to the world’s largest financial firms or using blockchain technology to reinvent entire markets, and they can be seen on this year’s Forbes 30 Under 30 Finance list.The rising stars in finance are inventing new modes of central banking and payment technologies, building new business lines at major hedge funds and private equity funds, and guiding strategy at large public companies. They can be found inside successful firms like Bridgewater Associates, Blackstone Group and PointState Capital or running trading desks at Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. Some have already created billion-dollar businesses. The changing contours of finance also means this year’s 30 Under 30 Finance list is hands-down Forbes’ most diverse. Some 40% of list-makers are female, and nearly a quarter emigrated to the United States.At 26, Nader Al-Naji, a Princeton-educated son of Syrian and Lebanese immigrants, has raised $133 million from the likes of Stanley Druckenmiller, Andreessen Horowitz and Bain Capital Ventures to develop a cryptocurrency, Basis, which aims to use blockchain technology to replace central banks in countries suffering from currency volatility. Al-Naji’s “stablecoin” is pegged to the U.S. dollar by increasing and decreasing in supply depending on demand. Thus, it is meant to offer new, more stable currencies for people in countries where inflation or political instability roil financial transactions.
2019 Under 30 in Finance: Nader Al-Naji, Founder & CEO of BasisWhen the world’s top hedge funds want to bolster their quantitative strategies, they’re leaning on the skills of Millennial-aged data scientists. At PointState Capital, Peter Maa oversees the $9.5-billion-in-assets hedge fund’s fundamental discretionary macro research. A China expert and managing director, Maa is also building PointState Capital’s in-house data science team, which uses the current explosion of big data to uncover opportunity.Richard Lee, 29, heads systematic engineering at BlueMountain Capital, overseeing the technology platform that is the backbone of its systematic investing strategies. Lee’s team builds custom data analysis, natural language processing algorithms and signal research across all the $20-billion-in-assets hedge fund’s strategies. At Bridgewater Associates, Daniel Hochman, 29, is a leading environment, social and governance researcher for the world’s largest hedge fund. A member of Bridgewater’s corporate strategy leadership group, Hochman has also been critical in some of the firm’s most important research projects, including those on the Chinese and Japanese economies, and interest rates.Wall Street’s largest banks and asset managers are also well represented on this year’s 30 Under 30 Finance list. Laura Wong Hon Chan, 29, an interest rate options trader at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, last year helped lead a 40% increase in trading volume for exotics products. Raised in Mauritius, she does market-making and risk management of dollar-denominated interest rate derivatives ranging in complexity from vanilla options to complex structured swaps. Jordan Zarilli, 29, a vice president at Goldman Sachs, runs equity derivatives for financials and consumer companies while overseeing the desk’s risk.In private equity, Steven Marangos, 29, has invested $1 billion as part of the Tactical Opportunities group at Blackstone, the world’s largest private equity firm. Marangos has also played a big role in Blackstone’s push into insurance and the formation of its insurance solutions unit, working on a two person team to lead its investment in insurer Fidelity & Guarantee Life. Lakshya Madhok, 29, has helped grow a strong-performing $9-billion-in-assets structured credit investing team at Bain Capital Credit, directly overseeing a $1.4 billion portfolio of investments. Christine Boyd, 28, has led the expansion of Apollo Global’s real estate debt platform on the West Coast, closing over $4 billion in loan deals.At TPG, Akash Pradhan, 29, is at the fore of the firm’s move into social impact investments and taking a leadership role in the $2.1 billion Rise Fund’s push into education technology investments, handling recent deals in DreamBox Learning and Renaissance Learning. As a technology investor in TPG’s $3.7 billion growth fund, he’s also worked on high-profile deals like Box and GreenSky.In financial technology, 30 Under 30 list makers are building breakthrough companies that aim to solve some of the biggest points of friction in the financial system. Brex, cofounded by Pedro Franceschi, 22, and Henrique Dubugras, 23, has raised $213 million and ascended to “unicorn” status by offering a novel credit card that banks tech startups based on how much money they raise. These entrepreneurs count Peter Thiel and Yuri Milner’s DST Global among their backers, and they sold their prior venture Pagar.me for tens of millions of dollars.Samantha Whitmore, 27, heads engineering at Kensho Technologies, which was recently acquired by S&P Global for $550 million and is a pioneer in applying machine learning and natural language processing to investing. Whitmore oversees a 10-person engineering team and helped build Kensho’s ubiquitous scoring engine. Charlie Javice, 26, is the founder of Frank, which aims to improve the $1.5 trillion student loan market by making the application process easier and faster. With $16 million in funding, Javice’s company already has helped 300,000 students apply for financial aid.Loek Janssen, 29, came to the U.S. from the Netherlands and studied at Stanford. Now as cofounder and CTO of Nova Credit, he's making software that lets immigrants share their home-country credit history with financial service providers, giving them better access to credit. The startup has raised $20 million from VCs like General Catalyst and plans to fill a big void in the marketplace. Lightning Labs cofounder Olaoluwa Osuntokun, 25, an immigrant from Nigeria, has raised $2.5 million to increase the speed of transactions on the bitcoin blockchain, making it a more viable system for small, Venmo-like transactions.Machine-learning engineer JB Rubinovitz, 26, cofounded Bail Bloc to create a blockchain-based system in which mined cryptocurrency can be used to pay for bail for those who can’t afford it. Hunter Horsley, 28, CEO of Bitwise Asset Management, is trying to build the Vanguard of cryptocurrencies. Bitwise’s four cryptocurrency indices are currently used by over 600 multifamily offices.As large public corporations turn to dealmaking to drive their growth, they’re counting on 30 Under 30 Finance list makers. Mikko Salovaara, 26, is the CFO of the U.S. Zone at Kraft Heinz, the $66-billion-market-cap foods giant backed by 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway. Salovaara is responsible for all aspects of finance within the U.S. for the company, leading a team of about 300. Previously he was CFO of Kraft Heinz in Asia and an analyst with 3G Capital in New York, advising the boards and management of other holdings like AB-InBev and Restaurant Brands International.At Barry Diller’s $15-billion-market-cap internet conglomerate IAC, Michelle Arbov, 28, has played a big role in growing its online home services business as a vice president of M&A. Arbov helped scale the company’s HomeAdvisor business through acquisitions and played an important role in its purchase of Angie’s List. Now publicly traded, ANGI Homeservices carries a $9 billion market cap and Arbov’s been instrumental in recent deals like its purchase of home services company Handy.

cryptocurrency—blockchain is not just about bitcoin,” said Chief Executive 
Anndy ...","Oct 3, 2018,06:45am EDT","Blockchain has become a buzzword for many businesses, and more Singapore companies have ventured into blockchain amid an overall openness toward the digital technology in the island nation.","Singapore-based supply-chain platform Linfinity has become a proponent of the technology. It is trying to get people to look beyond the hype to recognize blockchain’s benefits through dialogue sessions in Singapore and elsewhere in Asia. “We want to move away from the traditional perspective of cryptocurrency—blockchain is not just about bitcoin,” said Chief Executive Anndy Lian, who started Linfinity last year.The startup’s monthly Linfinity Talks, which cater to retail investors and the community, provide audiences with a basic education in blockchain technology. It also aims to reduce distrust towards blockchain that often stems from unpredictable cryptocurrencies and unreliable founders who disappear from investors’ view after an initial coin offering, said Lian.In addition, the firm is holding discussions with C-Suite executives, as well as forums tailored to the interests of crypto enthusiasts. These address larger questions, such as how blockchain will affect current tech infrastructure.Besides arranging these talks, Linfinity is a supply-chain platform that uses blockchain’s “distributed ledger”, or a network of nodes that work directly with one another to validate transactions, to combat counterfeit goods and create a secure tracking system. It aims to track goods, such as cosmetics and pharmaceutical products, as they travel from the start of supply chains, where raw materials are harnessed, to factories and eventually the consumer.Linfinity equips these goods with cameras, scanners and GPS tracking devices to monitor the whole process. Details such as the names of the people handling the goods and the products’ expiry dates are documented on the blockchain and cannot be modified, helping to create a transparent system, said Lian.While some companies are already using blockchain technology to track supply chains, they mostly manage only a part of, and not the entire, supply chain. This is where Linfinity could help fill the gap, he added.The startup has signed memorandums of understanding with six companies, including Singapore-based healthcare company Scientific Tradition, RHTLaw TaylorWessing and asset manager Crossinvest. Linfinity aims to help Scientific Tradition and other companies track the movement of raw materials along their supply chains. Meanwhile, firms such as RHTLawTaylorWessing will take on advisory roles.With 60 employees, Linfinity has offices in Singapore, China and South Korea. It is also looking to expand into Japan and Taiwan. The company is mainly self-funded, although it has a few early and institutional investors that Lian declines to disclose. It has a market cap of about $440,000 based on its digital currency, the Linfinity token, which it launched on Chinese crypto exchange CoinEx in July.Linfinity chief executive Anndy Lian is trying to encourage more discourse on blockchain technology.Linfinity is not the only company in Singapore that is focusing on blockchain-based supply chains. Shipping company Pacific International Lines, owned by billionaire Chang Yun Chung, is working with port operator PSA International and tech giant IBM Singapore to track cargo movement from Chongqing to Singapore on a blockchain-based supply-chain platform.While neighbors such as China are cracking down on cryptocurrency exchanges and events, Singapore has been cautiously receptive to the virtual currency. “Cryptocurrencies are an experiment. The number and different forms of cryptocurrencies are growing internationally. It is too early to say if they will succeed,” said Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam in a written answer to questions from members of parliament on banning the trading of bitcoin or cryptocurrency, according to the local press.The country has been watching the crypto space carefully. Last November, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, its central bank and financial regulator, published a guide to digital token offerings that provides information on how the country’s securities laws apply to digital tokens.It has also tested blockchain technology through Project Ubin, a partnership with New York-based financial consortium R3, which aims to work on inter-bank payments.In the private sector, a growing number of players are starting to join Singapore’s blockchain industry. For example, vehicle data firm Mass Vehicle Ledger (MVL) Foundation is using blockchain technology to record and increase people’s access to car-related data in areas such as ride-hailing, vehicle maintenance and car dealership.MVL’s private-hire service Tada, Korean for “let’s ride,” managed to get more than 10,000 customers on board before its launch on July 26. Passengers and drivers can rack up points that can be converted into MVL coins, the cryptocurrency of the Singapore-based firm. These can be exchanged for rewards from MVL’s partner companies. The firm raised some $16 million through an initial coin offering earlier this year.Its South Korean founder and CEO Kay Woo founded MVL’s parent company, location-based services firm easi6, in 2012. Blockchain technology especially benefits data-driven industries such as transportation, insurance and supply-chain management, but it is not suitable for all businesses, he says. “Even though you know blockchain technology well, your business model might not be suitable for it. It’s not magic or a simple solution, but it could be a big revolution.”"

[+] Conference 2018, in London on March 22, 2018. Photo credit: Daniel Leal-OlivasAcross Europe more broadly, (including the UK), 20% of the banking and payments institutions are new entrants and have captured nearly 7% of total banking revenue — and one-third (33%) of all new revenue since 2005.Elsewhere, while Canada has a lot of new entrants (with 47% of banking and payments institutions being classified as new), they have captured less than 2% of total banking and payments revenue, making Canada one of the least disrupted major banking markets.The UK fintech scene has been boosted by the local financial watchdog adopting EU so-called open banking rules early, forcing lenders to open up access for fintechs to the data and accounts of any clients who authorize it.Earlier this year the UK government created a crypto-assets task force, updated fintech regulation and built a UK-Australia so-called fintech bridge to help firms expand internationally.The rise in fintech firms and banking startups was sparked by the 2008 global financial crisis, which caused banks to cut back on spending and withdraw from some markets altogether — leaving a vacuum fintech companies stepped into.By using technology to make the finding, registering and lending to new customers quicker and easier these fintech companies have forced the traditional banking industry, which is famously slow to adapt, to react.""Ten years after the financial crisis, the banking industry is experiencing a level of competitive intensity and disruption that’s much greater than what's been seen before,"" said Julian Skan, Accenture Strategy managing director for banking and capital markets. ""With challenger banks and platform players reducing traditional banks’ competitiveness and the threat of a power shift looming, incumbent players can no longer rest on their laurels.""Darling of the UK fintech scene Funding Circle, a peer-to-peer lender, last month unveiled plans to raise £300 million in an initial public offering that is expected to value it at more than £1.5 billion.Traditional banks in the UK will likely start to see a significant impact on revenues as leading challenger banks are surpassing the 1 million customer threshold and 15 fintechs have been granted full banking licenses, the report warned.However, despite the UK's fintech startups capturing more of the market, even the country's biggest fintech firms and new banks are dwarfed by the likes of Stripe, Robinhood or SoFi in the U.S. — which are in turn outclassed by China's Ant Financial, the digital finance arm of online retailer Alibaba, which was recently valued at $150 billion.The UK is leading the way in terms of new banks and fintech startups.""Banks are mobilizing to take advantage of industry changes, leveraging digital technologies and ecosystem business models to cement their relevance with customers and regain revenue growth,"" Skan added."

She noted with cash, people make runs on banks when they believe withdrawals are honored on a first-come-first-serve basis.“Digital currency, instead, because it can be distributed much more easily than cash, could reassure even the person left lying on the couch!” Lagarde contended.The IMF head added that in the fintech revolution, people expect money to be integrated with social media; readily available for online and person-to-person use (including for micro-payments);  cheap and safe; and protected against criminals and prying eyes..Countering opponents of central bank digital currencies, she argued technology offers a wide canvas to mitigate the potential risks to financial integrity and financial stability.She added a public-private partnership would be the best way to foster central bank digital currency innovation.“The central bank focuses on its comparative advantage back-end settlement—and financial institutions and start-ups are free to focus on what they do best—client interface and innovation.

cryptographic signatures similar to those that ensure each bitcoin is 
unique.","Editors' Pick|Nov 8, 2018,07:00am EST",PC Parts And Accessory Shoot - August 2011,"Data storage giant Seagate has a counterfeiting problem. All one need do is Google ""Seagate and fake"" and the results produce numerous guides to help ensure users the hardware they’re putting in their computer is real. But the problem is actually larger than just retail customers buying fraudulent hard drives, which sometimes come shipped as nothing more than dressed  up USB sticks. Not only are counterfeits making it onto some mainstream platforms like eBay, but something called the reverse supply chain, when customers return goods, is also vulnerable, increasing the risk that Seagate itself, which generated $11.8 billion revenue this year, is accepting counterfeits back into its own supply.To prevent that from happening, the Cupertino, California, firm has devised a twofold plan aimed at cutting off the $100 billion counterfeit hardware industry from every angle. On one side, the hardware itself is coming under increased protection using cryptographic signatures similar to those that ensure each bitcoin is unique. But to ensure the supply chain itself—the actual process by which every part of every product is accounted for when it is moved—is also safe, Seagate has been quietly working with IBM for the past two months to move that process to a blockchain.If the proof of concept, which is expected to be completed as soon as the end of this year, is successful, it could help shine a light on the larger vulnerable computer hardware supply chain, which is increasingly being seen as a matter of national security.“We found a unique way of tying the physical product to the virtual world, through the blockchain,” says Seagate managing technologist Manuel Offenberg, who is overseeing the project. “We think that’s where some of the novelty is, where we really can go from a physical product to the virtual blockchain world.”While this effort marks Seagate’s first public push into blockchain, it’s also just a continuation of a years-old professional relationship with IBM, according to Offenberg. At least as far back as 2009, Seagate has been providing hard drives for IBM products, and after a brainstorming session in June helped confirm Seagate’s interest in the underlying technology, the companies formalized their latest project.Still in the early stages of the build, Offenberg and his team of six in Freemont, California, are using the enterprise grade IBM Blockchain, which incorporates the open-source Hyperledger Fabric, to track the movement of goods from the point of manufacture to the point of sale, and if necessary back again.While the traditional Seagate supply chain consists of numerous middlemen, each manually scanning and entering each computer part into their own accounting software, Offenberg hopes the IBM Blockchain solution will help move the process to a single append-only database that would accelerate the process and give users increased certainty fraud wasn't being committed. In addition, Offenberg says some steps such as the process of actually checking a product is authentic are replicated by IBM, Seagate and other counterparties, and could be reduced to a single action.The same is true for the reverse supply chain, when a customer returns a product to IBM, which returns the product to Seagate, which returns it to a reprocessing facility, and only then can it be determined if it is suitable to sell on a refurbished market.But the blockchain supply chain is only part of the cryptographic solution. Seagate also announced today that it will integrate its own cryptographic signatures, or electronic IDs (EIDs) at the point of manufacture to serve as a fingerprint for each piece of hardware along each step of the supply chain. When a hard drive is returned, cryptographic proof that the item was erased within the originating jurisdiction will also be hashed on the blockchain.“Based on the information in the blockchain, we can also quickly verify the provenance of the device, in which case, we could cut out several steps,” says Offenberg. “The proof of concept will tell us more succinctly which steps can be removed.”In addition to this being the first instance of an enterprise computer hardware supplier publicly exploring IBM Blockchain, the partnership is unusual because the software provider, IBM, is also a potential user.As a customer of Seagate, IBM uses the hardware being tracked on this supply chain in its servers, and if the platform is approved for pilot testing following a planned demo to executives from both companies next year, IBM will likely be the first to actually use the platform.“Initially, the application will be used between Seagate and IBM as we use it inside of our own server production operations,” says Bruce Anderson, IBM global managing director of the electronics industry and head of strategy for all the computer giant’s high-tech customers.At later stages of adoption, Anderson expects that some smaller companies with low supply chain volumes may decide to license access to IBM's or Seagate’s blockchain node, thereby reintroducing the middleman concept to the shared ledger. Larger companies, on the other hand, may have more of an incentive to spin up their own node on the blockchain platform. ""If someone's business is currently counterfeiting, this is going to take a big chunk out of the way they do business,"" Anderson added.Given the unique relationship, where IBM is both providing the blockchain software and the cloud computing support and is a participant in the supply chain, Anderson says, he took the further step of committing multiple members of this team to helping build out the solution side-by-side with the Seagate team.“We see that solving the counterfeiting problem as a customer of Seagate is definitely worth it,” says Anderson. ""We also see this at an industry level that others are going to be asking about.”Supply chain applications of blockchain and other distributed ledgers are increasingly being sought out as a possible evolution of the technology first popularized by bitcoin. At stake though is more than just system efficiency that results from removing middlemen and syncing up accounting records.Industry concerns go far beyond potentially fraudulent Seagate products moving on the supply chain. The administrations of both former U.S. President Barack Obama and current President Trump have issued statements about potential national security threats that could result from poorly managed supply chains. Most recently, Bloomberg published a hotly contested report claiming that a poorly managed server supply chain may have resulted in the surreptitious placement of malicious hardware. While blockchain might not necessarily stop such alleged fraud, a shared, immutable ledger could dramatically simplify investigations, giving those who believe the fraud existed, and those who don't, the evidence to support their case.As for Seagate, Offenberg declined to comment on whether the blockchain solution he is helping develop could address the issues brought up in the Bloomberg report. Instead he explained that these are still very early days for the project and that his company is predominantly focused on “bringing the levels of trust in our products up."" Though he did add: “We are looking at the bigger picture.”"

While the platform aims to bring transparency to a number of charitable organizations, the BCF platform will specifically advance the progress of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).If you look at the first few UN Sustainable Development Goals, such as poverty, hunger, health and even education, these are easily addressed or improved by the charity initiatives. Yet, what we’re trying to do is a level deeper. I believe that by improving transparency in the charity sector, we will be able address all 17 goals as a whole, at a more fundamental layer, said Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ).""''Donations through the BCF platform will ensure full transparency, accountability and direct reach to end recipients,'' echoed Helen Hai, United Nations Industrial Development Organization Goodwill Ambassador for Industrialization in Africa and Head of Blockchain Charity Foundation.Speaking at a United Nations Research Institute For Social Development (UNRISD) Seminar on Blockchain for Inclusive and Sustainable Development, Hai also said,''BCF will leverage blockchain technology to help fill the UN Sustainable Development Goals funding gap and directly empower over one billion people living in poverty. We believe poverty is not a destiny.''Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ) giving a keynote presentation at UNCTAD World Investment ForumTransparency Is Key For Fighting PovertyOne of the key benefits provided by blockchain technology is transparency, which is also one of the greatest challenges faced by charities today.“Donors don’t have the visibility as to where their funds are going, and most donations do not reach their intended beneficiaries. This lack of transparency causes a lack of trust, further reducing the willingness for people to donate to charity funds in general,” Zhao said.During his keynote presentation at UNCTAD World Investment Forum, Zhao noted that transparency brought about by blockchain technology will help advance all of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.""With improved transparency, we can be sure that all funds are used for the right purposes.  Once people have confidence that we can do more good, there will be more donations coming in. With more donations coming in, we can accomplish even more,""  said Zhao.Zhao also described the impact blockchain technology had on fundraising and donation distribution during disaster relief in West Japan last month, and spoke on the architecture of BCF's donation portal,''Conceptually, it is easy to track the flow of funds through the layers and we can make this 100% transparent. At the same time, for anything Binance is involved with, we pledge that 100% of donations will go to the end beneficiaries, and all costs will be covered by Binance, the company and the foundation.""The charity system will begin accepting donations immediately, with initial support for Binance Coin (BNB), Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) cryptocurrencies. BCF will also open a donation channel to support victims of the floods and landslides in Eastern Uganda.It Takes A VillageEchoing Binance, TRON Foundation pledged an initial amount of $3M to BCF to be put towards advancing blockchain efforts for charity.''All of us here have made the decision to be leaders in shaping blockchain technology for social good. Binance Charity Foundation is taking substantial steps in that direction by increasing the transparency of donations so we can see where the goodwill of the donors is going and what impact it has,” said Justin Sun, CEO of Tron Foundation.After speaking with individuals involved with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, it become clear to Sun that there was a lack of transparency, traceability, and efficiency within the organization. In turn, this has directly impacted the success of the organization’s charitable actions.I believe that providing the right infrastructure to those entities dedicated to charity and Sustainable Development Goals will help engage more people, allowing the community to receive more funding, be more efficient during their campaigns and ultimately have a better overall impact. Blockchain is a powerful tool that everybody should have access to. Collaborating with Binance, one of the leaders in this industry, will enable us to make this technology accessible, while being backed with the best innovations, Sun told me.""As an initial contribution, TRON is donating $3M to Binance Charity Foundation. Yet according to Sun, TRON will dedicate more resources and engineering power to build end-to-end solutions to support charitable actions.Our Blockchain is co-governed by 27 Super Representatives, all elected by TRON token holders. As one of those elected Super Representatives, I will dedicate the resources I have gained from co-governing the network to causes that will benefit society. I hope my actions will inspire more people to tap into the great potential of blockchain technology to truly make a positive impact, Sun said.""In addition to TRON, representatives from Bancor, UNICEF, IBM, Hyperledger, ConsenSys, the public sector and others gathered at the forum to discuss the implementation of blockchain toward the SDGs. The Blockchains for Sustainable Development forum attracted more than 700 attendees from around the world. Organized by the IFLAS initiative on Blockchains for Sustainable Development and supported by BCF, this marked the first blockchain session ever held at World Investment Forum."

Investors are losing their confidence and pulling money out of the country. The disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which has brought Saudi Arabia under the spotlight, proved to be a major market event. President Trump vowed “severe punishment” if the journalist was killed. Initially, the country's Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, denied knowledge about this death. However, following the most recent development, Saudi Arabia is expected to issue a report on Khashoggi and acknowledge the death of the journalist due to an interrogation that went wrong. The purpose was just to abduct him, but the operation was not cleared by the authorities and individuals will now be held accountable. Yesterday, President Trump also suggested that rogue action may have taken place.","Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's crown prince, left, smiles as U.S. President Donald Trump, holds...

The U.S. and Saudi Arabia are developing an increasingly close partnership, encompassing everything from isolating Iran to bolstering business ties beyond energy into technology, defence and entertainment. Photographer: Kevin Dietsch/Pool via BloombergIt is unsure how many believe such a statement, but the question is how Donald Trump will proceed after this. The reason he is involved is because of his close relations to Saudi and his recent visit to the country that showed the word their strong ties. All this is thanks to his son in law, Jared Kushner, the White House adviser who masterminded the entire new relation with Saudi Arabia after the Obama administration clearly made their distance.Mohammad Bin Salman appears to be one of the most proactive people the kingdom has ever had. Nobody has ever tried to convince several business leaders that they should use Saudi Arabia as the platform for their research labs the way he did. During his recent visit to the U.S., he met with Silicon Valley leaders and top executives. This kind of move is unprecedented and clearly shows that he is eager to diversify the country’s economy. In other words, he could be after creating another Silicon Valley in Saudi Arabia.After holding a successful Economic Reform Event in 2017, MBS decided to create the “Davos in the Desert” but it failed.  Major media outlets and business executives have decided not to participate. JP Morgan CEO and Ford’s Chairman are just a few top executives in that category.  If you want to attract Foreign Direct Investment FDI, businesses need assurance that they have the freedom to conduct their business, news wires have the freedom to report the actual picture and the political situation is stable enough. Saudi Arabia tied itself in unnecessary wars with neighbouring countries. Despite all these, businesses were still likely to consider the country as an option, but after Trump’s “severe punishment” remark, things have changed.Whether Trump really adopts a tough stance against Saudi Arabia remains to be seen. In the meantime, the Saudi stock index plunged nearly 7% during the session on Sunday after Trump’s initial comments and bounced back up yesterday after his softer tone.  The index is up nearly 1.53% year to date, but these gains are under threat again as the sell-off is picking up steam. Trump has left it open whether his administration will be part of the investment summit in Saudi Arabia. If the situation between Saudi Arabia and the U.S. becomes intense,  one thing that will be at threat is the peg between the Saudi Riyal and the dollar . We have seen this peg coming under serious pressure when the price of oil dropped at the lower 20s.Tadawual index has erased most of its gain for this yearSaudi is in a much stronger place compared to other counties the U.S. tried to put pressure on in the past. This is mainly because Saudi Arabia controls the OPEC cartel and it plays an important role here. It has the ability to put the supply and demand equation completely out of whack and trigger something similar to the Oil Embargo back in 1973.Having said this, the U.S. has made several changes over the years and it is the work of the precious presidents, which brought the U.S. shale oil production to a level not seen before. But this doesn’t mean that the U.S. and other OPEC countries can fill the gap. In other words, if the U.S. plays the same game it did with Iran, it is hard to imagine other countries stop buying Saudi oil.U.S. shale oil production has increased dramaticallyRemember, if the U.S. bans other countries from buying Saudi oil, this could trigger a huge rally in the cryptocurrency market. It has been brought up several times before that countries could dump the dollar as the benchmark currency to trade oil and instead use Bitcoin. Despite the massive scalability issues, there is a strong possibility that Saudis may join forces with other counties that are facing similar obstacles. Hence, the entire thing could backfire for the Trump administration.But Trump has made one thing clear from day one. He is more focused on his personal interests than anything else. His comments that it will be foolish to cancel the arms deal with Saudi Arabia was a clear evidence of this.Trump is an unpredictable individual, capable of picking fights with anyone without thinking about potential consequences for the country. It is this element that makes investors highly sensitive.  Saudi Arabia is the single biggest outside investor in SoftBank Group Corp. The group’s stock price sunk the most in more than two years on Monday on the back of the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.  When a stock falls like this, one way to measure the risk is to look at the cost of their credit default swap. The cost of this “against no-payment” has surged for SoftBank Group Corp and the chart below shows the CDS has jumped considerably, crossing the critical level of 10.CDS for SoftBank has jumped remarkably because of the risk involved"

Since GDPR went into effect back in May, there are still “wack-a-mole” instances with companies slipping through the cracks.Facebook, who is already facing severe scrutiny over how it handles its users private information, announced last week that it was subject to yet another security breach, this time, identified as the largest security breach in its 14-year history, with over 50 million compromised accounts. This breach will be the first major test of Europe’s GDPR laws, with estimations of around $1.63 billion in fines, or a maximum of 4% of the annual global turnover.But, these harsh realities don’t go unnoticed, even by companies opening their spell books to blockchain technology.#1–SkycoinTaking the idea of net neutrality to the max, Skycoin made its debut at ChainXChange conference in Las Vegas back in August, opening the floors up to Apple co-founder, Steve Wozniak, social media’s Gary Vaynerchuk, and Nobel Prize Winner, Paul Krugman.Holding itself out as the “third generation cryptocurrency,” Skycoin aims to provide a “new internet” that is global, decentralized, and not controlled by any country, corporation, or government entity.Its technological hardware innovation, ""the skyminer,"" will allow the company to provide computing power, network capability, and storage capacity necessary for the Skywire network to function. Members of the company, or ‘skyminers’, act as specialized VPN’s and nodes on the network, allowing users to become their own ISP’s (internet service providers), granting complete user freedom within an encrypted network. Adding to the excitement, the Skywire network is private enough that IP addresses cannot be traced, and users are rewarded in Skycoin for providing bandwidth to other users.For privacy gurus or net neutrality enthusiasts, this is a project to stay on top of.#2–MetadiumIn 2017, there were over 150 million social security numbers exposed in data breaches within the U.S. alone. What we've learned from these breaches, is that identity theft has become an endemic problem.Metadium is one company that is aiming to create a new, self-sovereign “digital identity” for users, allowing them complete control over where, when, and how much of their personal data is shared. Through the company's Meta ID project, any transaction or action that takes place on the Metadium blockchain will cost META, their native token. This helps to prevent transaction overflows and DDoS attacks. By bringing in attestation services to help validate users’ identities, all parties in the ecosystem are rewarded. The company’s co-founder, Ryan Uhr, a former chief engineer at Hyundai Electronics, and chief operating officer, Richard Yun, a former senior financial analyst at Cisco, literally bring security to this project.#3–Torch.AIBy exploiting good digital hygiene, Torch.AI addresses human credentialing and behavioral analysis, supplier diligence, and contextual analysis of the involved parties to financial transactions, all on the Atlas blockchain.

Its strategic advisors include CAA’s Hunter Williams and Paradigm partner, Paul Morris, alongside Lee Anderson and Sam Hunt.OMF is making its debut on October 20, 2018 in San Francisco at UC Berkeley's Greek Theatre.#5–APERTURE TVSimilar to popular market-streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu, APERTURE is a film and television ‘over the top’ (OTT) media services provider that allows users to watch premium theatrical film releases. But, what sets this project out is that APERTURE members are able to watch complete box sets of films and TV productions on all models of smart TV’s, mobile devices, and desktop devices.Rather than buying the physical boxed set of any given TV-series, APERTURE subscribers are given exclusive access to cast and director interviews, “making of” documentaries, alternate endings, deleted scenes, and more. Talk about spacial and financial savings.With over two years in development and testing, APERTURE utilizes Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host and manage all its content, specifically through Amazon’s CloudFront CDN service. Unlike other streaming services currently on the market, APERTURE drives to be the only premium film and production streaming service in North America that will allow subscribers to pay for their service with the Blockchain. As subscribers are added to the platform, the company’s value increases, tying real-world metrics to the value of the cryptocurrency.#6–VevueFrom the company that brought you the first film released with the help of blockchain technology, VeVue continues its mission in democratizing the internet in its fight against online piracy with its P2P blockchain. The blockchain streaming app service will soon be able to facilitate content surveillance, allowing for smart contract technology to identify the owner of the device and/or system that copies and/or duplicates protected content.While the company’s patent is pending on its ‘smart computational engine’, the company assigns a unique ID to video content that is stored on the Blockchain, activating the surveillance smart contract. The platform then utilizes its uniquely-coded process to search the internet for illegal duplicates of the original video, illuminating a pathway for potential copyright actions by the content owner.Thomas Olson, Vevue’s founder, told me that they have an early market lead by allowing mainstream users to earn their first cryptocurrency, not buy it. He considered the company in the same category as the Brave browser with their BAT token and Earn.com, recently acquired by Coinbase.The company recently partnered with Manchester-based indie sensation, Lost Under Heaven (LUH), bringing the touring duo’s content onto its platform, ahead of its October U.S. tour. By utilizing native tokens in the VeVue ecosystem, fans are able to directly request video content from the duo, including potentially personalized messages from the group.#7–TenfoldIn a market of over 1,900 DApps, there are over 12,000 daily active users. But, in this realm, user adoption is seriously lacking due to scalability issues. In attempts at solving these issues, the Tenfold Protocol utilizes Layer 2 to help DApps run more smoothly, processing transactions “off-chain.” This is done by identifying bounded transactions which by nature have an upper limit to their transfer value. These transactions are then processed through Tenfold’s network.The company has successfully utilized this technology in the game, HyperDragons, which took the #1 ranking on DappRadar’s game ranking last week. The blockchain-based strategy game allows players to construct kingdoms, accumulate assets, and battle dragons. The technology renders swift and gas-free gameplay, allowing for updated versions to run even faster than its predecessors.2015 U.S. Women's World Cup Champion and defender, Meghan Klingenberg (22), taking on Brazil in the... [+] 2015 Women's World Cup.(Photo by Joshua Weisberg/Icon Sportswire) / (Photo by Joshua Weisberg/Icon Sportswire/Corbis via Getty Images)In the age of women's empowerment, sports play an extremely crucial role.Having recently partnered with the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) earlier this summer, the Seattle-based startup, Player Tokens, led by founder and CEO, Kush Parikh, announced Tuesday that they have reached another groundbreaking deal, this time with the U.S. Women's National Team Players Association (USWNTPA). This will mark the first digital collectible that female athletes will be featured on in the retail market. Unfortunately, history has shown that women's sports has taken a backseat to that of men's leagues, at least in the collectibles industry.I was able to speak with both Parikh and Meghan Klingenberg, a player for the Portland Thorns and the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team on the phone, on why they believe this partnership will benefit both the space and the players. According to Klingenberg, the team's victory at the 2015 World Cup was the moving force behind the partnership.“When we won the World Cup, that was really cool, but, there was no structure in place to help our team capitalize off that win, that popularity, and that attention. Everyone was making money except for the players, which was frustrating, because we worked really hard. This isn’t to be confused with my desire or our desire of being in it just for the money, but if there’s money to be had, especially with our licensing rights, why shouldn’t the team be partaking in that? That led us to Player Tokens and the NFL Players Association (NFLPA).”Adding to the 2015 World Cup winner’s thoughts, Parikh also believes there to be something unique here, especially as it pertains to the sports space. “When it comes to digital collectibles, I’ve always thought about them as different ‘packs’,” said the Player Tokens CEO.The business model is not to be confused with crypto-currency, rather, the idea that digital assets are available in various “packs” allow for blockchain technology to truly thrive in a multi-dimensional and evolving sports space.This is definitely a force to be reckoned with, as it isn’t hard to believe that Player Tokens may find its way into helping shape other professional organizations in the future.Our energy can help protect our cybersecurity.When Walmart announced last month that it was forcing its suppliers onto the Blockchain in the aftermath of the E. coli outbreak, it was a message heard ‘round the world.#10–EthicHubMany small farmers around the world, while operating demonstrably profitable businesses, suffer from a range of geographic, technological, and financial issues that hinder their ability to sustain and grow their operations. Examples include, but aren't limited to the lack of local financial services, inaccessibility to lenders and financing networks, as well as prohibitively high costs and interest rates when these services and networks are available.By providing equitable sources of funding to small and unbanked farmers around the world, while giving lenders access to large, previously unreachable markets, EthicHub, a decentralized crowd-lending platform, uses the Blockchain to connect groups of small farmers from developing countries who currently pay high interest for cash loans without leaving record of such payment history, with lenders in low-interest markets with excess liquidity.Prior to connection, all borrowers are thoroughly vetted by one of EthicHub’s “Local Nodes” who possess strong experience working with the local community to ensure only solvent projects are offered to contributors. Throughout the funding process, each borrower’s credit history and the Local Node’s success history are recorded and provided to lenders to help with decision-making; effectively creating a valuable digital identity for EthicHub participants.The company’s combined 30-year history in coffee farming in addition to its decade-experience in software development and architecture, will help to democratize and humanize the international credit sector.#11–VostokBack in March, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) released for the first time, its report on how much our digital economy has contributed to GDP. The BEA defined our ‘digital economy’ by identifying three major types of goods and services:By 2020, the infrastructure is projected to reach over $6.6 trillion, eventually serving as a vital building block to the future of our digital economy. Capitalizing off these statistics, Vostok, a private blockchain platform specifically designed for large enterprises and public institutions, has created its own digital infrastructure to connect public administration services. Current examples include, but aren’t limited to state archival records, business registrations, banking, voting, and digital property rights.Its founder, Sasha Ivanov, also founded the $1.7 billion public blockchain platform, Waves, implementing the proof-of-stake (POS) Waves-NG consensus mechanism, which was based off the Bitcoin-NG model utilizing key-block and micro-block process. This allows for the blockchain network to process hundreds of transactions per second.#12–EnergiTokenAccording to BP's Statistical Review of World Energy, global energy demand grew by 2.2% in 2017; a 1.2% increase from 2016. While much of the growth is attributed to an increase in economic growth, China alone contributed to over a third of that growth.The market, dominated by major utility companies in what appears to be a closed ecosystem, is highly attributed to the U.S. and China, valued at $1.2 trillion and $2.7 trillion, respectively. In lieu of the current political heat between the U.S. and China, studies show that by 2020, the trends should be relatively close to what we are already seeing. But, with blockchain technology, the potential for those figures to grow is highly probable.As we have also seen with Solar Bankers, companies are looking for ways to incentivize clean energy usage. EnergiToken, a blockchain-based platform that rewards users for good “energy-hygiene”, aims to decentralize the energy markets by incentivizing consumers to participate in a transparent peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace, directly connecting electric generators with consumers. The native token, ETK, can be earned for energy-saving activities, which can then be used as payment for energy bills, trade-excess energy, or liquidation.Currently, the company’s parent, Energi Mine, is already managing over $140 million in energy across Europe, forcing market competition and reducing the current inefficiencies. Until this project, it seems that there hasn’t been much of an incentive to save energy. Definitely worth turning your switches on for.Time to manage your investmentsFor millennials, beginning to take an early look at our portfolios and assets is important in career development. The 21st century has made asset management more necessary than ever, as we are not just investing in stocks, but in digital collectibles, cryptocurrencies, and other new digital technologies. But, how do we document and protect those investments?#13–CoolBitXFor lawyers in particular, working with clients and understanding how to secure crypto assets will present a major challenge in the upcoming year. As regulation continues to develop and outline what is and is not acceptable when it comes to identification, security, and registration, holders of crypto need to take caution when managing their digital investments.Founded in 2014, CoolBitX, is a Taiwanese fintech company that specializes in manufacturing secure, US-patented digital asset hardware, while developing smart contract platforms for millions of users. The company is backed by leading investors such as SBI Holdings and Bitmain. The company’s mobile wallet, CoolWallet S, has become one of the market’s better known hardware wallets, providing users with offline digital vault capabilities such as selecting credit card sizes, physical flexibilities, and waterproof security.Keep Your Cauldrons BrewingSo, when you’re out trick-or-treating for new crypto-investments or blockchain-based ventures, keep your cauldron’s brewing and bubbling for more innovative and ""spook-tacular"" projects that are awakening for the upcoming year."

These figure are as fascinating as they are revealing. They refer to the ...","Nov 13, 2018,08:12am EST","When a graph depicting the funding of ICOs month on month from May 2017 to October 2018 was published on Bloomberg the alarm bells, which had already sounded, reached their crescendo.","ICO funding dropped to a 17-month low in September. For most, there was no surprise in that statement, barring perhaps the extent in which the ICO furor had fallen. At its peak, toward the end of last year to January, ICOs were garnering frankly astounding sums of money as investors sniffed around for potentially massive return on investment.However, the ICO mechanism has come under heavy scrutiny. Basing a company and an idea on nothing more than a blockchain proposition written in a white paper, people flooded to these incredible and apparently world-changing ideas, but starting a company, even with a huge bankroll is not easy, especially with nascent technology.In saying that, there were very few barriers to entry. No lawyers, bankers or regulators were needed to get this new style of IPO off the ground, it was essentially a kickstarter, but with a lot more investor interest.So, as the ICOs flooded the market, and for the most part got what they wanted -- that is, millions of dollars -- they rode the wave to the top only to get a little too close to the sun before performing a swan dive that only Icarus would be proud of.The failing ICOs, and their mechanism for operation, were unraveling before investors’ eyes. Those who were stung were not going to fall for it again, and those waiting to see where this sector of cryptocurrency investment was heading were relieved to have held onto their cash.ICO funding by month in US Dollars - ICO funding dropped to a 17 month low in September (Photo:... [+] Bloomberg.com)So, looking back at the graph, it currently looks like a bit of a blip that could whittle away to nothing and disappear into obscurity. However, is this the way ICOs should go? There is no doubting that in terms of blockchain disruption, they have their own notion of disrupting the traditional VC funding method for startups. Using the principles of open decentralization, but on start up funding, there is something to be said in not leaving the power to decide on exciting projects in the hands of just a few with enough to bankroll them.There then needs to be some sort of change in direction in the ICO mechanism in order to bring back trust and reputation, as well as the investors. Can it be done remains to be seen, but those who are persisting with ICOs admit that they have had to pivot in some aspects of the fund raising mechanism.Failures even at the topIn a fascinating investigation into the top 10 ICOs by funding, Forbes Staff Writer Jeff Kauflin uncovered some interesting finding about the state of the ICO market place, even at the top.“Since the ICO explosion began in 2017, some 800 ICOs have been offered, raising a total of about $20 billion,” Kauflin discovered, giving some insight into just how big this facet of cryptocurrency got, before dropping down significantly.“As an investor, if you had purchased all 10 of the largest ICOs during the token sale,” Kauflin goes on. “You would have fared well through the middle of October 2018. A $100,000 investment would now be worth $160,936, compared with $113,722 for the S&P 500. But six of the 10 have negative returns since their ICO, and one has mysteriously vanished. If you had simply sunk your $100,000 into bitcoin, you’d have $264,417.”These figure are as fascinating as they are revealing. They refer to the latter end of the ICO explosion and the returns you would be seeing just a month ago. Thus, on a purely financial spectrum, the investment may be returning more than the S&P, but there is a lot of weight being pulled by the minority of successful ones.It shows that 60 percent of the best performers are actually showing negative numbers, and in fact, 10 percent of the best of the bunch suddenly up and vanished! It harks back to the high risk and high reward that sparked the entire ICO boom, but the dust is settling and the risks are all that really remain.It comes down to projects that were promised with huge ambition, but then oddly believed and invested in. Then, when the money came flooding in quicker than it could be counted, those in charge were left to deliver, with very little idea as to how. There was also no regulation, laws, or any kinds of cheques and balances to vet the process, or keep it on track.CoinShares chief strategy officer Meltem Demirors describes it well - referring to those in charge of the ICOs. “They’re not financial planners or investors—they’re developers and engineers.”Can it be turned around?Lisa Cheng, founder and head of R&D of the Vanbex Group, the parent company of Etherparty, understands that the ICO mechanism is failing, and that its downfall can be attributed to a number of factors.“There are a lack of projects with real substance, and they fail to deliver on promises,” Cheng states bluntly. “The ICO bubble in 2017 was fuelled by hype and speculation. However, many projects failed to deliver on what they had initially planned. This led to diminishing confidence among ICO investors. The bear market also exacerbated the downfall of ICOs, by saturating capital from the cryptocurrency market.”Amir Farhand, CEO of a blockchain company called SOAR, has also noted the failing of the ICO mechanism.“I think there are a number of factors ranging from the quality of projects, investment mechanisms as well as the lag in the expected uptake of various blockchain technologies by the average consumer,” Farhand adds.“By the end of 2017 there was a surge in interest whereby pundits gauged which blockchain technologies would be rapidly taken up by the consumer, unfortunately 12 months on, technical hurdles have resulted in only a handful of ICO projects reaching any broader uptake. But this is by no means the final result, I expect that 2019 will be the year that many ICO projects will indeed mature and go onto to broader consumer acceptance.”So, while Farhand believes there will be ‘broader consumer acceptance’ coming from next year. There also needs to be a change in the mechanism for this to happen. It is not solely based around the blockchain hurdles that ICOs went off the boil, there needs to be a change in tact.“I strongly believe that ICOs as we know it will slowly subside and they will evolve into a more rational investment offering,” Farhand said. “Regulatory systems will need to be triggered to ensure that investors don't lose their money to scams, and that there is a 'balls on the line' approach by the projects themselves to be as open to the community as possible. After all the premise of blockchain is openness and decentralisation, I'm not sure why so many projects hide so much information from the broader community.”SOAR is trying to shift the needle by offering equity and tokens to institutionalised investors, but even with these types of changes that make these startups more liable, there needs to be projects that have a strong backing and more than just a wishy-washy promise laid out on a whitepaper.Cheng’s biggest point about trying to keep the ICO marketplace a float has to do with the strength of projects coming through. Because blockchain technology is so broad, and can be aimed at almost any sector, it can be diluted in to seemingly pointless projects.“ICOs of the future will have to be legitimately strong projects in order to attract investors. Investors buying into an ICO, will not be sold on hype and speculation alone anymore. Furthermore, the cryptocurrency market needs to be stable, and there needs to be an influx of institutional money in order to attract investors again. Security is another issue that needs to be addressed in order for investor confidence to return. Investors need to feel that their funds are safe when buying into an ICO,” says ChengCheng Also feels that the change in the tides for ICO tokens will be based on their actual make up. The emergence of the The Security Token Offering (STO) means there is a lot more regulatory checks and balances upon these offerings.A STO is a token that helps in mitigating a lot of the risks that come from traditional ICOs and tokens. Security tokens are essentially financial securities and therefore, they are backed by tangible assets, profits, or company revenue - and fall under a lot more investor-protection regulations.“Security Token Offerings will be the next big thing in cryptocurrency fundraising,” is the belief of Cheng “Most STOs are based off financial institutions, thus making it more secure than ICOs.”A long climb upAgain, the Bloomberg graph is very telling; the way in which it spiked and dropped. But, one can also draw similarities between the spike and drop of the price of Bitcoin over almost the same time. There is however still a lot of belief in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.No doubt that the cryptocurrency space is evolving, especially in terms of its need to become more compliant with regulatory needs, but in the same breath, the ICO space needs to do the same.Hype and speculation has left the market entirely, regardless of it is ICO investing, or Bitcoin. This is the best thing that could have happened however as now those who want to survive in a bear market and push through need to show some real potential and direction.ICOs sit on the precipice. They could either fall away entirely and be remembered as an entirely bad dream, or they can try and evolve and be a driving and disrupting force of innovation and start up business like they were supposed to be before the mass greed cycle took hold."

[+] technology, the ASX (Australian Stock Exchange) has indicated that it will adopt blockchain ledger, into its systems, the same technology Bitcoin uses. (Source: Getty, Royalty free).","Australian fintech company Identitii that enables the secure overlay of “transaction-level” detail on top of financial messages using a private blockchain, commenced trading on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) today in an initial public offering (IPO) that put a market capitalization of A$41 million (c$29.23 million) on the business.Over the past few of years, Identitii, which was founded as a start-up in 2014, has been forging its way towards this listing on the ASX. Back in 2016 the venture won the SWIFT Innotribe Industry Challenge on Compliance, which led to a pilot with seven major banks. And, last year in October the company from “Down Under” announced the launch of its Software as a Service (SaaS) offering, which was made available on the Microsoft Azure cloud.The latter was designed to help banks effectively address a lack of readily available payment information in certain quarters and extensively manual investigation processes that can exacerbate issues around delivering faster and more cost-effective payments, whilst ensuring extensive anti-money laundering (AML) and financial crime sanctions checks are performed.Legacy TechnologyOne might ask why is this development is significant. Well, legacy technology has to date limited the amount of detail banks and corporates can share via payment networks such as SWIFT, ACH (Automated Clearing House) and RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement) . SWIFT, for example, imposes a limit of 300 characters on MT103 messages. An MT103 is a message a SWIFT payment message type/format used for cash transfer and specifically for cross border/international wire transfer.“The originator of a payment has had to send it off and hope it gets where it needs to go,” explained Nick Armstrong, CEO of Identitii and the company's co-founder. “As a result, around 8% of these messages are held up as the receiving bank does not have enough information to determine what to do with a payment when it arrives or even if they should accept the payment, because they do not have enough information about the sender.”Banks have to manually review and clear payments, check details against sanctions lists, collect additional Know Your Client (KYC) information from customers and reconcile the transaction against invoices internally.Clearly, this takes time to complete, and costs “on average $50 per transaction”, Armstrong pointed out. And, given that there are around 30 million messages being exchanged over the SWIFT network alone each day, this is a $120 million problem for banks. So, not an inconsiderable issue.Identitii allows banks and corporates to securely exchange information and documents related to each transaction in real-time. It provides greater security to both sides of a transaction, makes settlement faster, reduces risks and cost associated with sharing information and simplifies compliance. It also vastly improves the customer experience banks can provide to their customers, as the payment service they provide is faster, more secure and more often settled first time. Identitii calls it “Know Your Transaction” or KYT.The IPOThe listing, which follows a fully underwritten A$11 million raising on September 12 (2018) at A$0.75 per share, sees a total of 14,666,666 shares being issued for an undiluted market capitalization at listing of A$41 million.Breaking down the key offer statistics, out of 39,852,133 existing shares on issue the total number of shares available under the Offer represent just over a third (36.8%) of that figure (i.e. 14,666,666). On completion of the Offer, the total number of shares on issue will be 54,518,799.Four leading institutional fund managers were the cornerstone investors for A$9m (c.$6.42 million) of the IPO. KTM Capital and Canaccord Genuity acted as joint lead managers, with KTM Capital fully underwriting the A$11 million (c.$7.85 million) raising.It is understood that funds raised from the IPO will go towards further “development and commercialization” of Identitii’s platform, already in use at global bank HSBC, as well as to appointing key resources in business development, marketing, account management and professional services.In terms of bolstering management, the company has appointed two new senior management roles in order to accelerate growth and drive its “go-to-market” strategy. Clare Rhodes becomes the firm’s Chief Marketing Officer (CMO), who has spent her career helping financial services and technology companies in the U.S., UK, Asia and Australia take advantage of growth opportunities, while Mark Garvie, who has worked in Hong Kong for most of his career, as its Chief Commercial Officer (COO).A journalist reports from a public gallery at the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) in Sydney, earlier... [+] this year in February. (Source: AP Photo/Rick Rycroft).Problem Facing BanksIdentitii aims to solve what is described as a “multi-million-dollar” problem for banks, who combined send more than 25 million messages over existing payment networks - SWIFT included - every day. According to Armstrong “Identitii could work overlayed on top of any existing or emerging settlement technology.”To illustrate the extent of the issue, the SWIFT website cites the number of financial messages sent over their network each day, which is usually around 25 to 30 million. Other networks are ACH and RTGS.And, while the precise answer to the dollar cost from all these messages flying around, McKinsey’s Global Payments Report 2017 has suggested payments will be a $2 trillion industry by 2020.These legacy networks currently limit the amount of detail that can be shared in messages, resulting in high rates of payments being held up for manual verification and investigation.And, while savings Identitii could potentially pass onto the banks who use their service versus the other/legacy systems in use is hard to pin down, Armstrong pointed to a SWIFT proof-of-value where Identitii demonstrated how it could save a single bank $15 million annually.Private BlockchainThe Identitii platform is built on a private blockchain and provides a way for banks and corporates to securely overlay documents and information on financial messages moving via the existing infrastructure, using Identitii Tokens.This additional transaction level detail - termed KYT - is touted as resulting in a higher rate of payments being settled first time, faster reconciliation, significantly decreased risk and an improved customer experience.Their token technology uses a distributed ledger and an innovative messaging system to enable information sharing before and after financial messages have been sent. As such, tokens travel within traditional settlement messages including SWIFT, ACH and RTGS and emerging settlement technologies.Armstrong commenting in the wake of the IPO on the ASX, which as an exchange signaled recently that it will adopt blockchain ledger into its systems (the same underlying technology that Bitcoin uses), said: “The need for enriched information to be shared between financial institutions and corporates is being driven by changing regulations and a push for faster and more transparent communication between counterparties.”By way of background, Armstrong previously founded and run EnergyLink (formerly COzero), an energy & emissions trading company with cloud-based energy management software, and Greentricity, a renewable energy provider acquired by AGL.An early proponent of blockchain, he added: “The opportunity to help banks and corporates achieve the visibility they need into their financial transactions is what we are solving at Identitii, and it is a solution that has been validated by both the legacy networks we enhance, and the financial institutions that use them. The funds raised today will enable us to continue to support this evolution in the markets and further commercialize the Identitii product suite.”Among its other solutions, Identitii’s Serra is an append-only federated database management system that supports robust permissioning and an immutable, verifiable audit trail. Leveraging what is claimed to be the “best parts” of distributed ledger technology (DLT), relational and graph databases, it enables the secure and auditable exchange of information between systems, branches and institutions.In relation to the health of fintechs and start-ups with blockchain-based systems and raising capital, Armstrong reflected generally that: “Blockchain has proven its value as a technology that can solve real transparency, auditability and compliance issues for banks and corporates. There are some real innovations coming out of the FinTech blockchain landscape and that is reflected in the strength of companies like ours delivering real benefits for their customers.”Industry ReactionEstonian FX and cryptocurrency trader Siim Õunap, who also serves as the COO of blockchain marketing agency Savii Digital between London and Tallinn, remarking in light of Identitii’s IPO development and their current endeavour said: “This is a long overdue upgrade in the bottleneck of international payments. The issue with checking transactions, avoiding AML and still keeping the transaction speed fast has been a huge complication that most banks are still struggling with. And, it will be very interesting to see how Identitii is going to solve this complex puzzle.”Gary Wright, CEO and founder of City thinktank B.I.S.S. Research in London, commenting said: “This initiative is just one of many in the fintech space that is releasing DLT technology to solve real and age-old problems in the financial markets. The crazy explosion in fintech - with almost as many start-ups you can see stars in the night sky - is beginning to sort into those firms who have genuine prospects and the majority that will fail.”Wright, a former head of European settlements at JPMorgan Flemings in The City, added: “Identitii is in the former category and their listing will consolidate their future prospects. Payments is a natural starting point for Identitii, but their transaction information platform concept has value also in securities.”“The Private Blockchain aspect is one area that may limit the potential in the markets as open source is really what the market is looking for with fast organic growth. For this reason, I expect Identitii to face competition from legacy vendors of data and other new entrants to produce alternative and competing services. And, probably similarly constructed as Identitii.”Furthermore, according to Wright at B.I.S.S., which provides benchmarking services to financial firms particularly in the back-office space, it is “an exciting time to see the financial markets finally tackling problems that have historically cost the client and customers and that has carried so much risk.”Some though might ask why the banks themselves are not doing what Identitii. And, as one well-connected financial markets source in Australia who declined to be named put it to me: “If indeed Identii end up with client-level information on both sides of the ledger, they will have a real asset (worth investing in). But the real key question is why would that not be done as it is today through associations of banks (e.g. SWIFT)? And, why would they allow a no-account third party in? Perhaps Identitii are hoping SWIFT will buy them rather than build it themselves.”The source added: “The private blockchain is to ensure (like ASX) the integrity of the system. Private blockchains are designed for people who need to trust each other (like Banks) and want to maintain greater anonymity. But then how is that any different from a shared database?  I cannot help feeling ‘the Emperor has new clothes.’”Funding support was provided by the Australian Government under the Accelerating Commercialization element of the Entrepreneurs’ Program and specifically helped commercialize Identitii’s Serra platform. The program assists small and medium businesses to bring novel new products, processes and services to market and can offer up to $1 million in matched financial assistance for eligible activities.For an overview of Identitii’s platform and private blockchain offering see this video. The company will attending the annual SIBOS event that takes place this year at the International Convention Centre (ICC) Sydney between 22 and 25 October 2018. "

to new highs; and in Cannabis stock, which have been the new Bitcoin.","Oct 6, 2018,09:33am EDT",. Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg,"2018 has been a great year to be invested in stocks, especially in FANGs -- which have been driving US equities to new highs; and in Cannabis stock, which have been the new Bitcoin.But not a good year if you were invested in US Treasuries and gold, both of which have been heading south.What about 2019? What’s the best place to be?Experts have different tips as to where that place will be in the new investment universe of rising interest rates, trade wars and a growing political divide at home.Major Stock Averages YTDFor Zach Gray, the Chief Retirement Strategist and Founder of Wall Street Financial Group, the number one tip to investors is to scale back bond holdings. “As we close in on the end of 2018, my number one tip for 2019 is be aware of interest rate hikes &how they affect your portfolio,” says Gray.” Many retirees/pre-retirees approach retirement by becoming a bit more cautious with their investments.  Many times, this means increasing the bond holdings in one's portfolio.  With rate hikes affecting bond portfolios negatively (as rates go up, bond performance falls), please be aware of how this could adversely affect what many thought to be safe returns.  The feds are projecting three rate hikes in 2019, and that could very well ensure some loss to many bond portfolios.”TLT-US Treasury Bonds ETFBrian Decker, a financial planner and founder of Decker Retirement Planning Inc., agrees. “It’s not bonds since interest rates worldwide are starting to trend higher,”says Decker. And he doesn’t  like stocks either. “It is not stocks since market valuations have ONLY been higher in 1999 and earnings comps are going to be tough with the Trump tax breaks baked into to last year’s numbers.”But he likes commodities like gold and silver as a protection to equity gains.“I believe the people who thrive in 2019 will have 25% exposure to commodities like Gold and Silver…..for two reasons,” he adds. “First, the US Dollar should start to trend lower with the world economies slowing down which will be great for precious metals.  Second, commodities, as an asset class, are a hated group and extremely shorted right now.  These markets go up quickly and I believe there are large gains to be made in this group next year.”Gold and Silver PricesKathy Longo, the president and founder of Flourish Wealth Management®, believes that it is time for “portfolio rebalancing.”“Sitting at the end of a 10-year equity market recovery, this is the time where individuals should take risk off the table and balance market exposure. We recommend following the old adage of “selling high and buying low” by trimming position sizes in your winners (most likely US Equities, particularly in the Large Cap Growth space) to reinvest in International Equities, Emerging Markets, Small Cap Value, or Fixed Income. In addition, we think that individuals should have a plan for any cash needed from their portfolio for the next two years. We never know when a market correction might occur, so it helps to have a cash reserve ready to avoid being forced to sell stocks during a downturn to meet cash needs.""David Brooks Sr., an Investment Adviser Representative (IAR) and the founder-president of Retire SMART, thinks it’s time for investors to take a close look at their tax bill. “My number one tip for 2019 would be to understand how your assets or income will be taxed once you decide to take income in retirement or the government makes you take your required minimum distributions,” says Brooks.“Generally speaking, the markets have done well the last 10 years or so, therefore most folks have had healthy gains in their retirement portfolios. However, very few people have given much thought about how those gains will be taxed - much less made a plan to minimize those taxes. It's important to consider your non-quailfied, traditional, and ROTH dollars will all be taxed differently. Depending on how each of your accounts will be taxed, you may decide to pull from one account over another in a certain year.”Apparently, there’s no number one tip for everyone. There are number one tips for different investors, depending on their personal profile, an on their financial goals and constraints, all of which determine the suitability of different investments in matching them."

It was originally created a decade ago to support the cryptocurrency bitcoin, but has grown to be so much more. Blockchain has lead to the creation (and loss) of millions of fortunes, the launch of hundreds of new companies, billions of dollars in investor funding and, most commonly for the non-technical, a lot of confusion around its true benefits.In its most basic form, blockchain makes it possible for the first time ever for people and companies to make major transactions without going through an intermediary. Intermediaries like credit card service companies, stock exchanges, banks and governments can make transactions expensive, slow and illiquid and may open opportunities for fraud or crime. Access to deals, the amount of time it takes to close, property title mistakes, high fees and fraud bog down the real estate industry. It is the largest asset class in the world and has had minimal innovation in the way of increased efficiency during transactions. Blockchain poses major opportunities for innovation in real estate. Here are three innovations that will change how real estate is done for the better in 2019.TokenizationHistorically, owning the most lucrative hard assets required investors to already be wealthy and have the luxury of being able to wait years to liquidate. That changes with tokenization. Tokenization democratizes ownership of assets by using cryptocurrency to split assets into tokens that are stored on the blockchain. Someone who wants to invest in a trophy real estate project now has the luxury of being able to resell their share on the open market through secondary trading. Also, people in different geographies and tax brackets now have access to attractive investment opportunities that they previously would not. Landlords now have the ability to sell off just a portion of their property to the crowd. In 2019, I believe we will see a major migration of real estate ownership moving to the blockchain. One of the pioneers in the space is Templum Markets, the first federally regulated marketplace for the primary issuance and secondary trading of security tokens. It recently closed what is thought to be the first digital security tokenization of a trophy real estate asset: Investors had the opportunity to invest as little as $10,000 in the St. Regis Hotel in Aspen. Unlike with most major real estate investments, owners are not locked in until the building is sold. They will be able to sell their portion on the secondary market. Smart ContractsThe current state of property agreements have a lot of moving parts and middlemen. A transaction using a smart contract is completed entirely between the buyer and the seller (or renter and landlord) and has no human interaction. Transactions can be done in far less time with far less chance of fraud. The seller includes all of the details of the property and the buyer puts all of their necessary information on a 100% encrypted and secure block. Computer protocols check the legitimacy of the transaction and no agreement can be completed until all of the terms are met. Propy is one of the most well-known incumbents in the space. It has built technology for buyers, sellers, brokers, title agents and notaries to come together through a suite of smart contracts on blockchain to facilitate transactions.Real estate purchasing can be a very emotional decision for people. I believe that middlemen such as brokers and attorneys earn their commissions for people making potentially the largest financial decision of their lives. While smart contracts are currently being built to replace middlemen, I believe this technology will ultimately be utilized to make advisers in this space more efficient. Property TitleTitle insurance has grown to be a $15 billion revenue per year industry by ensuring buyers that their property is clear of old liens and debts. Every municipality has their own way of storing property data. Some cities and towns have put records online while others still use printed paper. If all property title was decentralized on the blockchain, an immense amount of time and money would be saved and, potentially, it could eliminate the need for title insurance altogether. It could also be possible to add information about construction, damages and improvements to the title, almost like Carfax for homes. This will help make it so that people truly know what they are buying. Unfortunately, while having all title on the blockchain would be great for property buyers, inputting this amount of data from every municipality is an extremely laborious and expensive undertaking. There are a few exciting technology companies in the space, like State Title and Jetclosing, but it is unclear if they are up for the task. It will be interesting to see whether governments, corporations or a combination of both cough up the dollars to enhance the data quality for where we live, work and play.The coming year will be an inflection point for blockchain usage in real estate. Private investment has been flowing in real estate technology, cryptocurrency wealth is massive, real estate professionals are being increasingly aware of blockchain and the underlying technology is improving. When it comes to the potential growth and adoption of blockchain technology, we are in the first inning. Similar to using the internet, blockchain usage may soon be so common that you forget you’re even using it."

Trust must be built among new market participants, countries leading innovation need to respond to legal concerns and actions should to be taken to pave the way for both accredited and non-accredited investors to step foot into the cryptocurrency market.  As a result, lawyers specializing in cryptocurrency related matters have become key players for ensuring the success of the global adoption of digital assets. Three women lawyers in particular are taking action to help define legal uncertainties currently facing the evolving crypto ecosystem.Establishing Trust Among Market Participants: Sydney SchaubFirst and foremost, trust is required as new market participants enter the crypto market. The licensed digital asset exchange and custodian founded by the Winklevoss brothers, Gemini Trust Company, LLC (Gemini), recently announced that Sydney Schaub has joined as General Counsel. Ms. Schaub will focus on tackling new jurisdiction expansion, product initiatives and building Gemini's in-house legal team, reporting directly to Gemini’s President, Cameron Winklevoss.At this important moment for the global adoption of digital assets, establishing trust among market participants will be critical for success. Gemini’s leading market surveillance technology and digital asset insurance, coupled with its thoughtful approach to growth and regulation, are essential for creating this trust. I am looking forward to working with my new colleagues at Gemini to build the future of money, Schaub told me.Gemini Trust Company, LLC (Gemini) announced that Sydney Schaub has joined as General Counsel.Schaub joins at a time of incredible growth for Gemini, which recently received approval for the Gemini Dollar, the world’s first licensed and regulated stablecoin. Gemini also recently became the first licensed exchange in the world to offer ZCash upon obtaining approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).Ms. Schaub brings tremendous experience working with industry-disrupting, high-growth start-ups to her role as General Counsel for Gemini, said Tyler Winklevoss, Chief Executive Officer of Gemini. Sydney’s reputation as a trusted advisor to business, product and engineering teams precedes her, and that, along with her proven ability of successfully navigating complex deals and strategic partnerships, will prove invaluable to Gemini as our organization continues to expand.Bringing More Investors To The Crypto Market: Joshua Ashley KlaymanAccording to Joshua Ashley Klayman, Founder and Managing Member of Klayman LLC, a boutique blockchain-focused law firm based in New York City, certain steps should be taken from a legal standpoint to get more investors involved in the crypto market. While a key focus has been on bringing institutional investors in, Klayman believes that an increasing number of investors from around the world will soon enter the crypto market.As regulators, the media and the general public become more familiar with digital tokens, my view is that increasing numbers of investors from around the world will enter the crypto market. A few steps that could be taken to promote the involvement of additional investors in the crypto market may include enhanced disclosure in connection with token sales, including use of proceeds, lock-ups, percentage of tokens held by founders, discounts, etc, Klayman told me.Joshua Ashley Klayman, Founder and Managing Member of Klayman LLCAdditionally, Klayman mentioned that clarity concerning how the existing securities laws apply to digital tokens is needed.We now know that the SEC’s view is that present day sales of Ether are not deemed to be sales of securities, due, among other things, to sufficient decentralization. But, we do not yet know at what point sufficient decentralization is achieved or how, as a practical matter, a token seller would be able to remove itself from reporting and other securities law requirements when its tokens originally were sold as securities. We also need greater clarity, in the form of no-action letters and other guidance, regarding legally permissible approaches where compliance requirements may be less clear.Navigating Malta’s Cryptocurrency Ecosystem: Veronique DalliFinally, countries innovating in the cryptocurrency space also need lawyers to help navigate the evolving ecosystem. Malta in particular has become one of the most innovative countries for cryptocurrency and blockchain related projects. Yet while Malta’s recently passed cryptocurrency, blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) laws have created a sense of legal certainty, grey areas still remain.Veronique Dalli is a cryptocurrency lawyer based in Malta. Dalli started studying crypto law at the end of 2015, when her law firm, Dalli Advocates, began to receive inquires about cryptocurrency and blockchain applications. According to Dalli, the questions she typically receives deals with licensing requirements in Malta.Veronique Dalli, a cryptocurrency lawyer based in Malta and Founder of Dalli AdvocatesIt is required to bring all crypto projects to jurisdiction in Malta. It must be understood that the Maltese Government is a sound legal system that doesn’t come up with any surprises once an initial coin offering (ICO) is launched. It has been made very clear in Malta as to what jurisdictions will be at the receiving end of the token generating events issued here. For example, there are jurisdictions where by residents are not allowed to participate in crowd funding. As for investors, I would say that one needs to be careful in the sense of looking at the way ICOs are being advertised - if it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is. When someone comes to Malta to launch an ICO, we look at the white paper very carefully. We see what is proposed in the white paper and then determine if that is being seen in their ICO, Dalli told me.Other Legal Questions To Consider: Utility Vs. Security TokensSecurity tokens are another area crypto lawyers are finding of interest. In a recent article, it is stated that 2017 was the year of the utility token and that 2018 was the year of realizing the mistake of the utility token. As a result,  2019 will be the year for tokenized securities and the rise of Security Token offerings (STOs).Yet according to Klayman, there are still many grey areas to consider when it comes to security tokens.Even if you launch a token sale to U.S. persons and presume that such token sale is a sale of securities, unanswered questions remain.  This is because applying the existing U.S. federal securities laws to digital tokens is an imperfect fit. Among other things, security token sales raise important issues relating to flowback of tokens into the United States from regulated and unregulated exchanges worldwide – even if initially tokens were sold only to non-U.S. persons; requirements to file periodic reports with the SEC under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”); risks of inadvertently becoming an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “40 Act”); and compliance with transfer agent and broker-dealer registration requirements.While security tokens seem to be a growing trend in the U.S., countries like Mata, where regulations are in place, are still seeing a great deal of ICOs. However, according to Dalli, there are still legal uncertainties.“The concept of utility tokens is still in its initial stages. There could be situations, which are left without a solution. I think it is easier to regulate security tokens than utility tokens. If the asset is introduced as an access to a company’s product, financial authorities are unlikely to investigate it,” Dalli said."

cryptocurrency market in general? Woodrow: There is a good quote by the ...","Sep 17, 2018,04:59pm EDT","CEO and Founder of MovieCoin, Christopher Woodrow","The benefits promised by blockchain technology are starting to make their way to Hollywood.Christopher Woodrow, American financier and CEO and Founder of MovieCoin, a financial technology company that leverages  digital assets within the film and entertainment industry, has announced interest to bring blockchain technology to Hollywood.Since the launch of MovieCoin, we’ve had tremendous interest from people all over the world. In particular, we’ve discovered that blockchain technology can have a big impact on entertainment financing. To invest in Hollywood, one previously had to show up with a check for $50 million dollars for anyone to take them seriously. Utilizing blockchain can open up an entirely new asset class to accredited investors, Woodrow told me.Woodrow, who is no stranger to Hollywood, has financed and produced a number of notable feature films including box office hits, Black Mass and Hacksaw Ridge, as well as the critically acclaimed hit Birdman. Woodrow’s films have grossed in excess of $700 million worldwide and have been nominated for 16 Academy Awards, winning six Oscars, including Best Picture.I had the opportunity to speak with Woodrow about how tokenizing industry assets will benefit Hollywood.Rachel Wolfson: How will tokenizing assets impact Hollywood?Christopher Woodrow: The tokenization of assets will have a big impact on Hollywood in terms of investing in films, a sector that has been incredibly illiquid. For instance, those investing in a movie are traditionally locked up for several years. Those investing in several movies could even be locked up for a decade.The MovieCoin MSF security token, for example, will be freely traded on security token exchanges after a one-year and will allow accredited investors to buy and sell tokens that represent ownership of the underlying portfolio of movies. This is a real significant change in Hollywood, as a tremendous amount of liquidity is being brought to a previously illiquid asset class.Moreover, aside from blockchain technology providing greater transparency and trust to investors, the MFS token is being offered to accredited investors all over the world. High net worth individuals everywhere can now participate in the financing of major Hollywood movies. Hollywood is still very much a closed club. Unless you know someone, you can’t just go and finance a movie. But now for a relatively small amount of money, investors all over the world can participate in the financing of real movies.Wolfson: Do you believe that security tokens are the future of the cryptocurrency market?Woodrow: Without question, security tokens are the future. I think it could be 20 times the size of the current cryptocurrency market, and security tokens will be groundbreaking in many ways. However, with respect to Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrency in general, I don’t think this is something that is dying. ICOs were hyped last years and are now cooling off a bit, but this is becoming more regulated, which is good for everybody involved.Wolfson: How exactly is blockchain technology benefiting Hollywood?Woodrow: In terms of blockchain, one of the key things to consider is access. To previously invest in Hollywood films, someone had to show up with a check for $50 million dollars to be taken seriously. Utilizing blockchain technology can open up an entirely new class to accredited investors who previously couldn’t do this.Also, liquidity is a significant breakthrough. We are talking about a market with above average returns, but historically has had very little liquidity. Now, suddenly you have liquidity. In my mind, we will see more money coming to this asset class.Finally, transparency is a key driver of blockchain and something that the entertainment industry has lacked for years. Hollywood has been one of the few places where not a lot of new technology has been implemented in the last 30 years. Adding a level of trust and transparency will bring more capital to this asset class.Wolfson: What are your thoughts on the future of Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market in general?Woodrow: There is a good quote by the American journalist, Charles Dow, that someone told me in 2001 during the NASDAQ selloff. The quote turned out to be very accurate and I think it's timely considering where we are with the crypto market. “There is always a disposition in people’s minds to think the existing conditions will be permanent,” Dow wrote, and went on to say: “When the market is down and dull, it is hard to make people believe that this is the prelude to a period of activity and advance. When the prices are up and the country is prosperous, it is always said that while preceding booms have not lasted, there are circumstances connected with this one, which make it unlike its predecessors and give assurance of permanency. The fact pertaining to all conditions is that they will change.”  – Charles Dow, 1900"

blockchain, with over 500,000 videos, 10,000 contributing YouTubers, and ...","Oct 25, 2018,08:15am EDT",Democratizing Our Media,"So much of our outlook on society is shaped by the content we read, the videos we watch and the music we listen to, yet wherever we look, there is information bias. When it comes to the media industry, large behemoths acting as centralized intermediaries are the gatekeepers between the content of publishers and the end consumers. Written works are easily distributed if approved by these intermediaries, but creators are poorly compensated by the current ad revenue based model. Video demands much more infrastructure to create and to distribute, but industry leaders, such as YouTube, give us less of what we want and more of what we tolerate in the form of unstoppable commercials.When it comes to the entertainment industries, I’ve written in the past on how the blockchain is changing the music and social media industries, but with the emergence of cryptocurrency-powered decentralized applications, we are now seeing entrants who are taking on other sectors of media. What happens when publishers are in more control of their content? When the publisher and the consumer are able to connect directly with one another, without industry intermediaries with dated business models getting under foot? When systems are more transparent and open and it is up to the users themselves to decided what content is acceptable and which content should be hidden? I sat down with Everipedia, a decentralized wiki, and LBRY, a decentralized YouTube competitor, to learn more about how blockchain can democratize our online media experience.Everipedia: A Decentralized WikipediaEveripediaAccording to Everipedia founders, Everipedia is the largest application built on top of the EOS network, a new competitor to the Ethereum smart contract optimized blockchain protocol, that raised over $4 billion in an ICO. With a cryptocurrency of a market capitalization close to $50 million and four million page views a month, Everipedia expects to become the largest encyclopedia in the world. Co-founder Sam Kazemian explains why a decentralized solution is needed:The three major improvements over the state of encyclopedias today are transparency, self-sustainability and contribution incentivization. Imagine if Wikipedia’s database, a mysql in the backend, were actually open and anyone could just pull the articles and the data, instead of just linking to Wikipedia itself. This is what we are doing with Everipedia. Any website can interact with these articles, they just need the Everipedia IQ cryptocurrency to edit or submit new articles.When submitting content and edits, everything is done on the open network. Instead of a single entity deciding what gets added and edited behind the scenes, the holders of IQ get to vote on these contributors. This means more transparency and more accountability.The typical model we see regarding online media today are one of two models, an ad based model like Facebook or a donation based model like Wikipedia.Having an entire application run on cryptocurrency increases the value of the tokens as more users participate, which permits funding development, infrastructure, security and content contribution. This creates a new model for self-sustainability.Unlike Wikipedia, where contributors are just volunteers who don’t get paid, content contributors on Everipedia are paid through the creation of new IQ tokens. When a content contributor produces good work that is accepted into the encyclopedia, they get paid a portion of the new IQ created every 30 minutes. The inverse is also true, in that poor quality or bad-faith content are penalized.How does it work?First a user who wants to create content or vote on content must stake IQ tokens for at least twenty one days.  A token at stake is not spent, but rather locked to contribute to the system and can be recovered after a user no on longer wants to create or vote on content. After the tokens have been staked, a content creator can propose one new edit for 10 IQ staked. This limits DDOS, spamming and over trolling on the system, making it much more expensive to attack the network compared to creating fake accounts on Wikipedia. If the content is accepted, the content creator receives part of the 100 IQ generated every thirty minutes, although the amount of IQ generated will eventually change to a planned 5% inflation per year on top of the current 10 billion supply of IQ tokens.For the content voters, their voting power is relative to the number of IQ tokens they have staked. Content voters also receive a part of the generated IQ in proportion to their coins at stake. Any new content or edits can be voted on for up to twenty four hours. Content is accepted so long as it does not have a majority of no votes. However, content with more yes votes provide a higher percentage of generated IQ to the contributor. Today, there are 80 million tokens staked, worth close to $800,000 USD based on current prices.By having a decentralized encyclopedia, Everipedia has created a self-sustainable system that properly incentivizes the exponential growth of data accumulation and prevents unfair, biased, and opaque censorship of data propagation.LBRY: A Decentralized YoutubeLBRY User InterfaceLBRY is a protocol that provides discovery, distribution and purchase of digital content without the dependency on a centralized entity. The application runs on its own blockchain, a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain, with over 500,000 videos, 10,000 contributing YouTubers, and 150,000 application downloads. The market capitalization of the coin that makes it all work is just under $10 million. I met with Jeremy Kauffman, CEO of LBRY, to learn more about the problems a decentralized Youtube sets out to solve:When it comes to centralized systems like Netflix or Youtube, there is potential to mistreat customers. Publishers selling digital goods on platforms like Steam, Apple or Amazon often have to pay 30-40% and are at the mercy of these platforms whenever they change the rules. Consumers benefit from diverse content, instead of what YouTube's algorithm is pushing. A blockchain-based platform with native cryptocurrency allows for direct publisher to consumer interactions, reducing the costs significantly, while creating an open environment. The frictionless payment capabilities of cryptocurrencies also allow for micropayments that allow users to opt out of ads for a penny or even a fracture of a penny.BitTorrent already exists for decentralized digital content distribution, but it has 3 major problems. 1) Lack of Discovery, 2) Lack of incentive to participate 3) Infringement.BitTorrent requires users to go to various somewhat obscure websites throughout the web to find torrent files to download specific content. We solve discovery by attaching meta data of the content to the LBRY blockchain and offering a browser that can scan the blockchain and stream the content. This meta data includes things like title, description, cover image, type of content, movie file, type of movie file and so on. The end consumer can download the LBRY browser on desktop or Android and use the URL bar as a search engine or go directly to content with human readable URLs. There are also developer tools that parse out the data on the blockchain, keeps the data up to date, gives structured access to the data and allows queries in SQL.BitTorrent's only incentive to host or seed is access to content. LBRY provides a marketplace for disk space and bandwidth. The LBRY content sharing protocol uses a Kademlia DHT, which is the same infrastructure used through BitTorrent, except that users seeding the content get paid for it.As for copyright infringement, there are layers of reasons why it won't be a problem on LBRY, despite the use of the BitTorrent protocol. The records on the LBRY blockchain are there for all to see, so infringement investigations are simple, and much more likely to yield charges, since there is both a profit motive and proof of transaction. BitTorrent magnet files in the wild are unstoppable by design, but LBRY users notified of infringing content can simply remove it.  No large scale infringement would occur, since settlement providers wouldn't participate. LBRY is simply not an economical platform for anyone who doesn't legitimately own the content they wish to distribute.Both Everipedia and LBRY provide a revenue model that involves content consumers and producers, with LBRY taking it a step further by rewarding those who also contribute storage and network services, but that isn't the end of things. Seeing the “demonetization” backlash that YouTube faced as they tried to balance advertiser demands with creators' freedom of expression, they created the LBRY Community Fund, a pool of pre-mined coins that are available within a week to projects that complete a grant application. Blockchain based media plays like these are censorship resistant, but their internal methods ensure they will not devolve into the same sort of litigation and law enforcement melee that surrounds BitTorrent. Niche players from YouTube, currently subject to the whims of Google's ad related revenue model, can develop clean, direct connections with their audiences. A Wiki that rewards positive contributions and economically punishes negative behavior would spend more time producing and less time refereeing conflicts.The power of media transparency and censorship resistance is the ability to watch content that would otherwise be deemed inappropriate by a centralized entity. This requires trust in a benevolent dictator or the suffering under the tyranny of a malevolent one. In places with strong freedom of speech, such as the US or the EU, this means being able to watch socially unsavory content. However, in places with strong censorship, such as China or North Korea, this means access to globally accessible content."

Buyers of CDs and DVDs could sell the albums they no longer wanted or movies they had seen in secondary marketplaces such as eBay and Amazon or locally on Craigslist. Today, software is widely sold as a service (SaaS) and media is rented or licensed to users in a purely digital form. As this digital content is easily copied, distributors can embed software into media to limit and monitor its usage.Digital rights management (DRM) solutions restrict buyers to use the media inside of the environments provided by the seller – as is the case with Amazon’s media platform and Apple’s iTunes. The latter will further extend the permissions to as many as five devices. But like all DRM implementations, Apple and others do not enable buyers to resell their digital purchases. Such a resell function seemed technologically out of reach before a small team of developers introduced cartoon kittens virtually born on the public Ethereum blockchain in December 2017. (Full disclosure: my firm supports the open-source Ethereum blockchain community.)Digital CollectiblesCryptoKitties made mainstream headlines, including one New York Times article (paywall), when some of the game’s digital collectibles were bought for over $100,000. According to Crunchbase, several prominent venture firms consequently invested a combined $12 million into the company that created these images of colorful felines. Around the same time, CNN reported that a group of 10 digital art collectors spent $1 million for the rights to the digital photo of a rose. This willingness of buyers to pay high prices for what are essentially easily reproducible digital images has observers scratching their heads in amazement, if not disbelief. So, why do people treasure some virtual items while assigning little to no value to others, and can virtual items truly be owned?What makes CrypoKitties and other virtual items collectible is a new blockchain-based function which assigns a single unique address on the public Ethereum blockchain to the item. Like most blockchains, Ethereum makes use of public-key cryptography. As a result, all collectibles recorded on this blockchain are visible on the world wide web through a block explorer such as Etherscan. However, the ability to move the ownership of the entry (public key) to a new address is limited to the owner of the matching private key. A growing number of apps, such as the one offered by Coinbase Wallet or Enjin Wallet (my company works with Enjin), support the transfer of these items directly from one user to another without the need to interact with another platform or middleman.Digital BirthA new generation-zero CryptoKitty is created every 15 minutes, according to TechCrunch. This “birth process” is algorithmically scripted inside of the game developers' smart contract system, and its result -- the new and unique -- is consequently recorded onto the public blockchain. The latter entry is presumed immutable, which means it cannot be altered without impacting the complete transaction history of all the blockchain’s transactions. It could be said the entry is the ""birth certificate"" of the digital art.As of today, the phenotype and genotype information that determine the outcome of a new breed of virtual cats are solely maintained by the game developer, but future standards may allow these trades to be recorded directly on public blockchains. Standards on public blockchains are achieved through a public proposal process and ultimately decided upon by a combination of developers and network participants. Prior to adding the non-fungible token standard that allowed the creation of the aforementioned cryptographic cat game, a general token standard had enabled the creation of thousands of new tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The latter function -- the ERC20 Token Standard -- is, in my experience, largely accountable for the rise of initial coin offerings.Evolution Of StandardsBuilding on the success of the non-fungible token standard introduced by CryptoKitties, newer proposals -- such as EIP 1155, which my company's now-partner Enjin's CTO co-authored -- can allow for the creation of specific quantities of blockchain-recorded items. While the items within a given batch are interchangeable, each is recorded individually to the public blockchain, creating ""limited editions"" of these particular assets that are individually transferable. I predict that the standard could allow artists to sell their creations to more than one collector; and, when applied to the real world, it could attest for the provenance of a production good. Fine wine and other collectibles could enter the marketplace at the time of inception and be bought and sold before entering a supply chain, which could potentially reduce distribution costs and fees from middlemen.Transfer Between WorldsAside from software, movies and music, the business model of the computer game industry in particular is largely anchored in the distribution of digital products. According to a 2018 market report published by Clairfield International, the global video game market reached revenues of $78.6 billion in 2017. The report further postulates that in the future, “basically all the revenue will be generated through users’ in-game purchases.”I believe that advanced blockchain standards will empower game developers to create truly unique and limited in-game items that users will be able to trade outside of the confines of the game directly with other players or collectors using blockchain wallets. Moreover, the standards could allow users to transfer in-game items from one game to another.ConclusionsThe internet introduced new protocols for audio and video formatting that disrupted legacy media distribution technologies while simultaneously impacting ownership models that relied on physical products. Early blockchain protocols -- such as Bitcoin -- enabled the creation of digital bearer instruments, which allow ownership rights to be reliably transferred from one person to another without the sender keeping a copy of the virtual asset. (The European Central Bank touched on this concept in a 2017 paper.) While these digital products are generally fungible -- one bitcoin can be replaced by any other without impacting its value or function -- newer blockchain-based standards can allow for the creation of non-fungible virtual items. While digitally native products --such as software -- seem to be the obvious first use case for this new paradigm, I believe creators and producers are likely to take advantage of the blockchain-based ownership modules to circumvent proprietary platforms, which charge a toll for their rights-management functions."

It is not too difficult to see why the Irish feel this way as the UK accounts for 16% of Irish exports and 39% of their imports. Any fetter to the freedom of trade would prove difficult for both sides.Given the benefits both Ireland and the UK derive from the open border one wonders why it has become such a stumbling point in the extremely drawn out negotiations?The EU and UK  were on the same page as the first phase of Brexit negotiations were concluded in December 2017. Their common view was that if  a settlement could not be agreed then there would be a system of regulatory alignment between both Ireland and Northern Ireland.That plan was torpedoed below the water-line by the Democratic Unionist Party, (DUP), of Northern Ireland claiming they had not been consulted. Given their 10 Westminster MP’s provide the minority Conservative government of Theresa May with the votes to get key legislation through parliament they have a strong say over any policy that affects the island of Ireland.There was a need for fast and fancy footwork from Mrs May and to alleviate the DUP concerns that post-Brexit there would be no different treatment of Northern Ireland she assured them that she would never agree to a regulatory border running across Ireland or indeed set in the Irish Sea.So far, this has proven to be a stumbling block for the Brexit talks as the UK is not looking to agree a deal whereby it stays in either the official singe market or a customs union. Nor, as the Prime Minister has stated will she oversee a divide in the UK.There may, however, be a solution at hand if the EU and UK are willing to put faith in “Blockchain” technology.A watchful eye shields encrypted code Source: GettyOne of the main areas where blockchain has gained traction of late is in “Trade Finance”. Several trial schemes are announced each week as banks and exporters/importers delve deeper into how the opportunities of blockchain technology in trade finance and supply chain management can be exploited.What has emerged is that taking a limited view of the opportunities in a series of isolated or “stand-alone” scenarios is selling the process short. Wider reaching success and profitable opportunities could well emerge from a network approach to cover all stages i.e. parties in a trade or value chain. This would allow multiple transactions to be completed as subsets of the same chain as against having several discrete operations.This could well prove to be the technological solution to the Irish border problem post-Brexit and the driving force behind this possibility is the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond.Just last week at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham when he was asked a question about the Irish border and its impact on the UK economy he suggested""…There is technology becoming available, … I don't claim to be an expert on it but the most obvious technology is blockchain. …""It is too easy, even lazy to argue that given the only large-scale engagement of blockchain has been to underpin Bitcoin. There are an increasing number of companies that are finding ways to incorporate the blockchain into their businesses as a means of ensuring quality and quantity. Therefore, it is not unrealistic to suggest the immutable security of data stored in the blockchain is the best  solution to address the border control problems.The stored data is increasingly difficult to tamper with. As a result, would be thieves of goods or system hackers are giving up. Remember, amid all the scare stories over Bitcoin hacks, it was the exchanges that were the weak link, not the blockchain.If the sceptics within the EU and UK need reassurance they should look at the example being set by Maersk and IBM who have set up a joint venture that seeks to transform global shipping. By making use of blockchain technology they are laying the foundations of a maritime trade model that will be running securely within six-months.Maersk established it own pilot trial in conjunction with DowDuPont Inc whereby the technology has been adopted at the ports in Houston and Rotterdam. Adding legitimacy to the deal is the fact that the Custom Agencies in both the Netherlands and US have also come aboard. The IBM connection is found  in the programmes they have pursued with Nestle SA, Unilever NV and Walmart INC.The development has been seen to make the tracking of goods far more effective and efficient and is highly encouraging for eCommerce opportunities on a global basis.Critics may well claim that the time, cost and sheer scale of  building and implementing a customs system based on blockchain would be long and expensive. They will also point to the shifting sands of EU and UK politics in that what may be agreed to in 2019 could be undermined by a series of political changes in the EU and UK over the next five-years.That is so short-sighted as this technology can offer a smooth solution to the issue of identifying products that would come into the EU via the UK to ensure compliance with EU regulatory standards.It must be remembered that the EU, taken as a whole is the UK’s largest trading partner. In 2017, UK imports from the EU were £341 Billion or $447 Billion (53% of all UK imports). UK exports to the EU were £274 billion or $359 Billion (44% of all UK exports).  These are large sums of money by any measure. Before EU/UK luddites shoot blockchain down they should seriously think about the economic damage that failing to agree a deal because of the Irish border will cause for both sides.Even if, in the best possible outcome, the EU and the UK were able to sign a free trade agreement, they would rightly want to have protective customs controls to establish if a product crossing the Irish border is from the neighboring country or from a third-party nation that was seeking to circumvent tariffs.Blockchain can be the economic watchman on the tower, it can break this stumbling block.Stephen Pope ~ MarketMind"

To date, both technologies have been the provence of early adopters and speculators, but they are about to move from the perimeter of our financial lives to permanent fixtures on Main Street.Why now?Because cryptocurrency and blockchain make it cost-effective to securitize common assets – to turn anything of real value into a marketable security by creating a digital unit of ownership known as a security token.Instead of owning a Rembrandt outright, for example, tokenization means the owner could offer digital shares of ownership in a masterwork painting. The fractional owners would benefit from buying or selling their digital shares to take advantage of rising or falling prices. As a digital security, it can be quickly and easily traded online. Think price transparency every day, instead of a Christie’s auction every blue moon.We believe the tokenization of everything will bring to common assets the benefits Wall Street long ago engineered for other asset types, such as Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities (CMBS), syndicated loans, student loans, auto loans, and countless other assets.Tokenization of traditional assets can provide a wide range of benefits, including greater liquidity to asset owners, 24/7 markets, lower transactions costs, fractional ownership, automated and quicker settlement, improved compliance checks, and a broader slate of possibilities with smart security contracts. And, in turn, realization of such benefits would pave the way for security tokens to have a banner year in 2019.As we gaze into our crystal ball for 2019, we look at seven types of assets that are likely to be tokenized. This process won’t happen overnight, but it will begin in earnest in 2019. As this trend gathers momentum, we believe it’s likely to change Main Street investing as we know it today.1. Venture capital funds: This asset class has beennotoriously illiquid. Investors typically have long investment horizons and must typically wait 5 to 10 years before earning a return. Projects like Blockchain Capital (BCAP), EQUI, and Spice VC, want to lower the barrier to entry for investors and provide them opportunities to purchase pieces of investment portfolios and sell them faster.Our Take: The increased liquidity would allow more people to participate in the asset class. Venture capitalists would enjoy access to larger pools of investors.2. Precious metals: Blockchain startups such as CEDEX want to see if individual investors can securely and easily trade gold, silver, and diamonds. Sellers could list their diamonds on the CEDEX platform and subsequently deliver them to a custodian, who would release them to the buyer once the transaction is complete.For investors, the CEDEX platform provides something that has long eluded the diamond industry – transparency. Such a consolidated repository would help investors to properly determine their value and set prices.Our Take: The tokenizing of precious metals creates the possibility of fractional ownership along with greater transparency in an asset class that has been opaque, illiquid, and prohibitively expensive to own.  3. Real estate: Several Blockchain startups, most notably Alt.Estate, Atlant, Blocksquare, and Deedcoin, have been working on ways to tokenize commercial and residential real estate. In October, a luxury Manhattan condo development offered tokenized shares on the Ethereum Blockchain worth $30 million. Users can buy fractions of properties, earn income on those properties, then, as with traditional real estate investments, sell their fractions at higher prices depending on the appreciated values of the underlying property. The platform reduces entry and transactions costs, easier access to investment opportunities around the world, and a means to diversify investment portfolios. Real estate owners will find increased liquidity from fiat and cryptocurrency investors.Our Take: Tokenization of real estate assets provides liquidity to owners of traditional illiquid assets with fairly long capital lock-ins.4. Rare art and luxury cars: Wealthy individuals have exclusively owned these assets. But Blockchain projects hope to change that. The Maecenas project, for example, wants to “democratize access to fine art by creating a decentralized art gallery.” Such a platform would provide investors exposure to art without the cost of physically preserving the piece. More importantly, the technology could allow buyers and sellers to directly transact without the need for traditional auction houses like Christie’s and Sotheby’s, which control a combined 80 percent of secondary market value.BitCar aims to enable fractional ownership for both car enthusiasts and investors looking to diversify their portfolios. Users can buy and trade pieces of ownership in exotic cars without an intermediary like dealers. Verified agents source, acquire, store, and display these vehicles. After holding periods of 5 to 15 years, the vehicles are sold and proceeds distributed to token holders.Our Take: These and related applications increase access to an asset category which was traditionally limited to a smaller group of investors.5. Commodities: Binkabi wants to reduce geopolitical inefficiencies which adds costs to the supply chain and lowers prices paid to commodity producers. The current system to trade commodities suffers from a number of problems, which adds cost: a lack of trust that requires middlemen who often charge high fees; requirement of USD/EUR settlement in emerging markets; paper-based record-keeping in emerging markets, which increases the chances of errors and fraud; and the lack of affordable access to supply chain financing for commodity producers. Binkabi’s proposed solution consists of Barter Block, which will facilitate the development and use of Binkabi’s end-to-end cross-border commodity trading platform. Second, tokenization of commodities will enable commodity hedging and financing.Our Take: While most other applications want to provide benefits to investors and owners, Blockchain-based tokenization of commodities would benefit participants at almost every level of the supply chain.6. Sports teams, athletes, and celebrities: Globatalent wants to create a decentralized marketplace where investors and fans can invest in clubs and players and trade benefits guaranteed by image rights, player transfers, price money, salaries, ticketing, TV contracts, or any other income. For example, fans and investors alike could invest in young players, provide financial support to continue their careers in exchange for some future return. Clubs could similarly sell rights to future profits so they can raise the capital needed to sign players and thus boost the team’s value.Our Take: Fractional ownership and purchase of future benefits aligns incentives of asset operators with owners.7. Flat currencies: Stablecoins, whose prices are tied to traditional currencies, are designed to offset the volatility of traditional crypto assets like Bitcoin. The first such coin was the BitShares-created BitUSD, a cryptocurrency pegged to the value of a U.S. dollar. The market has since witnessed the launch of Tether, TrueUSD, and Dai, worth a combined $3 billion. Other companies have developed their own stablecoins including “USD Coin,” backed by Circle and Coinbase and governed by the CENTRE network.Beyond stablecoins, other projects have taken novel approaches to curbing volatility. Basis (formerly Basecoin) is attempting to build a cryptocurrency with an algorithmic central bank. By controlling the number of coins in circulation (as any government does with a money supply), Basis hopes to stabilize currency value.Our Take: We expect the adoption of Stablecoins to rise over the next 12 months. Such assets can provide a roadmap for other tokens to reduce transaction costs and processing time and check volatility."

offers few real-world use cases aside from cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.","Oct 8, 2018,07:30am EDT",Getty,"Blockchain technology is no longer just a “solution in search of a problem.” After 18 months of testing, IBM's blockchain-based food traceability platform is now live for global use by retailers, wholesalers and suppliers across the food ecosystem. The launch marks one of the first times that an enterprise blockchain network has been fully deployed at this degree of scale. The IBM Food Trust platform, as it is known, has heretofore been demoed exclusively in pilots and proofs of concept - to trace mangoes throughout a supply chain, for example. In September, retail giant Walmart announced that it would begin requiring its suppliers to implement the system to track bags of spinach and heads of lettuce.But on Monday, IBM announced that its solution-as-a-service cloud platform is now available to all players in the food supply chain, a move that will likely drive unprecedented visibility and veracity into the sourcing and certification of fresh produce and proteins. Included in the first cohort of adopters are Carrefour - the French retailer which boasts 12,000 stores across 33 countries, cooperatives Topco Associates and Wakefern - which combine to represent more than 15,000 stores globally - and suppliers BeefChain, Smithfield and Dennick Fruit Source.Other participants include multinational companies Nestle, Kroger, Tyson Foods, Kroger and Unilever.The rollout should help put to rest the criticism that, in spite of all the hype it has garnered over the last two years, blockchain technology offers few real-world use cases aside from cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Also, the de-siloing and collaborative approach required by companies participating in the platform will provide a glimpse into the distributed and network-based business models of the future.“The currency of trust today is transparency and achieving it in the area of food safety happens when responsibility is shared,” explained Bridget van Kralingen, senior vice president for IBM Global Industries, Platforms and Blockchain, adding:“That collaborative approach is how the members of IBM Food Trust have shown blockchain can strengthen transparency and drive meaningful enhancements to food traceability. Ultimately, that provides business benefits for participants and a better and safer product for consumers.” Value AlignmentWhat makes the solution such a remarkable breakthrough, explained Brigid McDermott - vice president of IBM Food Trust, is that it successfully overcomes five critical barriers to enterprise blockchain implementation. These include building an ecosystem, creating a business model that adds value for all parties, implementing a governance structure for securing data and access rights, ensuring interoperability and standardization so as to integrate with other platforms and building the system on top of battle-tested enterprise technology. Addressing all of these areas was critical to ensuring that all players in the ecosystem - whether they be a grower, wholesaler or retailer - earn a return on their investment for participating, though the value realized by certain parties may be larger and generated more quickly than with others.“At the end of the day, you can’t force people to do something that’s not in their own best interest. There has to be a fundamental ROI to join,” McDermott told Forbes. ""From the beginning, we’ve had that driver of ‘What is the ROI for each of the different segments.’” The value generated can take both monetary and non-monetary forms. For example, participation in the consortium will serve as a foundational pillar of Carrefour's Act for Food corporate responsibility program, explained Laurent Vallée the retailer's general secretary, adding that:“Being a founding member of the IBM Food Trust platform is a great opportunity for Carrefour to strongly accelerate and widen the integration of blockchain technology to our products in order to provide our clients with safe and undoubted traceability.""Solution to Recall WoesPerhaps most importantly, the traceability delivered by IBM Food Trust figures to generate sector-wide efficiency gains through the ability to specifically identify and locate product that may be subject to a recall, a process that is extremely expensive, wasteful and challenging - if not altogether impossible - under current processes. Last week, 6.5M pounds of beef were recalled in the United States over salmonella fears in what was reportedly the largest recall order ever issued. The ability to trace and identify the location where a parcel of beef was produced and target the recall toward those items that are specifically impacted will enormously reduce food waste and improve consumer welfare and confidence. “We use the term ‘supply chain,’ but we all know it’s not really a chain. There’s nothing linear about the way food is provided to any of us - it’s a web of interconnected companies, retailers, suppliers,” explained McDermott, adding:“What this should mean for consumers is that recalls stop being scare tactics, which is what they’ve been in the past and what they’ve had to be.”Who Can Use?Another important aspect of the Food Trust ecosystem is that it is designed to incorporate not just retailers and suppliers but other third parties, such as technology suppliers, that touch the food supply.Built on top of Hyperledger Fabric, the network is designed to be compatible with GS1 - a standards framework used by much of the food industry - to ensure maximum interoperability in its traceability systems.""While IBM is a big company that has tremendous technologies, we aren’t going to do everything. Other players out there doing outstanding work,"" said McDermott.As an example, Dole is working via the platform with a grower-owned partner called Centricity to connect audit data to the blockchain.""By simplifying on-farm and front-office reporting and putting data on the blockchain, IBM Food Trust has helped Dole unlock the value of compliance data across our suppliers and partners in a cost-effective way,"" said Natalie Dyenson, Dole's vice president for food safety and quality.Other involved third parties include 3M, which is enabling food safety diagnostic equipment to communicate with the blockchain, and Emerson - which is incorporating its cold chain technology to provide and track temperature information throughout the food transport process.The Food Trust platform is comprised of three modules. The tracing module facilitates the tracking of food products throughout the ecosystem and across borders, the certification module verifies the provenance of products that have been digitally certified as organic or fair trade, and the data entry and access module gives growers and supply chain intermediaries the ability to upload, manage and access their data within the system.Pricing for the trace and certification modules starts at $100 per month and is tiered differently for small, medium and large businesses. The data entry and access module is available for use without charge.Put it all together, McDermott argued, the transformative impact on the food industry and on society will not be insignificant:""I’m not a food safety expert, I’m an ex-McKinsey consultant, but I don’t think I’ve seen anything that's as powerful of a tool as blockchain."""

The ripple price surged to more than $3 last year, up from just $0.006 it began the year at.Ripple is now trading at a little over $0.55, giving it a market capitalization of $22.2 billion and making it the third most valuable cryptocurrency.Ripple (XRP) has doubled in value over the last week as investors bet new use cases will bring a... [+] fresh wave of interest.Video streaming site YouTube, along with the gaming-focused streaming service Twitch, and Wikipedia, are the three biggest sites involved in the Coil trial which will allow content creators on those sites to receive ripple tips through Coil's browser extension app.Coil charges users $5 per month for a subscription to its service and is currently invite-only, though it is planning to eventually open up registration.Ripple Lab's former chief technology officer Stefan Thomas launched Coil earlier this year, promising to help save the internet from ads.“For decades, people have discussed the potential of micropayments to support content creators that would move us away from the broken ad-supported web,” Thomas wrote in a Medium post. “Others have created subscription services that bundle content. But micropayments and subscriptions have always been built as closed systems, which fail to capture the huge variety of content on the web.”Coil would appear to be doing something similar to the now-defunct Changetip, a tipping app that was popular across many of the internet's social media sites before it was shuttered in late 2016 after burning through $3.5 million in funding. Coil could also clash with web browser Brave, which offers similar services to its four million users via its BAT tokens — in addition to increased internet privacy and an ad-blocking.Last week Sagar Sarbhai, head of regulatory relations for Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, told CNBC that Ripple Labs is close to launching a new product that could help banks speed up transactions using XRP, sending the ripple price sharply higher and sparking a wave of interest in the financial industry-focused cryptocurrency.Many are excited by ripple's practical use case, which has seen it work with many of the world's biggest banks and financial service companies to bring cryptocurrency's speed and efficiency to the rather clunky legacy financial systems."

Source:... [+] Getty Royalty Free images,"What are the latest buzzwords these days? Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Why? Because blockchain technology is a revolution which is impacting more and more industries, including banks, governments and even the marketing sector. Furthermore, according to the Statistica Report, 2017, the global blockchain industry is expected to grow to at least $2.3 trillion annually by 2021.Of the many existing sectors that are endorsing this new technology, S4FE is the world’s first blockchain technology-based global database for the registration and identification of stolen or lost items.S4FE’s CMO Recep Avci says his company uses freely accessible, blockchain-based technology to create a global network for the registration, search, verification and identification of (lost or stolen) property. ""We have worked hard to offer something useful and along with our hardworking and dedicated team we have made it work with a strong real world use case designed to benefit the global community.”
The Advantages That Blockchain Offers CMOsThe marketing ecosystem is rapidly implementing this new piece of tech because of the many benefits it brings: decentralized data, privacy, and transparency.Decentralized Data - Internet users do not have exclusive control over the data they share. A novel approach that has emerged from blockchain technology is the decentralized model that has redesigned the way we manage digital information. Also, by eliminating the need for middlemen, people are now be able to share their details without needing the centralized oversight to keep their precious information safe. Plus, the extra fees you would have to pay third parties for their involvement are eliminated.Privacy - This aspect is so important to marketers because they need to build trust with their clients. Nowadays users have to provide a lot of sensitive data about themselves in order to have access to different websites. Blockchain has the advantage of automation and thus makes processing information more secure because it uses a protocol that defines detailed event information, along with a clear cryptographic means of verifying transactions.Transparency - The nature of blockchain is to safely and transparently share data between different groups of individuals worldwide. Marketers embrace this concept, because it lets their customers monitor how their business handles and tracks clients’ digital details. By doing so, every party involved feels at ease with the company’s practices.Threats For Which To Be On The LookoutAs a CMO, your primary focus is to keep the business running and do your best at it. Consequently, when dealing with a new, promising technology, the person in charge must first analyze the fundamentals of blockchain before leveraging it into their business. In doing so, considering possible threats that could harm their organization is a crucial aspect.Hacks - The online ecosystem cannot exist without malicious operations that can hack even the safest of systems. No matter how powerful blockchains may be, they are not immune to attack because like any technology, they have their weak points and attack vectors. Some examples include: sybil and routing attacks. What CMOs can do to prevent such dangerous activities is to check their Proof-of-Work algorithm and to verify the legitimacy of their Internet Service Provider (ISP), specifically how they protect themselves against online threats.Electricity Cost - Everyone has acknowledged the great impact global warming poses and the general focus has been put on environmentally friendly practices. Unfortunately, blockchain requires the use of large amounts of electricity for all its processes and apps to function properly. As a result, adopting this emerging technology will mean that the electricity burden will be at increased rates, especially with new environmental regulations on the way. And as a CMO being aware of this situation when planning new budgets is crucial, in order to be prepared and make accurate and well-informed decisions.Regulatory Status - Since the implementation of this approach is relatively new it has an uncertain regulatory status, creating a potentially unstable climate. Businesses may spend months establishing a business case, testing approaches and proving their concepts to speed up settlement or lower processing costs. But all of this may be interrupted by internal audits – in the legal and compliance realm.Basically, you have to prove your blockchain application works and you have to do it to people who still don’t understand it or are still developing blockchain skills. As a result, the future may is ambiguous not knowing into which legal sphere these processes will fall. Undoubtably that this is an aspect CMOs cannot overlook and they may need to carefully measure the advantages and risks blockchain implementation holds, in order to ensure that their business will prosper in the future."

Jin Gil Lee and Sang Wook Kim, the ...","Oct 23, 2018,02:53pm EDT",Ivan Bogatyy (MetaStable Capital) and Makoto Sakaguchi (Cumberland),"Today, the initial coin offering market is in turmoil with some ICOs closing down. Others are prolonging their capital raising with the hope that the market will pick up. However, this is unlikely to happen soon as new patterns are beginning to emerge from the rubble. Before, the whales were investing in all kinds of new initial coin offerings with the promises of high returns, decentralization and disruption. This led to a flood of new companies raising funds via initial coin offerings, an alternative to traditional venture capital. Now that the market has changed, investors are looking beyond the ICO.The majority of ICOs are solving real-world problems with the use of blockchain technology. But not all of them require a coin or token to do this. That’s because the applications of blockchain technology and smart contracts can often achieve the same results without the coin/token. Most ICOs have become a simple case of solving the right problem with the wrong business model. Their technology is needed in the market but a coin/token may not always be required. The crypto whales became aware of this, believing that some ICOs should ""drop the ICO"" and become a ""blockchain-based company"" instead. This resulted in whales becoming more selective with their investments, pulling funding, which put the ""viability of tokens"" under scrutiny. This is what caused the crypto market crash of 2018.Whilst the challenges facing the ICO market sparked some controversy in the blockchain ecosystem, this has also led to new developments and trends with crypto exchanges and ICOs. Here’s a fresh look at some of these new patterns that are transpiring. Several top exchanges are working on transitioning to non-custodial trading, from Binance DEX to Coinbase acquiring Paradex, to Bitfinex’s Ethfinex Trustless. 0x, a DEX protocol that is not associated with any centralized exchanges has also been gaining momentum with their recent V2 launch.Ivan Bogatyy, the General Partner at MetaStable Capital sheds some light. “Now that centralized exchanges are pouring significant resources into solving these problems, we will likely see a significant increase in DEX trading volume share in the next year or two.”Craig McGregor, the CEO of DSTOQ, a regulated stock exchange echoes similar beliefs. “A trend that has largely taken the world of crypto exchanges by storm is ‘decentralization.’ As a result of numerous security issues plaguing centralized crypto exchanges, more and more users prefer decentralized crypto exchanges.” ICOs may have to rethink their business structure and the same could occur with crypto exchanges. Ras Vasilisin, the CEO of Virtuse, a crypto exchange that pairs cryptocurrencies with real-world assets, believes that exchanges will evolve into entirely new business entities.Vasilisin says that: “The future of exchanges will likely become something that we’ve never seen before operating as a broker, bank, payment provider, underwriter and custodian. They will combine the best of both centralized and decentralized exchanges in a new hybrid-like way.”The crypto exchange Huobi has been developing interests in the STO market with its recent investments in the security token exchanges OpenFinance and SharesPost, hinting that there will likely be more STOs. Similarly, Coinbase expanded its scope into the STO segment by acquiring 3 companies. Ivan Tsybaev who recently sold Trucker Path to the Chinese social networking firm Renren says that “It is only imminent that more security token exchanges will go live soon.” Tsybaev, who has just come out of stealth with his new blockchain project Nomica, believes that a few things will occur:In South Korea, a crypto ecosystem that is dense with over 90% of the crypto community residing in Seoul are growing their ecosystem together. This includes Korean exchanges, startup hubs and crypto coworking spaces like the Bitcoin Center Korea. Jin Gil Lee and Sang Wook Kim, the co-CEOs of the Korea Crypto eXchange (KCX) believe that Korean crypto exchanges will become institutional investors, resulting in the M&A of crypto coins. Lee says, “Some coins may then receive liquidity after investment from exchanges, hence, receiving a lifeline that would ‘resurrect’ under-valued coins”. Kim adds, “Initial exchange offerings (IEOs) may in the near future, serve as a model that could soon replace ICOs by listing projects directly on exchanges—without them necessarily needing to go through an ICO.” Assuming that Kim is correct, IEOs could now be the new ICO.

I. Setting the stageThe IoT and consumer hardware industry have seen multiple failures and a few exits over the last 12–18 months (while the B2B side has been doing a bit better overall) and some criticism has been recently made to the industry to slow down.In spite though of the current push back, the sector is still increasing and attracting capital and talents. Clearly, there are multiple reasons as to why this is the case, but I firmly believe that one of those reasons is the convergence of IoT and Artificial Intelligence with Blockchain as the infrastructural backbone, which is unlocking the next step not only on the tech side but also on the business side.The industry has indeed evolved from merely creating products, to create networks of products (namely, Internet of Things), to eventually creating Intelligent networks of products (I-IoT). The transition between the first and the second class was straightforward: it was enough to create more and different products and link them together. This generated many new possibilities, but it was clear from day one that it came with a series of issues hard to tackle, such as security/privacy, validation/authentication, and connectivity bottlenecks.This is where AI and Blockchain come in. The second transition indeed is made possible through a combination of improvements in computing powers, device miniaturization, ubiquitous wireless connectivity and efficient algorithms (Porter and Heppelmann, 2014). The new class of smart products will be (and already are, to some extent) able to monitor, control, optimize, and automatize processes and products with an accuracy previously not imaginable.Of course, as often happens, the bonus of integrating those fundamental technologies is that they ended up modifying IoT as much as IoT was impacting them in turn.This convergence is however not accidental, but rather an inevitable necessity almost designed by default: AI needs data, IoT needs intelligence and insights, and both need security and transparent marketplaces.The magnitude of this convergence is so high that will affect several sectors swinging from energy and manufacturing to home environment, robotics and drones, supply chain, logistics, and healthcare. Every field which is historically data-rich but information-poor will be touched (or should I say brutally hit?) by those technologies.I will explore how in the next few sections.II. How Blockchain is changing IoTBlockchain as a technology is basically providing the IoT stack with a secure data infrastructure to capture and validate data. As simple as that. At least it is a simple statement that contains three different nuances:III. How Blockchain can change AIAs I have already previously mentioned, blockchain can affect AI in multiple ways:IV. How AI can change IoTAI is feeding itself with the new stream of data coming from the physical world and the billions (if not trillions) of sensors and “things” that are capturing and monitoring everything we do.At the same time though, as soon as an AI starts making sense of IoT data flows, it will:V. How AI can change BlockchainAlthough extremely powerful, a blockchain has its own limitations as well. Some of these are technology-related while others come from the old-minded culture inherited from the financial services sector, but all of these can be affected by AI in a way or another:VI. How IoT is affecting AIThe generation and analysis of data that were not available earlier open a new spectrum of possibilities for an AI to:VII. How IoT could change blockchainIf there is a clear trend emerging, it is that decentralized systems are hard to work with and expensive to maintain. Although the relationship is less intuitive than other more direct links, IoT can help blockchain in:VIII. ConclusionsAs you might have noticed, the edges of the impact of one technology on the others and vice-versa often blur, and this is not by chance but an inevitable consequence of technologies that are born and developed to create an “intelligence flywheel.”In addition to unlocking a set of new technological scenarios, the integration of blockchain, IoT and AI has generated new powerful business models. The shift from product to service and ownership to access is the key to understand the magnitude of the changes in the tech ecosystem. Even more radically, product-as-a-service and product-sharing business models are emerging and winning in almost every markets, leaving the manufacturer in charge of the ownership as well as maintaining the full responsibility of the product and service operation.It is counterintuitive and even a bit absurd, if you think about it, that the surge in the hardware industry is in fact shifting the attention toward a “servitization” model (Porter and Heppelmann, 2014), which clearly makes more sense where the cost of service is a significant part of the greater cost of ownership (that is the case in the current technology landscape).This integration does not come without issues, as we have seen, both technical and commercial, as much as of design. Data democratization may also soon erode the data moat barrier AI companies are nowadays building their empires on. Software and algorithms are no longer private but rather open-source. Computational power is now affordable and will be processed directly on-device. What does it all mean for the evolution of the industry? Who knows. I have no idea of how these phenomena will shape our businesses and lives, but I am sure that the changes will happen at an exponential rate.ReferencesDeloitte (2016). “Blockchain Enigma. Paradox.

It’s the technology behind popular cryptocurrency bitcoin, but blockchain has a number of applications.Blockchain-based smart contracts can help businesses automate a number of transactions and processes. For example, in supply-chain management, a smart contract could be used to track delivery transactions from start to finish. In the real estate market, smart contracts can handle the transfer of titles and the exchange of funds.With Google’s recent announcement, the company joins a growing list of major technology players that are now offering Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS). They include Amazon, IBM, HP, Microsoft, Oracle and SAP. Microsoft was one of the first software vendors to offer BaaS when it launched its Azure Blockchain Service in 2015. These tech leaders are working to provide businesses with all the benefits of blockchain technology without the associated costs of having to build a blockchain platform from scratch.BaaS is helping businesses adapt to this new technology and utilize it as a business solution. Businesses that prefer to outsource the development of blockchain solutions can take advantage of BaaS services. And these new resources can help businesses increase efficiencies and take advantage of growth opportunities.BaaS could be the next big thing for business-to-business companies especially. Until recently, many B2B companies have been unable to take advantage of the benefits of blockchain, but BaaS presents a promising opportunity. Here are three benefits of BaaS for B2B companies.BaaS Allows Companies To Test Out The TechnologyOne of the greatest draws of BaaS is that it allows B2B companies to try out blockchain technology before making a larger investment. Enterprises are still trying to work out how to implement blockchain on a large scale, but the industry’s largest software providers are putting the technology to the test. With BaaS, these companies are allowing B2B companies to test the technology without having to expend capital costs related to on-sight development and hardware. BaaS eliminates the risk of deploying a blockchain platform in-house.""Everybody works with cutting-edge technology, but it does not happen often that your software makes history for being the first of its kind, says Antons Sapriko, CEO of Scandiweb, a blockchain development service provider helping businesses accelerate new ideas.The cost of hiring a coder to build a platform from the ground up can also be substantially prohibitive. As for 2017, the average annual income of a competent blockchain developer was $150,000-$200,000. And hourly rates can fall between $40 to $200 or more.For B2B companies whose core functions have little to do with technology, a blockchain platform may never be important enough to implement in-house. But with BaaS, these companies can see the same benefits as those companies building their own platforms from the ground up.BaaS Addresses The Limited Talent Pool IssueDespite the clear benefits of blockchain for B2B companies, the technology is still in its infancy. A small percentage of the international population have even heard of blockchain technology and an even smaller percentage are qualified to implement it.There currently exists a shortage of blockchain coders, making it downright impossible for many B2B companies to utilize the technology. Of the 20 million software developers in the world, only approximately 0.1 percent know what a blockchain code looks like. And experts indicate there are no more than 60,000 coders qualified to adequately do this work. In the meantime, while international education institutions work feverishly to produce more blockchain capable coders, BaaS companies are ensuring B2B companies can still benefit from those professionals currently holding expertise in this field.BaaS Can Change The Way B2B Companies Handle TransactionsIn 2016, global financial services institution Visa announced  a new partnership with blockchain enterprise company Chain to develop a simple and fast way to process B2B payments across the globe. Often times payments at this level can be difficult for B2B companies to complete efficiently and securely, but with blockchain, Visa can offer companies a consistent process for managing settlements.Making cross-border payments can often be an onerous and lengthy process even for corporations. But blockchain technology simplifies the process. Even though companies offering BaaS essentially serve as middlemen between B2B companies and blockchain technology, the hallmark of this technology is that it cuts out the middlemen in financial transactions by automating them. For this reason, transactions made on blockchain have the potential for faster than usual speeds. Companies like Visa are developing blockchain-based systems to execute near real-time transactions. And the amounts and destinations of these transactions aren’t a barrier. With BaaS B2B companies can exchange high-value international payments.By speeding up the process, BaaS can lead to real savings for B2B companies. A study by Accenture found that blockchain technology could help eight banks save at least $8 billion per year, or approximately 27 percent. Annual cost savings were predicted to reach as high as 38 percent, or around $12 billion.If blockchain can help large institutions processing hundreds of thousands of transaction per day, save money, it’s likely to help B2B companies as well."

His goal is a double-digit return every year – but without taking on too much risk in the stock market. “We’re pretty conservative,” says Catsimatidis. “We take on risks when it comes to high-yield bonds.”Forbes spoke to Catsimatidis in August. At that point, he said he had 70% of his stockholdings invested in financial and energy companies, but was looking at making his portfolio more conservative. Half of his money he has managed by big firms like JPMorganChase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America, and the other half is managed by his own staff. Last year the in-house team outperformed the outside heavyweights, returning 15%, 2 percentage points better than the banks. “Every week and every month we look at the batting average – who’s ahead of who,” he adds.Catsimatidis came to the U.S. from Greece with his parents when he was just 6 months old. The family lived in Harlem in a 5-room apartment; his father worked two jobs to make ends meet. He attended NYU but dropped out just shy of graduating for an opportunity to work and build ownership in a grocery store. He eventually built up a chain of grocery stores and then plowed the profits into other investments. (See this video interview with Catsimatidis from 2016.) 
One big bet has been on real estate. He has long focused on acquiring residential and commercial buildings in the New York area. Altogether he owns about 80 buildings, and has built new apartment towers in Brooklyn’s Fort Green neighborhood. Recently, he has snapped up properties in Florida. “You have 2,000 people a day moving to Florida, and Miami is the capital of South America,” he says. “We just started investing there.”He is also particular about investments that he shuns. “I don’t believe in municipal bonds; I want to get a higher return,” he says. What else does he avoid? Hedge funds. “We don’t like the amounts of fees they charge.” He’s not alone – the hedge fund sector has plenty of struggling participants.What about cryptocurrencies? “I told my son who wanted me to invest in it: ‘Never put more money in bitcoin than you would put on the blackjack table.” "

clients supports only five to seven transactions per second ...","Nov 2, 2018,08:30am EDT",Getty,"Blockchain is a misunderstood technology that I see directed toward solving the wrong kinds of problems. According to a 2018 Gartner study, only 1% of CIOs report that their companies tried to implement blockchain. In order to further adoption, David Furlonger, a vice president at Gartner, notes, ""It is critical to understand what blockchain is and what it is capable of today.”What's the problem with blockchain?My team consults on and implements data management solutions, so the question around how to use blockchain has come up frequently. The issue to me is that too many teams are focused on solving data management problems with blockchain. This is a challenge because blockchain performance typically pales in comparison to the data processing capabilities already in place at most companies when they're viewed side by side. We learned about these challenges early on when experimenting with blockchain prototypes.Cryptocurrencies offer good examples of the data processing challenges to expect as blockchain projects grow, since they are the largest-scale blockchain implementations right now. One MarketWatch opinion piece noted that one of the most popular Bitcoin clients supports only five to seven transactions per second compared to the 25,000 per second processed by Visa. The consensus mechanisms built into blockchain significantly limit data processing rates compared to traditional databases.Not only is data processing in blockchains slower but it also seems to be less energy efficient, a concept explained by a recent Economist article (paywall). In fact, a recent BBC article notes that cryptocurrency data validation operations (aka, crypto-mining) in Iceland are on track to consume more energy this year than all Icelandic households combined.It's understandable why tech teams are struggling to figure out where to use blockchain. What's the point if blockchain is slower, harder to implement and less efficient than standard data management software?Could blockchain remove operational friction?Anyone who has tried to make a purchase, such as a car or a home, can appreciate how complex it is for two parties to complete a largescale transaction. Funds must be verified, disclosures must be made in writing, title searches need to be done, and so on. All that legal paperwork and bureaucratic wrangling is there just to ensure two or more parties follow through on what they already agreed to do.Critical questions need to be answered any time large amounts of money or legal risks are at stake.• Does this party legally own the asset I'm trying to buy?• Will this party actually pay me what they say they will?• How do I make sure this party delivers the goods once I give them my money?Often, these questions need to be answered by multiple third parties. The problem here, in my opinion, is a lack of trust between parties. In many companies' current operational model, the data management and approvals processes are performed by third parties. This creates operational overhead when this additional party needs to be involved to make sure any request is valid and that records are accurately maintained. A great deal of operational excess and middlemen could be removed from many industries if there were a way to verify ownership rights and then enforce follow-through on payment and delivery.This is where blockchain's focus on distributed consensus could come into play. Typically, data in a blockchain is replicated and stored across the participants. Updating this data requires approval from a majority of the participants, who verify the requested change is valid and allowable according to the programmed rules of the blockchain. The participants within each blockchain implementation act as both the users and the controllers of the data, which essentially removes the need for excessive middlemen and other bureacratic nonsense to arbitrate transactions.I believe blockchain's value is the automation of trust between parties. This is blockchain's primary purpose. Blockchain is not just a fancier version of a database. It can significantly reduce the operational friction required to validate ownership, identity and contractual terms by allowing participants to interact directly with one another without someone in the middle providing verification.When looking for places to implement blockchain, I don't believe the question is where data flows or data management can be made more efficient. It's where we can remove the need for trust-based overhead. Brian Behlendorf, executive director of Hyperledger, summed this all up perfectly to Barron's when he said, “Blockchain is not a technological solution to a technological problem. It’s a technological solution to a political problem.”"

specifically “Bitcoin” is well understood by business leaders today.","Sep 27, 2018,09:30am EDT","The reality that “Blockchain” does not equal “cryptocurrency” or more specifically “Bitcoin” is well understood by business leaders today. But executives are just starting to realize that blockchain does equal opportunity for their businesses. Through its vast, and still largely untapped potential, blockchain may significantly streamline enterprise processes, reduce labor- and document-intensive transactions, and generally clean up the clearinghouse.","At first glance, for example, customer service, manufacturing, sales, distribution, and back office services all clearly seem to be fully integrated parts of a single company.By definition, Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology (DLT). In its simplest form, a DLT platform creates a single record of a transaction, such as a sale between two parties at an agreed-to price, that can be accessed and independently verified by all approved participants in the transaction. That single transaction—a “block”—serves as an unchangeable, permanent and trusted record maintained in a single, shared digital ledger. Any related new transactions can be added on top of that original record, creating an interconnected “blockchain” of increasingly complex transactions and counterparties—all neatly mapped in the single digital ledger shared by all participants.The PotentialThe real-world business applications of blockchain technology are where things start to get really interesting. Imagine a world of streamlined tax and compliance checks, more efficient (and less redundant) data-warehousing, and dramatically reduced reconciliation requirements across multiple business partners. And then increase that potential efficiency by the thousands to millions of transactions a DLT can execute.The result: Business leaders begin to see the opportunity for their entire enterprise to spend more time on highly-complex and risky transactions and processes by nearly automating the basic, redundant transactions and process—and the knock-on potential to reduce costs, improve margins and even grow topline revenue. But where to start?Before jumping head-first into the blockchain pool, companies will want to ensure they have the proper subject matter experts (SMEs) on hand to get their DLT architecture block-solid from the start. And perhaps no SME will be more important than a high-level tax expert, given the complex tax implications that are typically embedded across an enterprise blockchain.Get more insight on blockchain and the future of tax.Moving PartsFor starters, contemplate the sheer volume of interconnected transactions within just a single multinational company. At first glance, for example, customer service, manufacturing, sales, distribution, and back office services all clearly seem to be fully integrated parts of a single company.But look closer. There are also, ultimately, independent-run yet related parties with thousands and even millions of interconnected transactions between them that are essential to your company—and all too often, recorded with multiple, independent and ever-so-slightly different processes, databases and paper back-up files. (Much to your tax expert’s dismay!) But in a well-designed blockchain, these internal, but often disparately captured transactions become part of a single ledger.And that’s just within your company. Now add on top of that all of the different transactions with “counterparties” outside of your business walls: your banks and financial institutions, public markets, regulators, third-party vendors, suppliers to those vendors … and, of course, don’t forget your customers, and their related transactional nuances by product line, geography, sales taxes, and so forth.A Real-World ExampleBlockchain can cut through that multilayered complexity by establishing a single ledger to track and capture as many of the interconnected web of transactions as makes sense for a given business. For example, consider the possibilities for a large shipping company, which has to navigate transactions with:Buzzing throughout is a hornet’s nest of tax and regulatory issues: Virtually every transaction in the case above has a tax, accounting, and/or legal implication. It’s a challenge with a many-magnitude level of complexity that can drag on business growth and render smoke from executives’ ears.But this complex challenge offers many-magnitude level of opportunity when approached with a thoughtfully planned, enterprise-ready blockchain solution.Get more insight on blockchain and the future of tax. © 2018 KPMG LLP, a Delaware limited liability partnership and the U.S. member firm of the KPMG network of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Cooperative (“KPMG International”), a Swiss entity.

They sell borrowed shares, and must buy them back later--but if the price falls in between, they profit.Many people scorn the shorts. But I call my contest ""Short Sellers Don’t Have Horns” because I believe the shorts serve useful purposes, countering hype and maintaining an informed dialogue among investors.I engage in short selling for a few of my clients who have high risk tolerance.Condon took first place in my latest contest, which ran from September 30, 2017 to September 19, 2018, by picking MGT Capital Investments (MGTI) to decline. It fell 91.4%.MGT, he said, was “seen as a proxy play on bitcoin,” which was then soaring. The company describes itself as one of the largest U.S. bitcoin miners. Said Condon, “There is no proof that the company can make a buck from that activity.”On September 7 this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a complaint against Robert (Rob) Ladd, MGT’s CEO. It charges him with helping to orchestrate a “pump and dump” scheme involving cybercurrencies.On September 15, the company announced that Ladd will take a leave of absence, adding that it has confidence he is innocent.For his prize, Condon will receive a CD featuring the piano music of Bobby Short.For the coming year, Condon is picking Tilray (TLRY). The company, based in British Columbia, Canada, develops cannabis-based medications. It is expected to post sales of about $42 million this year, yet its market value is more than $11 billion. Condon says that valuation is ridiculous. In addition, he thinks the “tobacco stocks will win the new legal cannabis sector.”Stewart Winograd, a market data analyst for DTN in Omaha, Nebraska, came in second. He had a 37.8% gain on shorting Snap (SNAP).When he entered the contest, Winograd said that Snap shares were trading for 26 times the company’s sales, “an optimistic level compared to industry stalwarts” like Google (then 6 times sales). “If everything goes right, that valuation limits the upside,” Winograd wrote, “and everything does not always go right.”For the next contest, which begins September 30, 2018, Winograd picks a short sale on Shopify (SHOP). The company operates a cloud-based e-commerce platform. Again, he relied on the price-to-sales ratio to make his choice, calling it “one of my favorite tools.”Shopify, he says, had a “nice rise the past couple of years.” It now trades at 19 times sales, which Winograd calls “pretty high.” The average stock these days trades for 2.3 times sales. Even that is well above the historical norm of about 1.5.Finishing third was James (nickname Joe) Vihstadt, a retired investor in Papillion, Nebraska. He gained a theoretical 20.3% by shorting Tesla (TSLA).Tesla shares, he says, are “held up by a cult mentality.” They currently trade for about $299 a share. “One of these days the stock will fall to double digits,” Vihstadt predicts. “It is a totally overvalued company.”For the coming year’s contest, he will short Tesla again. CautionA word of caution. Short selling is a high-risk investment technique for one simple reason: Potential losses are unlimited. When you buy a stock, the most you can lose is 100% of what you invested; the stock can’t decline past zero.But when you sell short, there is no limit on how high a stock can rise, so you can lose more money than the amount you initially commit.Want to Enter?If you would like to enter the 2018-2019 contest, just send me an e-mail with the following information:Contestants are not required to sell the stock short in real life, only in theory. However, you may choose a stock that you are short in reality if you choose.The next contest will run from October 2, 2018 through September 14, 2019.

will completely replace legacy financial systems, the world is ...","Oct 29, 2018,09:41am EDT",Photographer: Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg,"This isn't just a phenomenon, but an entirely new move into financial operation. Similar to the beginning stages of the ""dot-com"" era and days of America Online (AOL), cryptocurrency has sparked a financial flame seen and felt ‘round the world.But while bright, this flame isn't as warming to everyone around it. Initially, financial institutions were hesitant to stick their hands out towards the flame. However, as the space has grown over the past two years, there’s no question that these institutions are now starting to take the cryptocurrency ecosystem seriously.The integration of legacy financial services, Blockchains, and the emerging class of digital assets are certainly underway. The potential of this newly hatched financial system is enormous, but there are still several obstacles that need to be overcome before any promises of this financial paradigm coming to fruition.#1 –Slow KYC/AML Compliance ProceduresSince the U.S. passed the Bank Secrecy Act in 1970, financial institutions have been charged with keeping the peace and structure of financial activity among their customers. Whether you as an investor are dealing with cryptocurrency or any other financial asset, implementing “know-your-customer” (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) policies, are essential in minimizing any potential threats. However, predicting the infinite number of incidents that could happen, serve as a disincentive for individuals to take this seriously. The biggest disadvantage with KYC/AML is that a company is trying to base its model off events that may not have happened yet, or may not have even been considered. But, recognizing certain truths may help steer companies in a traffic-free journey towards compliance:Yet, a substantial market gap still remains between traditional financial services, mainstream investors, and the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Although access to digital assets is available on multiple cryptocurrency exchanges, the current status quo is often inconvenient. Unclear regulatory environments burden exchanges that operate as fiat on-ramps that require slow KYC/AML compliance procedures. Further, the benefits and/or services each of these exchanges offer, differ widely, and often offer significantly fewer assets than their crypto-to-crypto exchange counterparts.#2 –The Realities of Crypto ExchangesWhile initially considered to be a ""financial taboo,"" regulation has become the topic of conversation among the crypto-community. After all, one cannot possibly think of creating an entirely new financial system without regulatory safeguards, and hope for mass adoption. Specifically, these exchanges are now seeking approval from the highest government authorities, hoping to on-board as many investors as possible.But, while these exchanges provide many benefits, they also come with their downsides as well. Many of which largely operate outside of regulatory control, listing assets that often have insufficient liquidity, leading to a dynamic, more representative of high-stakes gambling.Moreover, the relationship between these exchanges, token issuers, and coin ranking sites is opaque, presenting significant risks in what seems to be an unsustainable market trend.In a previously written article of mine, I outlined why it’s important for investors to seriously consider the exchanges they decide to entrust their funds with, as each offer something unique to its users.#3 –High Barriers of EntryThe fragmented nature of our current digital financial landscape has created an extremely high barrier to entry for mainstream investors as well as a lack of options for companies with digital asset reserves to plug into practical financial services. This stems from a hesitancy on the part of banks to offer its services to digital asset exchanges, investment funds, and ICO companies.Yet again, this leads back to the question of regulation and what our government authorities and investors need to do to help move this space forward, ultimately benefiting consumers and investors across the world.The Bitfinex ChroniclesThis precedent whereby traditional financial institutions are cautious in establishing relationships with these ""crypto-initiatives"" are clearly evidenced by the ongoing struggles and controversy of certain exchanges, such as Bitfinex.Last year, Wells Fargo cut off their correspondent relationship with the exchange, one of the largest and most popular in the world, initiating a series of struggles by Bitfinex to access sufficient financial services over the course of last year.More recently, Bitfinex had begun using Noble Bank International, based in Puerto Rico, for its banking services. Foreboding what was to come, the Bank has reportedly sought out a sale amid the ongoing bear market slide and the apparent breaking off of its relationship with the custodian Bank of New York Mellon Corp.Amidst these nuances, Bitfinex has since faced allegations of insolvency, along with Tether, which also has used Noble Bank International. Having strongly denied such allegations, Bitfinex has since parted ways with the Bank, with reports of it tapping HSBC, the London-based banking giant.But, Bitfinex isn't the odd ball out–all exchanges are having to deal with their own internal dilemmas, and the ongoing chronicles of Bitfinex are demonstrative of how fragile these industry relationships can be, especially between digital asset exchanges and traditional banking services. Consequently the ability to access insufficient liquidity pools, custodial and brokerage services, and payment services, is mostly absent and/or challenging to come by in the market.Learning from MistakesSome of the high-profile exchanges in the U.S. such as Coinbase and Gemini have been taking meaningful strides to expand their services and bridge the gap between cryptomarkets and institutional finance. But, there are others starting to make their moves across the board: HBUSMost recently, HBUS, the exclusive U.S. strategic partner of Huobi, the world’s leading digital currency marketplace, announced that Megan Monroe-Coleman, joined as Chief Compliance Officer (CCO). With over 15 years of experience in the compliance sector, previously a Director with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC), Monroe-Coleman previously served as MTL Compliance Officer at Intuit, following the acquisition of Mint, where she was also a compliance officer. At HBUS, she will be directly responsible for U.S. compliance functions and implementing comprehensive framework for regulatory compliance and risk. I spoke with the newly appointed CCO on how this new journey helps to bridge the large gap as between financial institutions and this newly created financial sector. “I am really excited to be part of an industry offering emerging financial products to consumers,” Monroe-Coleman emphasized. “While I have a strong background in money services compliance, it hasn’t made my role easier. I am learning new things every day, which is challenging, but also extremely rewarding. It’s important to be flexible, listen, and collaborate with the product and marketing teams, ensuring that you are all working towards a commonly shared vision.”When I asked the former PWC and Intuit Compliance Director about the nature of cybersecurity as it stands today, she was extremely confident. “A robust cybersecurity program is essential in any industry, especially given the recent consumer data breaches at Equifax and Facebook,” she told me. “Digital currency is a product that spans across both the financial and technology sectors, which means that it is even more important for us to implement stronger cybersecurity controls. My experience in (formerly) preparing Intuit to comply with the New York State Department of Financial Services 500 Cybersecurity regulations, combined with my background in conducting security audits and assessments at PWC, has prepared me extremely well compared to others, for this new challenge. I’m confident in my understanding of the standards and in HBUS’ motivation to protect our customers from cybersecurity attacks.”CoinbaseCoinbase, which recently surpassed 25 million users, has built out its retail service offerings, including Coinbase Commerce and other custodial services. Combined, the Coinbase Commerce platform, which is designed to easily onboard online merchants into the space, while targeting institutional finance to join a broader initiative.GeminiGemini, one of the United States’ largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has also helped to bridge the gap with its recent announcement of its insurance policy coverage for custodial assets. Seeking to build out its exchange with regulators, it is now offering its fully regulated Gemini Dollars stablecoin (GUSD), under the oversight of the New York Financial Services Department.The challenge here, will be competing with one of the most well-known stablecoins to date—Tether. But, with it’s FDIC-insured backing, it would seem this is the first time any type of digital currency is insured, protected, and also virtually immutable on a Blockchain.Formosa FinancialOne particular project I've kept my eyes on, is Formosa Financial. The platform is in its initial stages to offer users a single point of contact to applications and brokerages, connecting digital asset holders to a range of services and exchanges through its platform. If proven successful, this could help bridge the gap among many of these companies, on-boarding a very large volume of consumers and investors.From a consumer and investor perspective, nothing grinds my gears more than not having a range of options when it comes to liquidation or conversion. In my previously written article on evaluating exchanges, this concern is at the top of that list.The Shift Has BegunNo different than the beginning stages of the ""dot-com"" era or the days of AOL, the (hopeful) transition to a new financial system on blockchain networks, integrated with currently implemented financial systems, will take a long time to recognize its full potential.However, the signs are here and the flame has been seen. The shift has begun, with some vital infrastructural developments and regulatory distinctions becoming more defined, as companies now compete to establish themselves in a ‘eat or be eaten’ market.While however unlikely Bitcoin and decentralized cryptocurrency networks will completely replace legacy financial systems, the world is announcing its desire to have more diverse financial services, with reduced transactional costs and counterparty risks. Once the necessary framework is more clearly defined, however long it takes, then companies including digital asset exchanges, investment funds, and ICO projects have a fighting chance to plug into these traditional financial networks, opening the door for a new dynamic of financial services."

[+] certain types of insurance pay-outs.,"As Hurricane Florence barrels toward the eastern coast of the United States, a new kind of disaster relief is on the horizon.Currently, when hurricanes and other natural disasters strike, a whole fleet of insurance professionals goes into action. From insurance adjusters and agents working for insurance companies to minimize fraud to reinsurance companies that protect insurance companies and retrocessionaires that look after the reinsurance companies, the entire industry starts to look a lot like a Russian doll of loss prevention.The end result of the complicated web of professionals that stands between a disaster and a payout can sometimes be weeks or months of delays while otherwise avoidable suffering continues unchecked.To bring some sense to that chaos, and perhaps remove a couple layers of redundancies and inefficiencies in the process, Switzerland-based Etherisc is part of a growing global effort to automate parts of the process using self-executing code, or smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain.If successful, the work to move the insurance workflow to a shared, distributed ledger of transactions could eventually lead to the automatic payout of certain kinds of support. But for now, victims of Hurricane Florence, now speeding toward several eastern states at 140 miles per hour, will have to wait.“We'd love to offer policies in Virginia,” said Etherisc cofounder Renat Khasanshyn, referring to one of the places the Category 4 hurricane could make landfall.  “Yet launching a product in multiple locations is no easy task.""Etherisc was founded in 2017 as an open source platform to help create insurance products using the ethereum blockchain. After raising $3.6 million in an initial coin offering (ICO), the early-stage startup is already helping other companies write insurance policies using the smart contract code. By plugging in data from trusted third parties for everything ranging from cancelled flights to wind speed, a wide range of payout events could be automated.For example, in response to last year's Hurricane Maria, an insurance policy powered by Etherisc technology is now being developed by HurricaneGuard, an insurtech startup based in Puerto Rico. At stake are not only the approximately 225,000 insurance claims that remained unresolved four months after the hurricane made landfall but also the estimated 3,700 deaths that resulted from lack of access to medicine and other provisions following the disaster.""Our plan is to begin writing policies for the next hurricane season in Puerto Rico,” said Khasanshyn.After that, Etherisc hopes to use wind data from Colorado State University to trigger certain insurance payouts elsewhere around the world. ""Our interpretation of the underlying numerical weather model shows that hurricane Florence will slow down its progress over the land, which may cause significant losses,” said Khasanshyn.If Hurricane Florence makes landfall as expected later this week, it will be only the fourth Category 4 hurricane on record to do so in the region and could damage as many as 759,000 homes, with a reconstruction cost value of $170.2 billion.The application of a distributed ledger used by insurance counterparties may seem far-fetched, but French insurance giant AXA has already launched an ethereum-powered flight insurance tool that automatically pays out for cancelled flights, and a consortium of the largest insurance companies in the world has formed B3i, a for-profit entity aimed at implementing a wide range of insurance tools using the R3 distributed ledger.As for HurricaneGuard, the founders last month met with the office of the commissioner of insurance of Puerto Rico and are seeking a license to sell insurance in the region. In the meantime, HurricaneGuard co-founder and team lead Jonathan Gonzalez says the project is onboarding its first distribution partners and finalizing its incorporation in the state of Delaware.“While we are definitely tracking Florence closely and running test policies,"" said Gonzalez. ""We can't officially offer policies in a location without getting the required regulatory approval."""

(Source: Getty).,"The Blockchain Connect Association, a newly established Czech Alliance formed in the spring of 2018 with partners including IBM, PwC and a Prague-based fintech incubator for start-ups, has revealed plans to contribute to the development of blockchain technologies in the “economic and public spheres” within the Czech Republic.This is a country that this year along with Slovakia celebrates the 100th anniversary the founding of the First Republic of Czechoslovakia.The grand aim of the Alliance is to “significantly change” the Czech economy within the next three to five years by using blockchain technology - also known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) - as the initiative plans to accelerate the evolution of blockchain in the country.The protagonists behind the venture claim that it will be “integral to implementing DLT solutions” throughout the public and private sectors across the nation, which has a population of around 10.5 million.The Czech Republic is a country - along with neighbouring Slovakia - that can lay claim to many inventions and innovations over the years. The list is long, but it includes the ship’s propeller (by a Slovak) in a landlocked country, the 'Radio Priest', Jozef Murgaš, and another Slovak, whose patents would go on to form the foundations for the invention of the radio before Marconi.Then there was Štefan Banič, who emigrated to America and built a prototype of a parachute in around 1912 that was registered with the U.S. Patent Office.On the Czech side, the sugar cube (or first ever cube-shaped sweetener) was invented in the small Bohemian town of Dačice, near the Austrian border, by Jakub Kryštof Rad. And, let’s not forget the world's first golden pilsner larger, Pilsner Urquell, originates from 1842. Reflective of this ingenuity, there is an old adage, 'Zlaté české ručičky a chytré české hlavičky', which translated means “golden Czech hands and clever Czech heads.”Mitigating Corruption, Fraud & TheftBlockchain technology is touted by industry pundits as having the potential to significantly mitigate corruption, fraud and theft in various markets. IBM, for its part has been on a trail in recent years to bear down and stem fraud in sectors spanning gold and jewelry, logistics, shipping and digital identities applying technology from the HyperLedger project.Founding members of the alliance include Adel, a blockchain project accelerator and innovation firm, consultancy firm PwC, technology company IBM, and Squire Patton Boggs, a full-service global law firm with a multi-disciplinary team of over 1,500 lawyers across 20 countries.Blockchain Connect's 'Czech Alliance' partners. (Source: Adel).It was in December 2016 that Adel revealed plans to initiate a month-long crowdfunding exercise from March 1 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). The incubator is headed up by a couple of Prague-based fintech advisers, with its ecosystem comprising stakeholders, registered community members, staff from around the globe, a Project Review Committee and Adel’s Board formed by three co-founders.At the time, the incubator was to launch a website to support its initiative and aimed to develop, support and fund start-ups using blockchain technology based on the Nxt community platform. (Note: Nxt was to provide a Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform).Fast forward to this year and Adel plans to release Version 2 of their Incubation Portal during the fourth quarter of 2018. Earlier this year they moved their digital currency (ADL) from the Nxt blockchain to Ethereum. And, since their ICO, Adel has been working to incubate several ideas. Currently there are 14 on the table for consideration, it is understood.Furthermore, Adel's flagship idea is a Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchange - or DCX for short - called iFin (ifin.io), which is planned to be launched in 2019. This is a significant project since most trading platforms released to-date have been centralized. This means that they use a decentralized open ledger such as blockchain, but centralize account details and secret keys. The upshot is that it has resulted in a massive single-point-of-failures that have been exploited by hackers.The popularity of blockchain arrived with the rapid expansion of cryptocurrencies and the open ledger. This represents a decentralized database that keeps a record of every single transaction or interaction between two parties. In simplistic terms one could think of it as a huge Excel spreadsheet.Traditional databases have a much wider scope. For this reason, Blockchain Connect has indicated that it will “focus on the differentiation of crypto/DLT solutions.”Jan Lamser of Adel describing the alliance’s ambitions, remarked: “First and foremost, our goal is to educate the public and private sectors on blockchain and crypto solutions. We want to take part in the digitization of the entire Czech society and show the practical use cases.”Blockchain Connect plans on a “three-pronged” approach to market acceptance, namely on:Jiří Batěk, the director of IBM’s Infrastructure Division based in Prague and Business Unit Leader, Global Technology Services (Central Europe) at ‘Big Blue’, added: “Our ambition is not only to localize our global solutions in the Czech environment, but also to find and support innovative local partners and enable their access to international markets.”One of blockchain’s benefits is touted as the reduction of administration between companies and customers. As such this technology offers a high level of security and supply-chain transparency.“In traditional business models, there are many entities that play different roles. They are not easily trusted, and therefore require bilateral paper-based agreements. Blockchain can easily secure trust in a streamlined and digital sphere,” stated Petr Ložek, managing partner of consulting firm PwC ČR and lead partner of technology consulting at the firm.A possible obstacle though to the global introduction of blockchain technology is seen as deriving from “insufficient motivation” of all the stakeholders, it was pointed out by the Association. And, the question was how to address this.As noted by Danica Šebestová, a partner at Squire Patton Boggs law firm: “For a successful introduction of blockchain [projects] it is necessary to work with all stakeholders who want to benefit from these solutions. This is our ambition - to find ""optimal"" crypto/DLT solutions that will save time and money for our clients.In relation to these optimal solutions, while Blockchain Connect has actively begun to pursue opportunities in real estate, financial services, automotive, healthcare, and the food industry, specific details cannot be disclosed at this time due to customer confidentiality. However, in each of these industries, Supply Chain Management (SCM) and logistics are key areas where crypto can play a streamlined role to Business Process Management (BPM).""The Alliance partners will focus on traditional corporate solution benefits in the name of crypto. Namely: Return on Investment (ROI), Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), and Cost and Time savings,"" explained Gabriel Dusil, Adel co-Founder and Board member, from Prague.Given that Alliance partners have multinational offices, it should certainly benefit from the cornerstone initiatives of Blockchain Connect. In any case, crypto projects are expected to take on a multinational scope and will therefore require the engagement of relevant stakeholders in different countries, depending on the crypto opportunities that develop out of the Alliance.Simplified Logistics To Help Global TradeBlockchain Connect has identified a number of areas - real estate, financial services, automotive, healthcare and the food industry - as the top sectors that will be able to “maximize the benefits” of blockchain and DLT.For example, the alliance pointed to the logistics industry being “heavily burdened” by multiple parties needing to exchange paper documents. With blockchain they can be in a position to simply share the same open ledger in order to settle transactions.According to the World Economic Forum’s study “Enabling Trade Valuing Growth Opportunities 2013”, international trade can potentially save up to 15% by reducing legacy barriers.A key benefit of open ledger initiatives is a common platform that is trusted by all parties along the supply chain. Currently, international supply chains are plagued by disconnected databases, outdated logistics, and disparate ICT infrastructures.""The promise of blockchain is to streamline supply chains end-to-end, but this is only one piece of the puzzle to solving legacy problems,"" posited Adel's Dusil. He added boldly: ""Enter IBM, PwC, Squire Patton Boggs, and Adel - each alliance partner offers a plethora of skills necessary to tackle the largest corporate infrastructure challenges in the world.""Similar benefits can also be found in food safety controls, in verifying the quality of raw materials. And, in real estate, negotiations between banks and land registration can take up to 70 days within the Czech Republic.By using blockchain these settlements can be resolved within a few days or a saving in time of “up to 95%”, it was ventured.In the automotive industry, for example, it was pointed out that an open ledger can prevent tachometer tampering. Similarly, counterfeit spare parts can easily be identified and traced in cars, thereby protecting the supply chain of the entire automotive industry.The RoadmapAs to a roadmap going forward over the next couple of years, in parallel with the latest development, the Alliance has begun to engage the Czech government to discuss how blockchain can enhance the digital agendas, which are within the responsibility of each ministry.According to sources the government has already expressed their “interest in engaging” Blockchain Connect in educational seminars and in projects that will modernize their legislative framework. And, government projects are expected to have a much longer sales cycle compared to the private sector.Of course, like so many partnerships and alliances in the blockchain and cryptocurrency spaces, it is one thing to promise much. And, the industry has had a habit of over promising and under delivering. The proof of the pudding will surely come when concrete advances are actually forged and carved out.And, that is something the industry needs to build confidence more so than ever. For now, this is a work in progress, even if Blockchain Connect’s aim of “digitization” of Czech society to bring accelerated changes to legislation is a laudable one. And, working with partners across the CEE region might potentially pep up proceedings going forward."

And Litecoin Soar—Here's Why. As Nydia put it, “Social Alpha ...","Oct 23, 2018,01:18pm EDT",Social Alpha Foundation co-founders Nydia Zhang and Jehan Chu @ Social Impact Hackathon,"You often hear about the incredible riches generated by the crypto millionaires and billionaires of the world but have you ever spared a thought as to where all of that wealth goes? Surely, there are only so many lambos that can be bought with crypto.Cryptocurrencies have gone through a boom and somewhat of a bust, but overall, if you had been one of the earliest believers, you'd have seen a growth from a few cents in value to thousands of dollars. This has created a new class of wealthy individuals, many with contrarian views held from the start of cryptocurrency. Some of that money might be funneled into luxury goods, but some are also being used to finance a set of ideas and impact people believe in.The Social Alpha Foundation is a non-for-profit structured around getting donations from individual cryptocurrency holders and turning them to grants to organizations focused on blockchain education and social impact projects. The organization is in the process of supporting six projects and has raised over $1m in funding from individual donors in less than a year.Nydia Zhang is the co-founder and chairman, based in Hong Kong. She is the fund-raising Committee Member of the Hong Kong Society for the Protection of Children (HKSPC) and the Co-Chair of Financial Literacy & Inclusion Committee at The Fintech Association of Hong Kong (FTAHK), straddling both developments in fintech and emerging technology as well as established practices in not-for-profit management.As Nydia put it, “Social Alpha Foundation was founded to demonstrate the transformative power that blockchain has to make the world a better place.""She explains that the Foundation splits its funding into two categories: fundamental educational work on the social impact of blockchain and different applications focused on using blockchain for social good in education, public health or the environment.Each one of the grantees is audited by a council of charity professionals and technologists. The grants are disbursed on a milestone basis -- with percentages of funding as high as 50% riding on whether or not the grantee can accomplish certain intermediate and final goals. One can't help but notice a slightly higher bar for impact vetting than, say, your average ICO -- which promises a whitepaper's content and typically isn't held accountable if none of it is done.One of the grantees is now currently a graduate student at UCLA, who previously was one of the founding members of Blockchain at Berkeley -- she was the co-head of blockchain education at Berkeley. Thanks to a grant from the Social Alpha Foundation, she was able to both complete research and her studies in the blockchain space and share that knowledge through a series of meetups, going so far as to Hong Kong to share blockchain knowledge.Another funded project was a blockchain for social impact hackathon in New York City, where the winning team was composed of students from MIT and University of Chicago focused on learning and practicing as much as they could around the blockchain space. The three winning projects focused on blockchain applications for voting, crowdfunding, and helping refugees.Another project, Amply, was the very first grantee and it focused on building a mobile blockchain application that could help track the attendance of students and make it verifiable by third parties: saving on a paper chain of records and making it easier to measure program efficiency and to allocate resources and funding to the right places. By creating a more efficient system for recording attendances than the old one, they're able to save teachers the time of making records and focus on what they love doing: teaching. They initially started with the goal of impacting at least 1,000 students and they've already created a system that saves teachers and other stakeholders over 4,000 hours every month.Finally, a project known as the Impact Ledger is being used to curate and channel productive social impact efforts using blockchain that span across the non-for-profit, public and private sectors. Built by the Blockchain Trust Accelerator (BTA), a not-for-profit collaboration between technology think tank New America, The Bitfury Group, and the National Democratic Institute with support from the Rockefeller Foundation, Social Alpha Foundation plans to give the project a six-figure grant to support researchers creating the world's most comprehensive database of blockchain social impact projects.All of these projects are different, but the Social Alpha Foundation is able to be flexible. Nydia explains that “as every project is different, from events to software applications to travel grants, having a one-size-fits-all framework is quite difficult. To create bespoke and meaningful KPIs, we ask projects to define their KPIs in their application so they are clear and agreed on by the vetting committee before the grant is made.""The Social Alpha Foundation, through its vetting process and the projects it supports, aims to increase the impact of blockchain projects focused on doing good for the world instead of just doing good for cryptocurrency holders. By directing the profits of the crypto rich towards helping social good projects, Nydia Zhang and the Social Alpha Foundation are hoping to prove that cryptocurrencies aren't just a bubble focused on private profits."

Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStock/Getty Images),"Today’s post-truth discourse has made it hard to distinguish facts from fake news. Everyone seems to be out to challenge everybody else’s credibility.Even traditional news sources are under attack. 62 percent of Americans already view media as biased and there’s an understandable reason why. America's biggest media companies are owned by billionaires with interests in a variety of industries and affinities with different political groups. Concerns regarding bias are only natural given these circumstances.The internet should be able to provide worthy alternatives to mogul-owned media. Unfortunately, even online sources are turning out to be less reliable given the glut of poor content online. The ease through which users can create websites and social media pages enabled a bunch of nobodies to present themselves as experts and influencers without having the knowledge and credibility to actually weigh in on matters. Advertising and monetization have also forced creators to rely on clickbait in order to generate views and shares rather than working on useful content.In addition, given enough resources, it is possible to manipulate what people get exposed to online. The Facebook and Cambridge Analytica scandal serves as a reminder of how great an impact such manipulative actions can have on society.Various efforts are now being undertaken to use technologies such as blockchain to promote truthful and useful information online. Various blockchain projects are now applying the technology to not only secure content but also encourage the creation and consumption of quality content.Publishing platforms and ad networks have long influenced how online content is created. By controlling the mechanisms to monetization, they compel creators to focus on driving advertising rather than on delivering insightful information. Creators are forced to pander to the lowest common denominator, producing sensationalized content in order to generate views.To change this system, blockchain can help create new mechanisms for content monetization. Platforms can use crypto tokens and smart contracts to establish self-sustaining economies that can upend conventional monetization schemes. Question and answer platform ASKfm is now working on its own blockchain project dubbed ASQ Protocol. ASQ is a decentralized protocol for content creation, storage and monetization. Rather than relying on online advertising mechanics such as pay-per-click or pay-per-view, ASQ allows users to reward creators of content that they find helpful using tokens. Since they are being rewarded more directly, content creators now have to focus on meeting audiences’ needs and expectations.To help further boost the quality of online content, mechanisms that curb the spread of poor content on social networks must also be put in place. Bots, trolls, and fake accounts may be responsible for starting the spread of fake news but it’s the ordinary users who give momentum for such information to enter public consciousness. Curation is critical to ensure that only quality content gets shared.Sapien Network is a platform that promotes the creation and sharing of quality content. To ensure that only legitimate entities participate on the platform, users must first hold Sapien's SPN tokens. To perform actions such as voting, commenting, and posting, users must also stake their tokens. This staking compels users to be mindful of the content they share and it also discourages fake accounts and trolls from participating.In the case of ASQ, rewards are shared not only to creators but also to the community that curates and promotes the content. Incentivizing curation engages users in making quality content become more visible.Online content can also be scraped and stolen easily which can be demotivating to many content creators. Fake news sites also plagiarize and modify existing works to shape a different narrative. Blockchain can provide mechanisms for creators to prove ownership and preserve the integrity of their content through immutable recordkeeping.Research communities are now using blockchain to keep track of research projects and findings to ensure accurate attribution. For example, research collaboration platform Matryx uses blockchain to identify a researcher’s contributions to research projects.Services like Proof of Existence allows users to upload and have documents certified using the Bitcoin blockchain. Each document is given a unique hash which is then sent to the blockchain as a permanent and transparent record. This hash serves as the identifier for the document proving that the document already exists.The admissibility of blockchain records is also gaining ground across various territories. These records could eventually serve as evidence of copyright and ownership and enable creators to pursue legal action to those who debase their intellectual property.Online content should continue to be a reliable alternative to large mainstream news and media outlets. However, the problem of poor and fake content must be addressed. Blockchain appears poised to offer the mechanisms needed to curb the spread of fake news and promote quality content. By changing the way content is monetized, blockchain platforms can encourage content creators to finally focus on usefulness. Incentivizing users who contribute in curation and sharing of also ensures that only quality content gets shared. Blockchain-based content validation could also easily expose manipulated information.Surely, there will be skepticism concerning the fit of blockchain technology in these particular use cases. Better fraud prevention mechanisms from existing publishing and advertising platforms should already help ease the issue. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are now also being used to automatically censor trolls and fake news on social media. In addition, issues concerning blockchain’s scalability and usability have yet to be fully resolved. Some dapps are still hampered by blockchains’ slow confirmation times. A proliferation of more clunky and inefficient systems would probably do more harm than good. So, it would be up to these projects’ developers to ensure that they provide acceptable user experiences. "

And Litecoin Soar—Here's Why. While traditional, centralized ...","Editors' Pick|Nov 9, 2018,05:51pm EST",US-ARCHITECTURE-SEC,"Cryptocurrency exchanges, be warned. There’s no out-innovating the regulatory reach of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Clarifying an announcement yesterday that the SEC is in the middle of its first-ever case against a cryptocurrency exchange running on the ethereum blockchain, Robert Cohen, the chief of the SEC’s newly created cyber unit, exclusively told Forbes that using any blockchain to create an exchange without central operations doesn’t remove the original creator's responsibility.As similar decentralized exchanges are being launched with increasing ease and frequency, the warning shows how serious the SEC is about taming the cryptocurrency Wild West and the semantics used to bolster it.“The focus is not on the label you put on something or the technology you’re using,” says Cohen. “The focus is on the function, and what the platform is doing. Whether it’s decentralized or not, whether it’s on a smart contract or not, what matters is it’s an exchange.”While traditional, centralized exchanges like Coinbase, or even Nasdaq, are run by individuals, this new breed of decentralized exchanges runs on self-executing code. Instead of serving as a middleman connecting buyers and sellers, these decentralized exchanges connect people directly using the code, also known as a smart contract.But according to Cohen, the individuals behind that code remain responsible. It's notable that the SEC's charges yesterday were not against the exchange but the individual, Zachary Coburn, founder of the unlicensed decentralized EtherDelta token exchange. The exchange, which is still operational in spite of the fact that, according to the SEC, Coburn is being cooperative, has already helped users execute 3.6 million orders and took its most recent order at 3:07 pm ET on Friday, November 9.In total, Coburn agreed to pay a $300,000 disgorgement, $13,000 in prejudgment interest and a $75,000 penalty, though he didn’t admit to or deny the SEC findings. In its official statement, the SEC described Coburn as “cooperative."" Importantly, “almost all” of the trades conducted on the platform occurred after July 25, 2017, when the SEC published its conclusions on the seminal DAO investigation.Similar to EtherDelta, The DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, was an elaborate collection of smart contracts executed on the ethereum blockchain. When the code in the smart contracts was made to execute in a way unintended by the original developers, $60 million was siphoned off into an unknown third-party’s account.While the SEC didn't fine The DAO's creators, it did create the cyber unit that is investigating EtherDelta. The cyber unit filed its first charges against a blockchain company in December 2017, for matters related to the issuance of an ICO. Then, in September 2018, charges were filed against a crypto-asset fund manager and a crypto broker-dealer. But yesterday’s charges were the first against a crypto exchange and show the agency is escalating its efforts.Since the catastrophic failure of The DAO, which so deeply split ethereum users that it resulted in the creation of an entirely new cryptocurrency called Ethereum Classic, the decentralized exchange business has become increasingly refined and streamlined.In May 2018 licensed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase purchased Paradex, a decentralized exchange powered by 0x, a platform designed to streamline the creation of cryptocurrency exchanges without a single point of failure. In August 2017 0x raised $24 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) in which the public was able to purchase tokens used by the exchange.Since then, a number of other decentralized exchanges have launched on the 0x platform, the most prominent of which is Radar Relay, which raised $10 million in traditional venture capital from Blockchain Capital and others. Similarly, decentralized asset manager Melonport is building an autonomous system scheduled to be fully deployed in February 2019.While Cohen’s comments make it clear the SEC intends to assure that exchanges doing business in the United States are compliant, what is less clear is how the regulator might handle decentralized exchanges with less cooperative or anonymous creators. By their very nature, blockchain-based exchanges are nearly impossible to shut down. While online access to centralized servers can be revoked, a new wave of decentralized servers, domain providers and more are becoming increasingly popular. Soon, even traditional means of enforcement could become more difficult. "

blockchain
 solutions (including most cryptocurrencies) may be descending into a quagmire of get-rich-quick schemes, scams, and organized crime activity, but blockchain as a whole is not dead yet.","What remains above the waterline: a quieter hotbed of innovation we call ‘enterprise blockchain.’ As opposed to their problematic crypto cousins, enterprise blockchain solutions are largely permissioned and centralized – thus potentially making them safe for corporate use.These two trends are so different, in fact, that we shouldn’t lump them together under any moniker, let alone one as overhyped as ‘blockchain.’And yet, the differences aren’t quite in the night-and-day category. Even though enterprise blockchain has an unquestionable business focus, it is still too early to tell which enterprise blockchain approaches will become viable long-term.Blockchain: not as much to it as you thoughtProtocols, Mechanisms, and Architectures: You Pays Your Money, You Takes Your ChancesPeople like to compare today’s emergence of blockchain to the early days of the commercial Internet. However, this is a poor comparison, as the Internet’s early success depended on broad acceptance of basic protocols like TCP/IP, and for the Web, HTTP and HTML.Blockchain has no such acceptance. Not only are there no meaningful protocol standards in the works, but there isn’t even any agreement on the best mechanisms for making blockchain work at all.Consensus mechanisms are the best example of this problem. Bitcoin uses the ‘proof of work’ mechanism which enables the transaction processing nodes (aka ‘miners’) to battle for a reward – but ends up consuming impractically vast quantities of electricity.In response, enterprise blockchain innovators have developed numerous alternative consensus mechanisms, each with its own strengths and weaknesses – and generally, none are interoperable with any of the others.The Confusion over DecentralizationAsk your average crypto fanatic what makes their coin of choice so revolutionary, and they are likely to tout crypto’s decentralization. What they are referring to is the lack of a centralized decision-making authority. In essence, with any decentralized blockchain-based solution, no one is in control.With centralized, permissioned blockchain, in contrast, some company or consortium of companies controls who gets to process transactions, what rules they have to follow, and also establishes some way of coming to an agreement on any changes to the blockchain technology itself.Decentralized, however, is different from distributed. The notion of distributed applies to architectures, not decision-making policies. In fact, distributed architectures have been with us since the 1990s, as they were essential for building highly scalable Web sites like 
 
eBay
 and Yahoo! back in the day. Today, all cloud architectures are inherently distributed.When you boil blockchain down to its basics, you end up with a secure distributed ledger – that is, a database with multiple nodes in different places, with a secure mechanism to ensure all the nodes are sufficiently in agreement with each other. Decentralization, in fact, isn’t part of the blockchain equation at all.Distributed Ledgers in ActionSuch distributed ledgers are, in fact, hardly revolutionary. They are a useful innovation for handling a certain class of multiparty transactions – and such transactions are generally the focus of today’s emerging blockchain solutions.I’ve covered a few enterprise blockchain startups with novel approaches to multiparty transactions before. Gospel Technology, for example, provides exceptionally granular security for data in such transactions (featured in this article).Boardwalktech emphasizes granular transaction chaining, keeping track of each field in a complex transaction. And Interbit from BTL treats individual blockchains as virtual machines and is thus able to spawn vast numbers of ephemeral blockchains to keep track of individual transactions (the latter two featured in this article).Some distributed ledgers coming to market may not even be blockchains, as they don’t chain blocks (not that such a distinction really matters). One example: Corda from R3, which only shares transaction data among the nodes participating in a transaction. R3 is also following an open source strategy, offering a free alternative and a paid, enterprise version that adds additional capabilities like enterprise database support, better security, and higher availability.Incumbent software vendors are getting into the game as well. 
 
IBM
 has been heavily investing in Hyperledger, an open source permissioned blockchain initiative out of the Linux Foundation. For IBM, blockchain is more of a professional services play than a product offering, consistent with its long-term enterprise strategy.Nevertheless, IBM deserves kudos for innovating ahead of clear market demand. “We didn't start with a big bang,” says Marie Wieck, the general manager of IBM Blockchain. “We had to create something new, so we started experimenting and doing some customer pilots, and we saw there was enough interest to move forward.”

SAP
 is also following in IBM’s footsteps with the launch of the SAP Cloud Platform Blockchain. This ‘blockchain-as-a-service’ offering focuses on Internet of Things, manufacturing, and supply chain solutions, and leverages Hyperledger as well as MultiChain, another open source blockchain effort that focuses on private chains, much as Corda does.The Token PitfallIBM is also rolling out its new Blockchain World Wire (BWW) cross-border payment network, looking to facilitate international payment settlements that use multiple currencies.As many permissionless blockchain international payment processing wannabes have discovered, one of the primary challenges of an international payments business model is representing the value of the transaction in terms of a cryptocurrency or other cryptotoken.There are, in fact, many problems with such tokens. In addition to the crime-related shortcomings of cryptocurrencies, tokens that blockchain businesses issue themselves have their own drawbacks as well. In general, the value of such tokens is merely speculative.Since initial coin offering (ICO) speculators as well as founders of ICO-funded startups end up possessing large numbers of such tokens, it is unlikely their market value will ever rise to the point of fostering a working token economy, where buyers and sellers of such tokens drive an equilibrium in the market separate from speculative interest in the tokens.BWW isn’t making this mistake. In the case of BWW, IBM is working with Stellar, a payment technology originally built upon the 
 
Ripple
 protocol. Ripple is yet another permissioned blockchain play, in this case focused on international financial transactions. However, while Ripple’s tokens’ market value is subject to the whims of speculators, the Stellar tokens supporting BWW are ‘stablecoins,’ that is, tokens with a fixed fiat value.Stablecoins address the problem of speculators and founders dumping their tokens to depress a token economy, but they are really little more than stand-ins for fiat currencies – and we’ve been dealing with stand-ins for fiat since the first bank issued its own notes.On the other hand, there are enterprise blockchain platform providers that offer tokens on the open market. SophiaTX from Equidato provides a platform for building third-party blockchain solutions with a particular strength in enterprise integration, and DECENT offers a similar platform, with tokens intended to foster an ecosystem of third-party solutions on the platform, thus building an economy providing token value beyond what a single service provider could accomplish on its own – at least in theory.The challenge both SophiaTX and DECENT have, however, is that speculative interest drives the value of their respective tokens. Such interest puts money in their pockets via ICOs to be sure, but now presents an impediment to long-term token economy success that neither vendor knows how to resolve.Enterprise Blockchain’s Long-Term ProspectsThis article only scratches the surface of today’s enterprise blockchain initiatives – but it hopefully indicates the diversity of such efforts in terms of their technical approaches as well as their business models.Such diversity, however, cuts both ways. The wild west-style explosion of mechanisms and architectures only shows the level of overall immaturity in the space. We can expect to see a consolidation to a small handful of such technical approaches, once the market figures out which ones work and which ones do not.In terms of business models, furthermore, the diversity is perhaps smaller than the hype around blockchain might suggest.True, coming up with better ways of handling complex multiparty transactions is bound to lead to a vibrant market category over time. But that single market category appears to be the full extent of blockchain’s true business value.Blockchain fanatics around the world refuse to believe it, but the long-term opportunity for blockchain falls well short of Internet-level disruption that would indicate that this technology is anything close to revolutionary.This article was updated to clarify that Stellar was originally built upon the Ripple protocol.Intellyx publishes the Agile Digital Transformation Roadmap poster, advises companies on their digital transformation initiatives, and helps vendors communicate their agility stories.

[+] off, said family workplace support consultant Vick Salemi. She added preparation is also vital when caregivers get ready to re-enter the job market to explain to potential employers the gaps in their resumes. Photo credit: Getty","Caregivers should carefully prepare what to say to their bosses and potential employers, Vicki Salemi, an expert in family support in the workplace, urged today.When you are getting ready to tell your boss you need time off to care for a loved one, Salemi advised: “Practice on what you are going to say and what is authentic to you. You want to be upfront and transparent, (Caregiving) is a sensitive topic. It can trigger tears.”What you tell your boss, depends on your relationship, she said:“If it’s toxic, less is better. If the relationship is good, you can talk more.”In either case, you don’t need to go into the type of illness of the person you are caring for and the length, she said.The good news for caregivers who are also employed is many companies are friendly today in supporting their workers as whole persons, Salemi said.In looking for work after completing a caregiving stint, she stressed you will be asked about the gap on your resume.She recommended preparing a quick response, one sentence and then pivot into what you want to do.“Have it ready so you won’t be caught off guard,” said Salemi.She said keeping the time you spend telling about caregiving in a job interview brief is also important because caregiving memories can trigger emotions.In another tip for employed or self-employed caregivers, she urged setting up a niche in your home that is strictly devoted to the job leaving the rest of your house or apartment for the rest of your activities.“This is my (job) corner, even though it is in your bedroom,” Salemi explained.She said that corner can also be made more job-focused by wearing work clothes when you sit there and having things on the wall that make you feel work-focused.To keep the job strictly in that location, Salemi advised against bringing your laptop into other areas of your home.When you are on your regular job, she stressed taking breaks to relieve stress.“Self-care is as important as your care for the person you are caring for,” Salemi said.Her remarks came at Caregiving.com’s third national caregiving conference in Chicago. "

much higher volatility than the stock market, as measured by the S&P ...","Oct 31, 2018,04:47pm EDT",Investing vs. Speculating: Why Knowing the Difference Is Key,"As the stock market bull potentially nears the end of its run and we head into the last two months of 2018, many investors are making adjustments to their portfolios. Over the course of my travels and in conversations with other industry experts, I’m constantly reminded the importance of:  1) understanding the difference between investing and speculating, and 2) understanding risk tolerance.These are two primary points for any investor seeking to make sound decisions with their money to understand.All definitions vary slightly, but most are along the same lines. An investment is an asset or item acquired with the goal of generating income or appreciation in the future. Speculation is a financial transaction that has substantial risk of losing all value, but with the expectation of a significant gain.Notice how the definition for investment doesn’t include the word “risk.” Of course, every investment carries some level of risk; however, the potential of losing the entire principal investment amount is largely what differentiates investing from speculating. Other factors to consider include time horizon, decision criteria and investor attitude.Examples of well-known and popular investments include the stock market, bonds, U.S. Treasuries and mutual funds. Assets that fall into speculative territory include options, futures, foreign currencies, startup companies and cryptocurrencies.Investment vs SpeculationTake cryptocurrencies, for example. These digital coins, such as bitcoin and ethereum, surged in popularity late last year and are known for having high volatility, or price swings. Many consider cryptos as speculative assets due to their relatively short existence in the financial world, absence of sound regulation and the many unknowns surrounding trading patterns.What about the lottery? The Mega Millions made headlines last week for ballooning to the second highest jackpot ever, after failing to find a winner in the 25 drawings since July. Approximately 15.7 million people bought tickets for a one in 303 million chance of selecting the right six numbers, and just one lucky person in South Carolina won the $1.54 billion prize. Is buying a ticket speculating? Or is it perhaps gambling?I believe it all comes back to the level of risk.Standard deviation, or sigma, is a probability tool that gauges a security’s volatility. Specifically, it measures the typical fluctuation of a security around its mean or average return over a period of time. I often refer to this as an asset’s “DNA of Volatility.”Standard Deviation For One Year as of 09/30/18Take a look at this table comparing an array of assets. Two of the most popular cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and ethereum, both have much higher volatility than the stock market, as measured by the S&P 500. On the other hand, gold bullion is only slightly more volatile than the S&P 500, and has actually outperformed the market since 2000.At U.S. Global Investors we advocate investing in gold and gold equities due to its diversification potential. The yellow metal’s DNA of volatility is similar to that of the stock market, and as such we recommend allocating up to 10 percent of your portfolio in the space – we call this the Golden Rule.Every security has a different sigma for a specific period of time, and as such your expectations as an investor should reflect these differences. An abnormally high sigma, such as those for many cryptos, can signal whether an asset falls into the investment or speculation category.It’s no mystery that the investment portfolios of a 35 year old and a 65 year old should look noticeably different. As I’ve written about before, as a person gets older they should have a higher percentage of their money in bonds, for example, assuming their objective at that age is to protect the money they currently have saved for retirement and provide income. Investing in municipal bonds can be a good way to provide tax-free income for investors as they get older and move away from the stock market. A young person’s investment objectives differ significantly because they have a longer time horizon, particularly when it comes to recovering from any losses.Meet Your Financial Golds With a Well-Balanced PortfolioHighly speculative investments can indeed hold a place in some investors’ portfolios, but this should be based on their risk tolerance and goals. Depending on how much volatility you can comfortably withstand, it is prudent to adjust your portfolio accordingly when it comes to speculative investments.Many Americans haven’t been participating in the stock market bull run and using it to grow their savings. Saving should be a key goal for all, but so too should be growing wealth. Simply stashing away earnings in a savings account won’t protect against the destructive power of inflation, which is where investing and speculating come into play.Even during increasingly volatile times with many asset classes, investors can still seek returns. We believe one way to potentially take advantage of the recent market turbulence is through active management, rather than passively managed index funds.All opinions expressed and data provided are subject to change without notice. Some of these opinions may not be appropriate to every investor. The S&P 500 Stock Index is a widely recognized capitalization-weighted index of 500 common stock prices in U.S. companies. Diversification does not protect an investor from market risks and does not assure a profit. Standard deviation, or sigma, is a measure of the dispersion of a set of data from its mean. The more spread apart the data, the higher the deviation. Standard deviation is also known as historical volatility.

rules, and Section 475 MTM elections do not apply. The SEC recently ...","Nov 1, 2018,10:14am EDT",Shutterstock,"While the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act did not change trader tax status, Section 475 MTM, wash-sale loss rules on securities, and more, there is still plenty to consider.To Get The Most Out Of Tax Reform, Traders Need To Act Fast covered critical moves to make before the calendar year expires. But that’s just the tip of the hat. Read on for more action items to initiate sooner, rather than later.Wash sales: Securities traders must comply with wash-sale loss rules, but the IRS makes it difficult by applying different standards for taxpayers vs. brokers on tax reports and Form 1099-Bs. Taxpayers must report wash sales on substantially identical positions across all accounts, whereas brokers report only identical positions per account. Active securities traders should use a trade accounting program or service to identify potential wash sale loss problems going into year-end. In taxable accounts, break the chain by selling the position before year-end and not repurchasing a substantially identical position 30 days before or after in any of your taxable or IRA accounts. Avoid wash sales between taxable and IRA accounts throughout the year, as that is otherwise a permanent wash sale loss. (Starting a new entity effective Jan. 1, 2019, can break the chain on individual account wash sales at year-end 2018 provided you don’t purposely avoid wash sales with the related party entity.) Read strategies to avoid wash sale losses. Wash sales only apply to securities; not Section 1256 contracts, cryptocurrencies as intangible property, and volatility ETNs structured as prepaid forward contracts.Wash sale losses might be preferable to capital loss carryovers at year-end 2018 for TTS traders. A Section 475 election in 2019 converts year-end 2018 wash sale losses on TTS positions (not investment positions) into ordinary losses in 2019. That’s better than a capital loss carryover into 2019, which might then give you pause to making a Section 475 election. You want a clean slate with no remaining capital losses before electing Section 475 ordinary income and loss. (Learn more about wash sales and capital loss limitations in a video on our Website.)Trader tax status: If you qualify for TTS (business expense treatment — no election needed) in 2018, accelerate trading expenses into that qualification period as a sole proprietor or entity. If you don’t qualify until 2019, try to defer trading expenses until then. You may also capitalize and amortize (expense) Section 195 startup costs and Section 248 organization costs in the new TTS business, going back six months before commencement. TTS is a prerequisite for electing and using Section 475 MTM. (Learn more about trader tax status in a video on our Website.)Section 475 MTM: TTS traders choose Section 475 on securities for exemption from wash-sale rules and the $3,000 capital loss limitation — and to receive the new 20% QBI deduction. Existing individual taxpayers had to elect Section 475 by April 17, 2018, for 2018 (March 15 for existing S-Corps and partnerships). They need to complete the election process by filing a 2018 Form 3115 with their 2018 tax return. If you missed the 2018 election deadline, then consider the election for 2019. Capital loss carryovers are a concern.Trading entities: A “new taxpayer” entity can elect Section 475 within 75 days of inception. But it’s getting late to form a new trading entity by the middle of November, and still qualify for TTS in that short period before year-end. Elect 475 once, and it applies in subsequent years in which you are eligible for TTS unless you revoke the election. (Learn more about Section 475 in a video on our Website.)Net operating losses: Section 475 ordinary losses and TTS business expenses contribute to net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards, which are limited to 80% of taxable income in the subsequent year(s). TCJA repealed two-year NOL carrybacks, except for farmers. For some traders, this is the worst change in TCJA as traders have counted on quick NOL carryback refunds to replenish their trading accounts and remain in business. Get immediate use of NOLs with a Roth IRA conversion before year-end and other income acceleration strategies.Excess business losses: TCJA introduced an “excess business loss” (EBL) limitation of $500,000/$250,000 (married/other taxpayers), per tax year. Aggregate EBL from all pass-through businesses: A profitable company can offset another business with losses to remain under the limit. EBL is an NOL carryforward. For example, if a single TTS/475 trader has an ordinary loss of $300,000, his EBL is $50,000, and it’s an NOL carryforward.2018 S-Corp: TTS traders use an S-Corp trading company to arrange health insurance and retirement plan deductions. The S-Corp must execute officer compensation, in conjunction with these employee benefit deductions, through formal payroll tax compliance before year-end. Otherwise, you will miss the boat. TTS is an absolute must since an S-Corp investment company cannot have tax-deductible wages, health insurance, and retirement plan deductions. This S-Corp is not required to have “reasonable compensation” as other types of businesses are, so a TTS trader may determine officer compensation based on how much to reimburse for health insurance, and how much they want to contribute to a retirement plan. Some use a dual-entity solution: An LLC/partnership trading company, and a management company, organized as a C-Corp, or S-Corp. In that case, the management company executes year-end payroll and these employee benefits. (C-Corps can have other types of employee benefits, too.)TTS traders organized as a sole proprietorship (an unincorporated business), cannot have health insurance and retirement plan deductions because they don’t have self-employment income (SEI) from trading income. A TTS Schedule C does not have a net income, and the IRS does not permit a TTS sole proprietor to pay officer compensation (wages) to themselves as owners. A TTS partnership faces obstacles in attempting to arrange health insurance and retirement plan deductions because the partnership passes through expenses for reducing SEI, whereas, an S-Corp does not pass through expenses or losses for SEI — that’s why the S-Corp works for traders.An S-Corp formed later in the year can unlock a retirement plan deduction for an entire year by paying sufficient officer compensation in December when results for the year are evident. The S-Corp may only deduct health insurance for the months the entity was operational and qualified for TTS.Another reason to create officer compensation is to increase the 20% QBI deduction if you are in the phase-out range subject to the 50% wage limitation. (See my other blog posts and Webinars on year-end planning for TTS S-Corps to execute health insurance, make retirement plan contributions, and generate a QBI deduction.)2019 S-Corp: If you missed out on employee benefits in 2018, then consider an LLC/S-Corp for 2019. Starting 2019 with trading in the new S-Corp is beneficial. That breaks the chain on wash sales with your individual account at year-end 2018. If you start later, you will have tax compliance for your individual return and S-Corp return in dealing with broker 1099Bs and more.If you wait to start your entity formation process on Jan. 1, 2019, you won’t be ready to trade in an entity account on Jan. 2, 2019. Instead, you can form a single-member LLC by mid-December 2018, obtain the employee identification number (EIN) at irs.gov, and open the entity brokerage account before year-end. If desired, add your spouse as a member of the LLC on Jan. 1, 2019, which means the LLC will file a partnership return. If you want health insurance and retirement plan deductions, then your LLC should submit an S-Corp election for 2019 by March 15. The S-Corp should also consider making a Section 475 MTM election on securities only for 2019 by March 15.Solo 401(k): A Solo 401(k) retirement plan for a TTS S-Corp must be established (opened) with a financial intermediary before year-end. Plan to pay (or fund) the 2018 elective deferral amount up to a maximum $18,500 (or $24,500 if age 50 or older) executed with December payroll by Jan. 31, 2019. Plan to pay (fund) the 25% profit-sharing plan (PSP) portion of the S-Corp Solo 401(k) up to a maximum of $36,500, by the due date of the 2018 S-Corp tax return, including extensions, which means Sept. 15, 2019. The maximum PSP contribution requires wages of $146,000 ($36,500 divided by 25% defined contribution rate.) A SEP IRA is less attractive; it doesn’t have a 100%-deductible elective deferral, which means a similar contribution requires more compensation that is subject to Medicare taxes.Cryptocurrencies: Report realized capital gains and losses for all sales of cryptocurrencies. The IRS classifies cryptocurrencies as intangible property. Include crypto-to-altcoin sales, crypto-to-currency sales, hard forks if you have control and there is a fair market value and purchases of items using crypto. Many crypto traders inappropriately deferred 2017 income on crypto-to-altcoin sales claiming Section 1031 like-kind deferral treatment. TCJA restricted Section 1031 usage to real property only starting in 2018. Bitcoin, Ethereum and other crypto are not securities so wash sale loss rules, and Section 475 MTM elections do not apply. The SEC recently stated that some ICOs and tokens are securities, but not Bitcoin and Ethereum. The IRS has not changed its designation as intangible property, and I expect updated crypto tax guidance from the IRS soon. (See the cryptocurrencies section of our Website.)Fill in the gaps in tax bracketsIf you own an investment portfolio, you have the opportunity to reduce capital gains taxes via “tax loss selling.” You may wish to sell winning positions to accelerate income, perhaps to use up a capital loss carryover or an NOL. TTS traders want a “clean slate” — meaning no capital loss carryovers — so they can make a Section 475 election in the subsequent tax year.If you are in the lowest two “ordinary” tax brackets for 2018 (10% or 12%), try to take advantage of the 0% long-term capital gains rate. The 12% ordinary income bracket applies on taxable income up to $37,800/$77,400 (single/married). For example, if your single taxable income is $30,000, you can realize $7,500 of long-term capital gains with zero federal tax.If you realized significant short-term capital gains year-to-date in 2018 and had open positions with substantial unrealized capital losses, you should consider selling (realizing) some of those losses to reduce 2018 capital gains taxes. Don’t repurchase the losing position 30 days before or after, as that would negate the tax loss with wash-sale-loss rules.The IRS has rules to prevent deferral of income and acceleration of losses in offsetting positions that lack sufficient economic risk. These rules include straddles, the constructive sale rule, and shorting against the box. Also, be aware of “constructive receipt of income” — you cannot receive payment for services, turn your back on that income, and defer it to the next tax year. (See Some Proprietary Traders Under-Report Income.)Tax-loss selling is inefficient for short-term positions that reduce long-term capital gains. It’s also a moot point with Section 1256 and Section 475 positions since they are mark-to-market (MTM) positions reporting realized and unrealized gains and losses.Taxpayers should review tax brackets, Social Security and retirement contribution limits, standard deductions, and more. See Tax Rates, other tax charts, and analysis of TCJA at Tax Foundation. There are differences in filing status.We recommend discussing year-end planning with your tax adviser by early December.

million customers to send money to Africa using the Bitcoin Blockchain.","Nov 12, 2018,09:00am EST","One of the top three insurers in Japan, Sompo Holdings, Inc. has announced a business alliance with the leading digital foreign exchange platform and treasury solution based in Africa, BitPesa. This collaboration will allow Sompo to leverage BitPesa’s blockchain services to revolutionize the way businesses and individuals make financial transfers across borders. Both firms intend to help increase global trade and promote the digitization of international financial services.","As Sompo Holdings transitions into an era in which people, goods, data, and services move actively across national borders, international remittance and cross-border payments are playing an increasingly pivotal role in supporting these activities financially. However, expensive international remittance fees and lengthy processing times are serious challenges facing the market today. Resolving these obstacles and simplifying cross-border payments is expected to facilitate global trade and contribute to macroeconomic development.BitPesa leverages blockchain settlement to significantly lower the cost and increase the speed of business payments to and from frontier markets, including international remittances across Africa and Europe. As BitPesa continues to open corridors for business payments and trade between frontier markets and the rest of the world, Sompo Holdings recognized a great opportunity in forming a business alliance with BitPesa.We are very excited about our partnership with BitPesa. Initially, I did not think that our paths would ever cross. However, as I gain a deeper understanding of the cross-border money transfer environment, especially in Africa, I see how BitPesa’s mission will completely revolutionize this industry. We are looking forward to tackling this challenge together with BitPesa, Takehiko Eguchi, General Manager of Sompo Digital Ventures and Sompo Holdings, told me.""While Sompo Holdings is currently engaged in efforts to resolve social issues by developing businesses that contribute to security, health, and wellbeing, the Japanese insurance giant was particularly impressed with BitPesa’s positioning with deep infrastructure across the continent to develop and distribute financial products. BitPesa, which is rapidly scaling across a number of markets, including the entire African continent, Europe, and the Middle East, is expanding its customer base and service coverage. Together, Sompo Holdings and BitPesa believe that using virtual currencies will make it possible to resolve the problems of expensive exchange fees, while reducing long processing times.We focus on giving our customers the ability to transact between currencies. Now, we are welcoming other partners from around the world who want access to these markets. Sompo Holdings is one of the largest Japanese insurance companies and they are looking for new markets and new opportunities. We can give them immediate access to these markets. For all the financial services they offer, we can provide all the cross currency transactions to remove any currency risk, Elizabeth Rossiello, CEO and Founder of BitPesa told me.In addition to a newly formed alliance, Sompo Holdings has also announced an investment in BitPesa. According to Rossiello, BitPesa will be using the investment from Sompo to deepen the firms infrastructure and roots within Africa and the Middle East. While the venture-backed firm has already raised $10 million from Greycroft Partners and others, having Sompo Holdings as a shareholder allows BitPesa to gain international credibility, geographical presence and customer reach.“Any kind of transaction value for us is exciting because we have access and liquidity to all of these currencies and markets. Our number one goal is to increase liquidity in frontier market currency. It’s exciting for us If we can bring in partners that will eventually bring in flows for new currencies,” Rossiello said.Together, Sompo Holdings and BitPesa will work to manifest a society in which goods and value can move back and forth frequently around the globe by harnessing virtual currency through a cost-effective and efficient digital platform. Ultimately, the firms plan to revolutionize the way businesses and individuals make financial transfers across borders.Prior to Sompo Holding’s alliance with BitPesa, the firm announced a partnership with the Japanese money transfer giant, SBI Remit, to allow nearly half a million customers to send money to Africa using the Bitcoin Blockchain. Rather than relying on banks to move yen into U.S. dollars or euros and then into African currencies, BitPesa does this for SBI Remit using blockchain settlement services. The firm is also capable of settling remittances in as little as one hour. However, according to Rossiello, the alliance with Sompo Holdings is less about remittance and more about financial transactions.“While we did something similar with SBI Remit, our alliance with Sompo is less about sending money to other people, and more about financial transactions and services and supply flows. SBI Remit focuses on small businesses and person-to-person transfers, while Sompo is disrupting financial services,” Rossiello explained."

[+] account assets, a Washington think tank is warning, Photo credit: Getty","Retirement is in peril for most working-class Americans cautions a new report by the National Institute on Retirement Security, a Washington think tank.“The American dream of a modest retirement after a lifetime of work now is a middle-class nightmare,” warns the study’s author, NIRS Executive Director Diane Oakley.The report contends nearly four out of five working Americans are falling short of conservative retirement savings targets.Roughly the same number have less than one year’s income saved in retirement accounts, according to the study.That “less than one year” is actually nothing for close to three out of five workers.“57 percent (more than 100 million) of working age individuals do not own any retirement account assets in an employer-sponsored 401(k)-type plan, individual account or pension,” the think tank emphasizes.Oakley says causes of the retirement savings shortfalls include fewer workers having stable and secure pensions and the replacement of workplace pensions with 401(k)-style defined contribution accounts which provide less savings and protection.The report claims total retirement savings are still suffering from aftershocks of the Recession.“The economic downturn triggered a decline in total contributions to defined contribution retirement accounts as many employers stopped matching employee contributions for a time pushing total contributions below 2008 levels,” the report explains.In the alert, NIRS says while the typical American needs 85 percent of their working income to maintain their standard of living in retirement, Social Security provides only 35 percent.“This leaves a retirement income gap equal to 50 percent of pre-retirement earnings that must be filled through other means,” the study points out.To help fill the retirement savings gap, the retirement security think tank says Social Security should be strengthened and access should be expanded to low-cost, high-quality defined contribution plans, defined benefit pensions and hybrid plans.To expand access to pensions, the group is urging Congress to lure more employers into offering them by making required contributions more predictable.In another federal measure that could help reduce the savings gap, NIRS says tax credits should be improved to help low and moderate income workers save for retirement.To see the full study, click on: https://bit.ly/2xr0So3 ."

Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg,"IRS criminal prosecutions for identity theft have plummeted by more than a half in a year.Prosecutions dropped to 217 in Fiscal 2018 from 484 the year before and from 649 two years ago , according to a new IRS report released today.“We have made a conscious effort to reduce our investigative time on identity theft,” IRS Criminal Investigations Deputy Chief Eric Hylton said in the study.Hylton said his unit has reduced ID theft to 10 percent of its investigative time from a high-water mark of 18 percent. He added the 8 percent has gone over to traditional tax work.Looking at the way ID thieves operate, the report said: “In just a couple of years, we have seen identity theft morph from an unsophisticated street level crime to sophisticated international organized crime operations.""The incarceration rate for identity thieves who have been criminally charged has stayed relatively stable with 86 percent in 2018 and 88 percent in 2017 and 2016.Tax ID theft usually occurs when an identity thief uses a legitimate taxpayer’s identity to file a fraudulent tax return and claim a refund, the IRS explained.“Generally, the identity thief will use a stolen Social Security Numbers and other personally identifiable information (PII) to file a fraudulent tax return and attempt to get a refund early in the filing season before the legitimate taxpayer, files their tax return,” the report said.Despite the decline in prosecutions, the IRS continues to send out alerts to taxpayers and tax return preparers to be on the look out for tax ID theft. "

of data, which they held ransom for $6 million worth of Bitcoin.","Nov 8, 2018,08:30am EST",Getty,"Piracy is the main concern plaguing the digital distribution of media and entertainment. With consumer video-based traffic representing more than 80% of total internet traffic by 2021, online video piracy has skyrocketed. The film and television industry estimates nearly $52 billion in lost revenues by the year 2022, up from $31.8 billion in 2017, with the U.S. sustaining anticipated losses of $11.6 billion.Content creators are searching for ways to maintain control and ownership of video assets, while safely maximizing customer reach and monetizing the content effectively. However, the management and control of conditional access to video is complex. The farther a video gets from the content owner, the harder it becomes to enforce the copyright.This was illustrated last year, with the season seven premiere of Game of Thrones being illegally downloaded and streamed more than 90 million times within three days of it airing.So what are content creators doing to combat content piracy today? Where does the system fall down? And why might blockchain hold the answer?Keeping The Pirates At BayWorldwide, the media and entertainment industry have threatened legal action as one way to crack down on piracy.In 2017, six studios (including Twentieth Century Fox and Disney Enterprises) filed proceedings against nine Irish internet service providers in an attempt to stop illegal downloading of copyrighted work. If the claims of the plaintiffs are accurate, digital piracy cost the Irish economy a staggering 500 jobs and €320 million in lost revenue during 2015 alone.Not only is legal action retrospective, taking place after much of the damage is done, it’s often expensive and ineffective.The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) tried to sue more than 20,000 people for sharing music files online. It reportedly spent $64 million pursuing these individuals and won just $1.36 million from its claims. This financial loss, and the negative press generated from trying to sue children and the deceased, led the RIAA to drop its claims.Media and entertainment groups have also explored advertising campaigns to educate the public about the true cost of video piracy. The U.K. film and television industry launched “You Make the Movies” in 2010, a series of spoof scenes from movie classics including Reservoir Dogs, which aimed to educate viewers that illegal downloading prevented more good films from being made.Content creators can also take immediate anti-piracy action by using video protection technologies such as digital watermarking. But this tactic is no failsafe for preventing piracy. Rather, it enables content producers and rights holders to track unlawful distribution after the fact.The Limitations Of Today’s Video Protection TechnologiesMost digital content today is tagged and tracked via archaic anti-copyright infringement technology, including watermarking as well as CAP coding (a distinguishing pattern of dots added during post-production, used as a forensic identifier to pinpoint the source of illegal copies). But it is not well protected.The protection such technologies offer does not thwart film copying, sharing and other forms of content piracy, because there are many ways to circumvent them, including file compression, cropping, color variations and erasure of logos using content editing software. A simple Google search will uncover a variety of apps that have been developed specifically to remove digital watermarks.Visual markers merely allow copies to be traced back to the original piece of content once it’s already been pirated. And that’s too little too late.HBO found this out firsthand last summer when a hacker stole 1.5 terabytes of data, which they held ransom for $6 million worth of Bitcoin. The hacker gradually released several unaired programs and scripts when he didn’t receive the payoff sought.Blockchain technology, however, may prove critical to the management and even protection of such video content.The Promise Of Blockchain For VideoThe fundamental promise of blockchain technology is that it protects digital assets more comprehensively than visual markers alone. It provides an additional barrier to infringement by implanting security safeguards within the content to control the duplication, sharing, transferring or selling of ownership, even over an untrusted network.For this reason, media and entertainment industry leaders are looking to blockchain to secure digital video content, build in payment gateways and find better ways to automate and systematize royalties.The roadblock to blockchain’s potential to prevent video piracy is file size. Traditional video files are simply too large and complex for blockchain. However, if the size of the digital files can be drastically reduced, blockchain could allow users to transfer videos securely, with all parties maintaining full visibility of the transfer. And virtualization technology may hold the answer.Shrinking The File Size To Make Video Blockchain An Anti-Piracy RealityVideo virtualization could enable secure blockchain video transactions because the files are a fraction of a percent of the size of today’s digital videos. This makes them ideally suited as digital assets to be recorded, transferred and managed by a blockchain.Blockchain technology could keep the video secured, only opening when both parties confirm the transfer was legitimate. This would eliminate any risk of pirates copying files and giving others illicit access.The Future Of Video’s Anti-Piracy TacticsTo date, there have been no full-scale implementations of end-to-end video blockchain protection. But video virtualization’s ability to package content into smaller data files could solve this last mile for blockchain.However, there are a number of companies already building blockchain solutions for video.Earlier this year, U.S. production house Two Roads Pictures Co. announced a Hollywood first — that its indie romantic comedy No Postage Necessary would be distributed via peer-to-peer video network app Vevue, which runs on the Qtum blockchain.So perhaps the solution isn’t to attack the pirates and point fingers, but to innovate in a way that blocks the looting from occurring in the first place."

Survey, 45% of participating executives cited trust as a limitation to ...","Sep 11, 2018,02:41pm EDT",Credit: Getty Royalty Free,"The emergence of cryptocurrencies as a new asset class has heightened expectations for the eventual transition of other financial assets on to the blockchain. Derivatives, security tokens, and non-fungible assets can all benefit from the transparency and trustless execution environment of distributed ledgers. However, some critical hurdles need to be overcome to foster further adoption of the technology. According to PwC’s 2018 Global Blockchain Survey, 45% of participating executives cited trust as a limitation to adoption. Additionally, cryptocurrency exchanges exist as third-party custodians in a market trend that runs contrary to the dynamic of centralized control. These exchanges largely live outside of the mainstream financial system, leading to the need for a trustless bridge between crypto assets and traditional financial assets. The global derivatives market is enormous. With a low-end estimate of the size of the market at $544 trillion (on a notional contract basis), the opportunity for decentralization and increased access for retail investors is profound. The derivatives market typically contains a very high barrier to entry for most retail investors. Options contracts and other derivatives traded on large exchanges and OTC markets are not directly accessible to retail investors and require them to go through third-party brokerages. As a result, investors usually end up paying high fees and are susceptible to fraud and general misconduct on the part of the broker. According to the CFTC’s position on its ban against FXCM in 2017: “In particular, FXCM misrepresented to retail customers that it was merely acting as an agent or intermediary between retail customers and market makers, and that it did not take positions opposite retail customers.”Clearly, removing intermediaries and providing more transparency throughout the process is a necessary improvement. An emerging trend within the financial sector is the notion of digitizing financial assets and placing on them on the blockchain, to facilitate transparency and trustless trading execution. Peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges can effectively remove middlemen and rent-seeking intermediaries from the trading of derivatives. Further, the automated performance of smart contracts on blockchains allows for more sophisticated platform functionality of P2P exchanges than their centralized counterparts. The result of trustless and automated trading environments is vastly increased access to the global derivatives market for retail investors. Decentralising the paradigm of investment in all kinds of derivatives including options, stocks, bonds, and commodities can fundamentally change the investment ecosystem. Immediate benefits include reduced trading fees, removal of custodianship, decreased hacking occurrences, and mitigating against broker manipulation. Despite the overall trend of cryptocurrencies towards decentralisation and the removal of intermediaries, most of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges today use a centralised custodial model. As smart contract pioneer Nick Szabo puts it: “Trusted third parties are security holes.”Decentralised, P2P exchanges have made headway in the field but still have some key hurdles to overcome including improving liquidity, trade matching, and advanced user features. Several decentralized, P2P exchanges and marketplaces have begun emerging in offering financial assets with blockchains as the underlying settlement layer. Most decentralized exchanges (DEXs) in the cryptocurrency space today focus on atomic swaps and exchanging ERC-20 tokens. However, there are some innovative platforms tackling the connection between financial assets and blockchain tech. StellarX is actually more of a front-end UI than an actual exchange because it leverages the underlying Stellar blockchain. The Stellar blockchain effectively functions as a DEX and universal order book itself, with StellarX providing the intuitive interface to plug into its marketplace.Users of StellarX can exchange crypto, fiat tethers, stocks, bonds, commodities and more. Notably, there are no trading fees and transaction settlement is instant. Importantly, StellarX is a non-custodial interface for accessing the Stellar blockchain and does not hold user coins or assets. LXDX is an institutional-grade exchange for digital currencies. Their emphasis is on speed, reliability and increased liquidity for the markets by using proven institutional exchange architecture designs. As part of their model, LXDX is building a high-throughput exchange predicated on supporting a new wave of digital assets, including tokenized securities and non-fungible assets. LXDX is also a P2P non-custodial exchange. Level01 is a P2P trading platform designed to provide users with a non-custodial and AI analytics-driven exchange for the burgeoning derivatives market.As a decentralised platform, they substantially reduce the barriers to entry for retail investors to derivatives markets with traditional frictions between user-experience and exchanges stripped away. Notably, the market data feed is provided by Thomson Reuters.The migration of traditional financial assets to the blockchain is looming. The transparency, automated execution, and trustless nature of distributed ledgers and their accompanying smart contracts have considerable potential to redefine derivatives markets.That said, we need to see them actually meeting demand in a secure, scalable and ""liquid"" manner. "

fees for tax advice or tax preparation - even if made in candyâ€”could be ...","Nov 1, 2018,10:04am EDT",Different candy,"Only two of my kids went trick-or-treating this year. You’d think this would mean that the house would look a little neater than usual post-Halloween. You’d be wrong: Candy is still everywhere. It’s a challenge to figure out what to do with all of the loot—we can’t possibly eat it all. This dilemma inspired a post a few years back. It’s back again, updated to reflect changes under the new tax law. Here are 13 uses for leftover Halloween candy—complete with the tax consequences, of course:1. Give the really good stuff to your favorite tax pro just because.Nontax consequences: Everybody loves a gift, including tax geeks. Just be sure to pony up Reese’s peanut butter cups and Milky Way bars—don’t try to sneak in your butterscotch stragglers.Tax consequences: None. If you’re handing over the candy out of the kindness of your heart (or with “detached and disinterested generosity”) and not expecting anything in return, it’s a gift: gifts are not taxable for income tax purposes. And unless you make a habit of giving your tax pro gifts in excess of the annual gift tax exclusion ($15,000 for 2018)—which I am in no way discouraging—you’re fine when it comes to gift tax, too.2. Pay your tax professional in chocolate.Nontax consequences: Depending on costs, this could be a lot of candy. If your tax pro has a sweet tooth, he or she might appreciate some treats, otherwise they’ll probably insist on payment in the way of cash, check, credit card or bitcoin.Tax consequences: It used to be the case that fees for tax advice or tax preparation - even if made in candy—could be deductible as a miscellaneous deduction subject to the 2% floor. That’s no longer the rule under tax reform. The deductions for tax-preparation expenses and other miscellaneous deductions that exceed 2% of your adjusted gross income (AGI) have been eliminated for the tax years 2018 through 2025.(You can see other changes to Schedule A here.)3. Pay your plumber or electrician in Snickers bars.Nontax consequences: See #2 above.Tax consequences: None. The cost of most personal services isn’t deductible for individual taxpayers.4. Take a bowl (or two) of candy to hand out to your colleagues.Nontax consequences: Your colleagues will thank you for making them happy. Also fat. But mostly happy.Tax consequences: Giving candy to your colleagues isn’t deductible. Even if they could be couched as ordinary and necessary in your line of work (and who doesn’t think that M&Ms are both ordinary and necessary?) unreimbursed employee expenses are no longer deductible. As noted above, deductions for miscellaneous expenses that exceed 2% of your AGI have been eliminated for the tax years 2018 through 2025.(You can find more on the elimination of the deduction, including what it means for home offices, here.)5. Keep a filled candy bowl at the office for your employees.Nontax consequences: Your employees will think you’re awesome, assuming that you give them the good stuff. Leave out a bowl of unrecognizable nougats and you'll have a whole group of folks posting nasty comments to Glassdoor.com before you can say butter brickle.Tax consequences: None. There's no out-of-pocket cost to the employer for candy that was gathered by trick or treaters, though candy purchased at a store to feed employees would be a business expense. Occasional snacks offered to employees at their workplace are de minimis and are not includable for tax purposes: the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) considers these items “so small as to make accounting for it unreasonable or impractical.” In fact, the Latin phrase de minimis translates roughly to “of little importance” – which means that the IRS clearly doesn’t know how I feel about Junior Mints. But if you were touting hand-rolled truffles a la Google, it could be considered a taxable benefit. Stick to what’s in the trick or treat bags.(For more on recent IRS guidance regarding meals and entertainment, click here.)6. Exchange your Whoppers for other stuff.Nontax consequences: If you use a program like Halloween Candy Buy Back, participating businesses will “buy” back your candy in exchange for cash, coupons, and other creative exchanges; businesses may then work with groups to send candy to our soldiers, children’s hospitals, homeless shelters or other deserving folks. That should give you a reason to smile.Tax consequences: Property held for personal use is considered a capital asset and you have to report any gain from a sale or exchange as a capital gain. Assuming that your candy is exchanged for an equivalent item, there should be no gain and no tax consequences. But what if you lose out by trading a stash of Reese’s cups for a gift certificate to a restaurant that you'll never patronize? You can't deduct losses from the sale of personal property (more on losses here). And don't get fooled into thinking you can take a charitable donation: you can only claim a charitable deduction for gifts made to a qualifying organization to the extent that you don’t receive something in return (more on quid pro quo here).7. Donate your candy to charity.Nontax consequences: Warm fuzzies. You did a good thing.Tax consequences: Assuming that you contribute to a qualified charitable organization (check with IRS using the new search tool if you’re not sure), you can deduct the value of the goods as an itemized deduction. Document your gift and get a receipt. There’s one more caveat: In addition to making sure that the organization actually wants your extra candy, if you’re donating property that’s not related to the charity’s exempt purpose, your donation may be limited. In other words, if you’re giving candy to an after-school program, you can be reasonably sure that the program will use the candy to accomplish its charitable purpose. But if you donate that same candy to an art museum, not so much. So, use common sense—and a little courtesy (ask first).8. Use candy as prizes for bingo and card games.Nontax consequences: Kids, including big ones, love bingo. We play at our house because it’s fun, it’s easy, and notwithstanding some tricky advice from the seniors in my hometown, it doesn’t require much skill.Tax consequences: Our family bingo games don’t have tax consequences because we play for peanuts—well, literally for peanut M&Ms, but you get the point. In general, bingo winnings are taxable to the winner as income on line 21 of your federal form 1040: It does not matter whether the winnings are in cash or property (though clearly if you eat the winnings, they’re pretty hard to trace, not that I’m suggesting you evade taxation by this method). And in case you’re wondering if your unorthodox method of play really qualifies as bingo, there is a tax statute for that: 26 C.F.R. § 1.513-5 in the Treasury Regulations. 9. Use candy for tips.Nontax consequences: I’m not suggesting that you not give the paperboy a cash tip. But why not hand over some yummy candy as well? It can’t be a bad thing to be known as the house on the block that gives out the best tips ever. But that means you have to give out the good stuff (giving out Necco wafers isn’t going to win you any kudos).Tax consequences: It depends on who you’re paying. You can’t deduct tips to the paperboy or the pizza delivery girl. However, to the extent that you’re tipping the babysitter or other employees, tips are taxable to them (and thus possibly deductible to you)—but see #10.10. Make gifts for the babysitter, maid, etc.Nontax consequences: Who doesn’t like getting a nice gift now and again? With a little ingenuity, you can fill a cute gift bag filled with candy. Voilà! Minimal cost and effort to let folks know they’re appreciated.Tax consequences: No matter what you want to call it (a thank you, a bonus, a perk), a gift made to an employee is considered compensation. There’s an exception for small noncash gifts considered de minimis: Those gifts are not taxable. So, a few Hershey bars in a gift bag would be de minimis and nontaxable—a tower of Godiva truffles, likely taxable, though clearly still delicious.11. Recycle your stash of candy at Christmas.Nontax consequences: If you put leftover candy in the freezer, you can recycle it for later. Money saved. Just be sure to sort out the candy with ghosts and pumpkins otherwise you'll have to explain why Santa and the elves are handing out Halloween candy. (Note to new parents: Trying to make up a story about the rarely seen “Christmas bat” almost never works.)Tax consequences: None. Even if you had paid for it, you can’t claim tax deductions for personal expenses like food or candy.12. Conduct science experiments.Nontax consequences: Candy is pretty awesome, and science is pretty awesome, so why not combine the two? There are all kinds of experiments on candy to keep your budding scientists interested, from melting Starbucks to floating Skittles (you’ll find details on those and more at Candyexperiments.com).Tax consequences: There’s no allowable tax deduction for tutorials and extras to keep your kids at the top of the class since they’re considered a personal expense (exceptions exist). If you’re a teacher, however, the results are different. Despite threats that the deduction would be eliminated as part of tax reform, teachers may still deduct up to $250 if they use out-of-pocket cash to buy classroom supplies (depending, candy could qualify as “supplementary materials that you use in the classroom”). It’s an above-the-line deduction, which means you don’t need to itemize.13. Eat it.Nontax consequences: Halloween candy is delicious. You might, however, have to explain to your son why you ate his Butterfinger without asking (pro tip: there is no suitable answer). If you decide to sneak an extra treat, remember that there could also be potential long-term effects like cavities and an extra pound or two.Tax consequences: No immediate consequences. Dealing with some long-term consequences of eating candy, however, might be deductible. While you can’t deduct the cost of going to the gym or joining a weight loss program to get rid of those extra pounds, dental and medical expenses did survive threats under tax reform. The floor was even lowered, so for 2018, you can deduct out of pocket expenses paid for medical care exceeding 7.5% of your AGI. That means that you can deduct dental expenses if you end up with a mouth full of Skittle induced cavities—but even I’ll admit that's one heck of a way to squeeze out a deduction."

Ecologist, Bitcoin Magazine, the Next Web, and CoinJournal. Previously ...","Oct 16, 2018,08:30am EDT",Synchronizing the hospitality industry with Hotelier Coin,"What if a hotel you had booked knew whether you liked a glass of red wine, knew your preference for a particular beer or if you had a liking for a cream tea without having to talk to them, and all through a digital profile?Well, that may soon become a reality.Meet Rana Mukherji, the founder and CEO of Hotelier Coin, a new decentralised platform using the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts to simplify the hotel booking process.Through the blockchain, Hotelier Coin intends to create a digital revolution by enabling all users to sell and trade bulk room nights like a commodity for the first time. Through its borderless hotel currency, the HTL token, investors will trade branded and unbranded hotel rooms via the platform’s secondary marketplace with an ask and bid process, the Hotelier Coin decentralized exchange (DEX).Starting with access to 170,000 hotels across 185 cities, the platform is a B2B, B2C and peer-to-peer (P2P) service that is aiming to become a one-stop shop for the hospitality industry. Everyone in the value chain will benefit with no middlemen, high fees or lack of efficiency.With our DApp, powered by blockchain, travelers have access to an enhanced experience with a straightforward booking system that provides verified reviews and generates preference profiling, explained Mukherji. The hotel operator will now understand guests with unique insights provided by the platform. Guest information and data will also be secured within the blockchain, identified by the unique digital identification.Travelers using the Hotelier Coin platform can book a hotel of their choice whereupon the appropriate amount of HTL is debited from their balance. Alternatively, travelers will also have the option of paying with their Hotelier Coin debit card, powered by CrowdBank, a Singapore-based fintech wallet and crypto bank on the NEO blockchain, in partnership with Hotelier Coin.The decentralized platform is also working with Australia-based RMS, the Hospitality Cloud, a software company that specializes in online booking, channel management and front office systems to the world’s hospitality sector, and TI Infotech, a company based in India, which powers Hotelier Coin’s secondary marketplace.Revamping the industryAs a hotelier at heart, Mukherji has been managing, operating and running luxury hotels across the Middle East, India, North America and Africa for nearly two decades. Some of the leading brands he’s worked with include Marriott, Regent-Carlson, Fairmont, Raffles Hotels & Resorts and Bespoke Hotels U.K.Prior to starting Hotelier Coin, he worked as a general manager for IFA Hotel Investments, a $2 billion company listed on the Kuwait Stock Exchange, with multiple hospitality assets managed by leading luxury brands.During a trip to the Mediterranean in 2016, the inspiration came to create his own boutique hotel company. Traveling to London, Italy, Malta, Croatia and Montenegro he met several stand-alone hotel owners who discussed their day-to-day business challenges.However, some of them wanted to sell off the business as they were tired of managing multiple moving parts in hospitality compounded with several tech solutions, Mukherji said. The sinking profitability due to high booking fees didn’t help. It forced them to reduce their staff to cut costs and, day after day, their online visibility was diminishing.He added that it was during this time that he was fortunate enough to be exposed to the blockchain. As a result, he realised the potential of a decentralised service and how an open source platform powered by its own currency could dramatically benefit the hospitality industry.According to the Hotelier Coin lightpaper, it is proposing a 360° solution with the HTL token, that will synchronise the market. Mukherji states that it will address the most pressing challenges in the sector, by launching a platform that disrupts inefficiency in the industry.Figures from the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), estimate that the number of international tourist arrivals worldwide is going to continue steadily increasing, reaching 1.8 billion by 2030. In 2017, global travel industry gross bookings reached $1.6 trillion, data from Deloitte shows.Yet, while the industry is booming, it is the established online travel agencies and branded hotels that conquer. Last year, for instance, Expedia’s annual revenue reached $10.6 billion. Expedia and Priceline both provide robust access to a large number of clients, but at the same time they also charge high booking fees, in the region of 15% to 20%. On top of that are the fees banks charge, around 2.5% to 5%. Revenue that eventually gets to the hotel owner is a small percentage of what it could have been.Our mission is to give hotel owners complete control over their hotel rooms - a highly perishable commodity, which can be sold as high as $1,000 a night, otherwise it’s value is zero if it’s not used - by boosting revenue through the sale of room night tokens in advance. This will improve their cash flow and revenue per available room, said Mukherji. In addition to that, we will also improve sales productivity with smart contracts and ask-bid options, avoiding sales lobby and legacy negotiation. It’s a win-win for both B2B and B2C.At any given time, the hotel can only sell up to 20% of its room inventory through the platform’s exchange with an unlimited term. According to Hotelier Coin, the hotel will only issue new hotel room night tokens against the redeemed ones. The 20% room cap in supply will secure the hotel room night token’s price in the secondary marketplace against demand. The exchange commission on both sides is 0.1%.For travelers, not only do they receive cashback, up to 4% in HTL tokens for each booking, but the platform aims to give them peace of mind. While travelers are interested in the best deals, fraudulent reviews - good or bad - can undermine a traveler’s trust and experience, affect a hotel’s reputation and turn a simple process into a hit and miss. On top of that is the fact that these traditional platforms lack a loyalty program even though they collect travelers’ details that are then spread across multiple agencies, shared and stored on vulnerable technology.Hotelier Coin makes leisure markets leap into the 22nd century by providing peer-to-peer booking and payment options to all industry participants, including the often-overlooked vacation rentals, freelance and small tour operators, Mukherji said.With access to 170,000 hotels across 185 cities, Hotelier Coin is aiming to deliver millions of memories under one currency.Further down the line, it is hoping to offer more than just rooms on its platform. As it expands, Mukherji said that they plan to deliver a full suite of travel and leisure options. This includes using HTL tokens for visiting museums and galleries to adventure tours and extreme sports.Hotelier Coin is currently undergoing its private sale. Once the four stages have closed - closed pre-sale, pre-ICO, ICO, and post-ICO sale - there will be a total of 150M tokens, 70M will be available during the ICO. Mukherji is aiming to raise a hard cap of $60 million."

As a result, multiple rumors and speculations escalated around the project.The cryptocurrency community quickly caught up with the rumors: in social networks and forums, there was an active discussion of the relationship of the banker’s dynasty and the new cryptocurrency company. This led the IMMO riddle to grow even stronger. One of the users, for example, suggested that with the help of IMMO the world elite will establish total control over finances and all cash flows of the world.Obviously, the birth of such ""predictions"" is associated with an increased interest in conspiracy theories. After all, conspiracy theories help people find at least some sense in the world around them, where they cannot control what is happening.It is noteworthy that IMMO hasn’t made any official statement until today. Lack of information has caused rumors to rise around the project.""The cryptocurrency market is undergoing a crisis of trust, and this is primarily due to the fact that crypto-projects create a lot of hype, but do not fulfill their promises. The transformation of the market has led to the fact that investors have become more selective in relation to blockchain-start-ups. A strong and experienced team, and a viable and well-developed product – that's what serious investors are paying attention to today,"" said Gabriel.The IMMO chose ‘a closed door policy’ and, perhaps for this reason, the information vacuum began to be filled with speculations and outright assumptions. Recently there have been accounts that the Rothschilds held a closed event in Tokyo.“IMMO has been conducting closed meetings because the Partner Sale has begun for privileged clients. However, there is nothing secret about that.”Although the operation of IMMO is still shrouded in mystery, these vehement denials by Brack do seem to indicate that the Rothschild’s are not involved in blockchain – at least for now."

I still believe that electronic currencies backed by nothing will ...","Editors' Pick|Oct 8, 2018,12:01pm EDT",(photo: Getty royalty-free images),"Some things have changed radically over the last decade, however, the most important being the structure of financial markets. The Great Financial Crisis was arguably caused by the digitalization of finance–the technology that enabled financial practitioners to convert every piece of financial information into 1s and 0s.This led to the explosion in derivative financial instruments that drove the global financial system to the brink of collapse. Despite claims to the contrary, regulators failed to address the risks posed by derivatives after the crisis, and they still pose significant systemic risk.One of the key aspects of derivatives is their ability to sunder the connection between underlying financial instruments and the derivative instruments based on them. (For a detailed discussion of this, see my book, The Committee To Destroy the World: Inside the Plot to Unleash A Super Crash on the Global Economy).The relationship between mortgages and the real estate they finance, or corporate bonds and the companies they finance, is highly attenuated in derivative products such as credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations.As long as financial markets are stable, this disconnection doesn’t cause problems. But when markets encounter strains, the leverage embedded in these products becomes highly problematic because financial instruments divorced from the fundamentals of their reference securities are little more than simulacra without substance or meaning. This is particularly troublesome in a world draped in legal excuses that protect immoral and unprincipled economic players.It may sound clever to dismiss bonds without covenants as a cyclical phenomenon, but they are in fact a sign of a profound moral rot at the heart of the system for which both buyers and sellers of these certificates of confiscation are treating capital with disdain.While the credit markets gutted any and all protections for lenders, the equity markets worked just as hard to remove them for stockholders. ETFs are an incredibly noxious invention that lure investors with the promise of low costs, ease of execution and virtually any type of equity exposure they desire while relieving them of any responsibility to possess a micro-byte of knowledge about what they own. As a result,  ETFs and their promoters created the least educated, most complacent and most arrogant generation of investors in history .While ETFs are not derivatives, they build on the philosophy of indirect investing that underlay the derivatives revolution; think of them as “Derivatives for Dummies.” They also create a self-feeding momentum machine that simply funnels more money down the gullet of a market fueled by trillions of dollars of central bank liquidity that has no end in sight.Add to ETFs the tens or hundreds of billions of dollars of stocks owned by central banks, sovereign wealth funds, and other non-economic buyers as well as nearly a billion dollars a year in corporate buybacks financed with cheap borrowing and markets no longer provide genuine price discovery or reliable signals about corporate performance. None of these factors existed before the financial crisis, certainly not to the degree they do today.Much of this money is levitating the price of a relatively small group of stocks affectionately known (except by short sellers) as the FAANGs. Unfortunately, these companies are not changing the world in the way that people think they are. iPhones or Facebook, or Google search, or Netflix, or shopping for stuff online at Amazon is not improving the quality of life on earth; instead, these allegedly miraculous inventions mostly promote solipsistic and unproductive human behavior.Even electric cars, which are supposed to save the earth, create their own environmental problems (electricity production causes pollution and we are going to have to dispose of those batteries somewhere) and are sadly led by a profoundly flawed prophet in Elon Musk. FAANG evangelists never mention that the rise of the FAANGs coincided with an explosion in suicides and drug overdoses in America, but maybe someone should look into whether this mere coincidence or a consequence of the increasing isolation and narcissism fed by new technology.America is not as strong economically as current economic data suggests. Growth has definitely improved from the Obama years, but it is based on rising debt levels and unsustainable wealth inequality. We are heading straight into another financial crisis resulting from too much debt and too much speculation. Americans congratulate themselves about their ability to innovate, but a disproportionate amount of this innovation is related to unproductive activities like consumerism and gossip. We need policies that promote substantive economic growth rather than financial engineering social media-driven navel-gazing.The sugar high from the tax bill peaked in the second and third quarters. U.S. corporations repatriated about $225 billion in the first quarter and $105 billion the second quarter. JPMorgan estimates it will repatriate a total of $500 billion in all of 2018, so they are more than halfway done. JPMorgan also estimates that $124 billion of these funds were used for stock buybacks, another $133 billion for debt reduction, and a mere $13 billion (or 5%) for capex. This is troubling.We would be in a much better place if our tech giants were focused on medical research and manufacturing breakthroughs instead of censuring conservative voices and reading everybody’s e-mails or tracking their shopping preferences. Companies like Facebook and Google own mindshare over empty minds. We need to fill these minds with useful ideas and promote the ability for those minds to express themselves rather than shut them down over antediluvian ideas about political correctness. Technology is not an unalloyed good when it is used to shut down discourse and suck up people’s time running up and down rat holes.And this brings us to where we are today. Some futurists, such as  George Gilder, argue that the FAANG model is peaking and will soon be replaced by a new model based on the blockchain. That is not to say that bitcoin will go to $100,000, which some evangelists argue. I still believe that electronic currencies backed by nothing will end up being worth nothing (and maintain my year end price target of under $2,000 on bitcoin).But as I have argued consistently, the blockchain is a potentially revolutionary technology in its early stages that poses a threat to existing technology regimes. Having spent more time studying blockchain, I believe that you cannot understand where the financial and info-technology world is going without understanding this new technology. Just as information was broken down into 1s and 0s by computers, it is now being broken down into new forms by the blockchain.As our privacy and private data are increasingly exposed by the FAANGs as essential components of their business models, the blockchain offers an alternative way to store and transfer data and money. You ignore it at your own peril because it is changing the world whether you like it or not.Excerpted from October issue of The Credit Strategist.----"

Should ...","Sep 11, 2018,08:16am EDT",Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett (AP Photo/Nati Harnik),"Thirty percent of Millennials surveyed say that cash is their preferred long term investment, according to Bankrate. Why is this? Some may say that it is intimidating and overwhelming to decide what to invest in. Not wanting to make a potentially costly mistake, it may seem easier to stand on the sidelines. Unfortunately, parking cash in a checking or savings account will simply not make your money work for you in a way that will greatly increase your wealth over the long run.With an abundance of new and existing asset classes (hello bitcoin), the choice of what to invest in is as complex as it ever has been. Should today’s younger generations be focused on investing in cryptocurrency? Could picking individual stocks lead to the greatest returns? It’s easy to see how the abundance of choice could make an asset we deal with often, like cash, seem like the most friendly choice. It’s no surprise that three in five Millennials have no financial exposure to the stock market.However, I firmly believe that passively investing in the stock market with index funds should be the preferred long term investment of choice for today’s young professionals. For starters, index funds take all of the guesswork out of investing. Using a simple two fund or three fund portfolio is a perfect way to begin investing your money.For those not convinced, here are 5 more reasons why you should include index funds in your investment portfolio.1. A Portfolio Of Index Funds Is Easy To ManageOnce you invest, you can essentially forget about it. If you choose individual stocks, you should be rebalancing regularly to avoid too much exposure to specific sectors or companies. With a broad total stock market index fund, you are well diversified and the impact of one stock rapidly increasing or decreasing in price won’t be as pronounced.Checking your portfolio every six months to a year is good enough when you have a simple portfolio of a couple of index funds. For many investors, all they really need to do is rebalance their ratio of stocks to bonds to their desired risk level, and then they can again forget about it.In a world where no one seems to have enough time to get through all of life's demands, this is one less thing to worry about.2. Choosing Index Funds Is SimpleSimply find a low cost total market index fund, and invest in it regularly. Continue to buy and hold until you retire to minimize fees and taxes, and you’ll be well ahead of the majority of people.I personally love Vanguard’s VTSAX because it’s a diversified total stock market index fund, and it only has a 0.04% expense ratio, which means that less of my money is going to pay fees and overhead expenses. A new fund, with similar characteristics is Fidelity’s FZROX, which is also a total market index fund, but its defining feature is that it has absolutely no fees or expenses.Here’s an excellent primer on asset allocation to get you started.3. You Are Guaranteed Market ReturnsJohn Bogle, Founder of Vanguard, says in his book, The Little Book of Common Sense Investing, that most investors do not earn market returns. And he says that the professional investment advisers that do, charge a fee that will cause your earnings to drop below the average market return.If the average professional money manager and hedge fund isn’t able to consistently beat the market average, it seems silly and foolish to think you’d fare better on your own. By buying and holding an index fund, you guarantee that you’ll consistently earn market returns. Not bad for a portfolio that takes less than an hour to manage every year.If you're still not convinced, here's how Nobel Prize winner, William Sharpe, feels about the subject. He says, ""The return on the average actively managed dollar will be less than the return on the average passively managed dollar.""4. Index Funds Will Remain Viable For Years To ComeThere's a sentiment in the investment world that if everyone invests in indexes, the stock market will stop functioning the way it was intended. For example, if everyone buys index funds, the values of the stock prices of the underlying companies won't reflect the valuation of the companies, but rather just the inflow of funds to indexes.Index funds don't participate in the price discovery process, so if only index fund investors were in the market, then the market would no longer be efficient. If there were no longer individual investors creating the demand and supply which determines fair market prices of stocks, then the entire market would no longer be just that, a market. While, in theory, this is a valid concern, the truth is that the vast majority of the public stock market would have to be held by index investors for the market to become inefficient.In reality, Bloomberg estimates that less than 18% of global equities are owned by indexers. This is well below some of the threshold numbers that leading economists warn against. Larry Swedroe believes that market can remain efficient as long as index funds comprise less than 90% of all stock ownership. What this means is that investing in index funds will continue to be a viable investment for many years to come, since there's no indication that those levels will ever be reached. After all, there's always someone willing to bet that they can beat the market average.5. Index Funds Are Warren Buffett’s #1 Recommended Investment For IndividualsWarren Buffett’s love of index funds is well documented. In fact, Buffett bet $1 million that an S&P 500 index fund would outperform a portfolio of hedge funds over a 10-year period. Buffett’s index fund trounced the portfolio of hedge funds, and he won the bet easily.The bottom line is that  investing passively in index funds might not only be the easiest way to invest your hard-earned money, but also the best."

(Photo Illustration by Yu Chun Christopher Wong/S3studio/Getty Images)","The cryptocurrency market and initial coin offerings (ICOs) have carved out a grey area for regulatory efforts in the United States. For example, utility tokens (user owned tokens that are not created as investment vehicles and hold a claim that they are exempt from federal laws that govern securities) are the primary tokens circulating most ICOs. Owners of utility tokens can’t use the coins outside of the platform without exchanging them; they can send tokens person to person within the network.ICOs must evolve to become self-regulatory, in order to advance the crypto market and become attractive to institutional investors. It’s not uncommon to find that the majority of companies selling utility tokens don’t have token economics. Therefore, most listed utility tokens are not real utility tokens, but rather, these companies are actually selling security tokens. Due to this problem, many institutional investors have been bearish on this new market. For instance, securities purchased by investors in private companies cannot be easily exchanged into currency without significant time and effort. Security tokens aim to solve the problems faced by security token investors and utility token regulation.“Tokenized securities are bridging the gap between traditional financial markets and crypto markets because they are aligned with everyone’s interest. Regulators want to protect the investors, investors want their assets tradable, and crowds from all over the world want to invest in the most promising startups at an early stage,” Laimonas Noreika, CEO and founder of Desico, a platform launching next year for retail investors to invest in Security Token Offerings (STOs), told me.Tokenized securities enable the ownership of token transference over blockchain technology so that tokens can be viewed as “digital assets.” Anthony Pompliano (Founder & Partner  at Morgan Creek Digital Assets) describes tokenized securities as, “digital assets subject to federal security regulations. In layman terms, they are the intersection of digital assets (tokens) with traditional financial products — a new technology improving old things.” In other words, tokenized securities provide the innovation of blockchain, matched with the backing and safety that comes with traditional finance.Platforms For Investing In Tokenized SecuritiesWhile many U.S. citizens are opening bank accounts in various countries to invest in ICOs abroad, Europe now has Desico, a platform for investing in tokenized securities. The company is leveraging a new Lithuanian crowdfunding law and regulatory framework to issue legally compliant security tokens in the EU, creating access for retail investors to participate in these investments globally.Desico already has the backing of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of the Economy. ""Regulatory support and strict adherence to relevant regulations is the key to success for any company in the cryptocurrency space,"" Mason Borda, CEO of TokenSoft, a company enabling organizations to run compliant token sales, told me.Rewards based crowdfunding startups like Indiegogo and Kickstarter were launched when the US passed a law of permission. Mayra Ceja, Director of ICOs and Equity at Indiegogo, states, “The future of security tokens is going to be big.” She continues, “I think it unlocks a tremendous amount of capital and opportunity to be able to achieve liquidity a little bit faster, so you’re actually getting a lot of interest from fully established businesses that can use the blockchain to raise additional capital much faster.”Like Malta and other European countries competing to become first to market and own that market, Lithuania is one of the only countries that currently has a legal framework for retail investment into STOs.There are several startups working on a similar exchange model in the U.S. We believe that tokenized securities, or security tokens, will be more attractive to investors - individual and institutional - but the challenge is how to comply with the laws of not just one, but many countries at once. Lithuania's crypto and crowdfunding framework is a step forward for the global crypto ecosystem. Adoption by more jurisdictions can't come soon enough, Kendrick Nguyen, CEO of U.S. investment platform Republic, told me.In terms of steps being taken in the U.S. to create regulations around security tokens, Neysan Rassekh, President of Blockchain Government Affairs, believes that the regulatory framework has already been setup. According to Rassekh, existing securities laws will be applied to many tokens.  And those tokens that are not deemed securities will be regulated under anti-money laundering, fraud and related statutes.The broad outline of a regulatory framework has already taken shape. The urgent need now is for the industry to influence how it is applied. For those clearly caught in the securities net, the key is to actively engage the SEC to impact application of securities laws so that these tokens can survive and flourish, or seek legislative exemptions. Hiding won’t work. To succeed, it is critical to convey crypto’s revolutionary potential, Rassekh told me.2017 was the year of the utility token, 2018 was the year of realizing the mistake of the utility token, and 2019 will be the year for tokenized securities. STOs are the new ICOs. ICOs have misleading information by ICO issuers, no real shareholders’ rights, and lack of transparency. The cryptocurrency sector shows much promise and potential, but is currently limited due to legal uncertainty."

Price Picture · Big Four Accounting Firm Wants To Empower Enterprises ...","Sep 19, 2018,05:23am EDT",Climate change is one of the most challenging collective problems the world has faced to date. Whether we will be able to curb our carbon emissions quickly enough to avoid the catastrophic impacts of climate change is still very much in question.,"In the search for solutions to this global challenge, much of the work to date has focused on climate agreements that create marketplaces to put a price on carbon, thereby creating a compliance carbon market. There are also voluntary carbon markets that have made some headway, allowing businesses to offset their carbon emissions by funding certified greenhouse gas reduction projects such energy efficiency projects, renewable energy projects or rainforest rehabilitation.Both markets present challenges with issues around double counting, transparency, trust and scalability. Technologies like the blockchain have the potential to assist in improving and bringing integrity to these existing markets. Although it’s very early days, there is some progress in this area.Improving Existing MarketsArticle 6.2 of the Paris Agreement on climate proposes the concept of Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) as the unit of cooperation and transfer of value of carbon impact. Though the rules of this tool are currently being written, eventually the goal will be to create a system that connects all of the carbon accounts of all of the countries around the world.In response to the Paris Agreement, Canada-based Blockchain for Climate Foundation is a not-for-profit startup focused on improving global carbon markets and are working on the architecture of a blockchain tool connecting country’s carbon accounts. Founder Joseph Pallant explains that: “We want to support and accelerate this goal by building a smart contract protocol that tracks ITMOs leveraging the Ethereum technology stack and scales, to accommodate use by every country in the world. There will be enough data embedded in each of the tokens so the provenance and eligibility of each tonne of emission reductions is clear.”For this purpose, Blockchain for Climate have developed a draft specification for a new token type called Unique Fungible Tokens (UTFs) that can contain the unique information of each credit, such as it’s place of origin, for example, being a reforestation or renewable energy project, to be able to validate the authenticity of a carbon credit, while making the token fungible that can enable many UTFs to be traded, creating liquidity in the market for the carbon credit.Pallant sees distributed ledger technology as a huge asset in global carbon trading co-operation. The public and transparent nature of the information encourages collaboration across nations and strengthens trust in the system. Pallant also believes that if the market is to grow to the size it needs to be able to trade the trillions of tonnes of carbon of an effective global compliance market “you’ll have to track fast and repeated transfers of units and bundle those units into different transactions…and you’ll need these transactions to be updated in real time”. Blockchain’s innate triple-entry bookkeeping (credit, debit and timestamp) will allow this speed and scale required for an effective global trading system.Blockchain for Climate Foundation’s platform, whilst still in its infancy presents the potential to improve and bring connectivity to the global carbon market.But how could blockchain and digital payments also be used to create new price signals or marketplaces to accelerate the transition to a low carbon global economy?  Historically, carbon markets have been highly centralized, opaque and in many instances illiquid, resulting in very restricted market participation. The technology behind blockchain has the potential to open up existing and create new carbon markets for a wider range of players, including smaller businesses and individuals. The distributed ledger technology can add more integrity to the system, remove the need for middlemen and allowing more direct and simple channels for purchasing and trading. This ultimately makes it easier for everybody to participate in carbon markets and for new peer-to-peer and business-to-consumer marketplaces to emerge.Poseidon is a company at the forefront of voluntary carbon markets. Focused on retail integration and attaching carbon credits to everyday purchases, the company was born out of the realisation that blockchain technology could not only lower the barrier of entry into carbon credit markets but also, for the first time allow carbon credits to be usefully broken down into per transaction or per product quantities. Poseidon CEO Laszlo Giricz explains that “when we realised that on the Stellar blockchain transactions could be done in three seconds and at such a low cost, we realised we were now able to transact in grams of carbon. For the first time carbon credits could be integrated into retail transactions at the point of sale.” As a result consumers can see the carbon impact of a single purchase and be given the opportunity to offset their impact in real time. Giricz has also found that people are constantly amazed at how small this offset cost is, that people are generally very happy to pay it, and that the immediate sense of reward they are given is quite addictive.Poseidon recently partnered with US ice-cream giant Ben & Jerry’s to break down carbon credits into microtransactions that can be attached to every scoop of ice-cream in their London Soho store, allowing Ben & Jerry’s and their customers to see the carbon emissions of purchases at point-of-sale and the opportunity to offset their impact in real time. The project started as a pilot at their London store but was so successful it’s still live four months later and has, to date, already protected over 4,000 trees.Poseidon have also joined forces with Liverpool City Council with the aim to offset the city’s carbon emissions by 110% by 2020. Giricz explains that;“Along with the City Council we’re going to be working with a range of companies from across Liverpool – including those in the retail and infrastructure sector, schools, transportation services and garbage collection. The goal is to make the carbon cost of every product or service in Liverpool transparent and to provide the opportunity, through the Poseidon platform, for it to be easily offset.”There are other blockchain companies like Poseidon emerging in this space but the work is still very nascent. The full potential of blockchain to unlock new markets is yet to be truly unleashed.The technology behind the blockchain can help bring more trust and scale to existing carbon markets, and this important work is already starting to happen. But perhaps a bigger opportunity remains untapped in harnessing the market creation potential backing cryptocurrencies and blockchain, to expedite the transition to a low carbon world."

These principles, however, are often challenged in the digital art space where the proliferation of unauthorized digital copies makes it close to impossible to prove the ownership or the authorship of the artwork in question.The blockchain technology comes as a long-sought solution for the digital art space providing an opportunity to not only limit the number of copies as intended by the artist but also to create unique non-fungible versions of the digital masterpiece. So, what makes this technology so groundbreaking for digital artists and their markets?First of all, blockchain-based platforms allow artists to register the copyright and provenance information for their art supporting digital uniqueness and scarcity. Verisart is one of the first platforms to help artists issue certificates of authenticity for their works on the blockchain. Founded by Robert Norton, former CEO of Saatchi Online and Sedition, the company is using blockchain technology to ‘protect records of creation and ownership to verify the authenticity of artwork’.In addition to supporting the authenticity of the art, digital scarcity also opens new business opportunities for both artists and collectors. One can observe the continuous growth of the online marketplaces to trade digital art and crypto-collectibles such as CryptoKitties and CryptoPunks. Some of the marketplaces, like Rare Bits, make it easy for collectors not only to buy and sell their crypto assets with zero fees but also manage their crypto-collectibles portfolio and get educated about new crypto-assets coming up.Finally, the immutable nature of blockchain and an option to create infinite fractions of each piece open digital art space to creative uses of the technology. One of the exciting developments in the field is the collaboration between Snark.art, a digital laboratory for art and technology, and Eve Sussman, an established video, film and installation artist. The result of this collaboration, an original Ethereum-based artwork, 89 seconds Atomized, is ‘taking Sussman’s seminal 2004 video work 89 seconds at Alcazár and transforms it for the blockchain’ to be collected and interacted with in a new conceptual way.Summing it up, digital art is definitely one of the most obvious candidates for utilizing the blockchain for the art market. Access to state-of-the-art technology like AI and VR provides artists with new digital tools to create works that would be unimaginable just a few years ago while blockchain helps creators to secure the authorship of their pieces. But, most importantly, blockchain and its adoption in the art world, is a crucial next step to elevate the status of digital art, making it more desirable for the global collector community and placing it to the same level as the more traditional art."

The tokens are burned upon redemption, ensuring that all tokens in circulation have corresponding dollars in custody. Dollar deposits converted into tokens will be held in U.S. banks subject to oversight and regulation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, providing assurances and protections not available for other stablecoins currently on the market. “Paxos Standard gives financial markets the power to transact in a fully USD-collateralized asset with the benefits of blockchain technology and oversight from financial regulators,” said Charles Cascarilla, CEO and co-founder of Paxos, adding:“We believe that Paxos Standard represents a significant advancement in digital assets, leveraging the oversight and stability of the traditional financial system and enabling a frictionless global economy.”Cascarilla further emphasized to Forbes that dollar deposits for the token would be accepted by four separate U.S.-domiciled banking partners, and that the token would be regularly audited by a major auditor, though he declined to specifically identify the banks and auditors with whom Paxos will be working.“In the current marketplace, the biggest hindrances to digital asset adoption is trust and volatility,"" he added. ""As a regulated trust with a one-to-one dollar-collateralized stablecoin, we believe we are offering an asset that improves on the utility of money.""The NYDFS also on Monday approved a similar stablecoin developed by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. The coin, trading as PAX, will be immediately available for use on itBit, Paxos’ crypto exchange and digital asset custodial service. It will also be available for listing on additional exchanges.The company was originally founded in 2012 as itBit, but then later rebranded to Paxos to focus more broadly on blockchain offerings - particularly the digitization of assets to allow for frictionless transactions and reduced settlement risk.Paxos has since onboarded a wealth of legacy financial expertise into its orbit. Its board of directors now includes Sheila Bair, who served as chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation during the 2008 Financial Crisis; former U.S. Senator Bill Bradley; Robert Herz, former head chair of the Financial Accounting Standards Board and Duncan Niederauer - a former executive at Intercontinental Exchange and NYSE/Euronext.  In May, Paxos announced that it had raised $65M from investors including Liberty City and RRE Ventures.  "

Yet it surprises me how many people pay for tax opinions without thinking about what they are getting. Conversely, many don’t get a tax opinion despite the need. If you wait until you are audited, it is too late. What exactly is a tax opinion? Distinguish between tax opinions about your own situation from tax opinions attached to investment programs. The best type of tax opinion is customized. It is formal written advice about your own tax circumstance, whatever they are.","You might have settled some litigation and received money, or paid big legal fees. You might have moved states, liquidated a business, sold or exchanged a stockpile of Bitcoin, or had an involuntary conversion or casualty loss. You might have received a legal settlement you hope is tax free because of physical injuries or sickness. You might be claiming that your stock sale proceeds are tax exempt as qualified small business stock. Whatever your situation, you want formal tax advice about the strengths and weaknesses of your position before you file your return and spend your money.IRS Audit report and calculator on a desk.Tax opinions are usually thorough, discussing your facts and numbers, and the legal authorities. But when it comes to the bottom line conclusion, tax opinions generally conform to one of the following choices:Under IRS standards, the tax practitioner must assume there will be an audit. That way, the opinion's conclusion is not based on audit lottery. In reality, of course, audits are rare. One common question is the extent to which an opinion will get you out of penalties if the IRS disagrees with your treatment. In general, the higher the standard of opinion, the more it can help with penalties. However, even a lower level opinion helps. Even an opinion that you have a reasonable basis for your tax position can be enough to protect you if you disclose your position on your return.Of course, just penalty protection isn't enough. You don't want to end up paying all of the tax and all of the interest, even if there are no penalties. What you really want is to have your tax position upheld. An opinion can help. In fact, an opinion can help put you in the best possible light on both the facts and the law. Although customized tax opinions are arguably the best kind, there is another type of tax opinion. Some tax opinions are marketed in connection with investment offerings. Example: Your broker pitches you to buy an interest in an LLC owning railroad cars that will carry special food products. You get a prospectus showing you’ll get depreciation and tax credit benefits worth five times your investment in the first 12 months. You can’t sell for three years, but who needs sales proceeds when you’re getting tax benefits like that! A tax opinion included with the prospectus says it is “more likely than not” you’ll get your tax benefits. You may have had no contact with the law or accounting firm rendering the opinion.You probably don’t think of them as looking out for your interests, as they are representing the promoter or sponsor of the investment program. Still, it’s clear you’re supposed to be impressed by the opinion. You may get your own tax adviser to formally or informally opine on it too. Be careful with tax opinions of this sort. Sometimes, these investments go bad. The IRS may deny the tax benefits, and there may be litigation. One type of litigation is with the IRS. Another is between investors and promoters if the investment goes under or tax benefits are denied.To return to the customized type of tax opinion, try to plan ahead and get some tax advice before you sign documents or make major decisions that will impact your taxes. Often, that kind of tax advice can precede a formal tax opinion naturally. That way, the tax adviser is part of the process and can help shape the tax opinion and make it stronger. And once the tax opinion is written and your tax returns are filed, you have a ready source of authority if the IRS comes knocking. If they do, don't hand the opinion to the IRS. Instead, use it as a ready source to cut and paste into targeted responses to the IRS. Having all that work done in advance can make a world of difference."

And Litecoin Soar—Here's Why ...","Oct 22, 2018,04:01pm EDT",Getty,"The sizzling stablecoin market took another leap forward Monday with the announcement of a forthcoming U.S. dollar-pegged coin that will actually pay interest to its holders.  The stablecoin, known as the Universal Dollar, is the product of a partnership known as the Universal Protocol Alliance between Uphold, the global digital money platform, decentralized lending platform Cred, Brave and Blockchain at Berkeley.Like other stablecoins on the market, the Universal Dollar will be fully-collateralized by dollars held in FDIC-insured banks. However, its holders will be able to opt into a program called Uphold Earn that offers bank-like services to consumers, including the ability to earn interest as high as five percent. Set to rollout in mid-November, the coin is the latest in a wave of new dollar-collateralized stablecoin issuances, such as the Gemini Dollar and Paxos Standard - which were both greenlighted by the New York Department of Financial Services in September. “It’s really aimed at beyond the 24 million users of crypto or those relying on Tether for safe harbor,” Uphold CEO J.P. Thieriot told Forbes. “It’s really more aimed at crypto attempting to deliver the goods to the mass market.”Thierot continued:“Traditionally, the average consumer has been wary of digital currency for two reasons: volatility and a fear that, if they lose their key, they lose their money. Universal Dollar helps solve for both of these problems.”With Uphold Earn, customers will be able to earn as high as five percent interest if they convert digital dollars held on the Uphold platform into Universal Dollars and then stake a sufficient quantity of Universal Protocol tokens. Interest will be paid out from lending fees generated by Cred.“The idea here is Uphold remains a 100 percent reserve depository and now we’ve partnered with a pure play credit specialist,” said Thierot. Additionally, Uphold in conjunction with Cred announced a forthcoming crypto lending product called Uphold Borrow, which will allow customers to take out loans of up to $200,000 in U.S. dollars against crypto assets held on its platform, which is currently operational in 184 countries and has processed nearly $4B transactions.“Up until now, the rate you receive on your loan has been predicated on which country you live in, who you bank with and the credit rating you receive,” said Dan Schatt, Co-Founder and President of Cred, adding:“Thanks to the efficiencies of blockchain, the unique properties of crypto assets and smart contract infrastructure, Uphold and Cred customers can benefit from a more efficient, transparent and equitable financial services structure.”"

For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made...One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them.”—J.R.R. Tolkien, ""The Lord of the Rings""If you haven't read and/or watched J.R.R. Tolkien’s, The Lord of the Rings, have no fear, as there is still much to be learned from this piece—you just may miss out on some really cool references. In order to bridge the gap between the soccer community and its players, there is a 'ring of power' out there that just may fit a blockchain system, providing for unlimited possibilities. It's just a matter of finding that ring.The Battle for The GoalThe world loves football. Yet, with over four (4) billion fans across the globe, 300,000 football clubs, and 240 million active players, the sport has become less “interactive.” But, how is this possible? Well, first, don’t confuse the level of interactivity with the level of passion fans, including myself, express and often flaunt.Fans are provided the means to cheer and support their favorite teams and players, but from a distance.#1 —An Isolated CommunityAs I frequently mention throughout my pieces, I have traveled the world to over thirteen different countries. During the course of my travels, I've collected football jerseys, old and new, from each country I've visited; eventually having the opportunity to wear them at live matches that I would normally be watching from my couch at home. Of those countries, I left Brazil, Ghana, and Hong Kong with a sense of community and belonging.But, for those fans who may not have the financial ability to travel the world, their connection with their team or favorite player is extremely limited, attributed to a number of factors:On its own and/or in combination, these factors contribute to the diminishing interactivity of the space. Consequently, the e-Sports space and online fantasy sports space have increased in popularity, providing users and fans with a sense of control and influence over the teams they manage online.#2 –The ""Two Towers"" of the Football OrganizationThe 'Towers' of the Football OrganizationThe popularity of football clubs has made these organizations powerful. Not ""the eye of Sauron"" powerful, but still, influential enough to make certain decisions. In Tolkien's world, the ""Two Towers,"" symbolized the joining of forces with Sauron's armies as against the rest of the world. The stabilization of the football industry is attributed to the ""Three Towers,""or organizations that have joined forces, ultimately controlling the space:While not operating on a mission of world domination, these forces still control one important channel that keeps fans and communities at bay—access.  Limited accessibility to athletes and players outside of the rare ""meet and greets"" or public appearances, kills the fan vibe.  The effects of which, trickle down and impact the relationship teams could have with its fans.#3—The Journey Through 'Mordor'Whether as a fan or by meme reference, the name Mordor, should ring a bell, serving as Sauron's main-stage for world domination. The world of social media resembles, at least in a digital sense, many characteristics of Tolkien's Mordor. It's ever growing and unpredictable.Surrounding the towers, are barriers affecting the amount of exposure a team and/or its athletes have with their fans:In utilizing blockchain technology, the reduction and/or elimination of these intermediaries will always be the fundamental backbone.#4—Finding The 'One Ring'A few months ago, I covered a few different sports projects like MyDFS and Bountie, which by design, aim to connect teams with its fans. While the market has addressed what it believes to be timely issues, I still felt as if something was missing from the market as a whole—passion.Reaching out to contacts of mine in Hong Kong, one project caught my immediate attention. While not set to be fully functional until the first quarter of 2020, the 433 Token project has a unique model and an even more promising backing. Developed by Soccer Legends Limited, a company co-founded by entrepreneurs, Jason Sze and Raymond Wong, the company looks to youth development and sponsorship to help address the disconnect. Recently, football legends, Andriy Shevchenko and Paul Scholes, have come on board, becoming the face of the entire ecosystem.In my opinion, the ‘433 Token’ (Token) is one of these rings of power. Built on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 cryptocurrency, this ecosystem is designed to extinguish the burns left by the towers upon clubs, teams, and fans.The mission is three-fold:The first two missions are the prime focus of my analysis. As a millennial sports fan, I believe addressing the younger fan demographic is invaluable to the survival of the football space in our digital age.The Fellowship of LegendsIn Tolkien's world, the Council of Elrond created the Fellowship of The Ring; in 433's world, the Fellowship of Legends allows professional athletes to directly shape and nurture young talent interested in improving their game, by signing on as a “Principal.”Ranging from sixteen to eighteen years old, the individuals are picked from soccer academies around the world. The Principal has the ability to select and mentor up to five (5) children, meeting with them and working on managing nutrition, leadership techniques, and athletic development.  By monitoring their progress, the Principal is able to advise them on their strengths and weaknesses, including any potential pitfalls a professional player may face in their career.Earlier this summer, Andriy Shevchenko, Ukraine’s football legend, and Paul Scholes, formerly with Manchester United, signed on as Principals, becoming the faces for this entire ecosystem.“I’m a firm believer in supporting youth development in football,"" Scholes exclaimed, ""and I’m delighted to be part of this project.”Keeping Score On The BlockchainOnce they have chosen their mentees, the Principal then offers Token holders around the world, the opportunity to directly sponsor his mentoring by putting forward a certain number of their Tokens, which are distributed through smart contract technology.For example, 500,000 Tokens are required for the Principal to mentor Talent A. Once 500,000 Tokens are put up, or sponsored, no more tokens are accepted, and the Principal must start his or her mentorship in order to redeem those 500,000 Tokens. Throughout the duration of the sponsorship, all of the Tokens are held and governed by the terms of the smart contract, until certain mentorship milestones are reached.Watching Out For GDPR and RegulationsBack in May of this year, GDPR went into effect, instilling new regulations and penalties for those handling personal information belonging to European citizens. I was curious on the type of information the company stores on the Blockchain, and off. According to Anthony Huang, the Chief Marketing Officer for 433 Token, all the information is stored ""on-chain,"" but with limited accessibility to only those sponsors who have been granted special permissions.I spoke with Huang and he told me that the only ""off chain"" or private data being collected. is the date of birth and a photo, which together, demonstrate the youth talent's permission in accepting sponsorship. ""No other private information such as home address or passport information is collected,"" Huang added.Restoring Fandom Through Scaled BiddingThe company's second mission in restoring interactivity, explores scaled auction bidding. Being a loyal fan requires a great deal of passion, emotion, and financial devotion.  With scale, the distance between a fan and his or her team can be shortened, significantly.In 433's business model, a Principal will be able to hold an auction for special events (“event”) with his personal participation, including meet and greets, dinners, or even a scheduled football shootout on a field.Utilizing smart contract technology, each event has an associated “Event Token” with it, where participation is allowed by purchasing and spending the native Token. The highest bidder will receive the Event Token and participate in that particular event. Other bidders will get their tokens back and wait for the next opportunity. In effectuating the contract, the Principal only redeems their Token once they satisfy their obligations to the event. Absent this, the tokens are returned to the bidder.In Tolkien's world, there were nine rings of power, each containing value of its own. But, the 21st century has its own rings of power that seek to unite the spaces. In the world of soccer, I believe a ring of power has been found. There may very well be other rings out there. But, the potential of this ecosystem shows how implementing blockchain technology can truly empower the football community.Geared to be fully functional by 2020, there’s no question that when the FIFA World Cup comes back around in 2022, the world will be cheering louder than it ever has. This is definitely a project for football fans to keep their eyes on."

Futuristic background for technology concept, abstract illustration","Today, on stage at Devcon, Sergey Nazarov of Chainlink, the blockchain company that provides inputs and outputs for smart contracts on any blockchain, announced that they will be acquiring Cornell’s Town Crier project. Chainlink will be primarily adopting the technology and further lead the development of the trusted hardware-based oracle system on the Chainlink network.Town Crier is an interesting project that came out of Cornell University and IC3 to ensure data privacy and security for smart contracts. The project outlines a novel way to process transactions and use encryption to verify the processing without leaking any sensitive information in the process.There is already a link to Chainlink as the research for Town Crier was co-authored by Ari Jules, who is a co-author of the Chainlink whitepaper. Now, this announcement is seen as an important step forward for the two projects as it is the start of a consolidation of smart contract oracle projects.Credit: Sergey Nazarov of ChainlinkChainlink has explained that it will integrate the Town Crier technology into their decentralized oracle network. The combination of these two leading projects creates a clear technical leader for securely providing smart contracts with the key external inputs they need to function.A step in the right direction for bothJules, on explaining the acquisition believes that Chainlink is the correct company to expand the oracle space for the Town Crier technology“Chainlink is the most qualified team to seize the baton and bring Town Crier to the next stage of development. I’m confident that Chainlink’s leadership will result in high production quality, a raft of new features, and greatly improved usability. Integration of Town Crier into the Chainlink platform will help solve the vital problem of smart contract connectivity by bolstering both data integrity and query confidentiality.”For Chainlink, the acquisition was also a promising one as Nazaov explains the already strong link between Jules and the Town Crier project.“We decided that Town Crier was a good option for inclusion in Chainlink because we have been working on it together with Ari and Cornell, and know that it's the best approach out there for securely getting data to smart contracts using a Trusted Execution Environment like Intel's SGX.”The integration and acquisition of Town Crier is based predominantly on the technology and essentially about taking it forward along the Chainlink network.“The acquisition of Town Crier by Chainlink focused on us integrating Town Crier into Chainlink, and taking over the development of Town Crier in it's V2 form, with the help of great people like Ari and other folks at Cornell/IC3. The further development goals are to expand the features/usability of Town Crier, by connecting it together with the many great features we already have in Chainlink, while continuing to improve on its security in a Town Crier V2 release we're working on, to make it an even better version of the great approach that Ari and the very smart folks at Cornell came up with.”Advancing smart contractsThe partnership between these two projects seems to point to a new era of smart contracts as they approach a V2.0. With other companies like Synthetic Minds building automated smart contracts, and Chainlink trying to advance from scripted smart contracts to Externally Connected Smart Contracts which can generate real world events.Institutions like Cornell are strongly getting behind blockchain and their research capabilities are helping advance the space along with companies like Chainlink. It is these advancements in business and research that can help smart contracts become the dominant form of digital agreement in key industries like securities, derivatives, insurance and trade finance as they will need to be externally connected smart contracts.The leap from scriptable smart contracts that can't know about and/or take meaningful action in the real world the way many centralized digital agreements can, over to scriptable, secure and highly reliable smart contracts that can have meaningful interactions with the real world through knowing what's happening and/or making useful things is a very large and important leap forward for the entire space."

These characteristics can directly be addressed to solve challenges faced by charities today, like donation transparency, traceability, and actual impact. Blockchain technology is also a key part in bringing together various entities, like donors, volunteers, recipients, and organizations of various sizes, into one cohesive ecosystem.It was during World Cancer Day this year that Malta demonstrated the actual impact blockchain technology has on charities. The Malta Community Chest Fund Foundation (MCCFF) received a 40k EUR donation from CryptoCharity, a blockchain-powered solution designed to facilitate the process of donations. The solution is built on the STASIS platform, a financial infrastructure for launching digital assets reserved by traditional financial instruments with the regular state audit.All proceeds collected during the campaign went towards the Serenity Garden Project at the Oncology Centre in Malta, aimed to increase the well-being and quality of life for the patients there.""I envisage that the gardens will provide a soothing distraction, and help the patients achieve a sense of control; encourage family and friends to be with their loved ones in a pleasant, social environment; and offer opportunities for movement and light exercise. The proposed gardens will thus form an integral part of the Oncology Centre,” said her Excellency, President Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca of Malta.Moreover, a charity with digital assets on a blockchain network makes it possible to donate in a fast, secure and transparent manner. Philanthropists who donated also received charitable tokens for every 1-euro equivalent of a digital asset donation.Too often the cryptocurrency and blockchain community speaks of what may someday be possible with this new technology. We believe it is time to show what is possible now and to use our knowledge and expertise towards changing lives for the better. We are on a mission to bridge the gap between decentralized finance and the people - and we are delighted to be able to contribute to this wonderful initiative and help usher philanthropy into a new era,  said Gregory Klumov, CEO and Founder of STASIS."

The following are some

Only this time, they will occur less often and more privately than before. Plus, they will all be much better regulated.One thing, though, will never change: blockchain startups are different from most other tech startups, and all approaches in growing them are to be handled more strategically. Most novice blockchain entrepreneurs are unaware of basic growth hacking know-how, and it’s crucial for them to familiarize themselves with the building blocks of growth for blockchain.The concept of growth hacking itself appears complex and vague. In a nutshell, it is a combination of several forms of implementations and experiments across marketing, sales and product development.With TGE's, blockchain companies can raise private money from a pool of investors or crypto-focused funds. While that entails serious regulation standards, the benefit for investors is that they are able to have access to an array of investment opportunities, with minimal fiat investments. The following are some crucial basics when launching a blockchain and cryotocurrency startup. Don’t be fooled, much of it is easier said than done.User experience: First and foremost in blockchain products, many don't realise that their user experience is terrible. You need to download a client from there, then install an app on this - then face a product that is barely understandable. Everything you build in the blockchain space needs to have an intuitive workflow in mind, otherwise you'll be one of the many failed products.Demonstrate Adaptability: If you see that an approach is failing, be willing to pivot your product to achieve product market-fit. The crypto audience has a very short attention span.Keep it Simple: There’s no need to try to impress others with technological jargon in web copy, because if anything, it alienates them. Simplify your messages across the board, to allow your audience to easily understand your vision and missionEnsure Growth Efforts are Strategic: Most blockchain startups delve into marketing without a solid strategy that factors things such as paid, owned, and earned digital media. Simply creating accounts on multiple platforms and positing about developments barely scratches the surface. You need to break your goals and targets down, and be very specific about them.Learn from the Competition: What have the leading crypto projects in your niche done to achieve their growth? Study the efforts of your competitors, even if they are indirectly competing. Tweak your own strategies based on the pros and cons of theirs, so you can avoid having to learn some things the hard way. Dedicate some time to conduct an intense competitive analysis, and use your findings to your benefit. As you do the research, you will see that in addition to gauging competitors, you will be able to gain additional insights such as potential customers and companies worth collaborating with. Some of the tools I use to research competitors are Similar Web, OpenSiteExplorer and SEMrush.Keep your token holders Happy: Simple initiatives such as referral programs that offer referrers a reward go a long way. With blockchain projects, your strongest team members are the token holders. They will go a long way to increase value of their own money, and so you could potentially get an army of ambassadors - at barely any cost.Create Amazing Original Content: It’s well-known that quality content marketing generates far more leads than outbound marketing efforts, and costs less. It also helps make social media marketing efforts easier, as the content will draw attention to your channels. Dominate your niche with powerful thought leadership articles and social media updates.Make your Website Secure and Attractive: Secure websites are not only beneficial to your audience, it’s also helpful for SEO purposes. And as mentioned earlier, keep the language simple and easy to understand. Be sure to have a Designer assist in creating the site, as a free WordPress template just won’t cut it.Create and Populate a Blog: An active blog will help improve your branding and add traffic to your website. The most successful TGE's launched their blog on Medium.com, so you may want to consider giving that a try as well. On Medium, you can enjoy attracting an audience you couldn't have reached anywhere else, however your own website won't enjoy any SEO benefits.Focus on long-tail keywords that can attract the right audience. I use tools such as Ubersuggest and BuzzSumo.Look into PR and Media Outreach: If you've raised a significant amount in your TGE, it should be pretty easy securing some placements by your self. If not, hire a blockchain specialised PR agency as they are usually connected with the right editors. If you don't want to obligate for the long term, make sure it's clear that you only want to test the water.Focus on Social Media: All social networks are to be treated differently, and it’s important for your Social Media Manager to keep up to date on best practices and restrictions. For example, Twitter has banned crypto-related ads, and Google and Facebook have restrictions on words that can and can’t be used. I recommend being active on Twitter, BitcoinTalk, Reddit, Telegram, Steemit, Facebook, and Quora. Bonus points if you can create original information videos on YouTube as well. Many Telegram channels consist of purchased fake followers - do NOT be one of them. That will backfire, and you will instantly lose credibility. Also, don’t forget to create professional profiles on sites such as LinkedIn and Crunchbase.Get Added into listing websites: Being added into such sites will be of great help in terms of the discovery aspect. Some of the most popular free ICO listing sites include CoinGecko, ICOdrops, ICOBench, CoinSchedule, and TokenMarket.Launch Airdrops: Airdrops are the distribution of coins/tokens to the community either for free, or in exchange for small tasks (such as leaving a comment on a social media post.) It’s crucial to be very strategic along the way while growth hacking, and base that strategy on solid research and insights from others that have already gone down that path. As you go about each of your campaigns, focus on metrics and analytics, and make adjustments as needed to achieve optimal results."

QuickBooks Enterprise. Disrupters-In-Chief. The CFO will become a ...","Oct 31, 2018,07:19pm EDT",By Jason Compton,"Finance isn’t just for functionaries anymore. Financial leaders are growing beyond traditional boxes to become visionaries who drive strategy, innovation and growth.GettyimagesOver the next decade, the finance office is going to be about much more than transactions and balance sheets. In fact, that transformation is already well underway.  Business tradition sees the finance leader as a protector: the literal keeper of the purse. It casts a chief financial officer (CFO) or finance vice president as something like a historian, someone who can be called upon to produce the facts and figures that describe the company’s past. This approach keeps the financial leader looking backward, instead of using his or her senior position to not just influence but actually initiate and implement change.  “In a world of growing disruption and speed, the role of the CFO becomes more than just about optimizing cost savings and new revenues,” said Karen Barson, VP of Marketing for QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise. Here’s a look at five new responsibilities that keen CFOs and financial minds are eagerly embracing, at fast-growing smaller companies as well as on the enterprise level. Forecasting And Driving Growth Financial leaders won’t just tell their CEOs how fast companies are expanding. They’ll be actively scouting growth opportunities. A McKinsey CFO survey found that 41 percent of finance leaders already spend the bulk of their time on tasks outside finance, most often on strategic leadership and organizational transformation. CFOs who understand the power of data analysis will thrive here, using real-time insights and algorithms to create credible forecasts, not just ledgers of past activity.  Forward-thinking financial leaders interested in growing small businesses will find the break-even, worst-case and general what-if analysis functionalities built into solutions such as Intuit QuickBooks Enterprise to be useful.  Helping CEOs Pilot Through Head And Tail Winds Listen to conversations about the financial leader of the future and you’ll hear the term “co-pilot” a lot. That’s because the CFO is emerging as the de facto chief operating officer, especially as that role itself falls out of favor in the 21st century.  That means CFOs are not simply reporting the quarterly news, but actively looking for ways to optimize internal processes and external relationships. For example, a CFO at a manufacturing or distribution company is well-positioned to investigate options for improving margins, a key lever of differentiation in those industries. In an interview with Raconteur, Dell Technologies CFO Tom Sweet said, “I do think the role has expanded from a classic ‘close the books, report the results and manage the capital’ [role] to a much broader, quite frankly more interesting, dynamic job, which is what interests me about it.” Striking A Balance Between Human And Machine Today’s financial leader spends a lot of time looking for ways to cut costs and outsource operations. According to McKinsey, financial leaders will soon shift from focusing on outsourcing and labor cost reduction to creating new financial workflows based around automated processes and delegation.  McKinsey believes that more than half of the activities in most core financial functions – including general accounting operations, revenue management, planning and analysis, even taxation—can be automated.  As Binary Fountain CFO Licia Salice-Jarisch said in a Forbes interview, “The organizations that wait to automate their financial processes will find it hard to grow and scale their business.”  Transforming Transactions And Supply Chains For A Modern World The financial leader is already a natural data authority, since the responsibilities that come with that position are so closely tied to facts and figures, all of which must be reconciled, auditable and verifiable. It’s common to give the finance function responsibility for data concerning inventory and assets, particularly at manufacturing firms where return on capital depends on tight inventory control. In the not-at-all-distant future, financial leaders will be tasked with managing blockchain participation of all sorts—not only as blockchain relates to cryptocurrency, but also as it concerns contracts and complex transactions and other areas that require trustworthy data. That meshes with the natural tendency of a smaller firm’s CFO to be a security-minded leader, as well as the individual most closely involved with contractual obligations. Blockchain solutions for smaller, growing businesses are emerging to meet demand. For instance, payments through Bitcoin are already available in Intuit QuickBooks Enterprise.  Disrupters-In-Chief The CFO will become a storyteller and inventor, rather than the protector of the way things have most recently been done.  That means constantly provoking discussions about what is possible and what outcomes could result, not simply exploring the downside risks of change or failed experiments. And it entails creative use of new data-crunching capabilities for the high-level forecasting and dynamic conceptualization so integral to real growth.  “A robust business management software solution with advanced reporting capabilities can help identify risks and find opportunities, leading the company to enact smarter decisions,” Quickbooks’s Barson said. It’s an evolution, yes: from a traditional role as a rigid defender against financial risk into a company-wide risk manager and innovator. And it’s a natural, proactive and necessary change, given that going stale is one of the most serious risks a business can take.  Jason Compton is a writer and reporter with extensive experience in enterprise tech.

“Skyscanner” For Bitcoin · Bitcoin's Next Boom Has Already Begun ...","Oct 22, 2018,09:19am EDT","Founder of Synthetic Minds, Saurabh Srivastava. The company raised $5.5M in its first seed round,... [+] with participation from Khosla Ventures and Pantera Capital. This funding comes at the heels of the Y Combinator investment from this summer’s batch.","Synthetic Minds, a company that is using Program Synthesis to automate the analyzing and synthesizing of computer code, is taking aim at blockchain technology to create infallible smart contracts. And this is drawing attention from major investors.Synthetic Minds has raised $5.5 million in its first seed round, with participation from Khosla Ventures and Pantera Capital. Both these companies see the future of smart contracts as machine written, in order to eliminate human fault, and as such believe that Synthetic Minds is onto something.For Synthetic Minds, the funding comes at a time where they are trying to add concrete value to customers who are seeking a more correct form of smart contract. The idea being that through automation, Synthetic Minds analyses users’ smart contracts, and then synthesizes to build contracts that interact with the customer's code.The result is a computer vetted analysis of the smart contract code that can outline any potential issues along the blockchain down the line.From Spaceships to BlockchainProgram Synthesis, the core technology employed by Synthetic Minds, is a computer science discipline called Formal Methods. NASA uses these formal methods to ensure the safety of mission critical software in the space station and the Mars Rover.The result is, by combining Program Synthesis and Formal Methods, synthetic Minds has built an automation that can read and write computer code better than humans can. This is clearly beneficial for NASA with its fine margins of error, but it is also closely related to blockchain.This technology works for cases where software embodies high-value and permanence. Space applications and blockchain code share those characteristics, because smart contracts are permanent, But there have been instances where multiple $ 100 million bugs have disabled large important projects, for example, the DAO.Thus the service that is being put forward from Synthetic Minds allows companies to build much more trusted smart contracts, ones that are not going to fall foul to human error in the code.Addressing the future issuesSmart contract code is not always written badly, or inherently flawed. It is more that down the line the code can interact with new agents or occurrences on the blockchain in an unexpected way. It is because of this that founder of Synthetic Minds, Saurabh Srivastava, believes that this should be necessary to sure up the smart contract ecosystem.“It is not always just that the code is bad, it is also almost impossible for humans to envision all possible ways in which a contract might interact with its environment,” Srivastava explained to Forbes. ""Only automation can help us get those assurances.”“Some great teams are spending a lot of time worrying about correctness. This is because this domain is unlike normal web software where you break things and fix them continuously. Here you have to get it right up front.”“With Synthetic Minds our customers get code that is vetted by machines instead of humans. For now we are helping Ethereum smart contract applications be better. Eventually, we envision smart contracts and even general software will be automatically generated, rather than hand-written by programmers.”A better environmentAs the blockchain space expands and gains more attention, a lot more scrutinising goes on. This leads to poorer aspects of the space quickly pulled over the coals. Issues like the DAO, and the potential for immutable smart contract to go wrong, put a big spanner in the works for the advancement of blockchain.Thus, in such a digital space, it makes sense that the smart contract codes be vetted digitally too. Not only is the correctness of the code made sure, but there are other benefits that can help expand the space further.“As I mentioned, you get comprehensive correctness - formal guarantees that are the same as what NASA gets when they use formal methods for their software,"" Srivastava added. ""It has a quicker turnaround since there are no humans in the loop, customers can run checks every week or month if they need — as opposed to once a year.“Eventually, the goal is also to have it so customers will just state the specs and the synthesizer will generate the provably correct code. Idea to code can happen within weeks at that point.”Buying inThe idea of smarter, more correct, smart contracts has a wide array of applications that can not only help people using these contracts, but can also bring more security to the blockchain space. It is for this reason that the likes of Pantera Capital, a top-tier crypto fund, are investing in this project.Paul Veradittakit of Pantera Capital says: “Pantera believes that every company building smart contracts will benefit from the automated verification and synthesis technology that Synthetic Minds has built.”Joey Krug of Pantera also adds: “Writing secure smart contracts is extremely difficult, imagine if all of NASA’s rockets’ code were open source. It’ll be impossible for humans to detect all potential vulnerabilities a contract could have. Synthetic Minds synthesizes adversarial programs to attempt to find vulnerabilities that developers don’t want to have, but can’t find all on their own, but computers can.”In terms of the adoption of smart contracts to replace intermediaries, this level of correctness adds another edge to the argument. Smart contracts that are not only immutable and secure, but also digitally vetted and correct, offer up an entirely new branch of applications for sensitive applications"

And Litecoin Soar—Here's Why ...","Oct 23, 2018,12:00pm EDT",Getty,"Israel is known as the World’s Startup Nation, so it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the number of blockchain startups in Israel has tripled since the beginning of this year. According to new findings from the Israeli Blockchain Association, there are now more than 200 blockchain startups based in Israel, making the country positioned to become a leading blockchain nation.“Israel has a good chance to strengthen its Startup Nation brand, as well as to become a Blockchain Nation. This growth is happening thanks to effective regulation and close cooperation of many blockchain startups with educational and academic research organizations,” said Gadi Isaev, managing partner of the Israeli Blockchain Association.According to the Israeli Blockchain Association, most Israeli blockchain startups are concentrated in the fintech and protocols/core infrastructure sectors. A large increase was seen in the security sector, which today accounts for 23 startups. It was also noted that since the beginning of the year only 20 blockchain startups have ceased operations.The Israeli Blockchain Association's most complete Israeli Blockchain Startup map that covers more... [+] than 200 startups operating in the blockchain industry.Why The Israeli Blockchain Sector Is BoomingThe Israeli blockchain industry is currently experiencing both a boost and a transformation. On the one hand, we see unprecedented growth among blockchain startups, but on the other hand, many of them are skipping ICOs in favor of equity financing. Today there are fewer startup founders coming out of morally questionable markets, such as Forex, binary trading, and gambling. Instead, more institutional players are starting to enter the market. Thus, the market is going through a self-purification, said Roman Gold, founding partner of the Israeli Blockchain Association.""While Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) were a popular form of “crowdfunding” blockchain startups in 2017, research from Satis Group’s revealed that approximately 80% of ICOs last year were identified as scams. Moreover, new data from Fortune Jack has found that the top ten high-profile ICO scams have swindled $687.4M from unsuspecting investors.As a result of the uncertainty brought about by ICOs, many blockchain startups in Israel have turned to equity financing.We have been through an extremely exuberant phase of ICO funding, which has slowed dramatically. Crypto companies, whether pre or post ICO, are resorting into equity capital raises at more reasonable terms. As the industry is maturing at a rapid pace, I see companies raising equity while also defining token economics, governance, regulation forming and a proactive ecosystem taking steps to create a more sustainable growth trajectory,"" said Mor Asia, cofounder at iCapital.Israel’s regulators have also been keeping pace with the evolving blockchain and cryptocurrency landscape. According to Alex Mashinsky, pioneer of Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) and CEO of Celsius Network, this is due to Israel being the world’s startup nation. As a result, regulators are required to ensure growth.Regulations in Israel have come about because the government there is very open and sensitive to the tech community. Since there are so many startups in Israel, the government is forced to make sure growth isn’t stifled by not passing regulations. Israel is also one of the nations that understands the tremendous amount of capital flowing into this industry. The regulators there have to make sure they are supporting it. Israel has already passed specific laws that have enabled trading and the taxation of cryptocurrencies.""In January, the Israel Tax Authority issued a circular on the taxation of digital tokens. And in March, the Israel Securities Authority released its highly detailed “Interim Report on the Regulation of Decentralized Cryptocurrencies.” Currently the next wave of legislation is expected to define virtual currencies as “financial assets,” while mandating licensing for related services.It's true that Israel has transformed into a blockchain nation with over 200 tech startups in the field, but that alone wasn't surprising given Israel's track record with emerging industries. What's more interesting is Israel's official position on cryptocurrency and the associated regulation and taxation. Israel is working to become a leading jurisdiction globally, not only by providing the adequate frameworks for the current use cases, but considering future implementations in the field,"" Yael Tamar, founder of Top of Blockchain and CCO at VeganNation, told me.Just last week, the Israeli Blockchain Forum hosted a meetup with the Israeli Tax Authority (ITA). In attendance was Roland Am-Shalem, senior deputy director general at the Authority. According to Igal Nevo, CEO of the Israeli Blockchain Forum,Roland declared he believes in the Blockchain industry and confirmed that ITA will do it’s best to establish a clear set of rules for the industry to flourish. Roland suggested the industry will work with ITA to point the problems and possible solutions through the Forum or individually. Roland also said he believes that ITA work in the Blockchain field will influence other authorities to regulate and clarify the field in the near future.Regulations Bring More Innovation: What This Means For IsraelDue to advancing regulations, faster adoption of blockchain technology can be seen throughout the Israeli startup ecosystem.Crypto-focused legislative authorities in Israel combined with the country’s strong cryptography, fintech and software industry create a unique climate for digital currency innovation to thrive. This has infused Israel’s startup nation with energy, creativity and capital as crypto companies, open-source communities and large tech firms form hubs aimed at developing and deploying world-class blockchain technology,"" Eyal hertzog, founder and CEO of Bancor, told me.Moreover, the new regulations being implemented in Israel will facilitate the interaction between the crypto sector and institutional investment and banking services.Recently, the Israeli Supreme Court decided in favor of crypto exchanges, which ruled that banks and other financial institutions must not restrict crypto companies’ access to banking services based on speculative factors such as assumptions of risk. While the new rules may be controversial in some cases, such as the reporting requirements for financial service providers, the move is seen as a major step forward for cryptocurrency regulations and could position Israel as a pioneering force embracing cryptocurrencies and aiding their adoption."

Inside Blockchain's Coronavirus Hiring Spree. I was able to speak ...","Sep 12, 2018,08:33am EDT",Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg,"The Match.com for startups has birthed a relative in the cryptocurrency space. Established in 2010, AngelList has now entered the digital monies space through its new spin-off, Republic. Like its predecessor’s mission of democratizing the investment process, Republic strides to bring Silicon Valley and product investment beyond the lucky few who can afford it by acting as a leader in the U.S. securities sector.A More Robust EcosystemOperating independently from AngelList, the underlying relationship between the two is still key in understanding its strategy in the crypto space.The distinction between Republic and AngelList, is Republic is an investment platform that provides retail investors around the world with compliant access to well-founded startups and blockchain projects. What makes them unique is its core mission in abiding by U.S. equity crowdfunding regulations. Most importantly, it's under the supervision of the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).I was able to speak with Republic’s CEO, Kendrick Nguyen, a former New York securities lawyer, on why Republic’s core strategy of SEC compliance is instrumental in attracting entrepreneurs, investors, and advisors in both the financial and securities sector.Kendrick Nguyen, Esq., Former General Counsel AngelList and CEO of RepublicNguyen told me that at the beginning of his career as a New York securities lawyer, he spent the majority of his time in traditional asset management. “When I joined AngelList as their general counsel, they were just launching their syndicate project, while we were pushing out new financial products from 2014-2016,” explained Nguyen.But, it wasn’t until 2016, that Nguyen launched Republic, and in 2017, Republic launched the Republic Crypto brand.“Nothing is worth doing in my mind, if it’s not meaningful to whomever is working on that project,” Nguyen emphasized. When I asked the CEO what made this AngelList spin off different, he said his focus was on inclusion.“For me, making sure we stay true to the mission of inclusion, is everything,” said Nguyen. “That’s why we launched Republic—to bring Silicon Valley closer to home.""With blockchain technology, we are seeing a challenge, but also a potential in making it more accessible, more understandable, and  providing a mechanism that provides fair access to everyday people. As we work to build that, it most definitely leads to a more robust ecosystem for everyone.”New York Becomes First State To Rule ICO's Are Covered Under U.S. Securities Law While courts have been hesitant to rule on whether or not U.S. securities law are applicable to fraud cases involving cryptocurrency, New York broke the silence on Tuesday, ruling for the first time in American jurisprudence, that U.S. securities laws are applicable for prosecuting crypto fraud allegations. In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Raymond Dearie indicated that federal securities laws should be interpreted ""flexibly,"" after dismissing opposing counsel's motion to dismiss charges on the grounds that cryptocurrencies didn't fall under the Securities Exchange Act.“The question is whether the ‘elements of a profit-seeking business venture’ are sufficiently alleged in the indictment, such that, if proven at trial, a reasonable jury could conclude that ‘investors provide[d] the capital and share[d] in the earnings and profits; [and] the promoters manage[d], control[ed] and operate[d] the enterprise.’ For present purposes, we conclude that they are.” U.S. v. Zaslavskiy, 17-CR-0647, U.S. District Court (E.D. NY, 2018)It's important to note that Judge Dearie's decision did not cite to nor refer to any other cases that have applied federal securities law to crypto-fraud cases. For young attorneys such as myself, this was exciting to see a case of first impression involving crypto, emerge.As we are now beginning to witness, the legal piece is a major component when deciding whether or not to pursue a blockchain venture or cryptocurrency startup, and the former AngelList general counsel agreed with me. “The legal piece is probably more than 50%-60% when it comes to crypto,"" Nguyen emphasized. ""In a brand new industry, it’s such an interval part in productizing and navigating the ways in what appears to be a murky business and legal landscape.”According to Republic’s CEO, he always believed “fintech” to be cutting-edge, especially when dealing with new financial products. As a young millennial attorney, I wanted to know if Nguyen anticipated utilizing his license in this unconventional manner, where law is only part of the business model, rather than its backbone.“I always thought the law was extremely relevant to a business, but I never anticipated that my legal background, particularly in capital markets and securities, would be so crucial to the business and product styles of Republic.”But, Nguyen’s legal experiences were always in established realms, involving fiscally mature ventures. “With hedge funds, there were billions of assets,” explained the attorney. “We dealt with mainstream financial products. I was in academia for two years, and my focus on capital markets was perfect at the time, because that’s right around the time Dodd-Frank was passed, and new laws, regulations, and regulatory guidance were still being rolled out weekly.”In light of Tuesday's New York judicial decision and this summer's Congressional hearings, I wanted to know the direction in which Nguyen believed SEC compliance to be moving. He emphasized great caution to me.“I think for those individuals in the space that are selling, distributing, and/or offering tokens and ignoring U.S. securities regulation, they [obviously] need to be very careful on how far they are from overstepping into an area of complete illegality.”Tuesday's New York ruling evidences Nguyen's words of caution. Having been involved with and in frequent communications with SEC regulators, Nguyen believes the U.S. views this type of regulation in an extremely measured context. “But, at the end of the day, all of the relevant bells and whistles capital markets will come to apply this technology in the crypto-industry, and that’s how it should be.”Unmoved by the current state of U.S. securities law, the former AngelList general counsel was extremely excited by the pace at which securities law is now changing. “I'm very excited to know that for the first time in almost 80 years of American jurisprudence, crowdfunding is providing individuals with the ability to invest in private security; that it would suddenly become possible again,” Nguyen told me.“For attorneys of all ages, it has been an exciting time knowing that even in our legal realm, there’s still so much room for change.”A ‘One Size Fit All’ Solution?Parsing through the excitement and hype involving both blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, entrepreneurs and investors still need to take caution when deciding whether to bring their ventures into the space. There is a real contrast between a business that is attempting to force this new technology into their structure,and those that incorporate it into an already thriving business model.“I think many industries approach their decision on a case-by-case basis,” Nguyen interjected. “These implementations of the technology are still very thin. For example, with A.I., the potential is vast, but we are still waiting for that robot to listen to our commands and move around. Or, how about Google Translate having the ability to summarize an extremely lengthy article for me? Neither of which are at a functional part of their life cycles.”Nguyen agreed with me in that these new technologies are not a universal solution, but we both shared optimism for the vast potential of use cases that will emerge in these new industries.Considering what Republic is doing, I was curious on its competition. According to Nguyen, the competition falls short because of the lack of 'real-world' application. ""We are barely six minutes into this space, and it still requires a great deal of caution. But, it’s also important to enjoy the ride and have optimism in how the future of our technology space will continue to change the world we are living in, for the better.""A New ‘Republic’ For CryptoBy incentivizing it users to take an active interest in their investments, Republic is able to provide access to ICO deals and manage a company’s token sales. Republic takes a small interest in each company it hosts, meaning it acts as an investor in each company, just like participants. Back in June, Republic told CoinDesk, exclusively, in its initial disclosure, that it had raised over $12 million in commitments for its token pre-sale.As a young investor in the space myself, I can appreciate the company’s mission in issuing their own token to incentivize participants in their ecosystem (investors, founders, advisors) to become more active and contribute more. Nguyen told me that by issuing their token, SAFT-EST (""Simple Agreement for Future Equity and Security Tokens""), investors will have the choice between both tokens and shares in the company.With SAFEST, when the token is ready, pre-sale investors will have the option between tokens or up to 20 percent of their investment in equity. In the event Republic is unable to launch the token, investors hold a Simple Agreement for Future Equity, (""SAFE"") convertible into equity at a trigger event.Community Engagement Is EverythingIn any new industry, whether we are talking about crowdfunding or cryptocurrency, integrity and the ability to provide value within a community is vital. There are a plethora of bad actors in the space that aim to confuse and extort others based off their naivety. Republic is not ignorant to the fact that a distinction needs to be made as between credibility and mere puffery.In my conversation with Nguyen, he wanted to avoid any highly technical explanation of what “blockchain technology” is, instead focusing on how broad its application can be in any sector. “I would define blockchain technology as anything that relies on trust and on third-party intermediaries to validate a transaction,” said the CEO. His example was a real estate deed system all the way down to your credit card and banking options.“Utilizing encryption technology enables people to engage directly with it and monetize off of it.”Entrepreneurs, Don’t Force This Into Your ModelWhen starting out, Nguyen advises entrepreneurs not to force blockchain technology into their products or business model, simply out of hope of fundraising or raising large amounts of money. Nguyen and I both agreed that this technology may not always be necessary for the business’ model.“It has to be an authentic use case,” said the CEO. “You must truly believe in it, because if you don’t, investors will see right through that.”Second, it’s important to validate and cross-reference the business model with friends, family, and other entrepreneurs.“You need to have resilience and put conviction into what you’re doing. Understanding the mission of what you are doing is everything.”To You Millennials, Don’t Go AnywhereBut, have no fear, the securities lawyer and CEO had a very different message for young millennial investors, such as myself. In today’s digital age, we are living in a time of engagement. When it comes to starting up investment portfolios, younger investors need to appreciate what they are doing with their money.“You need to put your money where your heart and conviction is, regardless of whether you are a new investor or a veteran,” he commented.#1 –Invest A Small Amount Into Businesses That ‘Speak’ To YouWhether you are a student in college, law school, or grad school—each and every one of you should invest a tiny amount into projects, founders, and/or businesses that speak to you. It’s no different with cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. These are such amazing technologies and the world will change very quickly.When I’m talking tiny amounts, I’m talking $20-$50. Why? At the end of the day, it’s fun, meaningful, and valuable to invest a little, if you can.#2 –Have A Long-Term View On It, and Leave It AloneHaving a long-term view on your investments is crucial. In eight to ten years, you may be surprised on the potential return it brings. Invest a tiny amount, diversify your portfolio, and walk away.#3 –Expect to Lose EverythingBut, most importantly, regardless of your investments in this space, you need to accept one reality. You need to expect to lose everything. That’s just the nature of the market right now, no different than any other stock or investment. But, this has its own educational value on technology and global economics. This allows for you to become a more engaged member of society."

Twenty-eight percent of international families, family offices and family businesses have already been victims of cyber-attacks, according to a new study from Campden Wealth and Schillings, with just one incident costing a family $10 million. Considering that almost 50% of Ultra High Net Worth family wealth is being managed through family offices, it is critical that adequate measures are put in place to defend these firms from the growing threat of increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks.According to Cybersecurity Ventures, projections indicate that the global cost of cyber-crime could reach a staggering $6 Trillion by 2021, with up to 90% of all companies falling victim to cyber-attack. Emile Salawi, head of family offices BNP Paribas, stated in a recent interview: “ Today, cybersecurity is one of the three most important focus areas for family offices. Traditionally, families have relied on banks to exercise necessary governance and compliance requirements when it comes to protecting information and funds, but the time has come for families and family offices to take more responsibility for the protection of their own data, with consideration to the entire information and document flow.”It Starts With An EmailNinety-two percent of all malware is still delivered via email, mostly in the form of targeted phishing attacks, the intent being to trick recipients to download an attachment or click a link. Additionally, executive email accounts are often compromised, allowing fraudsters to impersonate individuals who have the authority to instruct wire transfers or obtain confidential information.Brand New ThreatsOn a daily basis, new threats like Ransomware and Cryptojacking seem to pop out of nowhere, making the viruses from yesteryear seem like child's play. Ransomware, those malicious programs that encrypt your files then demand bitcoin payment to restore them, received much attention in 2017 due to the NotPetya outbreak. The financial impact of this form of malware is often underestimated as the direct ransom cost is estimated to represent only 10% of the full productivity impact. Despite all the hype and publicity around ransomware, by the end of 2017 it was Cryptojacking that had become the most popular form of cyber-crime with 90% of remote code execution attacks involving the unauthorized use of other people’s computers to mine cryptocurrency.Social NetworkingSocial networking has fast become the preferred communication platform for both individuals and businesses, with sites such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter dominating the social media landscape.

last year, as the cryptocurrency traded above $19,000 before falling 80%.","Nov 12, 2018,08:47am EST","Cannabis, cryptocurrencies, artificial ntelligence and autonomous driving are just some of the “hot” investment themes investors are chasing. Of course most know that these early-stage investments come with risks, but as the bull market roars on in its tenth year, investors and in some cases their advisors, are ignoring risks and are letting greed take over.","Historically, when markets are at all-time highs, occurrences of fraud rise as the allure of ‘easy money’ can cause even sophisticated and smart investors to become susceptible to fraud.A friend recently reminded me of a once-famous story of fraud; the chronicle of ZZZZ Best and Ken Berman. Ken is a professional investor and advisor and his story offers a cautionary tale about how even the smartest investors can get taken in by CEOs who are really con men.Many of you may be too young to remember ZZZZ Best, a carpet cleaning company, but in 1987, it was an Enron-sized fraud that sent 22-year-old wunderkind and CEO Barry Minkow to jail. Earlier this year movie called Con Man told Minkow’s story, whose fraud, regrettably, did not end with ZZZZ Best.Berman’s story may be more instructive, since it can help safeguard investors, and because with some 30 years to think about how a con man CEO took all of his money, Berman has identified some red flags that all investors would do well to keep in mind, especially when ‘chasing’ “hot” investments in nascent industries that are lightly regulated.“I was so completely mesmerized by Barry Minkow,” Berman says.  “His enthusiasm.  His unshakable faith in the prospects for his company and all of the media attention he was getting. When I bought 700 shares—about $15,000 and a lot of money for me back then—I was convinced they would make me a millionaire.”  This sounds eerily similar to some of the froth around bitcoin this time last year, as the cryptocurrency traded above $19,000 before falling 80%.Today, Berman says the items below are the warning signs a CEO might be a fraud.  Some of them are right on the surface, and some of them require a little digging to find.Outsized media exposure.  Berman said that one thing that drew him in was Minkow’s relentless presence in the media. “He was everywhere,” say Berman, “and all of the coverage was glowing, until it wasn’t of course, but that was too late for me.”Berman is onto something here. After all, one of the most expensive and valuable resources a company has is the CEO’s time and talking to the press has no impact on sales, expenses, earnings and the myriad issues that make a company grow. When a CEO spends a lot of timing wooing another, likely irrelevant audience through the press, it suggests there is another, unseen agenda, and it’s this hidden agenda where fraud can hide.Encourages employees to buy stock. If you hear this, run for the hills says Berman. A more recent and well-known example of this red flag look no further than the late, and disgraced Enron CEO Kenneth Lay who exhorted employees to buy Enron stock and “talk up the stock” to friends and relatives just weeks before it reported its worst results ever. Ultimately, Enron when down in flames.Outsized pay. Young companies don’t make a lot of money, as they should be reinvesting revenues for growth. Outsized CEO pay should be viewed suspiciously. Berman told me that when he looks at companies today with a view toward sniffing out anything fishy, he looks for CEO pay that is out of proportion to the company’s performance or simply excessive pay. In Minkow’s case, this was hard to see since he was inflating the company’s financial performance.But there are plenty of examples where large CEO pay has been a harbinger of fraud or CEO misdeeds. At Countrywide Financial, CEO Angelo Mozilo paid himself some $470 million before reaching a $67.5 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over securities fraud and insider trading charges.Investors lost billions as the stock price fell approximately 90% from a high around $42 to $4.25 before it was bought by Bank of America. Since then, Bank of America has racked up losses of more than $50 billion with Countrywide.No-name accountants. Berman says that when he sees the use of auditor that no one has ever heard of, it’s a red flag. “Reputation matters,” Berman told me. “And when the reputation of allied professionals can’t be established, or is called into question, the circumstances are ripe for the CEO to commit fraud.”The most well-known example of no-name professionals aiding and abetting massive fraud happened in the case of Bernie Madoff. Even as his business mushroomed into a multibillion-dollar operation, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities relied on tiny Friehling & Horowitz, a three person operation in remote New City, New York.  One of the firm’s named founders, David Friehling, pled guilty to securities fraud in one of the largest Ponzi schemes ever, but served only a year of home detention because of his extensive cooperation with the feds.Of course, zeroing in on the accountants is not a silver bullet, Berman says.  ZZZZ Best used Ernst & Whiney—at the time a ‘Big Eight’ accounting firm—and giant Arthur Andersen was brought down by its client Enron. Arthur Andersen was also the auditor for WorldCom.Obsession with short sellers.  The best way to prove a short seller wrong is to grow revenues and consequently earnings. But when the CEO is more concerned with what the short sellers are saying than in delivering results, it’s a red flag.” Of course, short selling is not in and of itself evidence of CEO fraud. And short sellers can be wrong. Bill Ackman waged a brutal five-year war against Herbalife, calling the company a massive pyramid scheme, but ultimately unwound his short position with nothing to show for it but losses. Still, short sellers sniffed out fraud at Enron, Tyco, Conseco and Lernout & Hauspie Speech Products. “When short sellers are circling and the CEO is overly vocal they’re wrong, there are probably better places to invest your hard earned money,” Berman believes.If you’re considering investing, or really speculating, on small ‘up and coming’ businesses in “hot” areas, take a step back on consider the points that Ken Berman makes to help reduce the risk of having your investment evaporate.---- "

as a distributed ledger to ensure that data isn't tampered with.","Sep 25, 2018,09:00am EDT","
 ","Personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users was obtained by Cambridge Analytica to influence voter opinion for a number of politicians in the recently leaked Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal. As more personal data is compromised, the way in which data is stored and obtained comes into question. Putting users in control of their own data has become a top priority.In terms of technical change for the way in which data is managed, blockchain technology is gaining momentum. The global research firm, Gartner, predicts that the business value of blockchain will reach nearly $200 billion by 2025, with a good portion of this being applied to data storage. And although the market is still in its infancy, a number of companies are creating blockchain-based data storage solutions to provide users with full control over their personal data.Antoine Verdon, co-founder of Proxeus, a swiss-based startup that has just released a data storage DApp to give users total control over their digital identity, believes that traditional cloud storage will be massively disrupted in the near future.“Used smartly, blockchains will unlock more flexible ways to store data, while giving users better control over their personal information,” Verdon told me.As opposed to centralized cloud storage services, like Google Drive for example (which stores all files, including deleted files in its system), decentralized blockchain network data files are broken apart and spread across multiple nodes. This process is called sharding. These files are encrypted with a private key, which makes it impossible for any other node participating in the network to look at the file. Sharding ensures that files are just a fraction of their original self, which means reading their entire content is impossible.Verdon thinks Proxeus can compete with established companies like Dropbox by offering better user security through sharding methods.Proxeus users can manage several storage providers under one single identity and can store data at different locations depending on their needs, all within one app. The user also “holds the key” to every file, letting them decide who has access to their data, and when it is to be removed - all backed by the immutability of the blockchain. And Proxeus complies to data privacy laws by allowing users to grant and revoke access to their data via a storage smart contract, said Verdon.Legal and Regulatory ChallengesWhile technical advances with blockchain technology are being created to keep user data private, legal and compliance issues have developed. For example, the “right to be forgotten,” which is Art. 17 of the GDPR, challenges the notions of how data is stored across blockchain networks.If you store data on-chain, you cannot comply with data regulations because the data becomes immutable, which is the whole point of a blockchain. What I think is a more viable solution is to do all the processing and storage off-chain, possibly encrypted, and only use the blockchain to store the data hash, to prove that a computation happened and to log the data access. Basically, to store metadata rather than actual data, Rand Hindi, CEO of Snips, told me.Moreover, with increasing regulation governing personal data and privacy, there is a growing need for tracking when and with whom data has been shared with, and whether this access is still granted or has been revoked.According to Verdon, this permission layer will be moved to the blockchain, which will have implications on the business model of cloud providers.“Instead of providing subscriptions to individuals, blockchain-data storage solutions, like Proxeus, will have the possibility to charge a price based on file size and duration to anonymous crypto-identities from all around the world,” said Verdon.Is The World Ready For Blockchain-Based Data Storage?Blockchain solutions aim to put control of data into the hands of the user, yet developments are still underway. Also, Gartner predicts that nearly all of the blockchain platforms implemented through 2021, “will require replacement within 18 months to remain competitive and secure, and to avoid obsolescence.”Skepticism also remains. According to Michael “Monty” Widenius, the main author of the original version of the open source MySQL database and CTO of MariaDB, “A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography. When it's come to storage, it can only be used as a ledger to ensure that nobody had changed the data. When it comes to cloud storage, it's easy to add extra security if needed to verify that no one has tampered with the data by leveraging public and private storage that cloud vendors can't access (for example private checksums of all files).”Widenius also notes that cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin, uses the blockchain as a distributed ledger to ensure that data isn’t tampered with. However, this method is inefficient, slow and impractical for general data storage, and especially not for databases that need a high transaction rate.Zane Witherspoon, CTO of Dispatch Labs, also mentioned that cloud storage centers still have many economic benefits over blockchain-based storage solutions.Cloud data centers still have the economies of scale on their side, but we’re seeing an emergence of distributed alternatives for data storage called “fog” storage. The reason I don’t believe blockchain based distributed data storage will replace traditional cloud storage is because they have two totally different value propositions. Cloud storage is optimized for speed and efficiency, while fog storage better suited for fault-tolerance and data-sovereignty. Most of the idealists in the blockchain industry believe whole-heartedly that someday everything will be tracked on the blockchain. Today, blockchain technology can’t touch much more than money, though, Witherspoon told me."

Schwager profiles dozens of top day traders from multiple industries.He draws on his extensive interviews to explain ways many traders believe the markets reward people financially—or teach valuable life lessons.Schwager proposes lessons from the market apply to business and life in general. He even recounts how a church minister used trading principles to build a congregation.Now, it is hard to get further from trading than the ministry, yet the same key elements seemed to apply. I suspect there are some common principles of success, and I have simply discovered them through the perspective of great traders.Even if you're not interested in day trading, you can learn from successful traders to become more productive at work or to scale your business.Manage your risks""First, if you never bet your lifestyle, from a trading standpoint, nothing bad will ever happen to you. Second, if you know what the worst possible outcome is, it gives you tremendous freedom.” - Larry Hite, hedge fund managerIn Market Wizards, Hite describes to Schwager a time when a top coffee distributor invited Hite to his house in London to chat about a business idea. The distributor asked him about trading coffee, explaining he knew almost everything about the industry.Hite's advice was simple: Manage the risks involved.Three months later, Hite discovered this distributor turned coffee trader had lost more than $100 million.Hite explained to Schwager the new trader failed to manage risks and had over invested in coffee. Unlike this struggling coffee trader, Hite never risks more than 1% of total equity on any trade. This approach prevents him from losing money as quickly as this coffee trader.Building up a side business is an effective way to manage the risks of being fired. Similarly, learning a new skill unrelated to your day job will help manage the risks of being replaced by technology.Technology via ShutterstockKnow when to get out ""I instinctively trade smaller, and sometimes I just take a break. It is a good habit to wipe the slate clean and start fresh.” - Brian Gelber, broker turned traderSuccessful market traders know when to get out of a risky trade because they don't want to lose all of their stake or their clients' investments.In other words, they avoid becoming emotional about breaking past commitments. Knowing when to get out applies to business too.For example,  say you spent dozens of hours creating an online course you believe will solve problems for your customers.However, despite your best marketing efforts, only a handful of leads buy the course and certainly not enough to justify the time and money you've invested in it.Instead of doubling down and trying to improve the quality of the course, you could get out altogether and create a new offer, for example, a coaching program.Similarly, you might have invested a year or two of your career in a company that isn't doing well. Rather than clinging to the time you've already sunk into this business, prepare a plan for moving on before circumstances intervene.Diversify""I’m extremely well diversified. My thought process is that if I screw up in one place, I’ll always have a life preserver someplace else.” - Marty Schwartz, champion traderBusinessman via ShutterstockSuccessful traders avoid financial ruin through diversification. Many of them avoid going all in on one trade or one asset class. Instead, they typically allocate no more than 5% of capital to a particular trade.Consider your profession as a single asset. It might offer valuable returns come payday, but can you diversify?If you're a copywriter, you could learn other skills such as how to create Facebook advertisements. If you're a graphic designer, you could learn how to design or develop websites.If you run your own business, multiple products represent diversification too. For example, Ramit Sethi, a personal finance advisor and entrepreneur who writes at I Will Teach You to be Rich, offers courses in topics ranging from personal financial management to productivity to starting an online business.Finding success like a top traderDay traders typically have one goal: To generate a return on investment for themselves or their clients.Even if the price of gold or Bitcoin doesn't keep you up at night, you can draw upon the mindsets of successful traders to find success at home or in work. "

[+] Tuesday, Oct. 17, 2017, in New York. (Photo by Andy Kropa/Invision/AP)","The blockchain-based crowdfunding platform Pledgecamp has raised $17 million in a private funding round and is advised by Randi Zuckerberg (Founder/CEO Zuckerberg Media), Matt Curcio (VP Data at Ripple), and Keith Teare (Founding shareholder at Techcrunch) in the lead up to its $3 million public token sale. Founded by Kickstarter serial crowdfunding veterans Jae Choi, Eddie Lee, and Sam Pullman, the San Francisco company is trying to change the current crowdfunding model with a Backer Insurance escrow model that uses smart contracts. Choi, Lee, and Pullman launched several crowdfunding campaigns on Kickstarter, raising $2.2 million, which remains in the top 1 percent of campaigns on the platform. However, they claim to have realized the inefficiencies for participants -- particularly investors -- in a startup project. Investors are burned by projects that fail to deliver and are usually left with little recourse to recover funding. The subpar outcomes are a result of misaligned incentives between participants in the process, they claim.According to “The Economics of Crowdfunding” written by Cumming and Hornuf, of all the projects on Kickstarter, up to 85 percent of them delay product delivery while 14 percent do not deliver at all. Further, the incentives of centralized platforms do not match the market participants. “If platforms intend to operate in the market over a considerable period of time, they should, in line with Rochet and Tirole (2003), have good incentives to serve the interest of all market participants including the investors,"" They say.Intermediary platforms such as Kickstarter receive their portion of the fundraising campaign through a listing fee, which is collected regardless of the outcome of product delivery. Therefore, the incentive for the platform lies with the success of the fundraising campaign rather than the result. According to advisor and media figure Randi Zuckerberg, “You can do a lot with crowdfunding to support entrepreneurs, but it’s still a bit of an antiquated model because backers put money into projects and they don’t always know if that project is going to pan out. Especially in this new economy, there’s a lot of trust that goes into interactions with strangers. It’s going to be more and more essential where we develop mechanisms where money is held in escrow or is phased out depending on certain milestones being reached.” Pledgecamp uses a blockchain-powered platform that creates a decentralized market where incentives are aligned. Creators can make campaign deposits where providing transparency to backers through items such as identification documents, business plans and intellectual property registrations help earn their deposit back. Rather than centralized platform control, the ecosystem of participants governs the curation of campaigns, reducing barriers to entry and improving scalability. Assurances for backers (investors) are accomplished through Backer Insurance smart contracts that hold the native token in escrow for funded projects. Backers subsequently can vote on the approval of pre-determined milestones and can receive a portion of their funds back if the project fails to deliver. “If crowdfunding 1.0 was about opportunity, crowdfunding 2.0 is defined by accountability,"" says Jae Choi, the CEO. ""It’s a perfect moment to apply this new technology to a long-standing problem.” The inherent ability of blockchains to create trust-minimized, decentralized marketplaces has also opened the door for projects to utilize the “Wisdom of the Crowd.” Platforms such as the Ethereum-based Augur prediction market are predicated on this concept and drive honest market curation through a token incentive structure. Pledgecamp supplements their crowdfunding model with an open and decentralized marketplace for participants to contribute skills to startups as part of the broader ecosystem. Crowdfunding is a multi-billion dollar industry that is on a collision course with the emerging technology of blockchains. The next-generation of crowdfunding will empower creators and investors in a global ecosystem to build innovative solutions by overcoming the problems of trust and accountability. That said, time will tell if the world needs a blockchain-based Kickstarter, and if the crowd is interested in adopting the new currency and format."

[+] startups. (Photo by: Andrew Lipovsky/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images),"We are at an inflection point in the trajectory of blockchain tech and music product development.In this space and now in book form, I have been chronicling the application of blockchain tech to the music industry from the beginning. I’ve pulled back a bit from writing about this topic of late and have focused on working and advising in the space, in my role as Lead Researcher with the Open Music Initiative and as a consultant in conjunction with ATC Management for Intel. But I return now to sound an alarm.I hope that I’m wrong, and that this piece and its soon-to-come followup will be rendered moot the moment they are published via a product or startup that utilizes blockchain’s unique technical attributes to successfully achieve product/market fit.To be sure, the crypto markets, and thus blockchain tech by association, are currently in a position that I refer to as the Trough of Despair. This is the stage where all new technologies (and products, and relationships, and humans) find themselves after the initial thrust of excitement has worn off and the challenges to what had seemed like a slam dunk of a concept have emerged. Some technologies reverse course and claw their way back up from this trough by embracing a ""purpose, not product"" approach. But many, perhaps most, technologies — like most startups, relationships, etc. — do not. They die in the trough.Blockchain Tech Has Achieved A State Of AntifragilityI am very confident that blockchain technology will persevere. This technology is not as new as most would have you believe — Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta were implementing rudimentary blockchain tech back in the early 1990s while Satoshi Nakamoto was likely impressing his/her/their grade school friends with mad Rubik Cube prowess — and it has, via its successful implementation across a range of industries, reached a stage of “antifragility,” as defined by the brilliant Nassim Nicholas Taleb.An antifragile state means that adverse circumstances now only extend blockchain technology’s long-term strength and durability. For example, code exploitations are now increasingly rare because not only was the code improved to address the initial weakness but these exploitations led to the discovery and addressing of other vulnerabilities. Thus, rather than being taken down by these attacks (“fragility”) or simply enduring them (“resiliency”/“robustness”), the technology has become stronger and more likely to endure because of the “threats.”Certainly there is no guarantee that any of the current crypto currencies, their associated blockchains or the vast number of companies that attempted to cash in on the ICO crypto-rush will survive. However, I believe strongly that blockchain technology is not going anywhere and, in fact, is beginning to arrive at a state that pretty much guarantees long-term technological durability. To wit, this recent New York Times piece: From Farm to Blockchain: Walmart Tracks Its Lettuce.Blockchain As A Technical Solution For Music Is Very FragileSadly, I am much less sanguine when it comes to blockchain tech music startups. For a variety of reasons, I’m not going to specifically name those that I feel are unlikely to make it (most of them) or those that I think have a shot (very few), but the fact remains that it is very difficult to point to any example of real product/market fit in terms of adoption.Still, rather than citing examples — as a serial entrepreneur myself, I am all too aware of the challenges faced in this line of work — I’m going to define what I believe to be the key points of failure that far too many of these music startups continue to stumble over. I do this with the enduring hope that some will be able to reverse course and that new entrants will begin with these points in mind.The Howard TestAs a nod to the Howey Test — the guidelines used to determine whether a transaction qualifies as a security (and thus is governed by the SEC), which of late have been much in the minds of those contemplating ICOs — I’m going to jokingly refer to these points as the Howard Test.I carefully laid out these exact points several months ago at a conference in Berlin; there is (NSFW) video evidence of this. In any case, forthwith are two of the four points of failure any blockchain-based music company must avoid. Doing so, of course, will not guarantee success. However, ignoring them all but guarantees failure.Ignoring Or Being Unaware Of The Fundamental Structure Of Music CopyrightsUnlike other copyrightable intellectual property, a song will almost always have two separate and distinct copyrights. One is owned or controlled by the songwriter/publisher of the song and is the copyright for the composition: the melody and lyric, the song itself. The other is owned or controlled by the performer/label that recorded/released the song and is the copyright for the sound recording: the specific version or rendition of the song.For example, Dolly Parton wrote a song entitled “I Will Always Love You.” She and her publisher are the owners of the copyright to the composition of this song.Many years after she wrote it, Whitney Houston recorded a version of the song that appeared on an album released by Arista Records; Arista owns the copyright of this rendition of the song — but not the song itself. In fact, Arista must secure a license from and pay a royalty to Parton/her publisher in order for Houston’s version of this song to be released without infringing on Parton’s exclusive rights. Certainly, there are many, many songs that are both written and performed by the same person. And increasingly, there are singer/songwriters who are by either design or default acting as their own publishers and labels. However, there are vast, vast numbers of songs that make the rights soup described above seem simple.For example, not only are many songs today versions of someone else’s song (“covers”), but the “someone else” might be literally dozens of writers. Check out the songwriting credits, for example, on a Beyoncé song. Additionally, the songs are often full of samples or are mashups.No one is to blame for this. This type of songwriting-via-assembly-and-collaboration is very natural, and technological advances have made doing so incredibly simple. The culture — both technology-enabled creators and music fans — wants these types of works. Laws, however, tend to lag behind culture, and there is currently no scaleable legal solution to address, for example, the licensing of samples. Because of this complexity surrounding music copyrights, those who attempt to populate their blockchain-based music services with works that are not owned or controlled by a single rightsholder — I’ll use the term “controlled compositions” as shorthand for these works — are doomed to find themselves mired in a sea of lawsuits and/or insurmountable licensing challenges.Thus, Rule No. 1 is to understand the complexities of music copyrights and to avoid building a business that requires a large number of songs that are not controlled compositions.Overestimating The Current State Of The Art With Respect To Smart Contract Technology A core advantage of blockchain tech is the ability for a set of machine-readable rules to be programmed that, when met, enable transactions to occur without the need of intermediaries. This feature is known as a “smart contract.” Currently, smart contract technology works exceedingly well when what is programmed are binary rules that are not dependent on multiple-party sign-off: that is, a simple “if this, then that” dynamic between entities. This is why the transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain work, and it’s why supply-chain management has embraced blockchain tech.However, if for a transaction to occur numerous complicated rules and multiple stakeholders must sign off, smart contracts are currently not able to manage this at the speed or cost necessary to scale.Therefore, those attempting to utilize blockchain tech to facilitate complex licensing as part of their business’ core competency should proceed with caution. It is one thing to construct a business that employs a smart contract to facilitate a transaction with a rightsholder authorized to construct a dynamic that states, for example, “Upon a single rule being satisfied, I authorize the party who satisfies this rule to utilize my work.” It is a completely different situation when one attempts to construct a smart contract to accommodate anything close to the following: “Upon several different rules being satisfied and verified, and upon approval and acceptance of this satisfaction by the following 11 songwriters; their respective publishers, sub-publishers, administrators, co-publishers, labels, affiliates and estates; the rightsholders for the various interested parties who have granted the rights to any and all derivatives; and, notwithstanding the forgoing, their respective publishers, subpublishers and labels, authorization will be granted.""This is simply not going to happen with the current state of the technical ability of blockchain-based smart contracts. Even if smart contracts could handle this type of complexity, the amount of time, energy and money to power it would be massive. Certainly, Moore’s Law-accelerated technological development is on the side of rapid improvement, but it’s going to be a while. And the above example, with a multitude of parties, is not the exception, particularly when it comes to popular songs.Thus, Rule No. 2 is to not overestimate the current state of the art with respect to smart contract technology.These are two of the four rules that make up the Howard Test. I will shortly post the second part of this piece, which details the remaining rules. Unless, that is, some savvy entrepreneur develops or demonstrates a blockchain-based music product that has gained at least a toehold of product/market fit — then, my work here will be done."

Hyperledger, the umbrella project for open source distributed ledger technology frameworks such as Fabric and Sawtooth, and EEA - a standards body promoting the adoption of Ethereum by businesses, have respectively joined one another’s organization, with the shared goal of driving mass adoption of blockchain among companies and fostering greater collaboration across the two communities. “This is a time of great opportunity,” said Ron Resnick, executive director of the EEA, said in a statement. “Collaborating through mutual associate membership provides more opportunities for both organizations to work more closely together.”The new arrangement will facilitate greater cross-pollination among the leadership and communities of the respective organizations. For instance, Hyperledger developers who join EEA can participate in EEA certification programs, and EEA members working on specifications and standards can work on Hyperledger to help implement those standards. ""Great open standards depend upon great open source code, so this is a natural alliance for both organizations,"" Hyperledger executive director Brian Behlendorf said in a statement. With Hyperledger serving as a storehouse for numerous DLT codebases and EEA focused on helping to adapt Ethereum for enterprise use, the announcement largely codifies collaborative work that has already been occurring in an informal capacity. “There are already several organizations that belong to both Hyperledger and EEA, and good relationships among those in leadership positions,” said Amber Baldet, founder of Clovyr, a decentralized app store, and former blockchain lead at JPMorgan Chase who has been closely involved in both groups. “It makes sense to work together toward the common goal of solving real business challenges with decentralized technologies.”Burying the hatchet?The new partnership also figures to put to rest the narrative that EEA and Hyperledger are in a knife fight with one another for enterprise blockchain supremacy. While this may have been true in the past, explained Casey Kuhlman, CEO of Monax, it is not indicative of the current state of play:“Historically, under previous leadership, the EEA seemed to view itself as being in competition with Hyperledger. I must say that was under previous leadership of that body.” Monax became one of the first companies to join both organizations in early 2017.  An Ethereum-based contracting platform, it submitted a codebase to Hyperledger for incubation that eventually was eventually rolled out as Hyperledger Burrow, an Apache-licensed implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine bytecode interpreter. Support for the EVM is also now available on other Hyperledger frameworks like Fabric and Sawtooth. “My hope with this announcement is that the market will more keenly understand that asking ‘Will you use Hyperledger or Ethereum?’ for a particular use case is a nonsensical question - on both sides of the equation,” Kuhlman added. Bob Summerwill, Blockchain Lead at Quantfury and a developer who has been involved significantly in both projects, concurred. “We are really seeing the bridging of a chasm which has existed for nearly three years - mainly in people's minds, but that misunderstanding has been impactful in itself,"" he said. “They were never directly competitive, but it looked that way to some people because the participants did not have a very broad overlap in their Venn Diagrams.”Springboard for enterprise adoptionThis new collaborative model featuring an open source codebase and third-party standards organization, which brings more vendors of choice and a certification program, figures to smoothen the onramp for companies looking to deploy blockchain but find themselves overly-hesitant to commit due to concerns over interoperability and vendor lock-in.“I talk to biggest companies in the world, and they love the idea of what has been patterned in other market segments,” Resnick told Forbes. “What I typically get is: ‘We love it, we want to be part of it.’ Bringing in Hyperledger, all it does is build greater confidence among these enterprises.”As such, the news is an indicator that the lines between permissioned blockchains and open, public blockchains are continuing to blur, and that enterprise blockchain could be the driving narrative of 2019 after taking a backseat to public blockchain momentum over the last 18 months - though further work on specifications and certifications is still required. ""Progress on open source projects informs standardization efforts. Those efforts in turn help to commoditize the lower layers of the software stack so that higher value systems can be built on top,"" said Summerwill.Baldet predicts that leading incumbent institutions will be moving ahead with blockchain pilots over the next six months, though these will largely be focused around improving existing business process through mutualizing infrastructure and data sharing. “The truly disruptive uses of blockchain technology, however, won't happen until the vast majority of smaller businesses who can't afford the high cost of experimentation now can begin to work together to challenge industry leaders.”"

The growing number of art-tech startups aiming to bring greater transparency and transactional security to the industry as well as the adoption of the technology among the top players definitely indicates so! In order to best understand what blockchain can bring to the art market, let’s take a look at the main ways that it can be utilized, as well as the opportunities and challenges that they present.1. Tracking provenance.First of all, thanks to blockchain technology, all information about an artwork can now be securely stored in a tamper-proof system. As fakes and forgeries continue being a big issue, this solution promises to become a game-changer for artists, collectors and institutions.Many are asking: What happens if the information that’s entered into the blockchain database is false or inaccurate? The question of connecting a physical work of art to the blockchain registry still remains open despite several technological solutions that are coming up in the market. At the end of the day, the recorded information is only as reliable as the people who plug it in.
2. Democratizing art investments.A few art-tech startups offer fractional ownership of artworks, presenting a rather low threshold for potential investors to diversify their portfolios. Imagine how easy it is now to boast at a dinner party about the piece of the Warhol you own. Whether that fraction is one-thousandth or one quarter is almost irrelevant. The fact is that you can now have a stake in a masterpiece!The art market, however, is not extremely liquid, which means that some investors will have to wait for a while to see a significant profit. Also, more traditional collectors might find it hard to accept why they should own a tiny portion of something that they cannot enjoy on their walls in real life.3. Limited editions of digital art are now possible.For the first time ever, limited editions of digital art are possible thanks to blockchain technology. Digital artists can create limited editions of their works, providing a new way to grow their market. Previously, the bane of digital art has been the fact that it's easy to copy and pirate.Anne Bracegirdle, Associate Vice-President and Photography Specialist at Christie’s, points out that the application of blockchain is a perfect solution for the security of digital art. ‘It can create a self-contained, decentralized and democratic ecosystem where the provenance of works, payments and copyright are built in. A recent revelation was the surprising level of interest in the field — earlier this year a single work sold for $140,000'.So, what happens next? Christie’s Auction House has recently announced that it’s going to record the upcoming sale of a major art collection on blockchain. Does it mean that the art market is ready to be technologically revolutionized? The future will show!"

[+] South Korean media say North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has watched a rare performance by South Korean pop stars visiting Pyongyang. (Korea Pool via AP)","Two of South Korea’s largest media companies have teamed up with upstart blockchain video content platform Theta Labs in an effort to drive viewer engagement in one of Asia’s hottest economies. MBN, a division of Maekyung Media Group - a large player in South Korea’s communications and broadcasting realm, and CJ Hello - a subsidiary of one of the nation’s largest cable television and mobile providers will use Theta’s decentralized video restreaming platform to broaden their geographic reach and strengthen customer engagement and retention. The companies serve as key producers and distributors of South Korean television and music, such K-Pop, which has also become popular in other parts of East Asia and around the world.“These partnerships are like announcing deals with Comcast and Turner Media at the same time, and mark a major step toward taking blockchain technology to the mainstream and inventing the future of media,” Mitch Liu, CEO of Theta Labs, said, telling Forbes that:“These partnerships are hugely significant for us and they are hugely significant for the blockchain industry as a whole.”Theta’s blockchain-powered content delivery network provides Theta token rewards to customers who restream video content using excess bandwidth available on their electronic devices, thereby increasing the amount of quality video streams available in a given region and affording cheaper distribution costs and larger potential viewership for the distributor. “Speaking from my media experience working at YouTube Korea and Naver, the battle for consumer attention is fiercer than ever with a sea of content on every device from set top boxes to mobile and web desktop” said Yooshim (Karen) Huh, Senior Vice President of CJ Hello, adding that the partnership in his eyes is a true long-term strategic growth play: “Theta’s new blockchain model provides a valuable weapon to stand out and encourage users to spend more time with content we’re already delivering, from hit TV shows to K-pop.”MBN and CJ Hello, both part of larger conglomerates, will give customers who earn Theta tokens the ability to redeem those for products and services across different verticals of their respective enterprises, creating a loyalty mechanism that rewards and retains customers.Liu, who describes his  project as an AirBnB or Uber of excess bandwidth resources, says that the potential cost savings his model proposal has generated immediate interest among high-level media players:“These big platforms today spend a lot of money - millions of dollars a month delivering video streams. Our network can offload a big chunk of that.”Further, results from a testnet partnership with Sliver.tv - the popular e-sports content provider - supported the viewer engagement thesis. The site realized a 70% increase in total monthly visits during the test run and an average viewing time of 31 minutes, three times that of similar channels during that period. “Theta’s impressive early results from June convinced us to take a closer look at Theta as a media blockchain partner to build a decentralized video delivery network,” said Mr. Ryu Ho-Gil, CEO of MBN. “We’re excited to collaborate with Theta to achieve three key business goals, deepen user engagement and session times across our platform, reduce content delivery costs and drive increased market share."" The announcement comes amid a resurgent interest in blockchain technology and applications in South Korea. While the country took the aggressive step of banning initial coin offerings last September - an approach it is reportedly looking to lighten - it is been aggressively promoting other types of blockchain use cases, as Forbes has reported previously.For example, the country announced a $200M blockchain investment fund last summer. “If you look at South Korea, they’ve always been at the forefront of cutting edge technologies,” Liu concluded. ""That remains true also for blockchain technology.”"

And Litecoin Soar—Here's Why ...","Oct 31, 2018,06:00am EDT",MBS CEO Eman Pulis,"All eyes are on Malta over the next few days as one of the most hotly anticipated events in the crypto and blockchain world kicks off later today. The Malta Blockchain Summit organizers told me that they are expecting over 5000 delegates with a raft of speakers that can claim to be the Who's Who of this space.I spoke with Eman Pulis, the summit's chief organizer, and CEO on an exclusive basis where we shared various thoughts on how this event can be a game changer for Malta.So why is Malta being called the Blockchain Island and what does this mean for the local economy?'Malta has put in the hard work to earn its title as the Blockchain Island. Government backing has created a haven for Crypto companies to flourish here in Malta. The legislative action which passed through parliament this summer has instigated a sense of security and stability, qualities which have lured some of the biggest companies in the industry to Malta. Top cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and OKEx have already relocated, with others sure to follow – bringing an abundance of investment and employment opportunities with them and potentially transforming the island’s infrastructure. The relocation of foreign companies is also a boon to other industries in Malta, such as the hospitality sector, particularly when it comes to avenues focusing on entertainment, leisure and real estate'.Valletta, MaltaEman continued by reflecting that the Maltese parliament passed three regulatory bills in July this year, with the goal of driving innovation and setting up a regulatory framework for blockchain companies to operate within.'The Maltese government has been clear about its desire to turn Malta into a blockchain hub, and so far has been true to its word, offering support at all levels for the emerging technology to flourish. The response to the proposed regulation has been overwhelmingly positive – with the impact already being felt in terms of economic growth and development'.There has been a lot of talk that the blockchain and gaming industries certainly can go together. With his background of organizing huge events for the gaming industry such as SiGMA, Pulis certainly has a grasp on what can be achieved with both industries merging together.'The gaming industry is a prime candidate for disruption. Diminished trust in the marketplace can lead down a path of segregated, centralized trading platforms with excessive trading fees. Fraud is also rife in the online virtual goods market, making values such as security and transparency essential for players creating profiles, including when buying, selling, or storing in-game assets. In light of this, SiGMA will, for the second year running, be hosting a blockchain conference for a high-level discussion of the emerging tech and its implications for iGaming', Pulis added.Valletta, Malta's capitalPulis also believed that the legislation has definitely helped curate a positive energy amongst people from the Blockchain sphere, companies operating here or considering relocation have found a sense of security and welcome. At a government level, there’s a great willingness to embrace this technology and apply it in positive ways to the Maltese infrastructure. 'There’s definitely a feeling of being inspired and wanting to get things done', he says.Finally, it looks like another area where Malta is going for it is the esports sector. What does Eman think of that?'It’s great to see incentives encouraging eSports companies to establish themselves in Malta; this can only be a positive thing for our economy. Malta has a lot to offer companies considering relocation, from good weather and excellent hospitality services to a solid regulatory framework', Eman concludes.The Summit has also attracted interest from other industries that overlap with and compliment block tech. Representing advancement in the AI sphere is the latest in humanoid robotics from Hanson Robotics - Sophia. Sophia will join her creator for a fireside chat during the Marketing and Investment conference.Accolades include becoming the first ever robot to be granted citizenship anywhere in the world, as well as being named the world’s first United Nation Innovation Champion by the United Nations Development Program, where she will have a working role with UNDP to promote sustainable development and safeguard human rights and equality.MBS logoThe Summit agenda also includes a Hackathon. Lured by a €50 thousand prize, 16 blockchain teams are already confirmed to compete. The Hackathon is backed by a number of sponsors, such as e Toro, Dao. Casino, Snips, and IOST. The competition will be mentored by industry luminaries such including John McAfee, Noam Eppel, Jimmy Zhong, and Mikhail Savchenko, amongst others.An ICO Pitch is also on the books. 37 ICOs will bump elbows with 1000 investors in the Pitch room, before facing 18 savvy investors from the judging panel. The Pitch is partnered with d10e and comes with an impressive $ 100,000 prize pool.The summit will be held on the 1st and 2nd of November at the Intercontinental Hotel, St Julian’s, Malta, and brings with it four conferences and a considerable expo floor. Highlights, apart from those already mentioned include a Blockchain Awards ceremony and a Crypto Cruise. Not a bad place to be, I guess."

Satoshi Nakamoto's and Bitcoin network. PROMOTED. There are ...","Nov 17, 2018,11:20am EST",The digitization of identity,"Proving who we are used to be a pretty straight-forward affair, or as Popeye the Sailor Man used to say: I am what I am and that’s all that I am. The increasing digitization of our lives, however, doesn’t tolerate this naive attitude any longer.In meatspace, as they say, we’re all individuals. What an individual actually is, is so fundamental to the human experience that we describe it as just that: “that which can’t be further divided” - an individual. However, the Internet seems not to share this basic human intuition. In Cyberspace there are no individuals, only user accounts, IP addresses, memory slots, and cryptographic keys. In this sense “proving who you are” on the internet makes as much sense as trying to describe the smell of the color yellow. The only thing that can ever be proven is the validity of strings of characters we use as passwords and keys.Up until a decade ago, this used to be enough. Participation in the digital space was semi-voluntary, with e-mail services and the occasional e-bay account at stake. The absence of the individual from the internet was more of a feature than a bug, which granted us a very welcomed sense of anonymity and freedom. Today, with our financial, public and political lives moving more and more into a digitized mirror world of our own, the absence of the individual is beginning to inflict a pricy toll.Without individual identity, there are neither individual rights nor accountability - which are the pillars of liberal democracy. We already have lost confidence in election results, news articles, reviews, and the humanity of entities we interact with (click here to prove that you’re not a bot, said the bot to the bot). If we won’t find a way to reintroduce the individual into our digital lives, this annoying reality might morph into outright dystopia.So how could the internet be redesigned as a space in which actual humans dwell? For this to be possible we need to find a way to represent our identity in digital form. However, this is easier said than done, after all, anything digital can be copied and forged. We used to have the same problem with money. Genuine digital cash was believed to be impossible for this same reason: value can’t be digitalized since eventually, someone will find a way to copy-paste their fortune indefinitely. This is (or was) the “double-spend problem”, and was successfully solved by Satoshi Nakamoto’s and Bitcoin network.There are a handful of projects out there, utilizing the same logic to solve the identification problem. IBM has an entire department dedicated to this purpose, while Civic has raised $33 Million to provide its own solution. In the meantime, the tight (some might say draconian) Chinese regulatory framework, has pressured some interesting domestic projects to attempt to solve the internet’s identity problem once and for all.Metaverse, for example, is a smart contract enabled blockchain, akin to Ethereum. However, in contrast to its western counterparts, Metaverse allows (and in some sense, demands), the creation of “Digital Avatars” on its blockchain.A Digital Avatar is essentially a user’s (or company’s) true identity, tied to the blockchain addresses they own. This works a bit like the Internet’s DNS system: following identification, a string of complicated characters (the user’s public key) is represented as a human-readable address that resembles a domain or an email address. Something like JohnDoe@Metaverse. The verification process itself is signed by “Oracles”, which are trusted institutions such as banks or the government itself.If you want to create a new token, trade digital assets, receive or send encrypted messages, you need to have an Avatar. This Avatar can then also be used to log-in to your bank account, email service, social media account, and in the future might even allow you to vote from the comfort of your home.How is this better than a password or “log-in with Gmail”? First of all, given the way blockchains work, you’ll never have to present your private key anywhere in order to log in to these services.“Zero-Knowledge” proofs allow users to prove that they own their key, without ever having to broadcast it, which is very different from how password-based logins work. Secondly, the basis for your Avatar isn’t an account or key, but your actual, real-life identity, as perceived by other humans. If your Avatar’s private key gets stolen, for example, you can return to one of the above mentioned “Oracles”, and recreate it on the basis of your real-world identification.This way, the decentralization of the blockchain is used to cryptographically secure your identity (since your credentials are not stored on any third party’s server), while the centralized authority of “Oracles” is piggybacked on to validate its authenticity. This union of two opposites also has the neat benefit of allowing for “authorization without identification”. This means that you can prove that you have the right to access a service without disclosing who you are. This especially comes in handy if we want to see e-governance services such as online-voting being further developed.Such an approach has the potential to reunify our fragmented online lives, and maybe most importantly - it may eventually turn the internet into the safe and accountable space we all desperately need it to be."

Trump's China Nightmare Is Coming True For The U.S. Dollar ...","Nov 8, 2018,10:00am EST",Verified Collection project,"Verified Collection, a tech startup based in Los Angeles, CA is building a connected world where consumers have True Digital Ownership of the physical and digital goods they collect. In my last article, I wrote about why games were poised to change blockchain forever but today, we are looking at a startup focused on unlocking a $200 billion dollar collectibles market using elements of blockchain technology without the barriers found in blockchain companies today.The promise for blockchain and gaming to drive everyday consumers into this nascent market has caused startup entrepreneurs like Dil-Dominé J. Leonares, Founder and CEO of Verified Collection to think about creative workarounds solving the harsh reality of blockchain’s non-user friendly sign-up process. He sat down with me to explain how they plan to drive mass-consumer adoption without having the need to worry about complicated account creation workflows that hinder current blockchains.But how does Verified Collection (VC) drive consumer adoption through blockchain technology?Leonares insisted that Blockchain is here to stay but as with any major operating system, there are updates along the way that help you improve functionality and usability of the platform. Although, blockchain in its current form provides a proven trustless system that can exchange data between two individuals the problem lies in the microtransactions. We saw it with CryptoKitties on the Ethereum blockchain and when you get so many transactions trying to get a consensus approved on this global ledger you start to realize the limitation in blockchain technology.“We can utilize elements of blockchain that are great while improving upon the user experience whether its on-boarding an individual or actually using this technology on a day to day basis. With the current system in place, it’s as if we’re trying to shove a square peg in a round hole when it comes to consumer applications. Instead of starting with technology, we should focus on the idea and find technology that fits it”, Leonares explained.It's no wonder that luminaries such as Nolan K. Bushnell, Creator of Atari and Chuck E. Cheese's have decided to advise on the Verified Collection project""I've always been a passionate advocate of the future, determined to find things that will be powerful and important in years to come. There are many projects taking hold in the decentralized technology space and I've chosen to advise Dil-Dominé and the team whom I believe will have a large impact on the future”, Bushnell told me.Using Quantum DHT technology, similar to what BitTorrent uses, VC claim that they can create a global consensus but sign off on the transactions locally creating a decentralized peer-to-peer network while building out light and robust distributed applications. This removes the whole energy pollution caused by mining and it solves the concern over transactions per seconds while keeping the positive traits about blockchain.Another aspect that was touched upon was the fact that there are currently no SEC or CFTC regulations for running a KYC/AML test.“Verified Collection is a social marketplace and platform that operates by selling digital collectible goods. Just like how Epic Games uses V-Bucks to allow consumers to buy in-game skins and avatars, we allow consumers to acquire our in-platform Vyce token to purchase our digital collectibles. Vyce will never be placed on an exchange, therefore, there will never be any speculation or volatility of the in-platform token used to purchase these digital collectibles”.Leonares further added that people will still be required to sign-up for accounts on their platform just like you would need to create an Epic Games account before you could play Fortnite.“Who knows in the future when regulations become more concrete we might consider it but until then we will operate just like any digital platform does with in-game currency. We are also exploring partnerships with stable coins pegged to the US dollar as well”, he said.Dil-Domine’ explained that curating collections is an innate human behavior and he is in the know on this, having been a collector for a major part of his life, from matchbox cars, action figures, POGs, quarters, stamps then moving into vinyl toys like KidRobot, Disney’s Vinylmation and most recently Funko Pops.“Aside from that, I am also an avid gamer as well and what inspired me was watching Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One since how you can go from one world to the next. I think we all would picture how the avatars we buy in maybe Fortnite could be utilized to trade for another skin in a game like Destiny. We might not be there today but in the future, that is definitely a possibility”.Leonares spent tonnes of money on buying into what he describes as a centralized ecosystem where there is no true digital ownership over the physical and digital goods that he collected. He insists that this is where Verified Collection comes in when you buy the first edition of a comic book and you don’t want to open it to read it. VC lets you unlock a digital copy of the comic book to read and take with you where you want to go. Who knows, maybe in the process it unlocks a skin or avatar in your favorite video game because you have the digital collectible in your collection? Imagine celebrities or known-figures creating digital collectibles and possibly being able to unlock their favorite playlist or cartoon character in video games.“One of my collections was buying every single special edition XBOX 360 that was released and one time while traveling around the world, I had moved to the People’s Republic of China for a year. When I brought back all my XBOX 360s to the United States the guys at customs were perplexed with how many I had…” Dil-Dominé J Leonares, Founder and CEO of Verified Collection statedBut what exactly does Leonares mean by True Digital Ownership?Digital collectibles also are known as non-fungible tokens (NFT) in the blockchain community are unique and all have a smart contract assigned to them which can house data.“This is what excites me about our offering at Verified Collection is that even though our focus initially is solely on digital collectibles, we can now provide our 3-step TAG™ (Trusted And Guaranteed) quantum fingerprint to authenticate both physical and digital assets on what we call the Nexus”, Leonares explained.Leonares provided the example of DeBeer’s utilizing their TAG™ to track diamonds from the mine to consumer purchase and then after that as a title-tracking system showing it moves from one person to another. This can be beneficial to the nonprofit world which can use their digital collectibles platform to drive engagement with the ever-elusive millennial market and provide new ways to drive giving while rewarding the consumer for their participation; ie Tom Shoes.The elusive VYCE token logoAnother example is how brands can extend their IP into this space while building out a deeper relationship utilizing digital collectibles as a way for them to engage with the consumer where for the first time a brand could tell when the first engagement took place and when the consumer decided to transaction afterward with the digital collectible to unlock bonus content or interactive experiences.So imagine a beverage brand like Coca-Cola releasing limited-edition digital collectibles that are seasonal and with each collectible you unlock by watching an advertisement; your name is amended to that smart contract. So if you were to walk into a convenience store you could possibly trade that collectibles or multiples of that collectibles for a digital coupon for a 2-liter bottle of Coke or if you goto a Coke-sponsored event you can trade your collectibles for a “Share your bottle with... (insert your name)” because of your name attached to the title of that digital collectible.That’s the beauty of digital collectibles and it shows how it can be unlocked in a different way more than just having an augmented reality object you view in your phone but also be used as a certificate of authenticity that helps keep physical assets values high.At the end of the day, what do you want people to take away from this about Verified Collection?“I believe at the end of the day, blockchain has driven and inspired individuals like me to think outside of the box showing the possibilities to tokenize the world”.The idea of creating a decentralized ecosystem some that are autonomous like Aragon and some like Verified Collection that helps provide this authentication and ability to truly decide what you want to do with the physical/digital goods you collect.“That’s the beauty of the blockchain is it showed us what a trustless ecosystem could look like and now we just have to make that ecosystem more user-friendly”.Leonares said that their goal is to build a world where the consumer has True Digital Ownership of the physical and digital goods they collect; “we want to bridge the gap between the physical world and the digital one making it as seamless and secure as possible. If we can start by showing value in such a focused market as collectibles then we can bring those learnings into other industries as well like high-end consumer goods”, he concluded."

Photo Credit: Getty","The only stocks going up this year are U.S. stocks—on the back of Trump’s corporate tax cuts, which have increased earnings at domestic companies. But the effect of this tax break is already well baked into stock prices and U.S. stocks are now dangerously overvalued, trading at 18 times forward earnings and 25 times trailing earnings. Meanwhile international stocks have lagged far behind. Nearly all major stock indices outside the U.S. (except Japan) are down or under-performing domestic stocks year-to-date.This time the disparity is wide and vast. The only certainty is that any trend will reverse eventually. Whether in a week, six months, or a year, at some point the fashionable sector (i.e. U.S. stocks) becomes deeply unfashionable and the out-of-favor sector (i.e. emerging markets) once again finds itself intensely appreciated. As surely as wide neckties and narrow ones trade places in the fashion hierarchy, so do major asset classes.But you don't have to depend on simple reversion to the mean. The reality is that international stocks, whether they be emerging markets such as China, Eastern Europe or Latin America (or a developed overseas market such as Japan’s) are compellingly undervalued, while U.S. stocks are precariously overvalued. In fact, international stocks are undervalued to roughly the same extent that U.S. stocks are overvalued. The question often arises: why not buy more U.S. stocks if the U.S. is going up? The reason is that what is overvalued has a lower expected future return, while what is undervalued has a higher one.Consider the two major measures of valuation that show this great disparity: dividend yield and price-to-earnings ratio (p/e ratio). As stated above, U.S. stocks are trading at 18 times forward earnings. This means an investor in domestic stocks is paying 18 times for every dollar in earnings. A p/e ratio is an assessment of the value of stocks the same way a price-to-square-foot ratio is an assessment of the value in real estate. The long-term average p/e ratio is approximately 15 for U.S. stocks; based on this measure, they’re roughly 20% overvalued. Meanwhile, emerging market stocks are trading at roughly 11 times forward earnings, while their historical average is typically higher than even that of U.S. stocks, around 16 times (emerging market stocks typically trade at a higher multiple because they have a higher growth rate). This implies that emerging markets stocks are perhaps 30% undervalued. This means that to buy U.S. stocks now and eschew emerging markets stocks is like overpaying for an apartment whose fair value is $1,500/square foot by ponying up $1,800/ft while ignoring that better one that usually goes for $1,600/ft which is now selling at the fire sale price of $1,100/ft. It’s not rational, but that’s what people do when they see a trend: they continue to follow it. They buy what goes up because it already went up instead of seeing where the current value resides. For a while this works. But as every bust from the dotcoms to Bitcoin has shown, it only works until it stops working.If you’re not convinced by the p/e ratio difference, then you only have to look at dividend yields to see the dizzying disparity there. U.S. stocks are paying an estimated forward dividend yield of 1.84%. Meanwhile, emerging markets are paying 3.35%, fully 82% higher. Due to their faster growth rates, emerging markets should have a lower dividend yield—but they currently have one nearly double that of domestic stocks. Not since the dotcoms traded at a ridiculous 90 times earnings in 1999 and forsaken industrial stocks traded at a third of that have I seen such a gap. And we all know how that story ended.Many will say there are good reasons to avoid the emerging markets: tariffs, trade wars and rising interest rates. But that ignores that U.S. stocks will eventually reflect all the same factors. More importantly, it ignores the fact that emerging market stock valuations already assume the worst. As they say in investing: it’s already priced in.This is not to say that if the Dow is down, emerging markets ones will go up on any given day. Short-term declines can swamp all boats temporarily, and the knee-jerk reaction of traders on bad news days is to sell all stocks. But it does mean that the emerging markets should eventually have a much higher expected return."
